	<p>This prospective crossover study aimed to investigate the effect of binaural beat therapy music on soccer player performance. Between July 2023 and December 2023, 45 athletes (31 females/14 males, mean age = 20.47 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.99) wore Bluetooth earphones through which one of the following was given during initial 20 min warm-up exercises before undergoing repeated sprint ability tests: no music/fast-tempo music/fast-tempo music with background binaural beat therapy music. Heart rate change after warm-up exercises/repeated sprint ability (RSA) tests and the time to finish RSA tests were recorded. Despite no significant difference in heart rate increase after warm-up between the two genders regardless of intervention, larger increases after RSA tests were found in males following any of the three interventions (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) with the most notable difference observed after fast-tempo music (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). A significant effect size (r = 0.2) correlated with fast-tempo music during warm-up in either gender. Binaural beat therapy music during warm-up reached a significant effect size only when all participants were considered, suggesting limited benefits.</p>

">Transcranial focused ultrasound activates feedforward and feedback cortico-thalamo-cortical pathways by selectively activating excitatory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS) has been proven capable of altering focal neuronal activities and neural circuits non-invasively in both animals and humans. The abilities of tFUS for cell-type selection within the targeted area like somatosensory cortex have been shown to be parameter related. However, how neuronal subpopulations across neural pathways are affected, for example how tFUS affected neuronal connections between brain areas remains unclear. In this study, multi-site intracranial recordings were used to quantify the neuronal responses to tFUS stimulation at somatosensory cortex (S1), motor cortex (M1) and posterior medial thalamic nucleus (POm) of cortico-thalamo-cortical (CTC) pathway. We found that when targeting at S1 or POm, only regular spiking units (RSUs, putative excitatory neurons) responded to specific tFUS parameters (duty cycle: 6%-60% and pulse repetition frequency: 1500 and 3000 Hz ) during sonication. RSUs from the directly connected area (POm or S1) showed a synchronized response, which changed the directional correlation between RSUs from POm and S1. The tFUS induced excitation of RSUs activated the feedforward and feedback loops between cortex and thalamus, eliciting delayed neuronal responses of RSUs and delayed activities of fast spiking units (FSUs) by affecting local network. Our findings indicated that tFUS can modulate the CTC pathway through both feedforward and feedback loops, which could influence larger cortical areas including motor cortex.

">Dopamine transmission at D1 and D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens contributes to the expression of incubation of cocaine craving</a></h4>

              
                Relapse represents a consistent clinical problem for individuals with substance use disorder. In the incubation of craving model of persistent craving and relapse, cue-induced drug seeking progressively intensifies or "incubates" during the first weeks of abstinence from drug self-administration and then remains high for months. Previously, we and others have demonstrated that expression of incubated cocaine craving requires strengthening of excitatory synaptic transmission in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcc). However, despite the importance of dopaminergic signaling in the NAcc for motivated behavior, little is known about the role that dopamine (DA) plays in the incubation of cocaine craving. Here we used fiber photometry to measure DA transients in the NAcc of male and female rats during cue-induced seeking tests conducted in early abstinence from cocaine self-administration, prior to incubation, and late abstinence, after incubation of craving has plateaued. We observed DA transients time-locked to cue-induced responding but their magnitude did not differ significantly when measured during early versus late abstinence seeking tests. Next, we tested for a functional role of these DA transients by injecting DA receptor antagonists into the NAcc just before the cue-induced seeking test. Blockade of either D1 or D2 DA receptors reduced cue-induced cocaine seeking after but not before incubation. We found no main effect of sex in our experiments. These results suggest that DA contributes to incubated cocaine seeking but the emergence of this role reflects changes in postsynaptic responsiveness to DA rather than presynaptic alterations.

">Laminar CBV and BOLD response-characteristics over time and space in the human primary somatosensory cortex at 7T</a></h4>

              
                Uncovering the cortical representation of the body has been at the core of human brain mapping for decades, with special attention given to the digits. In the last decade, advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technologies have opened the possibility of non-invasively unraveling the 3rd dimension of digit representations in humans along cortical layers. In laminar fMRI it is common to combine the use of the highly sensitive blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) contrast with cerebral blood volume sensitive measurements, like vascular space occupancy (VASO), that are more specific to the underlying neuronal populations. However, the spatial and temporal VASO response characteristics across cortical depth to passive stimulation of the digits are still unknown. Therefore, we characterized haemodynamic responses to vibrotactile stimulation of individual digit-tips across cortical depth at 0.75 mm in-plane spatial resolution using BOLD and VASO fMRI at 7T. We could identify digit-specific regions of interest (ROIs) in putative Brodmann area 3b, following the known anatomical organization. In the ROIs, the BOLD response increased towards the cortical surface due to the draining vein effect, while the VASO response was more shifted towards middle cortical layers, likely reflecting bottom-up input from the thalamus, as expected. Interestingly, we also found slightly negative BOLD and VASO responses for non-preferred digits in the ROIs, potentially indicating neuronal surround inhibition. Finally, we explored the temporal signal dynamics for BOLD and VASO as a function of distance from activation peaks resulting from stimulation of contralateral digits. With this analysis, we showed a triphasic response consisting of an initial peak and a subsequent negative deflection during stimulation, followed by a positive post-stimulus response in BOLD and to some extent in VASO. While similar responses were reported with invasive methods in animal models, here we demonstrate a potential neuronal excitation-inhibition mechanism in a center-surround architecture across layers in the human somatosensory cortex. Given that, unlike in animals, human experiments do not rely on anesthesia and can readily implement extensive behavioral testing, obtaining this effect in humans is an important step towards further uncovering the functional significance of the different aspects of the triphasic response.

">Large-Scale Motor Dynamics Associated with Reaching are Altered in Essential Tremor</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Essential Tremor (ET) is a common neurological disorder identified by involuntary rhythmic movements stemming from pathological synchronization within a network that overlaps significantly with the normal motor circuit. The efficacy of therapeutic brain stimulation for ET is impeded by a limited understanding of how tremor-related synchronization affects brain circuits and disrupts normal sensorimotor processing. This paper details the changes in brain-wide synchronization associated with ET and connects these to the oscillatory dynamics during voluntary movements. Methods: We used high-density electroencephalography (EEG, 11 controls, 12 patients), and for the first time in ET patients, optically pumped magnetoencephalography (OPM, 5 controls, 4 patients) to record brain activity during upper limb reaching. We localized and analysed brain sources that synchronize with pathological tremors, studying motor oscillations in these regions. Using a novel dimensionality reduction approach, we identified a set of simple, latent circuits with specific frequency characteristics and analysed their relationship to kinematics and tremor. Results: Despite slight reductions in velocity, ET patients demonstrated reaching movements with kinematics comparable to controls. Notably, key motor areas - including the supplementary motor area, lateral prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and motor cerebellum - were synchronized to tremor frequencies. Motor oscillations were significantly changed in patients with ET relative to controls, including a 15% increase in movement responsive desynchronization in the low beta (14-21 Hz) band which inversely correlated with tremor severity. Oscillations in the beta and theta bands were key predictors of patients' overall tremor levels. Latent state analysis in EEG and OPM data located these changes to fronto-parietal and premotor/prefrontal circuits. High tremor trials were associated with diminished post-movement beta rebound in frontoparietal and premotor circuits and an increase in sensorimotor gamma activity (30-60 Hz). Latent dynamics were predictive of changes in patients' movement velocity and hold stability, suggesting that increased movement related beta desynchronization may reflect a compensatory mechanism in the brain. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that ET leads to significant changes in the oscillatory dynamics within individual motor regions and broader networks. Specifically, we suggest that increased desynchronization of networks in ET enables successful execution of movement, by freeing neural resources otherwise entrained by pathological synchronization at tremor frequencies. Our findings, reproducible across both EEG and OPM recordings, underline how motor-related brain signals can predict subject level tremor severity and offer a new set of candidate biomarkers crucial for developing advanced closed-loop stimulation therapies for ET.

">Fast and reliable quantitative measures of white matter development with magnetic resonance fingerprinting</a></h4>

              
                Developmental cognitive neuroscience aims to shed light on evolving relationships between brain structure and cognitive development. To this end, quantitative methods that reliably measure individual differences in brain tissue properties are fundamental. Standard qualitative MRI sequences are influenced by scan parameters and hardware-related biases, and also lack physical units, making the analysis of individual differences problematic. In contrast, quantitative MRI can measure physical properties of the tissue but with the cost of long scan durations and sensitivity to motion. This poses a critical limitation for studying young children. Here, we examine the reliability and validity of an efficient quantitative multiparameter mapping method - Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) - in children scanned longitudinally. We focus on T1 values in white matter, since quantitative T1 values are known to primarily reflect myelin content, a key factor in brain development. Forty-nine children (age range 8-13y) completed two scanning sessions 2-4 months apart. In each session, two 2-minute 3D-MRF scans at 1mm isotropic resolution were collected to evaluate the effect of scan duration on image quality and scan-rescan reliability. A separate calibration scan was used to measure B0 inhomogeneity and correct for bias. We examined the impact of scan time and B0 inhomogeneity correction on scan-rescan reliability of values in white matter, by comparing single 2-min and combined two 2-min scans, with and without B0-correction. Whole-brain voxel-based reliability analysis showed that combining two 2-min MRF scans improved reliability (Pearson's r=0.87) compared with a single 2-min scan (r=0.84), while B0-correction had no effect on reliability in white matter (r=0.86 and 0.83 4-min vs 2-min). Using diffusion tractography, we delineated MRF-derived T1 profiles along major white matter fiber tracts and found similar or higher reliability for T1 from MRF compared to diffusion parameters (based on a 10-minute dMRI scan). Lastly, we found that T1 values in multiple white matter tracts were significantly correlated with age. In sum, MRF-derived T1 values were highly reliable in a longitudinal sample of children and replicated known age effects. Reliability in white matter was improved by longer scan duration but was not affected by B0-correction, making it a quick and straightforward scan to collect. We propose that MRF provides a promising avenue for acquiring quantitative brain metrics in children and patient populations where scan time and motion are of particular concern.

">A widespread electrical brain network encodes anxiety in health and depressive states</a></h4>

              
                In rodents, anxiety is charactered by heightened vigilance during low-threat and uncertain situations. Though activity in the frontal cortex and limbic system are fundamental to supporting this internal state, the underlying network architecture that integrates activity across brain regions to encode anxiety across animals and paradigms remains unclear. Here, we utilize parallel electrical recordings in freely behaving mice, translational paradigms known to induce anxiety, and machine learning to discover a multi-region network that encodes the anxious brain-state. The network is composed of circuits widely implicated in anxiety behavior, it generalizes across many behavioral contexts that induce anxiety, and it fails to encode multiple behavioral contexts that do not. Strikingly, the activity of this network is also principally altered in two mouse models of depression. Thus, we establish a network-level process whereby the brain encodes anxiety in health and disease.

">Dopamine-induced Relaxation of Connectivity Diversifies Burst Patterns in Cultured Hippocampal Networks</a></h4>

              
                The intricate interplay of neurotransmitters orchestrates a symphony of neural activity in the hippocampus, with dopamine emerging as a key conductor in this complex ensemble. Despite numerous studies uncovering the cellular mechanisms of dopamine, its influence on hippocampal neural networks remains elusive. Combining in vitro electrophysiological recordings of rat embryonic hippocampal neurons, pharmacological interventions, and computational analyses of spike trains, we found that dopamine induces a relaxation in network connectivity, characterised by a reduction in spike coherence. This relaxation expands the repertoire of burst dynamics within these hippocampal networks, a phenomenon notably absent under the administration of dopamine antagonists. Our study provides a thorough understanding of the roles of dopamine signalling in shaping functional networks of hippocampal neurons.

">A level adjusted cochlear frequency-to-place map for estimating tonotopic frequency mismatch with a cochlear implant</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: To provide a level-adjusted correction to the current standard relating anatomical cochlear place to characteristic frequency in humans, and to re-evaluate anatomical frequency mismatch in cochlear implant (CI) recipients considering this correction. It is hypothesized that a level-adjusted place-frequency function may represent a more accurate tonotopic benchmark for CIs in comparison to the current standard. Design: The present analytical study compiled data from fifteen previous animal studies that reported iso-intensity responses from cochlear structures at different stimulation levels. Extracted outcome measures were characteristic frequencies and centroid-based best frequencies at 70 dB SPL input from 47 specimens spanning a broad range of cochlear locations. A simple relationship was used to transform these measures to human estimates of characteristic and best frequencies, and non-linear regression was applied to these estimates to determine how the standard human place-frequency function should be adjusted to reflect best frequency rather than characteristic frequency. The proposed level-adjusted correction was then compared to average place-frequency positions of commonly used CI devices when programmed with clinical settings. Results: The present study showed that the best frequency at 70 dB SPL (BF70) tends to shift away from characteristic frequency (CF). The amount of shift was statistically significant (signed-rank test z = 5.143, p < 0.001), but the amount and direction of shift depended on cochlear location. At cochlear locations up to 600 degrees from the base, BF70 shifted downwards in frequency relative to CF by about 4 semitones on average. Beyond 600 degrees from the base, BF70 shifted upwards in frequency relative to CF by about 6 semitones on average. In terms of spread (90% prediction interval), the amount of shift between CF and BF70 varied from relatively no shift to nearly an octave of shift. With the new level-adjusted frequency-place function, the amount of anatomical frequency mismatch for devices programmed with standard of care settings is less extreme than originally thought, and may be nonexistent for all but the most apical electrodes. Conclusions: The present study validates the current standard for relating cochlear place to characteristic frequency, and introduces a level-adjusted correction for how best frequency shifts away from characteristic frequency at moderately loud stimulation levels. This correction may represent a more accurate tonotopic reference for CIs. To the extent that it does, its implementation may potentially enhance perceptual accommodation and speech understanding in CI users, thereby improving CI outcomes and contributing to advancements in the programming and clinical management of CIs.

">1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-Treated Adult Zebrafish as a Model for Parkinsons Disease</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine (DA) is a neuroprotective catecholamine and neurotransmitter that works to regulate cognitive functions (Channer et al., 2023). Patients affected by Parkinsons Disease (PD) experience a loss of dopaminergic neurons, lower levels of DA, and downregulated neural DA production. This leads to cognitive and physical decline that is the hallmark of PD. Currently, no cure exists for this prevalent neurodegenerative disease. Danio rerio, or zebrafish, have become an increasingly popular disease model used in PD pharmaceutical development. This model still requires extensive development to better characterize which PD features are adequately represented. Furthermore, the great majority of PD zebrafish models have been performed by treating embryos, which may not be relevant towards age-related human PD development. As an improvement, mature D. rerio (18 months) were treated with the neurotoxic prodrug 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) through intraperitoneal injection to induce Parkinsonianism. Behavioral analysis confirmed the disparity in movement between saline-injected control and the MPTP experimental group, in which swim distance and speed were significantly lowered seven days after MPTP injection. Simultaneously, cognitive decline was apparent in MPTP zebrafish compared to control, demonstrated by decreased alternation in a y-maze. RT-qPCR confirmed trends consistent with downregulation in Parkinsonian genetic markers, specifically DA transporter (DAT), MAO-B, PINK1. In summary, mature zebrafish injected with MPTP present with similar movement and cognitive decline as compared to human disease. Despite its benefits, this model does not appear to recapitulate full pathophysiology of the disease with the full profile of expected gene downregulation. Because of this, it is important that researchers looking for pharmacological interventions for PD only use this zebrafish model when targeting the human-relevant PD symptoms and causes that are represented.

">Activity-dependent synthesis of Emerin gates neuronal plasticity by regulating proteostasis</a></h4>

              
                Neurons dynamically regulate their proteome in response to sensory input, a key process underlying experience-dependent plasticity. We characterized the visual experience-dependent nascent proteome within a brief, defined time window after stimulation using an optimized metabolic labeling approach. Visual experience induced cell type-specific and age-dependent alterations in the nascent proteome, including proteostasis-related processes. We identified Emerin as the top activity-induced candidate plasticity protein and demonstrated that its rapid activity-induced synthesis is transcription-independent. In contrast to its nuclear localization and function in myocytes, activity-induced neuronal Emerin is abundant in the endoplasmic reticulum and broadly inhibits protein synthesis, including translation regulators and synaptic proteins. Downregulating Emerin shifted the dendritic spine population from predominantly mushroom morphology to filopodia and decreased network connectivity. In mice, decreased Emerin reduced visual response magnitude and impaired visual information processing. Our findings support an experience-dependent feed-forward role for Emerin in temporally gating neuronal plasticity by negatively regulating translation.

">EEG Electrodes and Where to Find Them: Automated Localization From 3D Scans</a></h4>

              
                Objective: The accurate localization of electroencephalography (EEG) electrode positions is crucial for accurate source localization. Recent advancements have proposed alternatives to labor-intensive, manual methods for spatial localization of the electrodes, employing technologies such as 3D scanning and laser scanning. These novel approaches often integrate Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) as part of the pipeline in localizing the electrodes. The limited global availability of MRI data restricts its use as a standard modality in several clinical scenarios. This limitation restricts the use of these advanced methods. Approach: In this paper, we present a novel, versatile approach that utilizes 3D scans to localize EEG electrode positions with high accuracy. Importantly, while our method can be integrated with MRI data if available, it is specifically designed to be highly effective even in the absence of MRI, thus expanding the potential for advanced EEG analysis in various resource-limited settings. Our solution implements a two-tiered approach involving landmark/fiducials localization and electrode localization, creating an end-to-end framework. Main results: The efficacy and robustness of our approach have been validated on an extensive dataset containing over 400 3D scans from 278 subjects. The framework identifies pre-auricular points and achieves correct electrode positioning accuracy in the range of 85.7% to 91.0%. Additionally, our framework includes a validation tool that permits manual adjustments and visual validation if required. Significance: This study represents, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first validation of such a method on a substantial dataset, thus ensuring the robustness and generalizability of our innovative approach. Our findings focus on developing a solution that facilitates source localization, contributing to the critical discussion on balancing cost effectiveness with methodological accuracy to promote wider adoption in both research and clinical settings.

">Coding odor modality in piriform cortex efficiently with low-dimensional subspaces: a Shared Covariance Decoding approach</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental question in neuroscience is how sensory signals are decoded from noisy cortical activity. We address this question in the olfactory system, decoding the route by which odorants arrive into the nasal cavity: through the nostrils during inhalation or sniffing (orthonasal), or through the back of the throat during exhalation (retronasal). We recently showed with modeling and novel experiments on anesthetized rats that orthonasal versus retronasal modality information is encoded in the olfactory bulb (OB, a pre-cortical region). However, key questions remain: is modality information transmitted from OB to anterior piriform cortex (aPC)? How can this information be extracted from a much noisier cortical population with overall less firing? With simultaneous spike recordings of populations of neurons in OB and aPC, we show that an unsupervised and biologically plausible algorithm we call Shared Covariance Decoding (SCD) can indeed linearly encode modality in low dimensional subspaces. Specifically, our SCD algorithm improves encoding of ortho/retro in aPC compared to Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Consistent with our theoretical analysis, when noise correlations between OB and aPC are low and OB well-encodes modality, modality in aPC tends to be encoded optimally with SCD. We observe that with several algorithms (LDA, SCD, optimal) that the decoding accuracy distributions are invariant when GABA_A (ant-)agonists (bicuculline and muscimol) are applied to OB. Overall, we show modality information can be encoded efficiently in piriform cortex.

">The distribution and evolutionary dynamics of dopaminergic neurons in molluscs</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine is one of the most versatile neurotransmitters in invertebrates. Its distribution and plethora of functions are likely coupled to feeding ecology, especially in Euthyneura (the largest clade of mollusks), which presents the broadest spectrum of environmental adaptations. Still, the analyses of dopamine-mediated signaling were dominated by studies of grazers. Here, we characterize the distribution of dopaminergic neurons in representatives of two distinct ecological groups: the sea angel - obligate predatory pelagic mollusk Clione limacina (Pteropoda, Gymnosomata) and its prey - the sea devil Limacina helicina (Pteropoda, Thecosomata) as well as the plankton eater Melibe leonina (Nudipleura, Nudibranchia). By using tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactivity (TH-ir) as a reporter, we showed that the dopaminergic system is moderately conservative among euthyneurans. Across all studied species, small numbers of dopaminergic neurons in the central ganglia contrast to significant diversification of TH-ir neurons in the peripheral nervous system, primarily representing sensory-like cells, which predominantly concentrated in the chemotactic areas and projecting afferent axons to the central nervous system. Combined with -tubulin immunoreactivity, this study illuminates the unprecedented complexity of peripheral neural systems in gastropod mollusks, with lineage-specific diversification of sensory and modulatory functions.

">Electrical and G-protein Regulation of CaV2.2 (N-type) Channels</a></h4>

              
                How G-proteins inhibit N-type, voltage-gated, calcium-selective channels (CaV2.2) during presynaptic inhibition is a decades-old question. G-proteins G{beta}{gamma} bind to intracellular CaV2.2 regions, but the inhibition is voltage-dependent. Using the hybrid electrophysiological and optical approach voltage-clamp fluorometry, we show that G{beta}{gamma} acts by selectively inhibiting a subset of the four different CaV2.2 voltage-sensor domains (VSDs I-IV). During regular "willing" gating, VSDs I and IV activation resemble pore opening, VSD III activation is hyperpolarized, and VSD II appears unresponsive to depolarization. In the presence of G{beta}{gamma}, CaV2.2 gating is "reluctant": pore opening and VSD-I activation are strongly and proportionally inhibited, VSD IV is modestly inhibited while VSD III is not. We propose that G{beta}{gamma} inhibition of VSD-I and -IV underlies reluctant CaV2.2 gating and subsequent presynaptic inhibition.

                Cortical neuronal activity exhibits variability over time and across repeated stimulation trials, yet consistently represents stimulus features. However, the dynamical mechanism underlying this reliable representation and computation remains elusive. This study uncovers a mechanism that achieves reliable neural processing, leveraging a biologically plausible network model with spatial extension and neuronal timescale diversity. Our findings demonstrate that timescale diversity disrupts intrinsic coherent spatiotemporal patterns, enhancing local sensitivity and aligning neural network activity closely with inputs. This underscores the significant role of timescale diversity in shaping consistent stimulus representation, leading to local sensitivity and globally input-slaved transient dynamics, essential for reliable neural processing. This mechanism offers a potentially general framework for understanding the role of neural heterogeneity in reliable computation. Our work informs the design of new reservoir computing models endowed with liquid wave reservoirs for neuromorphic computing.

">Cell-specific inhibitory modulation of sound processing in the auditory thalamus.</a></h4>

              
                Inhibition along the auditory pathway is crucial for processing of acoustic information. Within the auditory thalamus, a key region in the central auditory pathway, inhibition is provided by the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), comprised of two large classes of inhibitory neurons, parvalbumin (PVTRN) and somatostatin (SSTTRN) positive. In the auditory cortex, PV and SST neurons differentially shape auditory processing. We found that the ventral MGB, the thalamic region in the direct ascending auditory pathway, receives inputs predominantly from PVTRN neurons, whereas SSTTRN neurons project to the dorso-medial regions of MGB. Consistently, inactivating PVTRN neurons increased sound-evoked activity in over a third of neurons in the vMGB, with another large fraction of neurons being suppressed. By contrast, inactivating SSTTRN neuronal activity largely reduced tone-evoked activity in vMGB neurons. Cell type-specific computational models revealed candidate circuit mechanisms for generating the bi-directional effects of TRN inactivation on MGB sound responses. These differential inhibitory pathways within the auditory thalamus suggest a cell-specific role for thalamic inhibition in auditory computation and behavior.

                The bidirectional long-distance transport of organelles is crucial for cell body-synapse communication. However, the mechanisms by which this transport is modulated for synapse formation, maintenance, and plasticity are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate through quantitative analyses that maintaining sensory neuron-motor neuron synapses in the Aplysia gill-siphon withdrawal reflex is linked to a sustained reduction in the retrograde transport of lysosomal vesicles in sensory neurons. Interestingly, while mitochondrial transport in the anterograde direction increases within 12 hours of synapse formation, the reduction in lysosomal vesicle retrograde transport appears three days after synapse formation. Moreover, we find that formation of new synapses during learning induced by neuromodulatory neurotransmitter serotonin further reduces lysosomal vesicle transport within 24 hours, whereas mitochondrial transport increases in the anterograde direction within one hour of exposure. Pharmacological inhibition of several signaling pathways pinpoints PKA as a key regulator of retrograde transport of lysosomal vesicles during synapse maintenance. These results demonstrate that synapse formation leads to organelle-specific and direction specific enduring changes in long-distance transport, offering insights into the mechanisms underlying synapse maintenance and plasticity.

	<p>We conducted a multicenter, prospective study (EMBRACE) evaluating the real-life effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of eptinezumab (100 mg/300 mg)&amp;amp;mdash;a monoclonal antibody targeting the calcitonin-gene-related peptide (anti-CGRP mAb)&amp;amp;mdash;in high-frequency episodic migraine (HFEM) or chronic migraine (CM). The primary endpoint was the change in monthly migraine days (MMD) for HFEM or monthly headache days (MHD) for CM at weeks 9&amp;amp;ndash;12 compared to baseline. The secondary endpoints included changes in monthly analgesic intake (MAI), Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS), Migraine Interictal Burden Scale (MIBS-4), and responder rates. The safety analysis involved 44 subjects; the effectiveness analysis included 26 individuals. Eptinezumab was well-tolerated. In CM patients, eptinezumab significantly reduced MHD (&amp;amp;minus;16.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.9, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), MAI, NRS, HIT-6, MIDAS, and MIBS-4. In HFEM patients, it significantly reduced NRS, HIT-6, MIDAS, and MIBS-4, though reductions in MMD (&amp;amp;minus;3.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.5) and MAI were not statistically significant. Overall, &amp;amp;ge;50% and &amp;amp;ge;75% response rates were 61.5% and 30.8%, respectively (60% and 30% in non-responders to subcutaneous anti-CGRP mAbs). The clinical change was rated as much or very much improved by 61.0% of the patients. Eptinezumab demonstrated high effectiveness, safety, and tolerability in real-life among hard-to-treat migraine patients with multiple treatment failures, including anti-CGRP mAbs.</p>

	<p>The exploration of functional resting-state brain developmental parameters and measures can help to improve scientific, psychological, and medical applications. The present work focussed on both traditional approaches, such as topographical power analyses at the signal space level, and advanced approaches, such as the exploration of age-related dynamics of source space data. The results confirmed the expectation that the third life decade would show a kind of stability in oscillatory signal and source-space-related parameters. However, from a source dynamics perspective, different frequency ranges appear to develop quite differently, as reflected in age-related sequential network communication profiles. Among other discoveries, the left anterior cingulate source location could be shown to reduce bi-directional network communication in the lower alpha band, whereas it differentiated its uni- and bidirectional communication dynamics to sub-cortical and posterior brain locations. Higher alpha oscillations enhanced communication dynamics between the thalamus and particularly frontal areas. In conclusion, resting-state data appear to be, at least in part, functionally reorganized in the default mode network, while quantitative measures, such as topographical power and regional source activity, did not correlate with age in the third life decade. In line with other authors, we suggest the further development of a multi-perspective approach in biosignal analyses.</p>

<p>Lognormal-like skewed spine size distribution is maintained in tumor necrosis factor deficiency and receptor loss. Dendritic spines sizes are distributed lognormally with a high percentage of the population consisting of small spines and a small percentage of the population consisting of large spines. The logarithm of the data shows a normal distribution. In mice exhibiting TNF deficiency, the lognormal distribution is maintained, albeit with a differences in its width, with the TNF deficient mice having more small and large sized spines and less medium sized spines. This finding was also observed in mice lacking TNF-receptor 1 and partially in mice lacking TNF-receptor 2. In mice lacking both TNF-receptor 1 and receptor 2 the lognormal distribution of spine head sizes was maintained, however, the distribution was shifted to the left, indicating a globalised reduction in spine head sizes of all spines. Spines maintain a lognormal distribution in multiple different conditions including homo- and heterosynaptic plasticity, blockage of presynaptic transmitter release and genetic disruption of TNF or its receptors, strenghtening the concept of redistribution of spine head sizes as a crucial functional adaptation within the neuron.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Dendritic spines are sites of synaptic plasticity and their head size correlates with the strength of the corresponding synapse. We recently showed that the distribution of spine head sizes follows a lognormal-like distribution even after blockage of activity or plasticity induction. As the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) influences synaptic transmission and constitutive TNF and receptor (TNF-R)-deficiencies cause changes in spine head size distributions, we tested whether these genetic alterations disrupt the lognormality of spine head sizes. Furthermore, we distinguished between spines containing the actin-modulating protein synaptopodin (SP-positive), which is present in large, strong and stable spines and those lacking it (SP-negative). Our analysis revealed that neither TNF-deficiency nor the absence of TNF-R1, TNF-R2 or TNF-R 1 and 2 (TNF-R1/R2) degrades the general lognormal-like, skewed distribution of spine head sizes (all spines, SP-positive spines, SP-negative spines). However, TNF, TNF-R1 and TNF-R2-deficiency affected the width of the lognormal distribution, and TNF-R1/2-deficiency shifted the distribution to the left. Our findings demonstrate the robustness of the lognormal-like, skewed distribution, which is maintained even in the face of genetic manipulations that alter the distribution of spine head sizes. Our observations are in line with homeostatic adaptation mechanisms of neurons regulating the distribution of spines and their head sizes.</p>

                The brain’s choroid plexus (CP), which operates as an anatomical and functional ‘checkpoint’, regulates the communication between brain and periphery and contributes to the maintenance of healthy brain homeostasis throughout life. Evidence from mouse models and humans reveals a link between loss of CP checkpoint properties and dysregulation of the CP immune milieu as a conserved feature across diverse neurological conditions. In particular, we suggest that an imbalance between different immune signals at the CP, including CD4+ T cell-derived cytokines, type-I interferon, and complement components, can perpetuate brain inflammation and cognitive deterioration in aging and neurodegeneration. Furthermore, we highlight the role of CP metabolism in controlling CP inflammation, and propose that targeting molecules that regulate CP metabolism could be effective in safeguarding brain function.

">Human-specific paralogs of SRGAP2 induce neotenic features of microglia structural and functional maturation</a></h4>

              
                Microglia play key roles in shaping synaptic connectivity during neural circuits development. Whether microglia display human-specific features of structural and functional maturation is currently unknown. We show that the ancestral gene SRGAP2A and its human-specific (HS) paralogs SRGAP2B/C are not only expressed in cortical neurons but are the only HS gene duplications expressed in human microglia. Here, using combination of xenotransplantation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived microglia and mouse genetic models, we demonstrate that (1) HS SRGAP2B/C are necessary and sufficient to induce neotenic features of microglia structural and functional maturation in a cell-autonomous manner, and (2) induction of SRGAP2-dependent neotenic features of microglia maturation non-cell autonomously impacts synaptic development in cortical pyramidal neurons. Our results reveal that, during human brain evolution, human-specific genes SRGAP2B/C coordinated the emergence of neotenic features of synaptic development by acting as genetic modifiers of both neurons and microglia.

">Rbm24 maintains survival of cochlear outer hair cells by repressing Insm1</a></h4>

              
                The inactivation of Rbm24, an RNA-binding protein, results in the degeneration of cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) during the postnatal period. However, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying this OHC death remain elusive. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive analysis comparing the gene profiles of wild-type OHCs to those lacking Rbm24 (Rbm24-/-) at postnatal day 7 (P7). Our results revealed that the overall differentiation program of OHCs is delayed in the absence of Rbm24. Furthermore, the expression of Insm1, a crucial factor for OHC development that is normally switched off by P2, remains prolonged in Rbm24-/- OHCs. Interestingly, when Insm1 is overexpressed, it also leads to OHC death. Significantly, the OHC degeneration is much less severe when both Rbm24 and Insm1 are simultaneously inactivated. These findings shed light on the important role of Rbm24 in repressing Insm1 and its impact on OHC differentiation and survival. Our study provides valuable insights into the complex genetic signaling pathways involved in OHC development.

">Depletion of TDP-43 exacerbates tauopathy-dependent brain atrophy by sensitizing vulnerable neurons to caspase 3-mediated endoproteolysis of tau in a mouse model of Multiple Etiology Dementia</a></h4>

              
                TDP-43 proteinopathy, initially disclosed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), coexists with tauopathy in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, termed multiple etiology dementias (MEDs), including Alzheimers Disease (AD). While such co-pathology of TDP-43 is strongly associated with worsened neurodegeneration and steeper cognitive decline, the pathogenic mechanism underlying the exacerbated neuron loss remains elusive. The loss of TDP-43 splicing repression that occurs in presymptomatic ALS-FTD individuals suggests that such early loss could facilitate the pathological conversion of tau to accelerate neuron loss. Here, we report that the loss of TDP-43 repression of cryptic exons in forebrain neurons (CaMKII-CreER;Tardbpf/f mice) is necessary to exacerbate tauopathy-dependent brain atrophy by sensitizing vulnerable neurons to caspase 3-dependent cleavage of endogenous tau to promote tauopathy. Corroborating this finding within the human context, we demonstrate that loss of TDP-43 function in iPSC-derived cortical neurons promotes early cryptic exon inclusion and subsequent caspase 3-mediated endoproteolysis of tau. Using a genetic approach to seed tauopathy in CaMKII-CreER;Tardbpf/f mice by expressing a four-repeat microtubule binding domain of human tau, we show that the amount of tau seed positively correlates with levels of caspase 3-cleaved tau. Importantly, we found that the vulnerability of hippocampal neurons to TDP-43 depletion is dependent on the amount of caspase 3-cleaved tau: from most vulnerable neurons in the CA2/3, followed by those in the dentate gyrus, to the least in CA1. Taken together, our findings strongly support the view that TDP-43 loss-of-function exacerbates tauopathy-dependent brain atrophy by increasing the sensitivity of vulnerable neurons to caspase 3-mediated endoproteolysis of tau, resulting in a greater degree of neurodegeneration in human disorders with co-pathologies of tau and TDP-43. Our work thus discloses novel mechanistic insights and therapeutic targets for human tauopathies harboring co-pathology of TDP-43 and provides a new MED model for testing therapeutic strategies.

                Sporadic early-onset Alzheimer's disease (sEOAD) represents a significant but less-studied subtype of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we generated a single-nucleus multiome atlas derived from the postmortem prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus of nine individuals with or without sEOAD. Comprehensive analyses were conducted to delineate cell type-specific transcriptomic changes and linked candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) across brain regions. We prioritized seven conservative transcription factors in glial cells in multiple brain regions, including RFX4 in astrocytes and IKZF1 in microglia, which are implicated in regulating sEOAD-associated genes. Moreover, we identified the top 25 altered intercellular signaling between glial cells and neurons, highlighting their regulatory potential on gene expression in receiver cells. We reported 38 cCREs linked to sEOAD-associated genes overlapped with late-onset AD risk loci, and sEOAD cCREs enriched in neuropsychiatric disorder risk loci. This atlas helps dissect transcriptional and chromatin dynamics in sEOAD, providing a key resource for AD research.

">Predictions of bimanual self-touch determine the temporal tuning of somatosensory perception</a></h4>

              
                We effortlessly distinguish between touching ourselves with our hands and being touched by other people or objects. Motor control theories posit that this distinction is made possible by the brain predicting the somatosensory consequences of our voluntary movements based on an efference copy, and attenuating our responses to the predicted self-touch. However, it remains unclear how these predictions impact somatosensory perception at times other than during self-touch: for example, as our hand reaches to touch our body or moves away from it. Here participants discriminated forces applied on their passive left index finger. The forces were applied during the reaching movement of their right hand towards the left hand, including the time the reaching ended by simulating self-touch between the hands, or after the reaching movement. We observed that the forces on the left hand felt progressively weaker during the reaching phase, reached their minimum perceived intensity at the time of self-touch, and quickly recovered after the end of the reaching. All effects were replicated with a new cohort of participants that further demonstrated that this gradual attenuation of the perceived magnitude of touch vanished during similar right hand reaching movements that did not produce expectations for self-touch between the two hands. Together, our results indicate a temporal tuning of somatosensory perception during movements to self-touch and underscore the role of sensorimotor context in forming predictions that attenuate the intensity of self-generated touch.

">Stereotyped spatiotemporal dynamics of spontaneous activity in visual cortex prior to eye-opening</a></h4>

              
                Over the course of development, functional sensory representations emerge in the visual cortex. Prior to eye-opening, modular patterns of spontaneous activity form long-range networks that may serve as a precursor for mature network organization. Although the spatial structure of these networks has been well studied, their temporal features, which may contribute to their continued plasticity and development, remain largely uncharacterized. To address this, we imaged hours of spontaneous network activity in the visual cortex of developing ferrets of both sexes utilizing a fast calcium indicator (GCaMP8m) and widefield imaging at high temporal resolution (50Hz), then segmented out spatiotemporal events. The spatial structure of this activity was highly modular, exhibiting spatially segregated active domains consistent with prior work. We found that the vast majority of events showed a clear dynamic component in which modules activated sequentially across the field of view, but only a minority of events were well-fit with a linear traveling wave. We found that spatiotemporal events occur in repeated and stereotyped motifs, reoccurring across hours of imaging. Finally, we found that the most frequently occurring single-frame spatial activity patterns were predictive of future activity patterns over hundreds of milliseconds. Together, our results demonstrate that spontaneous activity in the early developing cortex exhibits a rich spatiotemporal structure, suggesting a potential role in the maturation and refinement of future functional representations.

">Representational drift as the consequence of ongoing memory storage</a></h4>

              
                Memory systems with biologically constrained synapses have been the topic of intense theoretical study for over thirty years. Perhaps the most fundamental and far-reaching finding from this work is that the storage of new memories implies the partial erasure of already-stored ones. This overwriting leads to a decorrelation of sensory-driven activity patterns over time, even if the input patterns remain similar. Representational drift (RD) should therefore be an expected and inevitable consequence of ongoing memory storage. We tested this hypothesis by fitting a network model to data from long-term chronic calcium imaging experiments in mouse hippocampus. Synaptic turnover in the model inputs, consistent with the ongoing encoding of new activity patterns, accounted for the observed statistics of RD. This mechanism also provides a parsimonious explanation for the recent finding that RD in CA1 place cells has two distinct components: one which depends only on the passage of time, and another which depends on the time spent exploring a given environment. Furthermore, in the context of ongoing learning, the drift rate of any one memory depends on its repetition rate, a mechanism which can reproduce the diverse effects of experience on drift found in experiment. Our results suggest that RD should be observed wherever neuronal circuits are involved in a process of ongoing learning or memory storage.

">A large-scale optogenetic neurophysiology platform for improving accessibility in NHP behavioral experiments</a></h4>

              
                Optogenetics has been a powerful scientific tool for two decades, yet its integration with non-human primate (NHP) electrophysiology has been limited due to several technical challenges. These include a lack of electrode arrays capable of supporting large-scale and long-term optical access, inaccessible viral vector delivery methods for transfection of large regions of cortex, a paucity of hardware designed for large-scale patterned cortical illumination, and inflexible designs for multi-modal experimentation. To address these gaps, we introduce a highly accessible platform integrating optogenetics and electrophysiology for behavioral and neural modulation with neurophysiological recording in NHPs. We employed this platform in two rhesus macaques and showcased its capability of optogenetically disrupting reaches, while simultaneously monitoring ongoing electrocorticography activity underlying the stimulation-induced behavioral changes. The platform exhibits long-term stability and functionality, thereby facilitating large-scale electrophysiology, optical imaging, and optogenetics over months, which is crucial for translationally relevant multi-modal studies of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.

">Corticostriatal ensemble dynamics across heroin self-administration to reinstatement</a></h4>

              
                Corticostriatal projection neurons from prelimbic medial prefrontal cortex to the nucleus accumbens core critically regulate drug-seeking behaviors, yet the underlying encoding dynamics whereby these neurons contribute to drug seeking remain elusive. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging to visualize the activity of corticostriatal neurons in mice from the onset of heroin use to relapse. We find that the activity of these neurons is highly heterogeneous during heroin self-administration and seeking, with at least 8 distinct neuronal ensembles that display both excitatory and inhibitory encoding dynamics. These neuronal ensembles are particularly apparent during relapse, when excitatory responses are amplified compared to heroin self-administration. Moreover, we find that optogenetic inhibition of corticostriatal projection neurons attenuates heroin seeking regardless of the relapse trigger. Our results reveal the precise corticostriatal activity dynamics underlying drug-seeking behaviors and support a key role for this circuit in mediating relapse to drug seeking.

">Mapping the spectrotemporal regions influencing perception of French stop consonants in noise</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how speech sounds are decoded into linguistic units has been a central research challenge over the last century. This study follows a reverse-correlation approach to reveal the acoustic cues listeners use to categorize French stop consonants in noise. Compared to previous methods, this approach ensures an unprecedented level of detail with only minimal theoretical assumptions. Thirty-two participants performed a speech-in-noise discrimination task based on natural /aCa/ utterances, with C = /b/, /d/, /g/, /p/, /t/, or /k/. The trial-by-trial analysis of their confusions enabled us to map the spectrotemporal information they relied on for their decisions. In place-of-articulation contrasts, the results confirmed the critical role of formant consonant-vowel transitions, used by all participants, and, to a lesser extent, vowel-consonant transitions and high-frequency release bursts. Similarly, for voicing contrasts, we validated the prominent role of the voicing bar cue, with some participants also using formant transitions and burst cues. This approach revealed that most listeners use a combination of several cues for each task, with significant variability within the participant group. These insights shed new light on decades-old debates regarding the relative importance of cues for phoneme perception and suggest that research on acoustic cues should not overlook individual variability in speech perception.

">Effects of transcranial photobiomodulation on peripheral biomarkers associated with oxidative stress and complex IV activity in the prefrontal cortex in rats subjected to chronic mild stress</a></h4>

              
                Background: This study addresses the urgent need for effective alternatives to treat major depressive disorder (MDD) in patients who do not respond to conventional therapies Transcranial photobiomodulation therapy (tPBM) shows promise by enhancing mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress, as demonstrated in the chronic mild stress (CMS) rat model. To analyze the impact of tPBM with two wavelengths (red and infrared) on behavioral and biological parameters related to MDD in a CMS model. Methods: Male Wistar rats were subjected to CMS for five weeks and categorized into resilient (CMS-R) and susceptible (CMS-S) groups using the sucrose consumption test (SCT). The CMS-S group received tPBM treatment (600nm and 840nm) for five weeks. Biological measures included lipid damage (TBARS), antioxidant defense (TEAC), mitochondrial complex IV activity (CCO), and nitric oxide (NO) concentration in the prefrontal cortex and blood were measured. Results: As expected, post-tPBM treatment (both red and infrared groups) exhibited increased sucrose consumption compared to the sham (Kruskal Wallis chi-squared=26.131; p<0.001). The red and infrared presented higher serum TEAC levels than the sham and control groups, but these effects did not reach statistical significance (p=0.306). In contrast, the red group showed lower peripheral TBARS levels (M = 9.50, SD = 2.87) than the sham group (M = 13.66, SD = 2.20) (p=0.0048); such effect was similar to the control non-stress group. The infrared group showed higher NO levels within the hippocampus than the sham group (Mean = 107.83; SD = 6.48, Dunn Test p = 0.0134) and higher prefrontal CCO activity levels than the red group (p=0.012), which was similar to the control non-stress group. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that tPBM using both red and infrared wavelengths significantly improved behavioral and biological parameters in the chronic mild stress (CMS) rat model. In particular, tPBM may offer therapeutic benefits by ameliorating oxidative stress and enhancing mitochondrial function, thereby presenting a promising alternative for the management of MDD.

">Gestational CBD shapes insular cortex in adulthood</a></h4>

              
                Many expectant mothers use CBD to alleviate symptoms like nausea, insomnia, anxiety, and pain, despite limited research on its long-term effects. However, CBD passes through the placenta, affecting fetal development and impacting offspring behavior. We investigated how prenatal CBD exposure affects the insular cortex (IC), a brain region involved in emotional processing and linked to psychiatric disorders. The IC is divided into two territories: the anterior IC (aIC), processing socioemotional signals, and the posterior IC (pIC), specializing in interoception and pain perception. Pyramidal neurons in the aIC and pIC exhibit sex-specific electrophysiological properties, including variations in excitability and the excitatory/inhibitory balance. We investigated IC cellular properties and synaptic strength in the offspring of both sexes from mice exposed to low-dose CBD during gestation (E5-E18; 3mg/kg, s.c.). Prenatal CBD exposure induced sex-specific and territory-specific changes in the active and passive membrane properties, as well as intrinsic excitability and the excitatory/inhibitory balance, in the IC of adult offspring. The data indicate that in-utero CBD exposure disrupts IC neuronal development, leading to a loss of functional distinction between IC territories. These findings may have significant implications for understanding the effects of CBD on emotional behaviors in offspring.

	<p>Dysautonomic disorders are an increasingly studied group of conditions, either as isolated diseases or associated with other neurological disorders. There is growing interest in understanding how dysautonomia affects people with epilepsy, who may report autonomic symptoms before, during and after seizures. Furthermore, autonomic abnormalities appear to play a role in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, likely contributing to the increased mortality rate described in epilepsy. To better understand the association between epilepsy and dysautonomia, we explored electrochemical skin conductance in a group of 18 children and young adults with epilepsy compared to 15 age- and sex-matched healthy controls by the SudoscanTM test. We found a significant difference in terms of electrochemical skin conductance, suggesting that people with epilepsy suffer significantly reduced conductance in small nerve fibers. Within patients, values were significantly different according to the type of epilepsy and to neuroimaging results, with lower conductance values in epilepsies of unknown origin and in patients with morphological abnormalities of the brain. Using a non-invasive test, we identified altered conductance of small sympathetic nerve fibers in children and young adults with epilepsy, suggesting underlying dysautonomia. Further studies are needed to investigate this association and to clarify its neurobiological substrates.</p>

	<p>Deficits in memory performance have been linked to a wide range of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. While many studies have assessed the memory impacts of individual conditions, this study considers a broader perspective by evaluating how memory recall is differentially associated with nine common neuropsychiatric conditions using data drawn from 55 international studies, aggregating 15,883 unique participants aged 15&amp;amp;ndash;90. The effects of dementia, mild cognitive impairment, Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, traumatic brain injury, stroke, depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder on immediate, short-, and long-delay verbal learning and memory (VLM) scores were estimated relative to matched healthy individuals. Random forest models identified age, years of education, and site as important VLM covariates. A Bayesian harmonization approach was used to isolate and remove site effects. Regression estimated the adjusted association of each clinical group with VLM scores. Memory deficits were strongly associated with dementia and schizophrenia (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), while neither depression nor ADHD showed consistent associations with VLM scores (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Differences associated with clinical conditions were larger for longer delayed recall duration items. By comparing VLM across clinical conditions, this study provides a foundation for enhanced diagnostic precision and offers new insights into disease management of comorbid disorders.</p>

	<p>Gi-coupled receptors, particularly cannabinoid receptors (CBRs), are considered perspective targets for treating brain pathologies, including epilepsy. However, the precise mechanism of the anticonvulsant effect of the CBR agonists remains unknown. We have found that WIN 55,212-2 (a CBR agonist) suppresses the synchronous oscillations of the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ions (epileptiform activity) induced in the neurons of rat hippocampal neuron-glial cultures by bicuculline or NH4Cl. As we have demonstrated, the WIN 55,212-2 effect is mediated by CB1R receptors. The agonist suppresses Ca2+ inflow mediated by the voltage-gated calcium channels but does not alter the inflow mediated by NMDA, AMPA, and kainate receptors. We have also found that phospholipase C (PLC), protein kinase C (PKC), and G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channels (GIRK channels) are involved in the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory action of CB1R activation against epileptiform activity. Thus, our results demonstrate that the antiepileptic action of CB1R agonists is mediated by different intracellular signaling cascades, including non-canonical PLC/PKC-associated pathways.</p>

	<p>Delayed therapy escape (DTE) is frequent after thalamic deep brain stimulation for essential tremor, leading to reduced quality of life, often with ataxic symptoms, and early recognition is challenging. Our goal was to examine whether a low-frequency rebound tremor of the left hand after switching off stimulation is useful as a diagnostic marker for DTE. In this cross-sectional study with additional retrospective analysis, we examined 31 patients with bilateral thalamic DBS &amp;amp;ge; 12 months for essential tremor, using quantitative assessments including video-based motion capture, Fahn&amp;amp;ndash;Tolosa&amp;amp;ndash;Marin Tremor Rating Scale (FTMTRS), and scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA). If available, preoperative (preOP) and 12-month postoperative assessments were included in the analysis. Evaluations occurred with DBS activated (ON) and deactivated (OFF). A higher ratio FTMTRS nowON/preOP indicated DTE. Preoperative FTMTRS scores were available for 16 patients, including 5 patients with DTE. The receiver operating characteristic analysis found an area under the curve of 0.86 (p = 0.024) for identification of DTE by low-frequency rebound tremor (i.e., OFF) on the left. In conclusion, it could serve as a potential diagnostic marker.</p>

	<p>BACKGROUND: Clinical dynamic posturography concentrates on the pitch and roll but not on the yaw plane instability measures. This emphasis may not represent the axis instability observed in clinical stance and gait tasks for patients with balance deficits in comparison to healthy control (HC) subjects, nor the expected instability based on correlations with vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) deficits. To examine the axis stability changes with vestibular loss, we measured trunk sway in all three directions (pitch, roll, and yaw) during the stance and gait tasks of patients with acute unilateral vestibular neuritis (aUVN) and compared the results with those of HC. Concurrent changes in VORs were also examined and correlated with trunk balance deficits. METHODS: The results of 11 patients (mean age of 61 years) recorded within 6 days of aUVN onset were compared within those of 8 age-matched healthy controls (HCs). All subjects performed a two-legged stance task&amp;amp;mdash;standing with eyes closed on foam (s2ecf), a semi-gait task&amp;amp;mdash;walking eight tandem steps (tan8), and four gait tasks&amp;amp;mdash;walking 3 m with head rotating laterally, pitching, or eyes closed (w3hr, w3hp, w3ec), and walking over four barriers 24 cm high, spaced 1 m apart (barr). The tasks&amp;amp;rsquo; peak-to-peak yaw, pitch and roll angles, and angular velocities were measured with a gyroscope system (SwayStarTM) mounted at L1-3 and combined into three, axis-specific, balance control indexes (BCI), using angles (a) for the tandem gait and barriers task, and angular velocities (v) for all other tasks, as follows: axis BCI = (2 &amp;amp;times; 2ecf)v + 1.5 &amp;amp;times; (w3hr + w3hp + w3ec)v + (tan8 + 12 &amp;amp;times; barr)a. RESULTS: Yaw and pitch BCIs were significantly (p &amp;amp;le; 0.004) greater (88 and 30%, respectively) than roll BCIs for aUVN patients. For HCs, only yaw but not pitch BCIs were greater (p = 0.002) than those of roll (72%). The order of BCI aUVN vs. HC differences was pitch, yaw, and roll at 55, 44, and 31%, respectively (p &amp;amp;le; 0.002). This difference with respect to roll corresponded to the known greater yaw plane than roll plane asymmetry (40 vs. 22%) following aUVN based on VOR responses. However, the lower pitch plane asymmetry (3.5%) in VOR responses did not correspond with the pitch plane instability observed in the balance control tests. The increases in pitch plane instability in UVL subjects were, however, highly correlated with those of roll and yaw. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that greater yaw than pitch and roll trunk motion during clinical balance tasks is common for aUVN patients and HCs. However, aUVN leads to a larger increase in pitch than yaw plane instability and a smaller increase in roll plane instability. This difference with respect to roll corresponds to the known greater yaw plane than roll plane asymmetry (40 vs. 22%) following aUVN observed in VOR responses. However, the lower pitch plane asymmetry (3.5%) in VOR responses does not correspond with the enhanced movements in the pitch plane, observed in balance control tasks. Whether asymmetries in vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (Vemps) are better correlated with the deficits in pitch plane balance control remains to be investigated. The current results provide a strong rationale for the clinical testing of directional specific balance responses, especially yaw and pitch, and the linking of balance results for yaw and roll to VOR asymmetries.</p>

	<p>Chemsex is the interplay of substance use by men who have sex with men (MSM) in sexual contexts. The minority stress model and the identity process theory are explanatory models. In this study, we investigated whether (i) differences in certain psychosocial aspects (i.e., shame, aspects of queer identity, and sexual self-concepts) exist between chemsex users and non-users, and (ii) which factors influence an awareness of negative impacts in chemsex users. We conducted an anonymous, cross-sectional, online survey, including sociodemography, sexual history, history of substance use, validated scales for shame-proneness, aspects of queer identity, and sexual self-concepts. Our analysis comprised descriptive statistics, t-tests, Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlations, and a multiple linear regression model. We recorded a total of 3257 datasets with 107 chemsex users. Chemsex users showed higher rates for risky sexual behavior. Values for shame proneness, more negative aspects of queer identity, and sexual self-concepts were elevated in chemsex users with an awareness of negative impacts. Sexual anxiety, intravenous substance use, and having had a difficult process coming out were significant predictors of feeling negative impacts. Aspects of shame, queer identity aspects, and sexual self-concepts play an important role in the field of chemsex. Different explanatory models seem to be relevant for different subgroups of chemsex users. Chemsex users with an awareness of a problem were particularly vulnerable and distressed but had the highest motivation for change. Prevention, counseling, and care might profit from the inclusion of these aspects. Further anti-stigma campaigns and a specialization of the healthcare system are needed.

	<p>Anomia, characterized by difficulty in word retrieval, particularly action verbs, poses a significant challenge in post-stroke aphasia. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has gained attention for language processing investigations and interventions. This systematic review explores the potential of rTMS as a modality to address action-verb deficits in post-stroke aphasia. We searched MEDLINE via PubMed, CINAHL via Ebsco and Web of Science in February 2024 for English articles (1996&amp;amp;ndash;2024). Eligible studies involved post-stroke aphasia action naming rehabilitation with rTMS. In some of these studies, rTMS was combined with speech-language therapy. In total, 10 studies were included in this systematic review. These articles highlight the potential of rTMS in improving verb retrieval deficits. While significant improvements may not be evident, notable progress both before and after intervention is observed in this review. However, it also underscores the need for further research to enhance language recovery for individuals with post-stroke aphasia.</p>

	<p>Increasing evidence shows that virtual reality (VR) training is highly effective in cognitive and motor rehabilitation. Another modern form of training is cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;motor dual-task training (CMDT), which has been demonstrated to rapidly improve physical and cognitive functions in real environments. This study aims to test whether a VR-based CMDT protocol can be used for motor and cognitive skill enhancement in young, healthy subjects. For this aim, 24 university students participated in a randomized control trial. The experimental group participated in a 5-week virtual reality reaction training (VRRT), performing 30 min sessions once a week. The control group did not receive any training but was tested twice with the same measures and temporal distance as the experimental group. Before and after the intervention, motor, cognitive, and electrophysiological measures were assessed. The results showed that following VRRT, the response time for both physical and cognitive tests was improved by about 14% and 12%, respectively, while the control group did not show significant changes. Moreover, electrophysiological data revealed a significant increase in anticipatory motor readiness in premotor brain areas in the experimental group only; however, cognitive top&amp;amp;ndash;down control tended to be increased in prefrontal areas after VRRT. This training protocol in a VR modality seems to be as effective as other CMDT methodologies carried out in a real modality. Still, it has the advantages of being more flexible and more user-friendly compared to standard training. The VRRT&amp;amp;rsquo;s efficacy on physical and cognitive functions indicates that virtual reality applications can be used by the young population, not only for entertainment purposes but also in the form of cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;motor training.</p>

	<p>A body of experimental research has aimed to investigate processes underlying dream formation by examining the effects of a range of pre-sleep stimuli and events on subsequent dream content. Given its ever-growing presence and salience in people&amp;amp;rsquo;s everyday lives, pre-sleep media consumption stands out as a key variable that could influence people&amp;amp;rsquo;s dreams. We conducted a scoping review to evaluate the experimental evidence of the effects of pre-sleep exposure to visual media on dream content. A systematic search on PubMed, PsycInfo, and Web of Science using terms related to moving visual media and dreams yielded 29 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Overall, we found modest yet varied effects of pre-sleep exposure to visual media on dream content, with rates of stimulus-related incorporation ranging from 3% to 43% for REM dream reports, 4% to 30% for NREM sleep mentation reports, and between 11% and 35% for home dream reports. Our review highlights the large methodological heterogeneity and gaps across studies, the general difficulty in influencing dream content using pre-sleep exposure to visual media, and suggests promising venues for future research to advance our understanding of how and why digital media may impact people&amp;amp;rsquo;s dreams.</p>

                Background A neural network is a machine learning algorithm that can learn and make predictions by adjusting the strength of the connections between nodes. The sigmoid function is commonly used as an activation function in these nodes. This study explores the potential applicability of biological materials in the development of alternative activation functions. Methods Inspired by the fact that acetylcholine induces intestinal contractions that follow a sigmoid function, we used pharmacological data obtained from guinea pig ilea in a layered neural network for image classification tasks. Results and Conclusions We found that the intestinal data-based neural network with the same structure as a conventional three-layer perceptron achieved an impressive classification accuracy of 85.7% ± 0.6% based on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset (chance = 10%). Additionally, the neural network was trained to determine whether objects in photographs collected from the internet were digestible, achieving an accuracy of 88.5% ± 0.9% (chance = 50%). Our approach highlights the potential applicability of intestine data in neural computations based on pharmacological mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-301/v2?src=rss">Proposal of a domain model for 3D representation of buildings in Ecuador. [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                The accelerated urban sprawl of cities around the world presents major challenges for urban planning and land resource management. In this context, it is crucial to have a detailed 3D representation of buildings enriched with accurate alphanumeric information. A distinctive aspect of this proposal is its specific focus on the spatial unit corresponding to buildings. In order to propose a domain model for the 3D representation of buildings, the national standard of Ecuador and the international standard (ISO 19152:2012 LADM) were considered. The proposal includes a detailed specification of attributes, both for the general subclass of buildings and for their infrastructure. The application of the domain model proposal was crucial in a study area located in the Riobamba canton, due to the characteristics of the buildings in that area. For this purpose, a geodatabase was created in pgAdmin4 with official information, taking into account the structure of the proposed model and linking it with geospatial data for an adequate management and 3D representation of the buildings in an open-source Geographic Information System. This application improves cadastral management in the study region and has wider implications. This model is intended to serve as a benchmark for other countries facing similar challenges in cadastral management and 3D representation of buildings, promote efficient urban development and contribute to global sustainable development.

                Background Cesarean section is the most common obstetric procedure performed. This can lead to maternal anxiety, which is a significant contributor to postpartum depression. This can adversely affect pregnant women both mentally and emotionally, negatively impacting their well-being and family bonding. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the addition of an informative cesarean section operative steps video on the maternal anxiety score compared with standard pre-cesarean section care. Methods This randomized controlled trial was conducted at Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand, between April and September 2023. Pregnant women who underwent their first cesarean section were allocated to two groups: intervention and control groups. Participants in the intervention group were required to watch a 5-minute informative video that elaborately described the process from pre-operative steps until post-operative care on the day scheduled for cesarean delivery. All participants received the same routine pre-operative and post-operative care. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to measure both populations on two occasions: the day of scheduled cesarean delivery and postpartum day 1. Results A total of 178 women were recruited. The demographic and obstetric characteristics were similar between the two groups. The pre-operative STAI scores of the intervention and control groups were 42.9 and 44.1 points, respectively, with no significant difference. However, the post-operative anxiety score showed a significant decline in the intervention group compared to that in the control group (p = 0.002). Moreover, most of the participants in the intervention group showed a low level of anxiety after the operation, while half of the control group remained at a moderate to high level score. Conclusions The provision of an informative educational video before cesarean delivery is a powerful tool that significantly reduces cesarean operative anxiety and improves health outcomes.

                <p>by Jaejoong Kim, Sarah M. Tashjian, Dean Mobbs</p>

Comparative research suggests that the hypothalamus is critical in switching between survival behaviors, yet it is unclear if this is the case in humans. Here, we investigate the role of the human hypothalamus in survival switching by introducing a paradigm where volunteers switch between hunting and escape in response to encounters with a virtual predator or prey. Given the small size and low tissue contrast of the hypothalamus, we used deep learning-based segmentation to identify the individual-specific hypothalamus and its subnuclei as well as an imaging sequence optimized for hypothalamic signal acquisition. Across 2 experiments, we employed computational models with identical structures to explain internal movement generation processes associated with hunting and escaping. Despite the shared structure, the models exhibited significantly different parameter values where escaping or hunting were accurately decodable just by computing the parameters of internal movement generation processes. In experiment 2, multi-voxel pattern analyses (MVPA) showed that the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and periaqueductal gray encode switching of survival behaviors while not encoding simple motor switching outside of the survival context. Furthermore, multi-voxel connectivity analyses revealed a network including the hypothalamus as encoding survival switching and how the hypothalamus is connected to other regions in this network. Finally, model-based fMRI analyses showed that a strong hypothalamic multi-voxel pattern of switching is predictive of optimal behavioral coordination after switching, especially when this signal was synchronized with the multi-voxel pattern of switching in the amygdala. Our study is the first to identify the role of the human hypothalamus in switching between survival behaviors and action organization after switching.

                Introduction A urethral diverticulum can be defined as a pocket that forms from the lining of the urethra and protrudes into the surrounding tissue, a condition which causes voiding dysfunction and may result as a rare complication of hypospadias repair surgery. Case report We report the case of a 2-year-old child who presented to us in 2019 complaining of a thin forceful stream, ballooning of the ventral aspect of the penis while voiding, and post-void dribbling. He has a history of undergoing a tubularised incised plate urethroplasty for distal penile hypospadias at 18-months-old. Ultrasound showed increased post-void residual volume and cystourethroscopy confirmed a urethral diverticulum extending from the subcorona to the base of the penis. The patient underwent partial excision of diverticulum, urethroplasty, and meatoplasty. He was followed-up 3 months later with complete resolution of his symptoms and a normal urinary stream with no urethral ballooning or dribbling. Conclusion Urethral diverticulum may present as a complication post hypospadias repair. Although it is rare, we believe that it is important for the patient’s parents to understand the possibility and know of the signs and symptoms in addition to attending regular outpatient clinic appointments in order to facilitate early management if needed. Furthermore, it is highly important for physicians to assess newborns for hypospadias before carrying out circumcision as it is a contraindication for the procedure.

                Abstract* Pleomorphic adenomas (PA) are the most prevalent benign salivary gland neoplasms. They may occur at any age, with a peak incidence between 40 and 60 years of age. They are more commonly observed in females (60%). These tumors can arise in both the major and minor salivary glands. Approximately 80% of these tumors are diagnosed in the parotid gland, whereas 10% arise in the minor salivary glands, mainly affecting the palates, followed by the lips and cheeks. This report describes two cases of unusual lesions that were diagnosed as (PA) in the minor salivary glands in our department via a review of the relevant literature. The first case involved an 83-year-old man who presented with a slow-growing swelling on the right side of the upper lip, and the second case involved a 45-year-old woman who presented with a slow-growing lesion on the palate. The presence of PA was confirmed histopathologically after surgical resection. Although relatively rare, PA is a benign lesion, the diagnosis of which must be known for appropriate therapeutic management.

                Background Coronavirus (COVID-19) is the causative agent of the most recent pandemic that hit the globe and has been the cause of a vast range of symptoms, including neurological symptoms. Bell’s palsy is an acute peripheral facial paralysis commonly associated with viral infections. Case presentation This case report describes a patient with incidental COVID-19 infection that led to acute unilateral peripheral facial paralysis, Bell’s palsy. Our patient is a 35-year-old male with no known comorbidities who was presenting with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and was found to be positive for COVID-19. Soon after the onset of symptoms, he also developed right-sided facial weakness in association with his symptoms. A thorough examination revealed a peripheral neurological lesion. The diagnosis of Bell’s palsy secondary to COVID-19 virus infection was through the exclusion of other possible causes. Conclusions This case report suggests a potential link between Bell’s palsy and COVID-19, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive understanding of the neurological manifestations of COVID-19. Further research is essential to determine the significance of neuropathies in COVID-19 and enhance treatment strategies.

                Background Recall of medical instructions is associated with improved adherence to treatment. The recall of the Body Mass Index (BMI) is important for the improvement of adherence to treatments related to obesity. The burden of obesity all over the world has increased, including in many sub-Saharan African countries. This study measured the recall of BMI, shared decision-making (SDM), and patients’ demographics to determine if they were associated. Methods The study was conducted at a rural hospital outpatient clinic in South Western Uganda. Data were collected using a questionnaire and collaboRate-5 tool for measuring shared decision-making. Data were analysed using SPSS version 20. The chi-square test and Pearson coefficient test were done. Results Out of the 92 participants in this study, the median age was 36 years, in an age range of 18 to 87 years, the majority were male 54 (58.7%), most had a background of attending formal education 75 (81.5%), 79 (85.9%) were not able to recall their BMI; 13 (14.1%) were able to recall their BMI. Only gender among demographic factors studied was associated with recall of BMI (p = 0.027). Shared decision-making was associated with the recall of BMI (P < 0.001). Conclusions The proportion of patients who were not able to recall their BMI after the outpatient clinic visit was high. Gender and the use of SDM were associated with recall of BMI. Measured items describing the use of SDM were only reported among 21(22.8%) participants. SDM was underutilized during the study period at the outpatient clinic. There is a need to have continuous medical education on SDM.

Subsequently, each of these types is illustrated by an example from the sciences. The article also presents the potential of and objections to the application of expert consensus methods there. It gives four examples of expert consensus methods that were applied in humanities research, also presented in line with the six elements. Conclusions The comparisons and categorization show that, as in the natural, social, and life sciences, expert consensus methods in the humanities can in some instances potentially accelerate the epistemic process and enhance transparency, replicability, diversity, and fair processes. Nevertheless, expert consensus methods need to be fine-tuned to do justice to the unique nature and approaches of the humanities and therefore further research is needed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1067/v3?src=rss">Paravertebral vs. Epidural Analgesia for Liver Surgery (PEALS): Protocol for a randomized controlled pilot study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Perioperative thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is commonly used in hepatectomy patients since it is opioid-sparing. However, TEA has a high failure rate and is associated with potentially devastating complications (spinal haematoma) and the risk is increased with hepatectomy. Thus, some centres favour systemic opioid-based modalities which, in turn, are associated with inferior analgesia and well-known risks/side-effects. Hence, alternative analgesic methods are desirable. Paravertebral block (PVB) has been used in liver resection with advantages including haemodynamic stability, low failure rates, and low risk of spinal haematoma. The purpose of this pilot RCT is to compare continuous TEA (traditional standard of care is local anesthetic (LA) + opioids) with PVB (traditional standard of care is with LA without opioid) for patients undergoing hepatectomy. We hypothesise that pain outcomes will be comparable between groups, but PVB patients will require fewer perioperative vasopressors/blood products, have fewer opioid-related side effects and a shorter hospital length of stay. Methods With ethics approval, this non-inferiority, pilot RCT with a convenience sample of 50 hepatectomy patients will examine whether PVB imparts analgesia comparable to TEA but with fewer adverse effects. Primary outcomes are surrogates of analgesia for 72 h postoperatively (i.e., opioid consumption, time to first analgesic request and pain scores at rest and with coughing); Secondary outcomes are blood products/fluids administered; side effects/complications until 72 h postoperatively; length of hospital stay. The results will be used to plan a large multicentre trial comparing TEA vs. PVB in hepatectomy patients. This study has a high potential to positively impact the quality/safety of patient care.

Basement membrane remodeling establishes heterogeneity in the distribution of Collagen IV and in the micropattern of fiber-like structures that is important for proper egg chamber shape.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87753">GABAergic synaptic scaling is triggered by changes in spiking activity rather than AMPA receptor activation</a></h4>

              
                Homeostatic plasticity represents a set of mechanisms that are thought to recover some aspect of neural function. One such mechanism called AMPAergic scaling was thought to be a likely candidate to homeostatically control spiking activity. However, recent findings have forced us to reconsider this idea as several studies suggest AMPAergic scaling is not directly triggered by changes in spiking. Moreover, studies examining homeostatic perturbations <i>in vivo</i> have suggested that GABAergic synapses may be more critical in terms of spiking homeostasis. Here, we show results that GABAergic scaling can act to homeostatically control spiking levels. We found that perturbations which increased or decreased spiking in cortical cultures triggered multiplicative GABAergic upscaling and downscaling, respectively. In contrast, we found that changes in AMPA receptor (AMPAR) or GABAR transmission only influence GABAergic scaling through their indirect effect on spiking. We propose that GABAergic scaling represents a stronger candidate for spike rate homeostat than AMPAergic scaling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90278">Serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons in the dorsal raphe are differentially altered in a mouse model for parkinsonism</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by motor impairments caused by degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. In addition to these symptoms, PD patients often suffer from non-motor comorbidities including sleep and psychiatric disturbances, which are thought to depend on concomitant alterations of serotonergic and noradrenergic transmission. A primary locus of serotonergic neurons is the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), providing brain-wide serotonergic input. Here, we identified electrophysiological and morphological parameters to classify serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons in the murine DRN under control conditions and in a PD model, following striatal injection of the catecholamine toxin, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Electrical and morphological properties of both neuronal populations were altered by 6-OHDA. In serotonergic neurons, most changes were reversed when 6-OHDA was injected in combination with desipramine, a noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitor, protecting the noradrenergic terminals. Our results show that the depletion of both NA and dopamine in the 6-OHDA mouse model causes changes in the DRN neural circuitry.

                How human prefrontal and insular regions interact while maximizing rewards and minimizing punishments is unknown. Capitalizing on human intracranial recordings, we demonstrate that the functional specificity toward reward or punishment learning is better disentangled by interactions compared to local representations. Prefrontal and insular cortices display non-selective neural populations to rewards and punishments. Non-selective responses, however, give rise to context-specific interareal interactions. We identify a reward subsystem with redundant interactions between the orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortices, with a driving role of the latter. In addition, we find a punishment subsystem with redundant interactions between the insular and dorsolateral cortices, with a driving role of the insula. Finally, switching between reward and punishment learning is mediated by synergistic interactions between the two subsystems. These results provide a unifying explanation of distributed cortical representations and interactions supporting reward and punishment learning.

                SARS-CoV-2 induces delayed type-I/III interferon production, allowing it to escape the early innate immune response. The delay has been attributed to a deﬁciency in the ability of cells to sense viral replication upon infection, which in turn hampers activation of the antiviral state in bystander cells. Here, we introduce a cellular automaton model to investigate the spatiotemporal spreading of viral infection as a function of virus and host-dependent parameters. The model suggests that the considerable person-to-person heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 infections is a consequence of high sensitivity to slight variations in biological parameters near a critical threshold. It further suggests that within-host viral proliferation can be curtailed by the presence of remarkably few cells that are primed for IFN production. Thus, the observed heterogeneity in defense readiness of cells reﬂects a remarkably cost-eﬃcient strategy for protection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94836">Modulation of biophysical properties of nucleocapsid protein in the mutant spectrum of SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

              
                Genetic diversity is a hallmark of RNA viruses and the basis for their evolutionary success. Taking advantage of the uniquely large genomic database of SARS-CoV-2, we examine the impact of mutations across the spectrum of viable amino acid sequences on the biophysical phenotypes of the highly expressed and multifunctional nucleocapsid protein. We find variation in the physicochemical parameters of its extended intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) sufficient to allow local plasticity, but also observe functional constraints that similarly occur in related coronaviruses. In biophysical experiments with several N-protein species carrying mutations associated with major variants, we find that point mutations in the IDRs can have nonlocal impact and modulate thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, protein oligomeric state, particle formation, and liquid-liquid phase separation. In the Omicron variant, distant mutations in different IDRs have compensatory effects in shifting a delicate balance of interactions controlling protein assembly properties, and include the creation of a new protein-protein interaction interface in the N-terminal IDR through the defining P13L mutation. A picture emerges where genetic diversity is accompanied by significant variation in biophysical characteristics of functional N-protein species, in particular in the IDRs.

">Proteomic analysis of isolated nerve terminals from NaV1.9 knockout mice reveals pathways relevant for neuropathic pain signalling</a></h4>

              
                Neuropathic pain substantially affects the mental and physical well-being of patients and magnifies the socio-economic burden on the healthcare system. It is important to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying chronic pain to effectively target it. To investigate peripheral mechanisms relevant to pain signaling, we isolated nerve terminals from mouse footpads. The isolated peripheral terminals contain both pre- and post-synaptic proteins and are deficient in keratin and histone in both mice and humans. We detected the protein translational machinery and mitochondria in nerve terminals and observed that they were capable of endocytosis. An unbiased proteomic analysis of nerve terminals from footpads of NaV1.9 knockout mice shows dysregulation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathways, and of protein components involved in translation and energy metabolism. Isolation of human nerve terminals from skin punch biopsies, validated by proteomic analysis, highlights the broad and translational value of our approach. Our study thus reveals peripheral signaling mechanisms implicated in pain perception.

	<p>Respiratory dysfunction is an important hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Elevation of creatine kinase (CK) has been reported in 23&amp;amp;ndash;75% of ALS patients, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. This work aims to enlighten the role of CK as a prognostic factor of respiratory dysfunction in ALS. A retrospective analysis of demographic and clinical variables, CK, functional decline per month (&amp;amp;Delta;FS), forced vital capacity (%FVC), and mean amplitude of the phrenic nerve compound motor action potential (pCMAP) in 319 ALS patients was conducted. These measurements were evaluated at study entry, and patients were followed from the moment of first observation until death or last follow-up visit. High CK values were defined as above the 90th percentile (CK &amp;amp;ge; P90) adjusted to sex. We analyzed survival and time to non-invasive ventilation (NIV) as proxies for respiratory impairment. Linear regression analysis revealed that high CK was associated with male sex (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), spinal onset (p = 0.018), and FVC &amp;amp;ge; 80% (p = 0.038). CK was 23.4% higher in spinal-onset ALS patients (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). High CK levels were not linked with an increased risk of death (p = 0.334) in Cox multivariate regression analysis. CK &amp;amp;ge; P90 (HR = 1.001, p = 0.038), shorter disease duration (HR = 0.937, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), lower pCMAP (HR = 0.082, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and higher &amp;amp;Delta;FS (HR = 1.968, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) were risk factors for respiratory failure. The association between high CK levels and poorer respiratory outcomes could derive from cellular metabolic stress or a specific phenotype associated with faster respiratory decline. Our study suggests that CK measurement at diagnosis should be more extensively investigated as a possible marker of poor respiratory outcome in future studies, including a larger population of patients.</p>

	<p>Depression is clinically diagnosed when a defined constellation of symptoms manifests over a specific duration with notable severity. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is characterized by the presence of five or more symptoms persisting for at least two weeks. As a profound mental health condition affecting millions globally, depression presents a considerable challenge for researchers and clinicians alike. In pediatric and adolescent populations, depression can precipitate adverse outcomes, including substance abuse, academic difficulties, risky sexual behaviors, physical health problems, impaired social relationships, and a markedly elevated risk of suicide&amp;amp;mdash;up to thirty times higher than the general population. This paper details a study that evaluated the efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) alone vs. CBT combined with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in a treatment program. The study cohort comprised sixteen (16) children and adolescents diagnosed with depression (eight males and eight females) and sixteen (16) typically developing peers (eight males and eight females) aged from 9 to 15 years (Mean age = 11.94, standard deviation = 2.02). Initial assessments employed Event-Related Potentials (ERPs), the Children&amp;amp;rsquo;s Depression Inventory (CDI), and reaction time measurements. The results reveal that participants with depression exhibit cognitive deficits in attention and memory, as evidenced by prolonged P300 latencies. Following intervention with either CBT alone or CBT combined with medication, the depressed participants demonstrated significant improvements, evidenced by lower CDI scores, reduced P300 latencies, and faster reaction times, both compared to their pre-treatment status and relative to the control group.</p>

	<p>Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a side effect of cancer treatment, often linked with pain complaints. Patients report mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity that may emerge during chemotherapy treatment and may persist after cancer remission. Whereas the latter situation disturbs the quality of life, life itself may be endangered by the appearance of CIPN during cancer treatment. The causes of CIPN have almost entirely been ascribed to the neurotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs in the peripheral nervous system. However, the central consequences of peripheral neuropathy are starting to be unraveled, namely in the supraspinal pain modulatory system. Based on our interests and experience in the field, we undertook a review of the brain-centered alterations that may underpin pain in CIPN. The changes in the descending pain modulation in CIPN models along with the functional and connectivity abnormalities in the brain of CIPN patients are analyzed. A translational analysis of preclinical findings about descending pain regulation during CIPN is reviewed considering the main neurochemical systems (serotoninergic and noradrenergic) targeted in CIPN management in patients, namely by antidepressants. In conclusion, this review highlights the importance of studying supraspinal areas involved in descending pain modulation to understand the pathophysiology of CIPN, which will probably allow a more personalized and effective CIPN treatment in the future.</p>

	<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), major depressive disorder (MDD) is the fourth leading cause of disability worldwide and the second most common disease after cardiovascular events. Approximately 280 million people live with MDD, with incidence varying by age and gender (female to male ratio of approximately 2:1). Although a variety of antidepressants are available for the different forms of MDD, there is still a high degree of individual variability in response and tolerability. Given the complexity and clinical heterogeneity of these disorders, a shift from &amp;amp;ldquo;canonical treatment&amp;amp;rdquo; to personalized medicine with improved patient stratification is needed. OPADE is a non-profit study that researches biomarkers in MDD to tailor personalized drug treatments, integrating genetics, epigenetics, microbiome, immune response, and clinical data for analysis. A total of 350 patients between 14 and 50 years will be recruited in 6 Countries (Italy, Colombia, Spain, The Netherlands, Turkey) for 24 months. Real-time electroencephalogram (EEG) and patient cognitive assessment will be correlated with biological sample analysis. A patient empowerment tool will be deployed to ensure patient commitment and to translate patient stories into data. The resulting data will be used to train the artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) predictive tool.</p>

	<p>Menopause may increase the risk of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) dementia. This study aimed to use young plasma therapy (YPT) to improve dementia caused by AD in aged ovariectomized rats. Female Wistar rats were used in the following groups: (a) young (CY) (180&amp;amp;ndash;200 g, 2&amp;amp;ndash;3 months, n = 10) and (b) old groups (250&amp;amp;ndash;350 g, 22&amp;amp;ndash;24 months, n = 60). The old rats were randomly assigned to six sub-groups: (1) control, (2) sham, (3) ovariectomized group (OVX), (4) OVX + Alzheimer disease (OVX + AD), (5) OVX + AD+ 17&amp;amp;beta;-Estradiol (OVX + AD + E), and (6) OVX + AD + young plasma (OVX + AD + YP). Cognitive behaviors were evaluated using NOR, MWM, and PAL tests. MiR-134a, SIRT-1, CREB, and BDNF expressions were measured using real-time PCR and western blot, respectively. Oxidative stress in hippocampal tissue was assayed using ELISA kits. OVX and AD caused significant cognitive impairment (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), up-regulated miR-134a (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), down-regulated SIRT-1, CREB, and BDNF protein expression (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and decreased antioxidant marker levels (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) compared to the sham group. YPT significantly restored miR-134a (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), SIRT-1 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), CREB (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and BDNF (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) protein expression in OVX + AD rats. YPT, as much as or more than estrogen therapy (ERT), significantly improved oxidative stress and down-regulated miR-134a expression and the up-regulation of SIRT-1, CREB, and BDNF proteins in OVX + AD rats (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). YPT significantly improved histological alteration compared to the OVX + AD group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). As a non-pharmacological treatment, YPT can improve the expression of miR-134a and SIRT-1, CREB, and BDNF proteins as much as or more than estrogen therapy, ameliorating AD-induced dementia in aged OVX rats.</p>

	<p>This study examined the impact of personalizing muscle vibration parameters on trunk control. We assessed how altered trunk extensor muscle (TEM) proprioception affects seated trunk control in healthy controls (HCs). To explore the link between altered TEM proprioception and impaired trunk control in chronic low back pain (cLBP), we performed equivalence testing between HCs undergoing TEM vibration and cLBP without vibration. Twenty HCs performed active joint reposition error (AJRE) testing to determine personalized vibration parameters. Each participant maintained balance on an unstable chair with eyes open and closed, with and without TEM vibration. We compared trunk control between HCs and twenty age- and sex-matched cLBP participants, using mean velocity and 95% confidence ellipse area of center-of-pressure changes to quantify trunk postural control. Equivalence was examined by comparing mean difference scores to minimal detectable change values and calculating between-group effect sizes. Personalized vibration parameters led to larger lumbopelvic repositioning errors (d = 0.89) than any single vibration frequency (d = 0.31&amp;amp;ndash;0.36). In healthy adults with no back pain, vision had large effects on postural control (&amp;amp;eta;p2 = 0.604&amp;amp;ndash;0.842), but TEM vibration had no significant effects (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.105) or interactions with vision (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.423). Between-group effect sizes (d = 0.32&amp;amp;ndash;0.51) exceeded our threshold for performance equivalence (d &amp;amp;lt; 0.2). Muscle vibration altered position sense during AJRE testing, and personalizing parameters amplified this effect. However, TEM vibration had minimal impact on seated trunk postural control in adults with no back pain and did not lead to performance degradation comparable to that in cLBP.</p>

                Introduction and aim Periodontal disease, initiated by dental biofilm and influenced by various local and systemic factors, includes stress as a potential contributor to its progression. Despite associations with severe forms like acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, a comprehensive large-sample study linking stress to periodontal disease is lacking. This study aims to investigate the relationship between mental health and periodontal disease. Materials and Methods Leveraging data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), relevant information was extracted. Mental health was the exposure variable, and periodontal disease, assessed through indices following Eke et al.'s definition, served as the outcome. Covariates impacting periodontal disease were considered, and demographic and disease status analyses employed the Rao-Scott chi-squared test. A logistic regression model assessed mental health's impact on periodontal disease. Results Logistic regression indicated higher odds of periodontal disease among individuals feeling bad about themselves for more than half of the day (OR 1.170, 95% CI 0.533-2.474), though statistical significance was not reached. Periodontitis prevalence significantly varied based on marital status, with 6.6% of married and 10.8% of unmarried subjects affected. Notably, a statistically significant difference in periodontitis prevalence existed between subjects with health insurance (8.3%) and those without (16.5%). Conclusion Within study limitations, it is concluded that no significant difference exists in periodontal status between individuals with compromised mental health and those without. The findings underscore potential associations between mental health, marital status, and access to health insurance with periodontal disease.

                <p>Linked rhythmic behaviors, such as respiration/locomotion or swallowing/chewing, often require coordination for proper function. Despite its prevalence, the cellular mechanisms controlling coordination of the underlying neural networks remain undetermined in most systems. We use the stomatogastric nervous system of the crab <I>Cancer borealis</I> to investigate mechanisms of internetwork coordination, due to its small, well-characterized feeding-related networks (gastric mill [chewing, ~0.1&nbsp;Hz]; pyloric [filtering food, ~1&nbsp;Hz]). Here, we investigate coordination between these networks during the Gly<sup>1</sup>-SIFamide neuropeptide modulatory state. Gly<sup>1</sup>-SIFamide activates a unique triphasic gastric mill rhythm in which the typically pyloric-only LPG neuron generates dual pyloric-plus gastric mill-timed oscillations. Additionally, the pyloric rhythm exhibits shorter cycles during gastric mill rhythm-timed LPG bursts, and longer cycles during IC, or IC plus LG gastric mill neuron bursts. Photoinactivation revealed that LPG is necessary to shorten pyloric cycle period, likely through its rectified electrical coupling to pyloric pacemaker neurons. Hyperpolarizing current injections demonstrated that although LG bursting enables IC bursts, only gastric mill rhythm bursts in IC are necessary to prolong the pyloric cycle period. Surprisingly, LPG photoinactivation also eliminated prolonged pyloric cycles, without changing IC firing frequency or gastric mill burst duration, suggesting that pyloric cycles are prolonged via IC synaptic inhibition of LPG, which indirectly slows the pyloric pacemakers via electrical coupling. Thus, the same dual-network neuron directly conveys excitation from its endogenous bursting and indirectly funnels synaptic inhibition to enable one network to alternately decrease and increase the cycle period of a related network.</p>

                Background The goal of the Fifth Annual Baylor College of Medicine & DNAnexus Structural Variation Hackathon was to push forward the research on structural variants (SVs) by rapidly developing and deploying open-source software. The event took place in-person and virtually in August 2023, when 49 scientists from 14 countries and 8 U.S. states collaboratively worked on projects to address critical gaps in the field of genomics. The hackathon projects concentrated on developing bioinformatic workflows for the following challenges: RNA transcriptome comparison, simulation of mosaic variations, metagenomics, Mendelian variation, SVs in plant genomics, and assembly vs. mapping SV calling comparisons. Methods As a starting point we used publicly available data from state-of-the-art long- and short-read sequencing technologies. The workflows developed during the hackathon incorporated open-source software, as well as scripts written using Bash and Python. Moreover, we leveraged the advantages of Docker and Snakemake for workflow automation. Results The results of the hackathon consists of six prototype bioinformatic workflows that use open-source software for SV research. We made the workflows scalable and modular for usability and reproducibility. Furthermore, we tested the workflows on example public data to show that the workflows can work. The code and the data produced during the event have been made publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/collaborativebioinformatics) to reproduce and built upon in the future. Conclusions The following sections describe the motivation, lessons learned, and software produced by teams during the hackathon. Here, we describe in detail the objectives, value propositions, implementation, and use cases for our workflows. In summary, the article reports the advancements in the development of software for SV detection made during the hackathon.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-707/v1?src=rss">Roles and Current Challenges of Peer Educators in delivering HIV/AIDS-related services: a case study in VietNam [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Increasing the participation of peer educators (PEs) to deliver HIV/AIDS services in a limited income context remains challenging, despite their profound effectiveness, and this has become more evident since the COVID-19 outbreak. This study examines the roles of PEs and the current challenges in delivering HIV/AIDS services in Vietnam. Methods A mixed-method approach was employed. The study was conducted in seven large provinces in Vietnam from December 2021 to March 2022. An online cross-sectional survey was administered to 63 health staff and 147 PEs to collect quantitative data on PEs’ roles. Qualitative interviews included seven focus-group discussions with 39 PEs and in-depth interviews with 25 key informants, including seven leaders and 14 health staff from district health centers and provincial centers for disease control (CDCs), one national-level HIV/AIDS program manager, one non-government organization representative, and two senior experts. Results Results show the diversified roles of PEs in delivering HIV/AIDS activities in Vietnam. The roles could be categorized into two main groups, including community-based activities and facilities-based activities. Prominent roles are identifying and referring customers to HIV testing services, conducting communication and education activities, and referring patients to treatment services. The study shows a decrease in the roles of PEs in delivering HIV/AIDS services in Vietnam despite the high demand for their participation from healthcare providers. Critical challenges in employing PEs in HIV/AIDS services are related to lack of funding, inadequate training, lack of recognition, and stigma. Conclusion To keep the right path to the goal of ending the HIV pandemic by 2030, it is important to maintain and increase the roles of PEs in delivering HIV/AIDS services. Raising better acknowledgment from stakeholders of PEs’ roles could help overcome the remaining challenges and expand their participation toward this goal.

                <p>by Youcheng Li, Leann Lac, Qian Liu, Pingzhao Hu</p>

Spatial transcriptomics has gained popularity over the past decade due to its ability to evaluate transcriptome data while preserving spatial information. Cell segmentation is a crucial step in spatial transcriptomic analysis, as it enables the avoidance of unpredictable tissue disentanglement steps. Although high-quality cell segmentation algorithms can aid in the extraction of valuable data, traditional methods are frequently non-spatial, do not account for spatial information efficiently, and perform poorly when confronted with the problem of spatial transcriptome cell segmentation with varying shapes. In this study, we propose ST-CellSeg, an image-based machine learning method for spatial transcriptomics that uses manifold for cell segmentation and is novel in its consideration of multi-scale information. We first construct a fully connected graph which acts as a spatial transcriptomic manifold. Using multi-scale data, we then determine the low-dimensional spatial probability distribution representation for cell segmentation. Using the adjusted Rand index (ARI), normalized mutual information (NMI), and Silhouette coefficient (SC) as model performance measures, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms baseline models in selected datasets and is efficient in computational complexity.

                <p>by Matthew C. Perrone, Michael G. Lerner, Matthew Dunworth, Andrew J. Ewald, Joel S. Bader</p>

Therapeutic interventions are designed to perturb the function of a biological system. However, there are many types of proteins that cannot be targeted with conventional small molecule drugs. Accordingly, many identified gene-regulatory drivers and downstream effectors are currently undruggable. Drivers and effectors are often connected by druggable signaling and regulatory intermediates. Methods to identify druggable intermediates therefore have general value in expanding the set of targets available for hypothesis-driven validation. Here we identify and prioritize potential druggable intermediates by developing a network perturbation theory, termed NetPert, for response functions of biological networks. Dynamics are defined by a network structure in which vertices represent genes and proteins, and edges represent gene-regulatory interactions and protein-protein interactions. Perturbation theory for network dynamics prioritizes targets that interfere with signaling from driver to response genes. Applications to organoid models for metastatic breast cancer demonstrate the ability of this mathematical framework to identify and prioritize druggable intermediates. While the short-time limit of the perturbation theory resembles betweenness centrality, NetPert is superior in generating target rankings that correlate with previous wet-lab assays and are more robust to incomplete or noisy network data. NetPert also performs better than a related graph diffusion approach. Wet-lab assays demonstrate that drugs for targets identified by NetPert, including targets that are not themselves differentially expressed, are active in suppressing additional metastatic phenotypes.

                <p>by Apolline Louvet, Clément Mantoux, Nathalie Machon</p>

As the spatial arrangement of trees planted along streets in cities makes their bases potential ecological corridors for the flora, urban tree bases may be a key contributor to the overall connectivity of the urban ecosystem. However, these tree bases are also a highly fragmented environment in which extinctions are frequent. The goal of this study was to assess the plant species’ ability to survive and spread through urban tree bases. To do so, we developed a Bayesian framework to assess the extinction risk of a plant metapopulation using presence/absence data, assuming that the occupancy dynamics was described by a Hidden Markov Model. The novelty of our approach is to take into account the combined effect of low-distance dispersal and the potential presence of a seed bank on the extinction risk. We introduced a metric of the extinction risk and examined its performance over a wide range of metapopulation parameters. We applied our framework to yearly floristic inventories carried out in 1324 tree bases in Paris, France. While local extinction risks were generally high, extinction risks at the street scale varied greatly from one species to another. We identified 10 plant species that could survive and spread through urban tree bases, and three plant traits correlated with the extinction risk at the metapopulation scale: the maximal height, and the beginning and end of the flowering period. Our results suggest that some plant species can use urban tree bases as ecological corridors despite high local extinction risks by forming a seed bank. We also identified other plant traits correlated with the ability to survive in tree bases, related to the action of gardeners. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that our Bayesian estimation framework based on percolation theory has the potential to be extended to more general metapopulations.

                <p>by Caleb J. Holt, Kenneth D. Miller, Yashar Ahmadian</p>

When stimulated, neural populations in the visual cortex exhibit fast rhythmic activity with frequencies in the gamma band (30-80 Hz). The gamma rhythm manifests as a broad resonance peak in the power-spectrum of recorded local field potentials, which exhibits various stimulus dependencies. In particular, in macaque primary visual cortex (V1), the gamma peak frequency increases with increasing stimulus contrast. Moreover, this contrast dependence is local: when contrast varies smoothly over visual space, the gamma peak frequency in each cortical column is controlled by the local contrast in that column’s receptive field. No parsimonious mechanistic explanation for these contrast dependencies of V1 gamma oscillations has been proposed. The stabilized supralinear network (SSN) is a mechanistic model of cortical circuits that has accounted for a range of visual cortical response nonlinearities and contextual modulations, as well as their contrast dependence. Here, we begin by showing that a reduced SSN model without retinotopy robustly captures the contrast dependence of gamma peak frequency, and provides a mechanistic explanation for this effect based on the observed non-saturating and supralinear input-output function of V1 neurons. Given this result, the local dependence on contrast can trivially be captured in a retinotopic SSN which however lacks horizontal synaptic connections between its cortical columns. However, long-range horizontal connections in V1 are in fact strong, and underlie contextual modulation effects such as surround suppression. We thus explored whether a retinotopically organized SSN model of V1 with strong excitatory horizontal connections can exhibit both surround suppression and the local contrast dependence of gamma peak frequency. We found that retinotopic SSNs can account for both effects, but only when the horizontal excitatory projections are composed of two components with different patterns of spatial fall-off with distance: a short-range component that only targets the source column, combined with a long-range component that targets columns neighboring the source column. We thus make a specific qualitative prediction for the spatial structure of horizontal connections in macaque V1, consistent with the columnar structure of cortex.

                <p>by Devon J. Boland, Nicola M. Ayres</p>

AlphaFold2 is an Artificial Intelligence-based program developed to predict the 3D structure of proteins given only their amino acid sequence at atomic resolution. Due to the accuracy and efficiency at which AlphaFold2 can generate 3D structure predictions and its widespread adoption into various aspects of biochemical research, the technique of protein structure prediction should be considered for incorporation into the undergraduate biochemistry curriculum. A module for introducing AlphaFold2 into a senior-level biochemistry laboratory classroom was developed. The module’s focus was to have students predict the structures of proteins from the MPOX 22 global outbreak virus isolate genome, which had no structures elucidated at that time. The goal of this study was to both determine the impact the module had on students and to develop a framework for introducing AlphaFold2 into the undergraduate curriculum so that instructors for biochemistry courses, regardless of their background in bioinformatics, could adapt the module into their classrooms.

Throughout history, humans have relied on plants as a source of medication, flavoring, and food. Plants synthesize large chemical libraries and release many of these compounds into the rhizosphere and atmosphere where they affect animal and microbe behavior. To survive, nematodes must have evolved the sensory capacity to distinguish plant-made small molecules (SMs) that are harmful and must be avoided from those that are beneficial and should be sought. This ability to classify chemical cues as a function of their value is fundamental to olfaction and represents a capacity shared by many animals, including humans. Here, we present an efficient platform based on multiwell plates, liquid handling instrumentation, inexpensive optical scanners, and bespoke software that can efficiently determine the valence (attraction or repulsion) of single SMs in the model nematode, <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Using this integrated hardware-wetware-software platform, we screened 90 plant SMs and identified 37 that attracted or repelled wild-type animals but had no effect on mutants defective in chemosensory transduction. Genetic dissection indicates that for at least 10 of these SMs, response valence emerges from the integration of opposing signals, arguing that olfactory valence is often determined by integrating chemosensory signals over multiple lines of information. This study establishes that <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> is an effective discovery engine for determining chemotaxis valence and for identifying natural products detected by the chemosensory nervous system.

                <p>by Lingchao Ji, Beatriz C. Borges, David T. Martel, Calvin Wu, M. Charles Liberman, Susan E. Shore, Gabriel Corfas</p>

Loss of synapses between spiral ganglion neurons and inner hair cells (IHC synaptopathy) leads to an auditory neuropathy called hidden hearing loss (HHL) characterized by normal auditory thresholds but reduced amplitude of sound-evoked auditory potentials. It has been proposed that synaptopathy and HHL result in poor performance in challenging hearing tasks despite a normal audiogram. However, this has only been tested in animals after exposure to noise or ototoxic drugs, which can cause deficits beyond synaptopathy. Furthermore, the impact of supernumerary synapses on auditory processing has not been evaluated. Here, we studied mice in which IHC synapse counts were increased or decreased by altering neurotrophin 3 (Ntf3) expression in IHC supporting cells. As we previously showed, postnatal Ntf3 knockdown or overexpression reduces or increases, respectively, IHC synapse density and suprathreshold amplitude of sound-evoked auditory potentials without changing cochlear thresholds. We now show that IHC synapse density does not influence the magnitude of the acoustic startle reflex or its prepulse inhibition. In contrast, gap-prepulse inhibition, a behavioral test for auditory temporal processing, is reduced or enhanced according to Ntf3 expression levels. These results indicate that IHC synaptopathy causes temporal processing deficits predicted in HHL. Furthermore, the improvement in temporal acuity achieved by increasing Ntf3 expression and synapse density suggests a therapeutic strategy for improving hearing in noise for individuals with synaptopathy of various etiologies.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27019?af=R">Metabolic Syndrome and Risk of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Insights from a Large‐Scale Prospective Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although metabolic abnormalities are implicated in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases, their role in the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains a subject of controversy. We aimed to identify the association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and the risk of ALS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This study included 395,987 participants from the UK Biobank to investigate the relationship between MetS and ALS. Cox regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR). Stratified analyses were performed based on gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, and education level. Mediation analysis was conducted to explore potential mechanisms.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In this study, a total of 539 cases of ALS were recorded after a median follow-up of 13.7 years. Patients with MetS (defined harmonized) had a higher risk of developing ALS after adjusting for confounding factors (HR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.19–1.89). Specifically, hypertension and high triglycerides were linked to a higher risk of ALS (HR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.19–1.95; HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.06–1.61, respectively). Moreover, the quantity of metabolic abnormalities showed significant results. Stratified analysis revealed that these associations are particularly significant in individuals with a BMI &lt;25. These findings remained stable after sensitivity analysis. Notably, mediation analysis identified potential metabolites and metabolomic mediators, including alkaline phosphatase, cystatin C, γ-glutamyl transferase, saturated fatty acids to total fatty acids percentage, and omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids ratio.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MetS exhibits a robust association with an increased susceptibility to ALS, particularly in individuals with a lower BMI. Furthermore, metabolites and metabolomics, as potential mediators, provide invaluable insights into the intricate biological mechanisms. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27016?af=R">Inflammation‐Triggered Enlargement of Choroid Plexus in Subacute COVID‐19 Patients with Neurological Symptoms</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate whether choroid plexus volumes in subacute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with neurological symptoms could indicate inflammatory activation or barrier dysfunction and assess their association with clinical data.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Choroid plexus volumes were measured in 28 subacute COVID-19 patients via cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), compared with those in infection-triggered non-COVID-19 encephalopathy patients (n = 25), asymptomatic individuals after COVID-19 (n = 21), and healthy controls (n = 21). Associations with inflammatory serum markers (peak counts of leukocytes, C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin 6), an MRI-based marker of barrier dysfunction (CSF volume fraction [V-CSF]), and clinical parameters like olfactory performance and cognitive scores (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) were investigated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>COVID-19 patients showed significantly larger choroid plexus volumes than control groups (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.172). These volumes correlated significantly with peak leukocyte levels (<i>p</i> = 0.001, Pearson's r = 0.621) and V-CSF (<i>p</i> = 0.009, Spearman's rho = 0.534), but neither with CRP nor interleukin 6. No significant correlations were found with clinical parameters.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In patients with subacute COVID-19, choroid plexus volume is a marker of central nervous system inflammation and barrier dysfunction in the presence of neurologic symptoms. The absence of plexus enlargement in infection-triggered non-COVID-19 encephalopathy suggests a specific severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 effect. This study also documents an increase in choroid plexus volume for the first time as a parainfectious event. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background The aim of this paper was to explore how the Fourth Industrial Revolution shapes teaching and learning during COVID-19 in some of the schools located in the Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces, South Africa. This paper employed qualitative interpretative multiple case study design. Purposive sampling was used to sample our participants. Methods We selected four teachers who separately taught at the early childhood development stage, intermediate phase, senior phase, and further education and training phases. Data was collected telephonically through semi-structured interviews with teachers from Limpopo, Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces of South Africa. Data was collected from their experiences of COVID-19 from 2019 to 2021. Collected data was analysed using a typology approach whereby themes that derived from the literature reviewed and research questions were used. Results We inferred from the results of the paper that teachers had challenges with teaching and availability of learning resources, such as limited access to internet and socio-economic backgrounds, which hindered the integration of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the teaching and learning process. There were also challenges related to teachers’ background on the usage of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the lack of school management teams support. The paper revealed that the integration of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in teaching and learning was affected negatively by the existence of the above-mentioned challenges, which needs to be addressed. Conclusions Therefore, we recommended that the government and stakeholders within the education sector provide resources such as smart-boards, computers, and network access in schools lacking such facilities, as well as providing professional development interventions and training teachers to have an in-depth understanding of the Fourth Industrial Revolution within the teaching and learning context.

                Fish species are commonly used as experimental models in the laboratory. DNA is routinely collected from these animals to permit identification of their genotype. The current standard procedure to sample DNA is fin clipping, which involves anaesthetising individuals and removing a portion of the caudal fin. While fin clipping reliably generates good quality DNA samples for downstream applications, there is evidence that it can alter health and welfare, and impact the fish’s behaviour. This in turn can result in greater variation in the data collected. In a recent study we adapted a skin swabbing protocol to collect DNA from small-bodied fish, including sticklebacks and zebrafish, without the use of analgesics, anaesthetics or sharp instruments. A rayon-tipped swab was used to collect mucus from the flank of the fish, which was then used for DNA extraction. We subsequently demonstrated that compared to fin clipping, skin swabbing triggered fewer changes in stress axis activation and behaviour. We also found that gene expression and behaviour data collected from swabbed fish were less variable than similar data collected from fish that had been fin clipped. This potentially allows smaller sample sizes in experimental groups to be used after skin swabbing, thereby reducing animal use. Here we provide a detailed protocol explaining how to collect DNA samples from small laboratory fish using skin swabs.

                Background Kimono is being reevaluated for its sustainability aspects, such as having fewer offcuts in the production process due to its structural differences from Western-style clothes and its high reusability due to the adaptability to individuals’ body shapes. On the other hand, once a common attire for daily wear in Japan, kimono has transitioned to being worn only on special events and the kimono-related industry has also shrunk. To stimulate demand for kimono, it is essential to familiarize younger generations with its potential as daily wear. Methods A questionnaire survey on perceptions of kimono was conducted among two groups in Japan: 211 college students and 50 kimono enthusiasts. The questionnaire included demographic questions and psychometric scales, primarily focusing on their kimono experiences, challenges associated with wearing kimono, their perceptions of kimono and Western-style clothes, and their attitudes towards kimono. Results The results revealed that a majority of students had worn kimono before, though they found it difficult to move while wearing it. In contrast, kimono enthusiasts evaluated it as easier to move, hard to become disheveled, and casual. They also rated the ease of wearing Western-style clothes lower compared to students, and this tendency intensified with the length of enthusiast experience. Furthermore, the findings indicated that enthusiasts regarded the kimono more as daily wear compared to students, while still deriving enjoyment from it as formal attire in special events. Conclusions These results suggest that the cognition that Western-style clothes are easy to move and kimono is not may change with experiences. Therefore, providing opportunities for people in Japan to acquire how to wear kimono in comfortable ways possibly impacts their perceptions of kimono.

                Background Various stemness markers (SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG) have been studied in odontogenic cysts and tumors. However, studies on SALL4 having similar properties of stemness has not been documented. Additionally, insight into fascin as a migratory molecule is less explored. In this study, the expression of SALL4 and fascin were evaluated in ameloblastoma, adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (AOT), odontogenic keratocyst (OKC), dentigerous cyst (DC), radicular cyst (RC), and calcifying odontogenic cyst (COC). Methods Semi-quantitative analysis of fascin and SALL4 immuno-positive cells was done in a total of 40 cases of ameloblastoma (11 plexiform, 12 follicular, 12 unicystic, and 5 desmoplastic) variants, 6 cases of AOT, 15 each of OKC, DC, RC and 5 of COC. Chi-square test was applied to evaluate the association between SALL4 and fascin expression in odontogenic cysts and tumors. Results Fascin immunopositivity was observed in peripheral ameloblast-like cells, and the expression was weak or absent in stellate reticulum-like cells. A moderate to weak immune-reactivity to SALL4 was observed in the cytoplasm of ameloblastoma, epithelial cells of dentigerous and radicular cysts, having a marked inflammatory infiltrate, which was an interesting observation. COC and AOT had negative to weak expressions. No recurrence has been reported. Conclusions Expression of fascin in ameloblastomas elucidate their role in motility and localized invasion. Its expression in less aggressive lesions like DC, COC, AOT will incite to explore the other functional properties of fascin. SALL4 expression in the cytoplasm of odontogenic cysts and tumors may represent inactive or mutant forms which requires further validation.

                Background Technology has completely transformed healthcare, starting with X-ray machines and MRIs to telehealth and robotic surgeries to e-health records. The launch of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) serves as a milestone in medical history, offering benefits such as smaller incisions, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery, making it a preferred surgical option. This study mainly explores patients’ willingness to adopt robot-assisted surgery (RAS) technology in a surgical intervention and is assessed in the backdrop of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Methods This research project employs a post-positivist research philosophy and a cross-sectional research design. A structured, pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect data from 280 respondents. Results The results revealed that trust had a significant impact on Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.099) and Perceived Ease of Use (β = .157), and eHealth literacy had a significant impact on Perceived Ease of Use (β = 0.438) and Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.454). Additionally, Perceived Usefulness partially influenced behavioral intention (β = 0.123), and attitude had a significant influence on behavioral intention (β = 0.612). The analysis revealed an insignificant impact of eHealth literacy on Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.067). The Standard Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) value was <0.8. Mediation analysis also revealed partial mediation between the constructs. The SRMR rating of this model is 0.067, indicating that it fits the data well. Conclusion This study revealed that a patient's intention will be high if he or she believes that RAS is beneficial in treating his or her ailment. In comparison, information related to RAS is clearly known, and it does not directly affect selection intention. eHealth literacy is a significant antecedent to patients’ behavioral intention. Hence, the healthcare industry must devise strategies to promote the acceptance of RAS at all levels.

                Background In Sierra Leone, the National Emergency Medical Services (NEMS) was designed to facilitate maternal and under-five referrals. During the COVID-19 pandemic, health facilities were repurposed and mobility restrictions were introduced, and this might have negatively influenced access to care. Thus, we compared utilization, timeliness and outcomes of referrals between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods. Methods This was a cohort study using routinely collected data by the NEMS. There were 65 weeks in the pre-COVID-19 period (week one of January 2019 to week three of March 2020) and 91 weeks in the COVID-19 period (week four of March 2020 to week four of December 2021). We compared weekly referrals and the duration from initiating the NEMS for a referral to the patient reaching the receiving facility (prehospital delay) using the Mann–Whitney U test. Chi-squared tests were used to compare the mode of transportation and referral outcomes. Results Compared to the pre-COVID-19 period, there was significant decrease during the COVID-19 period in the median number of weekly maternal referrals (277 to 205), under-five referrals (177 to 104) and transfers on NEMS ambulances (348 to 269). The prehospital delays increased during the COVID-19 period for both maternal (72 to 86 minutes) and under-five (75 to 90 minutes) referrals (p<0.001). The percentage of NEMS ambulance transfers for maternal referrals was similar in both periods (90%), but for under-five referrals this decreased between the pre-COVID-19 (72%) and COVID-19 (68%) periods. In both periods, maternal (98%) and under-five (96%) referrals were successfully admitted to the receiving facilities. Conclusions The performance of the NEMS system in terms of referrals reaching the receiving health facilities was maintained during the pandemic. However, there is a need to sustain the current performance of the NEMS system while making more efforts to increase utilization and reduce delays during outbreaks/pandemics.

                Richter’s hernia is a rare type of abdominal wall hernia characterized by high morbidity and mortality. It occurs when the anti-mesenteric border of the bowel is partially trapped in a tight hernial ring. The femoral ring is the most common site, with the ileum being the most frequently involved intestinal segment. However, the advent of laparoscopic surgery has introduced another potential site for Richter’s hernia formation. In our region, this pathological entity is exceptionally diagnosed due to limited access to abdominal imaging and delayed management. Additionally, the wide variety of clinical manifestations resulting from incomplete intestinal obstruction makes it particularly difficult to diagnose. Consequently, it is usually identified during surgery. We present here the case of two adult patients (a 33-yeairs-old woman and a 59-year-old man), the first with a history of surgical procedures and the second with a spontaneously reducible painless inguinal swelling. They were transferred to the surgical emergency department for an acute abdomen with abdominal distension and cessation of matter and gas. Clinical and paraclinical examinations (including hydroaeric level on abdominal X-ray) indicated mechanical intestinal obstruction. Emergency laparotomy, necessitated by the unavailability of abdominal computed tomography due to financial constraints, confirmed the diagnosis of Richter's hernia, with the first case located in the right inguinal region and the second in the linea alba. Surgical management involved reduction of the hernia contents and suture repair in both cases. Despite requiring bowel resection in the second patient, the postoperative course was straightforward. These two rare cases highlight that emergency exploratory laparotomy is the cornerstone of Richter hernia management in resource-limited conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-701/v1?src=rss">A systematic review on Artificial Intelligence applied to predictive cardiovascular risk analysis in liver transplantation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Liver transplantation is the ultimate therapeutic option for patients with end-stage liver disease. The clinical management of transplant patients significantly impacts their prognosis, with outcomes influenced by multiple interacting variables. Cardiovascular complications count as a leading cause of both short-term and long-term morbidity and mortality in liver transplant recipients. In this respect, accurate risk assessment and stratification are crucial for optimizing clinical outcomes. Modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have significant potential for early risk prediction, providing comprehensive risk assessments in both diagnosed cohorts and early clinical phase patients. This systematic review examines the state of the art in AI applications for predicting cardiovascular risks in liver transplantation, identifying current issues, challenges, and future research directions. We reviewed articles from digital repositories such as PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect published between 2000 and 2023, using keywords including artificial intelligence, machine learning, cardiovascular, and liver transplantation. Our analysis revealed a diverse range of machine learning algorithms used in this domain. Despite the potential, only 12 papers met the criteria for adequate topic coverage, highlighting a scarcity of research at this intersection. Key challenges include integrating diverse datasets, isolating cardiovascular effects amid multifaceted influences, ensuring data quality and quantity, and the issues to extrapolate machine learning models to day-to-day clinical practice. Nevertheless, leveraging AI for risk prediction in liver transplantation could significantly enhance patient management and resource optimization, indicating a shift towards more personalized and effective medical practices.

                Background Statistical process control (SPC) is utiled in manufacturing and service applications. It is used to monitor the behavior of the process, also to discover and solve the issues in internal systems. SPC allows immediate corrective actions to prevent defects and maintain process stability. There are two types of control charts are available in the literature: variable control charts and attribute control charts. Methods The use of attribute control charts for two positively skewed distributions such as power function distribution and weighted power function distribution is discussed in this research paper. We compared the behavior of both types of control charts and presented the results in form of tables. Results We conclude that control charts under a weighted power function distribution perform better than control charts using a power function distribution. Furthermore, these results will help in the early detection of errors that enhance the process reliability of the telecommunications and financing industries.

                Background Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is an effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Automatic positive airway pressure (APAP) at home might be an alternative choice to identify optimal treatment pressure for OSA patients requiring CPAP treatment. Data on the association of effective treatment pressure between laboratory polysomnography (in-lab PSG) and home APAP has been limited. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation of effective CPAP pressure between in-lab PSG and home APAP. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted. OSA participants aged 18 years or older who required CPAP therapy were included. Patients underwent in-lab PSG with manual CPAP titration to identify an effective treatment pressure. Patients also underwent APAP at home for 2 weeks to identify 95 percentile treatment pressure as an effective pressure. Results Fifty OSA patients (82% male) were included. Mean age was 48.9±14.6 years. Body mass index was 28.7±6.1 kg/m2. Polysomnographic data showed the effective treatment pressure of 10.4±2.9 cmH2O and the apnea-hypopnea index was 55.1±29.0 events/hour. Severe OSA was 76%. Home APAP data showed effective treatment pressure of 10.8±1.8 cmH2O. There was positive correlation of effective pressure between home APAP and in-lab PSG (r=0.472, P=0.001). The equation for predicting an in-lab effective pressure was: predicted pressure (cmH2O) = 2 + (home APAP ⁎ 0.78). Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement between them, with a low mean difference of -0.428 cmH2O and 96% within the limit of agreement. Conclusions Home APAP pressure is moderately positively correlated with in-lab PSG effective pressure. The accuracy of home APAP is in agreement with in-lab PSG with manual CPAP titration. This APAP might be able to determine an effective therapeutic pressure in the sleep laboratory for OSA treatment.

                Background Sexual violence is prevalent in higher education institutions in Nigeria and stakeholders have encouraged staff and students to blow the whistle whenever they fall victim to or are aware of any sexual violence case. However, there is lack of data about whether the staff and students of these institutions have the intention to blow the whistle internally (within the institution) or not. There is also a lack of data on the existing reporting mechanisms or preferred whistleblowing mechanisms in these institutions. These have hindered the analysis of stakeholders’ opinions on this topic. Methods This data note presents a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative data set collected from staff and students of three categories of government owned higher education institutions (Universities, Polytechnics, Colleges of Education) in Nigeria. Data collection was between February and December, 2021, during which quantitative data were collected from 21,937 students and 3,108 staff. Qualitatively, 138 students and 111 staff participated in a total of 35 focus group discussion sessions. The study provides unique information on respondents’ attitude, self-efficacy, and subjective norm to sexual violence whistleblowing. It also provides information on self-reported sexual violence experiences, whistleblowing intention, reporting systems in higher institutions and the preferred sexual violence whistleblowing mechanisms. Conclusions In this data note, we provide a detailed account of the variables in the dataset and then highlight the potential of this study to contribute to improved sexual violence reporting in higher education institutions, thereby reducing the occurrence of the social menace.

                Background Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness characterized by psychosis, apathy, social withdrawal, and cognitive impairment, which results in impaired functioning in work, school, parenting, self-care, independent living, interpersonal relationships, and leisure time. Method A systematic search was conducted using Arksey and O’Malley’s framework with studies published on leisure-based intervention from January 1990 to December 2023. Results The review included 11 articles in the study. In total two studies were pilot interventional study, one randomized controlled study, one case-control, one retrospective study, three were cross sectional, one was cross sectional longitudinal study and two were qualitative in nature. Studies used different types of leisure activities like cooking group, discussions, board games, arts and craft, painting, beading, sewing, clay work, paper craft, etc were used as an intervention. Qualitative studies found that individuals with schizophrenia spent less time in social and leisure activities and more time relaxing and doing nothing. Conclusion The study highlights the need to conduct further research on leisure-based interventions using various study designs like randomized controlled trials and mixed methods to understand its effectiveness among individuals with schizophrenia.

                Background: Ludwig's angina is a potentially life-threatening disease characterized by diffuse bilateral cellulitis with an odontogenic origin. This unique infection is now rare owing to the antibiotic era. Case: This patient presented to the emergency room with trismus, jaw and neck swelling, mild respiratory distress with tachypnea, hyperthermia, and panic. Clinical examination and radiographic evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of Ludwig's angina. As it is a quickly spreading infection, the patient was taken up for immediate surgical decompression leading to pus drainage, removal of the offending tooth, bacterial culture and sensitivity, and administration of empirical antibiotics. As we had operated promptly, there was no need for emergency airway intervention, and the patient had immediate relief from airway distress. Conclusions: Early accurate diagnosis with conservative surgical decompression, thereby negating the need for airway intervention, was vital to avoiding mortality which is always possible in such an expeditious infection.

                Background For more than 150 years, dental amalgam (DA) has been popular as a dental restorative material. Many organizations oppose its use due to perceived toxicity and environmental concerns. Hence, this study aimed to explore the continued use of DA from a South Indian dental practitioners’ perspective. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among fifty-two private and public dental practitioners of Udupi district in Southern India. A self‑administered questionnaire was distributed, that involved assessment of their preferences, continuation of use and concerns of using DA as a restorative material. The percentage contribution of each variable was calculated. Preferences for continuation of use of silver amalgam based upon the age, experience and mercury toxicity as a risk factor were analyzed using Students-t test and Fisher’s Exact Test test. Results Most dentists were satisfied (87%) with the results of the DA, found minimal failures (96%) and found DA more economical (89%). More than half (54%) of the participants reported that they would not continue the use of DA owing to mercury toxicity and environmental concerns. Dentists with higher age and longer clinical experience preferred continuation of DA. Conclusions Despite satisfaction with DA for its minimal failure, longevity and affordability, the authors found that most practitioners did not prefer its continued usage. This highlights their concerns over mercury toxicity and soft tissue lesions and accentuates their community social responsibility. There is also an urgent need to educate dentists on mercury hygiene, mercury waste management and disposal.

                Background Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the head and neck pose a challenge in their management due to their local aggressiveness and high recurrence risk. This study aimed to analyze literature on head and neck AVM recurrence post-treatment and identify the most effective strategy with a lower recurrence rate. Objectives To analyse existing literature on the recurrence of head and neck AVMs following treatment. Our goal was to identify the most effective treatment option with a lower recurrence rate. Methods We conducted a thorough literature search using PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus, from year 2000 to the present. Our analysis focused on key endpoints, specifically the recurrence rates of head and neck AVMs following various treatment approaches. Results Out of the initial pool of 108 screened articles, a total of 83 patients were deemed suitable for inclusion in the literature review. The reviewed articles demonstrated that appropriate diagnostic tests were documented in 95% of the included studies. Among the patients, 37.3% had previously undergone interventions and were currently dealing with regrowth masses. Notably, 56.6% of patients underwent a combined approach involving both endovascular and surgical methods, while 25.3% opted for a surgical-only approach, and only 18.1% pursued an endovascular-only approach. The studies showed a promising curing rate of AVMs, with a success rate of 94%, albeit with a complication rate of 32.5%. The average follow-up duration for all patients was 26 months, with a standard deviation of 20.5 months. Out of the 83 patients, 5 experienced recurrence, with single-modality approach. Interestingly, no patients who received a multi-modality of treatments experienced recurrence or regrowth of the AVM mass within the follow up period. Conclusion The multi-modality approach outperformed single-modality treatments in preventing AVM recurrence. These findings highlight the importance of a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach in the management of these complex vascular anomalies.

                Changes in pupil size offer a rich, continuous, and integrated neurophysiological readout of attention and cognition. I here briefly reintroduce examples of a vast, forgotten literature, full of inspiring ideas, which described attentional modulations of pupil size decades earlier than often assumed. I outline parallels between these early studies and recent developments in pupillometry.

                Hirsch et al. subjected primary human CD8 T cells to IRF4 overexpression or knockout and assessed T cell functions and the transcriptome. The TCR-induced transcription factor IRF4 promotes proliferation and PD-1 expression but hampers effector functions and expression of NF-κB-regulated genes. They also compared CD8 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to activated T cells in patients with COVID-19.

                Nishizawa et al. discover that the transcription factor BACH1 induces ferroptosis and suppresses cellular senescence in surrounding cells by secreting FGF21 from ferroptotic cells. Additionally, they find that BACH1-induced ferroptotic FGF21 secretion contributes to obesity suppression and longevity in vivo.

                Liu et al. find a mechanism deployed by cells to respond to ER stress. The unfolded protein response (UPR) selectively down-regulates a subunit of the signal recognition particle, SRP14. This causes a decrease of protein translocation into the ER lumen, thus reducing ER burden to alleviate cellular stress.

                Cellular stress may contribute to neurodegeneration. Huang et al. demonstrate that stress-induced nuclear condensation of the neurodegeneration-linked TDP-43 protein causes its transient inactivation and loss of function in splicing. Although these changes are reversible, some TDP-43 splicing targets, e.g., STMN2, recover slowly, rendering them prone to misregulation under chronic stress.

	<p>Dyslexia is a common learning disorder that hinders reading fluency and comprehension. Traditional treatments can be tedious for children, limiting their effectiveness. This study investigated the one-year effects of rehabilitation treatment with a virtual reality rehabilitation system (VRRS) on children with dyslexia. Twenty-four children were divided into control (CG) and experimental (EG) groups. The CG underwent conventional neuropsychological treatment (CNT), while the EG underwent VR neurorehabilitation training (VRNT) using the VRRS. Neuropsychological evaluation was conducted before treatment, after six months, and again after one year for both groups. Compared to the control group, children who received VR training showed significant improvement in reading skills, especially in non-word reading and reading speed, even after one year without further VR intervention. VRRS can improve treatment adherence and minimize symptoms by offering engaging activities for children. These findings suggest VRRS may be a valuable tool for dyslexia rehabilitation with long-lasting effects.</p>

	<p>Sleep and brain/cognitive/neural reserve significantly impact well-being and cognition throughout life. This review aims to explore the intricate relationship between such factors, with reference to their effects on human cognitive functions. The specific goal is to understand the bidirectional influence that sleep and reserve exert on each other. Up to 6 February 2024, a methodical search of the literature was conducted using the PubMed database with terms related to brain, cognitive or neural reserve, and healthy or disturbed sleep. Based on the inclusion criteria, 11 articles were selected and analyzed for this review. The articles focus almost exclusively on cognitive reserve, with no explicit connection between sleep and brain or neural reserve. The results evidence sleep&amp;amp;rsquo;s role as a builder of cognitive reserve and cognitive reserve&amp;amp;rsquo;s role as a moderator in the effects of physiological and pathological sleep on cognitive functions. In conclusion, the findings of the present review support the notion that both sleep and cognitive reserve are critical factors in cognitive functioning. Deepening comprehension of the interactions between them is essential for devising strategies to enhance brain health and resilience against age- and pathology-related conditions.</p>

	<p>Somatosensory tactile experience is a key aspect of our interaction with the environment. It is involved in object manipulation, in the planning and control of actions and, in its affective components, in the relationships with other individuals. It is also a foundational component of body awareness. An intriguing aspect of sensory perception in general and tactile perception in particular is the way in which stimulation comes to consciousness. Indeed, although being aware of something seems a rather self-evident and monolithic aspect of our mental states, sensory awareness may be in fact modulated by many different processes that impact on the mere stimulation of the skin, including the way in which we perceive our bodies as belonging to us. In this review, we first took into consideration the pathological conditions of absence of phenomenal experience of touch, in the presence of implicit processing, as initial models for understanding the neural bases of conscious tactile experience. Subsequently, we discussed cases of tactile illusions both in normal subjects and in brain-damaged patients which help to understand which high-order processes impact tactile awareness. Finally, we discussed the observations reported in the review in light of some influential models of touch and body representation.</p>

	<p>Background: Specific phobias impact over 400 million people worldwide. Digitalizing mental health could alleviate the burden. Still, although the corporate-driven Metaverse is expanding rapidly, there needs to be more momentum in harnessing virtual reality exposure therapy uptake. Objective: This study aims to conceptualize, develop, and deploy a free Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) application specifically designed for treating acrophobia and claustrophobia. This pilot study, which holds the promise of a future where mental health is more accessible and effective, explores the feasibility of leveraging transdisciplinary collaboration among specialists to create a safe, accessible, and effective VRET solution. Methods: We conducted a Delphi heuristic approach involving bioethicists, neuroscientists, and tech developers. Second, we reviewed the existing psychological theories and therapeutic strategies for addressing phobias in VR. Third, we conceptualized a thematic analysis-derived framework for a safe, adaptive-gamified free exposure to virtual reality acrophobia and claustrophobia (SAFEvR ACT). Finally, we provide an overview of the iterative improvements made during 12 workshops and 76 weekly briefings on developmental implementations. Results: We developed the SAFEvR ACT into a proof-of-concept application freely deployed on the MentalVerse app platform. Our safety-focused approach can benefit from prevalidation perspectives within future randomized control trials. Conclusions: The resulting application derived from the SAFEvR ACT framework represents a blueprint to counter the current lack of iVR mental health uptake by offering a free VRET alternative. Future research should aim towards developing similar free platforms to lessen mental health burdens and gather quantitative data. We conclude with a call to action to researchers to fine-tune our current approach and take a stand for free digital mental health within MentalVeRse.app.</p>

	<p>Individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a transitional stage between cognitively healthy aging and dementia, are characterized by subtle neurocognitive changes. Clinically, they can be grouped into two main variants, namely patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) and non-amnestic MCI (naMCI). The distinction of the two variants is known to be clinically significant as they exhibit different progression rates to dementia. However, it has been particularly challenging to classify the two variants robustly. Recent research indicates that linguistic changes may manifest as one of the early indicators of pathology. Therefore, we focused on MCI&amp;amp;rsquo;s discourse-level writing samples in this study. We hypothesized that a written picture description task can provide information that can be used as an ecological, cost-effective classification system between the two variants. We included one hundred sixty-nine individuals diagnosed with either aMCI or naMCI who received neurophysiological evaluations in addition to a short, written picture description task. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a BERT pre-trained language model were utilized to analyze the writing samples. We showed that the written picture description task provided 90% overall classification accuracy for the best classification models, which performed better than cognitive measures. Written discourses analyzed by AI models can automatically assess individuals with aMCI and naMCI and facilitate diagnosis, prognosis, therapy planning, and evaluation.</p>

	<p>Spinal cord epidural electrical stimulation (EES) has been successfully employed to treat chronic pain and to restore lost functions after spinal cord injury. Yet, the efficacy of this approach is largely challenged by the suboptimal spatial distribution of the electrode contacts across anatomical targets, limiting the spatial selectivity of stimulation. In this study, we exploited different ESS paradigms, designed as either Spatial-Selective Stimulation (SSES) or Orientation-Selective Epidural Stimulation (OSES), and compared them to Conventional Monopolar Epidural Stimulation (CMES). SSES, OSES, and CMES were delivered with a 3- or 4-contact electrode array. Amplitudes and latencies of the Spinally Evoked Motor Potentials (SEMPs) were evaluated with different EES modalities. The results demonstrate that the amplitudes of SEMPs in hindlimb muscles depend on the orientation of the electrical field and vary between stimulation modalities. These findings show that the electric field applied with SSES or OSES provides more selective control of amplitudes of the SEMPs as compared to CMES. We demonstrate that spinal cord epidural stimulation applied with SSES or OSES paradigms in the rodent model could be tailored to the functional spinal cord neuroanatomy and can be tuned to specific target fibers and their orientation, optimizing the effect of neuromodulation.</p>

	<p>Gene expression alterations in postmortem schizophrenia tissue are well-documented and are influenced by genetic, medication, and epigenetic factors. The Wingless/Integrated (WNT) signaling pathway, critical for cell growth and development, is involved in various cellular processes including neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity. Despite its importance, WNT signaling remains understudied in schizophrenia, a disorder characterized by metabolic and bioenergetic defects in cortical regions. In this study, we examined the gene expression of 10 key WNT signaling pathway transcripts: IQGAP1, CTNN&amp;amp;beta;1, GSK3&amp;amp;beta;, FOXO1, LRP6, MGEA5, TCF4, &amp;amp;beta;TRC, PPP1C&amp;amp;beta;, and DVL2 in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) using postmortem tissue from schizophrenia subjects (n = 20, 10 males, 10 females) compared to age, pH, and postmortem interval (PMI)-matched controls (n = 20, 10 males, 10 females). Employing the R-shiny application Kaleidoscope, we conducted in silico &amp;amp;ldquo;lookup&amp;amp;rdquo; studies from published transcriptomic datasets to examine cell- and region-level expression of these WNT genes. In addition, we investigated the impact of antipsychotics on the mRNA expression of the WNT genes of interest in rodent brain transcriptomic datasets. Our findings revealed no significant changes in region-level WNT transcript expression; however, analyses of previously published cell-level datasets indicated alterations in WNT transcript expression and antipsychotic-specific modulation of certain genes. These results suggest that WNT signaling transcripts may be variably expressed at the cellular level and influenced by antipsychotic treatment, providing novel insights into the role of WNT signaling in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.</p>

	<p>The central nervous system (CNS) exhibits remarkable adaptability throughout life, enabled by intricate interactions between neurons and glial cells, in particular, oligodendrocytes (OLs) and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). This adaptability is pivotal for learning and memory, with OLs and OPCs playing a crucial role in neural circuit development, synaptic modulation, and myelination dynamics. Myelination by OLs not only supports axonal conduction but also undergoes adaptive modifications in response to neuronal activity, which is vital for cognitive processing and memory functions. This review discusses how these cellular interactions and myelin dynamics are implicated in various neurocircuit diseases and disorders such as epilepsy, gliomas, and psychiatric conditions, focusing on how maladaptive changes contribute to disease pathology and influence clinical outcomes. It also covers the potential for new diagnostics and therapeutic approaches, including pharmacological strategies and emerging biomarkers in oligodendrocyte functions and myelination processes. The evidence supports a fundamental role for myelin plasticity and oligodendrocyte functionality in synchronizing neural activity and high-level cognitive functions, offering promising avenues for targeted interventions in CNS disorders.</p>

	<p>In this study, we investigated the cognitive mechanisms underlying action anticipation in volleyball players, especially concerned with the differences between experts and amateurs. Participants included both expert (male, N = 26) and amateur (male, N = 23) volleyball players, who were asked to predict spiking movements containing high, medium, and low levels of kinematic information while their electrophysiological activities were recorded. The high-information stimuli included the whole spiking action, the medium-information stimuli ended at 120 ms, and the low-information stimuli ended at 160 ms before hand&amp;amp;ndash;ball contact. The results showed that experts significantly outperformed amateurs in both prediction accuracy (68% in experts vs. 55% in amateurs) and reaction time (475.09 ms in experts vs. 725.81 ms in amateurs) under the medium-information condition. Analysis of alpha rhythm activity revealed that experts exhibited the strongest desynchronization under the low-information condition, suggesting increased attentional engagement. In contrast, amateurs showed the weakest desynchronization under the medium-information condition. Furthermore, mu rhythm activity analysis showed greater desynchronization in the duration of 100&amp;amp;ndash;300 ms before hand&amp;amp;ndash;ball contact for experts, correlating with their higher anticipation accuracy. These findings highlight the significant kinematic information-processing abilities of volleyball experts and elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying efficient attentional engagement and mirroring. Therefore, this study provides valuable insights for the development of targeted training programs through which to enhance athletic performance.</p>

	<p>The insular cortex, a critical hub in the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s sensory, cognitive, and emotional networks, remains an intriguing subject of study. In this article, we discuss its intricate functional neuroanatomy, emphasizing its pivotal role in processing olfactory information. Through concise exploration, we delve into the insula&amp;amp;rsquo;s diverse connectivity and its involvement in sensory integration, particularly in olfaction. Stimulation studies in humans reveal compelling insights into the insula&amp;amp;rsquo;s contribution to the perception of smell, hinting at its broader implications for cognitive processing. Additionally, we explore an avenue of research in which studying olfactory processing via insular stimulation could unravel higher-level cognitive processes. This innovative approach could help give a fresh perspective on the interplay between sensory and cognitive domains, offering valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying cognition and emotion. In conclusion, future research efforts should emphasize a multidisciplinary approach, combining advanced imaging and surgical techniques to explore the intricate functions of the human insula. Moreover, awake craniotomies could offer a unique opportunity for real-time observation, shedding light on its neural circuitry and contributions to higher-order brain functions. Furthermore, olfaction&amp;amp;rsquo;s direct cortical projection enables precise exploration of insular function, promising insights into cognitive and emotional processes. This multifaceted approach will deepen our understanding of the insular cortex and its significance in human cognition and emotion.</p>

	<p>Introduction: The integration of augmented reality (AR) in spine surgery marks a significant advancement, enhancing surgical precision and patient outcomes. AR provides immersive, three-dimensional visualizations of anatomical structures, facilitating meticulous planning and execution of spine surgeries. This technology not only improves spatial understanding and real-time navigation during procedures but also aims to reduce surgical invasiveness and operative times. Despite its potential, challenges such as model accuracy, user interface design, and the learning curve for new technology must be addressed. AR&amp;amp;rsquo;s application extends beyond the operating room, offering valuable tools for medical education and improving patient communication and satisfaction. Material and methods: A literature review was conducted by searching PubMed and Scopus databases using keywords related to augmented reality in spine surgery, covering publications from January 2020 to January 2024. Results: In total, 319 articles were identified through the initial search of the databases. After screening titles and abstracts, 11 articles in total were included in the qualitative synthesis. Conclusion: Augmented reality (AR) is becoming a transformative force in spine surgery, enhancing precision, education, and outcomes despite hurdles like technical limitations and integration challenges. AR&amp;amp;rsquo;s immersive visualizations and educational innovations, coupled with its potential synergy with AI and machine learning, indicate a bright future for surgical care. Despite the existing obstacles, AR&amp;amp;rsquo;s impact on improving surgical accuracy and safety marks a significant leap forward in patient treatment and care.</p>

                <p>Sleep disruption and impaired synaptic processes are common features in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hyperphosphorylated Tau is known to accumulate at neuronal synapses in AD, contributing to synapse dysfunction. However, it remains unclear how sleep disruption and synapse pathology interact to contribute to cognitive decline. Here, we examined sex-specific onset and consequences of sleep loss in AD/tauopathy model PS19 mice. Using a piezoelectric home-cage monitoring system, we showed PS19 mice exhibited early-onset and progressive hyperarousal, a selective dark-phase sleep disruption, apparent at 3 months in females and 6 months in males. Using the Morris water maze test, we report that chronic sleep disruption (CSD) accelerated the onset of decline of hippocampal spatial memory in PS19 males only. Hyperarousal occurs well in advance of robust forebrain synaptic Tau burden that becomes apparent at 6&ndash;9 months. To determine whether a causal link exists between sleep disruption and synaptic Tau hyperphosphorylation, we examined the correlation between sleep behavior and synaptic Tau, or exposed mice to acute or chronic sleep disruption at 6 months. While we confirm that sleep disruption is a driver of Tau hyperphosphorylation in neurons of the locus ceruleus, we were unable to show any causal link between sleep loss and Tau burden in forebrain synapses. Despite the finding that hyperarousal appears earlier in females, female cognition was resilient to the effects of sleep disruption. We conclude sleep disruption interacts with the synaptic Tau burden to accelerate the onset of cognitive decline with greater vulnerability in males.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/26/e0050242024?rss=1">Differential Activation States of Direct Pathway Striatal Output Neurons during L-DOPA-Induced Dyskinesia Development</a></h4>

              
                <p><scp>l</scp>-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) is a debilitating motor side effect arising from chronic dopamine (DA) replacement therapy with <scp>l</scp>-DOPA for the treatment of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. LID is associated with supersensitivity of striatal dopaminergic signaling and fluctuations in synaptic DA following each <scp>l</scp>-DOPA dose, shrinking the therapeutic window. The heterogeneous composition of the striatum, including subpopulations of medium spiny output neurons (MSNs), interneurons, and supporting cells, complicates the identification of cell(s) underlying LID. We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to establish a comprehensive striatal transcriptional profile during LID development. Male hemiparkinsonian mice were treated with vehicle or <scp>l</scp>-DOPA for 1, 5, or 10&nbsp;d, and striatal nuclei were processed for snRNA-seq. Analyses indicated a limited population of DA D1 receptor&ndash;expressing MSNs (D1-MSNs) formed three subclusters in response to <scp>l</scp>-DOPA treatment and expressed cellular markers of activation. These activated D1-MSNs display similar transcriptional changes previously associated with LID; however, their prevalence and transcriptional behavior were differentially influenced by <scp>l</scp>-DOPA experience. Differentially expressed genes indicated acute upregulation of plasticity-related transcription factors and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, while repeated <scp>l</scp>-DOPA-induced synaptic remodeling, learning and memory, and transforming growth factor-&beta; (TGF-&beta;) signaling genes. Notably, repeated <scp>l</scp>-DOPA sensitized <I>Inhba</I>, an activin subunit of the TGF-&beta; superfamily, in activated D1-MSNs, and its pharmacological inhibition impaired LID development, suggesting that activin signaling may play an essential role in LID. These data suggest distinct subsets of D1-MSNs become differentially <scp>l</scp>-DOPA-responsive due to aberrant induction of molecular mechanisms necessary for neuronal entrainment, similar to processes underlying hippocampal learning and memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/26/e0240242024?rss=1">Striatal Dopamine Contributions to Skilled Motor Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Coordinated multijoint limb and digit movements&mdash;"manual dexterity"&mdash;underlie both specialized skills (e.g., playing the piano) and more mundane tasks (e.g., tying shoelaces). Impairments in dexterous skill cause significant disability, as occurs with motor cortical injury, Parkinson's disease, and a range of other pathologies. Clinical observations, as well as basic investigations, suggest that corticostriatal circuits play a critical role in learning and performing dexterous skills. Furthermore, dopaminergic signaling in these regions is implicated in synaptic plasticity and motor learning. Nonetheless, the role of striatal dopamine signaling in skilled motor learning remains poorly understood. Here, we use fiber photometry paired with a genetically encoded dopamine sensor to investigate striatal dopamine release in both male and female mice as they learn and perform a skilled reaching task. Dopamine rapidly increases during a skilled reach and peaks near pellet consumption. In the dorsolateral striatum, dopamine dynamics are faster than in the dorsomedial and ventral striatum. Across training, as reaching performance improves, dopamine signaling shifts from pellet consumption to cues that predict pellet availability, particularly in medial and ventral areas of the striatum. Furthermore, performance prediction errors are present across the striatum, with reduced dopamine release after an unsuccessful reach. These findings show that dopamine dynamics during skilled motor behaviors change with learning and are differentially regulated across striatal subregions.</p>

                <p>The striatum plays a central role in directing many complex behaviors ranging from motor control to action choice and reward learning. In our study, we used 55 male CFW mice with rapid decay linkage disequilibrium to systematically mine the striatum-related behavioral functional genes by analyzing their striatal transcriptomes and 79 measured behavioral phenotypic data. By constructing a gene coexpression network, we clustered the genes into 13 modules, with most of them being positively correlated with motor traits. Based on functional annotations as well as Fisher's exact and hypergeometric distribution tests, brown and magenta modules were identified as core modules. They were significantly enriched for striatal-related functional genes. Subsequent Mendelian randomization analysis verified the causal relationship between the core modules and dyskinesia. Through the intramodular gene connectivity analysis, <I>Adcy5</I> and <I>Kcnma1</I> were identified as brown and magenta module hub genes, respectively. Knock outs of both <I>Adcy5</I> and <I>Kcnma1</I> lead to motor dysfunction in mice, and <I>KCNMA1</I> acts as a risk gene for schizophrenia and smoking addiction in humans. We also evaluated the cellular composition of each module and identified oligodendrocytes in the striatum to have a positive role in motor regulation.</p>

                <p>Myelinated axons conduct action potentials, or spikes, in a saltatory manner. Inward current caused by a spike occurring at one node of Ranvier spreads axially to the next node, which regenerates the spike when depolarized enough for voltage-gated sodium channels to activate, and so on. The rate at which this process progresses dictates the velocity at which the spike is conducted and depends on several factors including axial resistivity and axon diameter that directly affect axial current. Here we show through computational simulations in modified double-cable axon models that conduction velocity also depends on extracellular factors whose effects can be explained by their indirect influence on axial current. Specifically, we show that a conventional double-cable model, with its outside layer connected to ground, transmits less axial current than a model whose outside layer is less absorptive. A more resistive barrier exists when an axon is packed tightly between other myelinated fibers, for example. We show that realistically resistive boundary conditions can significantly increase the velocity and energy efficiency of spike propagation, while also protecting against propagation failure. Certain factors like myelin thickness may be less important than typically thought if extracellular conditions are more resistive than normally considered. We also show how realistically resistive boundary conditions affect ephaptic interactions. Overall, these results highlight the unappreciated importance of extracellular conditions for axon function.</p>

                <p>The third trimester is a critical period for the development of functional networks that support the lifelong neurocognitive performance, yet the emergence of neuronal coupling in these networks is poorly understood. Here, we used longitudinal high-density electroencephalographic recordings from preterm infants during the period from 33 to 45&nbsp;weeks of conceptional age (CA) to characterize early spatiotemporal patterns in the development of local cortical function and the intrinsic coupling modes [ICMs; phase&ndash;phase (PPCs), amplitude&ndash;amplitude (AACs), and phase&ndash;amplitude correlations (PACs)]. Absolute local power showed a robust increase with CA across the full frequency spectrum, while local PACs showed sleep state-specific, biphasic development that peaked a few weeks before normal birth. AACs and distant PACs decreased globally at nearly all frequencies. In contrast, the PPCs showed frequency- and region-selective development, with an increase of coupling strength with CA between frontal, central, and occipital regions at low-delta and alpha frequencies together with a wider-spread decrease at other frequencies. Our findings together present the spectrally and spatially differential development of the distinct ICMs during the neonatal period and provide their developmental templates for future basic and clinical research.</p>

                <p>Humans make decisions about food every day. The visual system provides important information that forms a basis for these food decisions. Although previous research has focused on visual object and category representations in the brain, it is still unclear how visually presented food is encoded by the brain. Here, we investigate the time-course of food representations in the brain. We used time-resolved multivariate analyses of electroencephalography (EEG) data, obtained from human participants (both sexes), to determine which food features are represented in the brain and whether focused attention is needed for this. We recorded EEG while participants engaged in two different tasks. In one task, the stimuli were task relevant, whereas in the other task, the stimuli were not task relevant. Our findings indicate that the brain can differentiate between food and nonfood items from ~112&nbsp;ms after the stimulus onset. The neural signal at later latencies contained information about food naturalness, how much the food was transformed, as well as the perceived caloric content. This information was present regardless of the task. Information about whether food is immediately ready to eat, however, was only present when the food was task relevant and presented at a slow presentation rate. Furthermore, the recorded brain activity correlated with the behavioral responses in an odd-item-out task. The fast representation of these food features, along with the finding that this information is used to guide food categorization decision-making, suggests that these features are important dimensions along which the representation of foods is organized.</p>

                <p>Human experience is imbued by the sense of being an embodied agent. The investigation of such basic self-consciousness has been hampered by the difficulty of comprehensively modulating it in the laboratory while reliably capturing ensuing subjective changes. The present preregistered study fills this gap by combining advanced meditative states with principled phenomenological interviews: 46 long-term meditators (19 female, 27 male) were instructed to modulate and attenuate their embodied self-experience during magnetoencephalographic monitoring. Results showed frequency-specific (high-beta band) activity reductions in frontoparietal and posterior medial cortices (PMC). Importantly, PMC reductions were driven by a subgroup describing radical embodied self-disruptions, including suspension of agency and dissolution of a localized first-person perspective. Neural changes were correlated with lifetime meditation and interview-derived experiential changes, but not with classical self-reports. The results demonstrate the potential of integrating in-depth first&ndash;person methods into neuroscientific experiments. Furthermore, they highlight neural oscillations in the PMC as a central process supporting the embodied sense of self.</p>

                <p>MAGUK scaffold proteins play a central role in maintaining and modulating synaptic signaling, providing a framework to retain and position receptors, signaling molecules, and other synaptic components. In particular, the MAGUKs SAP102 and PSD-95 are essential for synaptic function at distinct developmental timepoints and perform both overlapping and unique roles. While their similar structures allow for common binding partners, SAP102 is expressed earlier in synapse development and is required for synaptogenesis, whereas PSD-95 expression peaks later and is associated with synapse maturation. PSD-95 and other key synaptic proteins organize into subsynaptic nanodomains that have a significant impact on synaptic transmission, but the nanoscale organization of SAP102 is unknown. How SAP102 is organized within the synapse, and how it relates spatially to PSD-95 on a nanometer scale, could underlie its unique functions and impact how SAP102 scaffolds synaptic proteins. Here we used DNA-PAINT super-resolution microscopy to measure SAP102 nano-organization and its spatial relationship to PSD-95 at individual synapses in mixed-sex rat cultured neurons. We found that like PSD-95, SAP102 accumulates in high-density subsynaptic nanoclusters (NCs). However, SAP102 NCs were smaller and denser than PSD-95 NCs across development. Additionally, only a subset of SAP102 NCs co-organized with PSD-95, revealing MAGUK nanodomains within individual synapses containing either one or both proteins. These MAGUK nanodomain types had distinct NC properties and were differentially enriched with the presynaptic release protein Munc13-1. This organization into both shared and distinct subsynaptic nanodomains may underlie the ability of SAP102 and PSD-95 to perform both common and unique synaptic functions.</p>

                <p>The periaqueductal gray (PAG) is a small midbrain structure that surrounds the cerebral aqueduct, regulates brain&ndash;body communication, and is often studied for its role in "fight-or-flight" and "freezing" responses to threat. We used ultra-high-field 7&nbsp;T fMRI to resolve the PAG in humans and distinguish it from the cerebral aqueduct, examining its in vivo function during a working memory task (<I>N</I> = 87). Both mild and moderate cognitive demands elicited spatially similar patterns of whole-brain blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response, and moderate cognitive demand elicited widespread BOLD increases above baseline in the brainstem. Notably, these brainstem increases were not significantly greater than those in the mild demand condition, suggesting that a subthreshold brainstem BOLD increase occurred for mild cognitive demand as well. Subject-specific masks were group aligned to examine PAG response. In PAG, both mild and moderate demands elicited a well-defined response in ventrolateral PAG, a region thought to be functionally related to anticipated painful threat in humans and nonhuman animals&mdash;yet, the present task posed only the most minimal (if any) "threat," with the cognitive tasks used being approximately as challenging as remembering a phone number. These findings suggest that the PAG may play a more general role in visceromotor regulation, even in the absence of threat.</p>

                <p>The N2pc and P3 event-related potentials (ERPs), used to index selective attention and access to working memory and conscious awareness, respectively, have been important tools in cognitive sciences. Although it is likely that these two components and the underlying cognitive processes are temporally and functionally linked, such links have not yet been convincingly demonstrated. Adopting a novel methodological approach based on dynamic time warping (DTW), we provide evidence that the N2pc and P3 ERP components are temporally linked. We analyzed data from an experiment where 23 participants (16 women) monitored bilateral rapid serial streams of letters and digits in order to report a target digit indicated by a shape cue, separately for trials with correct responses and trials where a temporally proximal distractor was reported instead (distractor intrusion). DTW analyses revealed that N2pc and P3 latencies were correlated in time, both when the target or a distractor was reported. Notably, this link was weaker on distractor intrusion trials. This N2pc&ndash;P3 association is discussed with respect to the relationship between attention and access consciousness. Our results demonstrate that our novel method provides a valuable approach for assessing temporal links between two cognitive processes and their underlying modulating factors. This method allows to establish links and their modulator for any two time-series across all domains of the field (general-purpose MATLAB functions and a Python module are provided alongside this paper).</p>

                <p>Aging is accompanied by a decline of working memory, an important cognitive capacity that involves stimulus-selective neural activity that persists after stimulus presentation. Here, we unraveled working memory dynamics in older human adults (male and female) including those diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using a combination of behavioral modeling, neuropsychological assessment, and MEG recordings of brain activity. Younger adults (male and female) were studied with behavioral modeling only. Participants performed a visuospatial delayed match-to-sample task under systematic manipulation of the delay and distance between sample and test stimuli. Their behavior (match/nonmatch decisions) was fit with a computational model permitting the dissociation of noise in the internal operations underlying the working memory performance from a strategic decision threshold. Task accuracy decreased with delay duration and sample/test proximity. When sample/test distances were small, older adults committed more false alarms than younger adults. The computational model explained the participants&rsquo; behavior well. The model parameters reflecting internal noise (not decision threshold) correlated with the precision of stimulus-selective cortical activity measured with MEG during the delay interval. The model uncovered an increase specifically in working memory noise in older compared with younger participants. Furthermore, in the MCI group, but not in the older healthy controls, internal noise correlated with the participants&rsquo; clinically assessed cognitive integrity. Our results are consistent with the idea that the stability of working memory contents deteriorates in aging, in a manner that is specifically linked to the overall cognitive integrity of individuals diagnosed with MCI.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/26/e2199232024?rss=1">Biophysics of Frequency-Dependent Variation in Paresthesia and Pain Relief during Spinal Cord Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>The neurophysiological effects of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for chronic pain are poorly understood, resulting in inefficient failure-prone programming protocols and inadequate pain relief. Nonetheless, novel stimulation patterns are regularly introduced and adopted clinically. Traditionally, paresthetic sensation is considered necessary for pain relief, although novel paradigms provide analgesia without paresthesia. However, like pain relief, the neurophysiological underpinnings of SCS-induced paresthesia are unknown. Here, we paired biophysical modeling with clinical paresthesia thresholds (of both sexes) to investigate how stimulation frequency affects the neural response to SCS relevant to paresthesia and analgesia. Specifically, we modeled the dorsal column (DC) axonal response, dorsal column nucleus (DCN) synaptic transmission, conduction failure within DC fiber collaterals, and dorsal horn network output. Importantly, we found that high-frequency stimulation reduces DC fiber activation thresholds, which in turn accurately predicts clinical paresthesia perception thresholds. Furthermore, we show that high-frequency SCS produces asynchronous DC fiber spiking and ultimately asynchronous DCN output, offering a plausible biophysical basis for why high-frequency SCS is less comfortable and produces qualitatively different sensation than low-frequency stimulation. Finally, we demonstrate that the model dorsal horn network output is sensitive to SCS-inherent variations in spike timing, which could contribute to heterogeneous pain relief across patients. Importantly, we show that model DC fiber collaterals cannot reliably follow high-frequency stimulation, strongly affecting the network output and typically producing antinociceptive effects at high frequencies. Altogether, these findings clarify how SCS affects the nervous system and provide insight into the biophysics of paresthesia generation and pain relief.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-695/v1?src=rss">Only severe Injuries are effectively reduced by muscles' injury prevention protocols in football players: A systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Muscle injuries are the most frequent in football and may lead to the end of a player’s career. Many studies have evaluated the effectiveness of prevention programs for all injury types. Few studies have evaluated the effects of exercise on muscle injuries. Methods A documentary search was conducted in October 2022 from three databases: Medline via its PubMed interface, Google Scholar, and COCHRANE databases. We only included original articles published between October 2012 and October 2022 with a high level of evidence. The research was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria. The target population consisted of professional and semi-professional footballers. The intervention in question was structured injury preventive protocols, including specific training or pre-established protocols such as the FIFA 11+ program, compared to each other or with regular training sessions. The main outcomes were the incidence rates of muscle injuries and severe injury in each group, as well as the time loss to injury. Results Seven randomized controlled trials with a high level of evidence confirmed using the PEDRO scale were included. There were 3815 male professional football players. There was heterogeneity in the age, hours of exposure, and duration of the intervention. The prevention protocols used were FIFA 11+, bounding exercises, NHE, and stretching exercises. Structured exercises significantly reduce the severity of muscle injury and, consequently, time loss to injury. Discussion Despite the diversity of prevention programs, teams still lack standardized programs. Structured exercises, such as FIFA 11+ and bounding exercises, which combine strengthening, body kinesthesic awareness, and neuromuscular control, reduce the incidence and severity of muscle injury. FIFA 11+ is the first and most complete structured program, but lacks some exercises, such as adductor strengthening. Conclusion This review showed the interest in structured exercises in reducing severity and time loss to injury in professional football players. Registration This review was registered on 8/17/2023 in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews under the reference code CRD42023452202.

                <p>by Chengwei Ai, Hongpeng Yang, Xiaoyi Liu, Ruihan Dong, Yijie Ding, Fei Guo</p>

De novo drug design is crucial in advancing drug discovery, which aims to generate new drugs with specific pharmacological properties. Recently, deep generative models have achieved inspiring progress in generating drug-like compounds. However, the models prioritize a single target drug generation for pharmacological intervention, neglecting the complicated inherent mechanisms of diseases, and influenced by multiple factors. Consequently, developing novel multi-target drugs that simultaneously target specific targets can enhance anti-tumor efficacy and address issues related to resistance mechanisms. To address this issue and inspired by Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) models, we propose an upgraded GPT model with generative adversarial imitation learning for multi-target molecular generation called MTMol-GPT. The multi-target molecular generator employs a dual discriminator model using the Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) method for a concurrently multi-target molecular generation. Extensive results show that MTMol-GPT generates various valid, novel, and effective multi-target molecules for various complex diseases, demonstrating robustness and generalization capability. In addition, molecular docking and pharmacophore mapping experiments demonstrate the drug-likeness properties and effectiveness of generated molecules potentially improve neuropsychiatric interventions. Furthermore, our model’s generalizability is exemplified by a case study focusing on the multi-targeted drug design for breast cancer. As a broadly applicable solution for multiple targets, MTMol-GPT provides new insight into future directions to enhance potential complex disease therapeutics by generating high-quality multi-target molecules in drug discovery.
