              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Measurement of speech in individuals with selective mutism: A systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The main characteristic of selective mutism (SM) is the failure to speak in specific social situations. Thus, assessing speech across social contexts is important for confirming a diagnosis of SM and for differentiating it from other disorders. The purpose of this review was to organize how the core symptom of SM, a lack of speech in specific social situations, has been assessed in previous studies. Methods: A systematic search of articles was conducted in three databases, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and PubMed and reviews of surveys or experimental studies that reported empirical data on individuals with SM were performed. We excluded review, qualitative, epidemiological, and intervention studies. The study summarized the diagnostic criteria, methods of confirming SM diagnosis, distinction of SM from other disorders, and methods of speech assessment. Results: A total of 447 articles were screened, where 60 articles were considered eligible. The results demonstrate that different interviews and questionnaires were used to establish the diagnosis of SM. However, the majority of interviews and questionnaires lacked validation. Only two (2/60) articles used validated methods of speech assessment to confirm SM diagnosis. Moreover, a consensus was lacking on the assessment method for differentiating SM from other disorders across studies. Specifically, 17 studies measured speech and are not intended for diagnosis. The majority of studies (16/17) used the questionnaire to assess the severity of the SM condition, and only one study conducted behavioral observation. Assessment methods based on the measurement of speech in real-life situations for individuals with SM were not established. Conclusion: We have the limitation that we did not review intervention studies. However, this systematic review revealed the problem that speech assessment methods for surveys or experimental studies of SM were not established. Future studies should establish methods of speech assessment across social situations to assess SM symptoms.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Interspecific variation in sex‚Äêspecific gustatory organs in Drosophila</a></h4>

     alt="Interspecific variation in sex-specific gustatory organs in Drosophila"/><p><i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is a popular model for investigating how sex-specific sensory information is translated into sex-specific behavior. To provide an evolutionary context for these studies, this report shows that different <i>Drosophila</i> species vary extensively in the presence, number, locations, and morphology of sex-specific gustatory bristles on their legs.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Drosophila</i> males use leg gustatory bristles to discriminate between male and female cuticular pheromones as an important part of courtship behavior. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, several male-specific gustatory bristles are present on the anterior surface of the first tarsal segment of the prothoracic leg, in addition to a larger set of gustatory bristles found in both sexes. These bristles are thought to be specialized for pheromone detection. Here, we report the number and location of sex-specific gustatory bristles in 27 other <i>Drosophila</i> species. Although some species have a pattern similar to <i>D. melanogaster</i>, others lack anterior male-specific bristles but have many dorsal male-specific gustatory bristles instead. Some species have both anterior and dorsal male-specific bristles, while others lack sexual dimorphism entirely. In several distantly related species, the number of gustatory bristles is much greater in males than in females due to a male-specific transformation of ancestrally mechanosensory bristles to a chemosensory identity. This variation in the extent and pattern of sexual dimorphism may affect the formation and function of neuronal circuits that control <i>Drosophila</i> courtship and contribute to the evolution of mating behavior.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Spider brain and central nervous system (CNS) have remained unexplored, due in part to the difficulty of observing these organs, usually only possible through histological preparations. Recently, internal anatomy studies have been supplemented by the inclusion of X- ray micro-CT. Unmineralized tissue such as the body of invertebrates requires a staining process to enhance tissue X-ray absorption and improve contrast during observation. Many current protocols are based on iodine staining requiring critical point drying (CPD) of the sample for optimal contrast. This process induces shrinking of the soft tissue generating artifacts in the morphology, volume, and even position of internal structures. Phosphotungstic acid (PTA) is an alternative staining agent recently used in marine invertebrate and plant studies. Here, we used several specimens of the common spider <i>Araneus diadematus</i> to visualize the spider brain and compare both contrast-enhancing ethanol-based solutions. We assessed a gradient of staining times, observed and tested the repercussions of CPD, and examined the use of vacuum to accelerate PTA diffusion. We show that PTA provides the best contrast on micro-CT scans in ethanol eliminating the need for CPD, and offering more realistic in situ visualizations of the internal organs. In combination with different scanning settings, PTA allowed observation of internal organs like the CNS, digestive system, muscles, and finer structures like the retina, visual nerves, and optic neuropiles. This fast and less invasive method could facilitate the proper documentation of the internal anatomy in the context of evolutionary, developmental and functional studies.</p>

     alt="Chemoarchitecture of area prostriata in adult and developing mice: Comparison with presubiculum and parasubiculum"/><p>The present study investigated the genoarchitecture of the mouse equivalent of area prostriata (Pro), which receives direct inputs from dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex (V1). In both adult and postnatal mice, many genes are expressed in layers 2‚Äì3 (e.g., Fstl1) or layer 5 (e.g., Lypd1) or both (not shown) of the prostriata, while some other genes are differentially expressed in the dorsal (e.g., Col5a1) and ventral (e.g., Cdh24) subdivisions of the prostriata. These gene expression patterns make the prostriata distinguishable from adjoining regions such as the postsubiculum and V1.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Retrosplenial area 29e, which was a cortical region described mostly in earlier rodent literature, is often included in the dorsal presubiculum (PrSd) or postsubiculum (PoS) in modern literature and commonly used brain atlases. Recent anatomical and molecular studies have revealed that retrosplenial area 29e belongs to the superficial layers of area prostriata, which in primates is found to be important in fast analysis of quickly moving objects in far peripheral visual field. As in primates, the prostriata in rodents adjoins area 29 (granular retrosplenial area), area 30 (agranular retrosplenial area), medial visual cortex, PrSd/PoS, parasubiculum (PaS), and postrhinal cortex (PoR). The present study aims to reveal the chemoarchitecture of the prostriata versus PrSd/PoS or PaS by means of a systematic survey of gene expression patterns in adult and developing mouse brains. First, we find many genes that display differential expression across the prostriata, PrSd/PoS, and PaS and that show obvious laminar expression patterns. Second, we reveal subsets of genes that selectively express in the dorsal or ventral parts of the prostriata, suggesting the existence of at least two subdivisions. Third, we detect some genes that shows differential expression in the prostriata of postnatal mouse brains from adjoining regions, thus enabling identification of the developing area prostriata. Fourth, gene expression difference of the prostriata from the medial primary visual cortex and PoR is also observed. Finally, molecular and connectional features of the prostriata in rodents and nonhuman primates are discussed and compared.</p>

     alt="A three-dimensional atlas of the honeybee central complex, associated neuropils and peptidergic layers of the central body"/><p>The central complex in the brain of insects is a highly conserved group of midline-spanning neuropils that houses the internal compass. It is responsible for goal-directed locomotion and involved in the regulation of sleep-wake cycles. Honeybees have been a model organism for sky-compass orientation for more than 70 years, but there is still very limited knowledge about the structure and function of their central complex. We created a high-resolution three-dimensional atlas of the honeybee central complex and associated neuropils, which includes layers defined by the distribution of neuropeptidergic immunoreactivity.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The central complex (CX) in the brain of insects is a highly conserved group of midline-spanning neuropils consisting of the upper and lower division of the central body, the protocerebral bridge, and the paired noduli. These neuropils are the substrate for a number of behaviors, most prominently goal-oriented locomotion. Honeybees have been a model organism for sky-compass orientation for more than 70 years, but there is still very limited knowledge about the structure and function of their CX. To advance and facilitate research on this brain area, we created a high-resolution three-dimensional atlas of the honeybee's CX and associated neuropils, including the posterior optic tubercles, the bulbs, and the anterior optic tubercles. To this end, we developed a modified version of the iterative shape averaging technique, which allowed us to achieve high volumetric accuracy of the neuropil models. For a finer definition of spatial locations within the central body, we defined layers based on immunostaining against the neuropeptides locustatachykinin, FMRFamide, gastrin/cholecystokinin, and allatostatin and included them into the atlas by elastic registration. Our honeybee CX atlas provides a platform for future neuroanatomical work.</p>

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>It is becoming increasingly clear that robust sex differences exist in the processing of acute and chronic pain in both rodents and humans. However, the underlying mechanism has not been well characterized. The dorsal horn of the lumbar spinal cord is the fundamental building block of ascending and descending pain pathways. It has been shown that numerous neurotransmitter and neuromodulator systems in the spinal cord, including the endocannabinoid system and its main receptor, the cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>R), play vital roles in processing nociceptive information. Our previous findings have shown that <i>CB<sub>1</sub>R</i> mRNA is widely expressed in the brain in sex-dependent patterns. However, the sex-, lamina-, and cell-type-specific characteristics of CB<sub>1</sub>R expression in the spinal cord have not been fully described. In this study, the <i>CB<sub>1</sub>R-iCre-EGFP</i> mouse strain was generated to label and identify CB<sub>1</sub>R-positive (CB<sub>1</sub>R<sup>GFP</sup>) cells. We reported no sex difference in CB<sub>1</sub>R expression in the lumbar dorsal horn of the spinal cord, but a dynamic distribution within superficial laminae II and III in female mice between estrus and nonestrus phases. Furthermore, the cell-type-specific CB<sub>1</sub>R expression pattern in the dorsal horn was similar in both sexes. Over 50% of CB<sub>1</sub>R<sup>GFP</sup> cells were GABAergic neurons, and approximately 25% were glycinergic and 20‚Äì30% were glutamatergic neurons. The CB<sub>1</sub>R-expressing cells also represented a subset of spinal projection neurons. Overall, our work indicates a highly consistent distribution pattern of CB<sub>1</sub>R<sup>GFP</sup> cells in the dorsal horn of lumbar spinal cord in males and females.</p>

     alt="From retina to motoneurons: A substrate for visuomotor transformation in salamanders"/>
<p>We provide anatomical and physiological evidence of a retino-tecto-reticulo-spinal pathway in salamanders. This pathway provides a substrate for the transformation of visual information into a motor command and is well positioned to control orienting behaviors when approaching a prey for instance.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The transformation of visual input into motor output is essential to approach a target or avoid a predator. In salamanders, visually guided orientation behaviors have been extensively studied during prey capture. However, the neural circuitry involved is not resolved. Using salamander brain preparations, calcium imaging and tracing experiments, we describe a neural substrate through which retinal input is transformed into spinal motor output. We found that retina stimulation evoked responses in reticulospinal neurons of the middle reticular nucleus, known to control steering movements in salamanders. Microinjection of glutamatergic antagonists in the optic tectum (superior colliculus in mammals) decreased the reticulospinal responses. Using tracing, we found that retina projected to the dorsal layers of the contralateral tectum, where the dendrites of neurons projecting to the middle reticular nucleus were located. In slices, stimulation of the tectal dorsal layers evoked glutamatergic responses in deep tectal neurons retrogradely labeled from the middle reticular nucleus. We then examined how tectum activation translated into spinal motor output. Tectum stimulation evoked motoneuronal responses, which were decreased by microinjections of glutamatergic antagonists in the contralateral middle reticular nucleus. Reticulospinal fibers anterogradely labeled from tracer injection in the middle reticular nucleus were preferentially distributed in proximity with the dendrites of ipsilateral motoneurons. Our work establishes a neural substrate linking visual and motor centers in salamanders. This retino-tecto-reticulo-spinal circuitry is well positioned to control orienting behaviors. Our study bridges the gap between the behavioral studies and the neural mechanisms involved in the transformation of visual input into motor output in salamanders.</p>

     alt="Calcium-binding proteins typify the dopaminergic neuronal subtypes in the ventral tegmental area of zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata"/>
<p>Graphical Abstract: Dopamine (DA) neurons residing in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN) in the midbrain of zebra finch demonstrate distinct differences in size and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (TH-ir). The DA neurons in VTA were smaller than those in SN. Based on TH-ir, VTA neurons have been demarcated as subtype 1, 2, and 3. The further study probed the nature of the calcium binding proteins (CBPs), namely, Calbindin (CB)-, Calretinin (CR)-, Parvalbumin (PV)-, and Secretagogin (SCGN)-expressing DA neurons in the VTA and SN. CBPs mRNA and protein showed differential expression in VTA subdivisions and SN. While the subtype 1 TH neurons in the VTA were CB- or CR-negative, subtype 2 and 3 TH neurons co-expressed CB and CR, respectively. Neurons expressing SCGN were observed only in the VTA. All subtypes of TH neurons in the VTA co-expressed PV, and the PV and TH-ir showed reciprocal relationship.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Calcium-binding proteins (CBPs) regulate neuronal function in midbrain dopamine (DA)-ergic neurons in mammals by buffering and sensing the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and vesicular release. In birds, the equivalent set of neurons are important in song learning, directed singing, courtship, and energy balance, yet the status of CBPs in these neurons is unknown. Herein, for the first time, we probe the nature of CBPs, namely, Calbindin-, Calretinin-, Parvalbumin-, and Secretagogin-expressing DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN) in the midbrain of zebra finch, <i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>. qRT-PCR analysis of ventral midbrain tissue fragment revealed higher Calbindin- and Calretinin-mRNA levels compared to Parvalbumin and Secretagogin. Application of immunofluorescence showed CBP-immunoreactive (-i) neurons in VTA (anterior [VTAa], mid [VTAm], caudal [VTAc]), SN (compacta [SNc], and reticulata [SNr]). Compared to VTAa, higher Calbindin- and Parvalbumin-immunoreactivity (-ir), and lower Calretinin-ir were observed in VTAm and VTAc. Secretagogin-ir was highly localized to VTAa. In SN, Calbindin- and Calretinin-ir were higher in SNc, SNr was Parvalbumin enriched, and Secretagogin-ir was not detected. Weak, moderate, and intense tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-i VTA neurons were demarcated as subtypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. While subtype 1 TH-i neurons were neither Calbindin- nor Calretinin-i, ‚àº80 and ‚àº65% subtype 2 and ‚àº30 and ‚àº45% subtype 3 TH-i neurons co-expressed Calbindin and Calretinin, respectively. All TH-i neuronal subtypes co-expressed Parvalbumin with reciprocal relationship with TH-ir. We suggest that the CBPs may determine VTA DA neuronal heterogeneity and differentially regulate their activity in <i>T. guttata</i>.</p>

Newly defined Otpa-positive neuroanatomical areas include the ventral and prerecess caudal periventricular hypothalamic zones and various brainstem nuclei including the perilemniscal nucleus and nucleus lateralis valvulae.

Using <i>shh-</i> and <i>islet1</i>-related zebrafish transgenic lines, colocalization of <i>shh</i> and Otpa is shown in posterior tubercular dopaminergic cells (c) with ascending projections to the subpallium, and of <i>islet1</i> in the ventral hypothalamic zone (d).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Many transcription factors boost neural development and differentiation in specific directions and serve for identifying similar or homologous structures across species. The expression of Orthopedia (Otp) is critical for the development of certain cell groups along the vertebrate neuraxis, for example, the medial amygdala or hypothalamic neurosecretory neurons. Therefore, the primary focus of the present study is the distribution of Orthopedia a (Otpa) in the larval and adult zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) brain. Since Otpa is also critical for the development of zebrafish basal diencephalic dopaminergic cells, colocalization of Otpa with the catecholamine synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is studied. Cellular colocalization of Otpa and dopamine is only seen in magnocellular neurons of the periventricular posterior tubercular nucleus and in the posterior tuberal nucleus. Otpa-positive cells occur in many additional structures along the zebrafish neuraxis, from the secondary prosencephalon down to the hindbrain. Furthermore, Otpa expression is studied in <i>shh</i>-GFP and <i>islet1</i>-GFP transgenic zebrafish. Otpa-positive cells only express <i>shh</i> in dopaminergic magnocellular periventricular posterior tubercular cells, and only colocalize with <i>islet1</i>-GFP in the ventral zone and prerecess¬†caudal periventricular hypothalamic zone and the perilemniscal nucleus. The scarcity of cellular colocalization of Otpa in <i>islet1</i>-GFP cells indicates that the Shh<i>-islet1</i> neurogenetic pathway is not active in most Otpa-expressing domains. Our analysis reveals detailed correspondences between mouse and zebrafish forebrain territories including the zebrafish intermediate nucleus of the ventral telencephalon and the mouse medial amygdala. The zebrafish preoptic Otpa-positive domain represents the neuropeptidergic supraopto-paraventricular region of all tetrapods. Otpa domains in the zebrafish basal plate hypothalamus suggest that the ventral periventricular hypothalamic zone corresponds to the <i>otp</i>-expressing basal hypothalamic tuberal field in the mouse. Furthermore, the mouse <i>otp</i> domain in the mammillary hypothalamus compares partly to our Otpa-positive domain in the prerecess caudal periventricular hypothalamic zone (Hc-a).</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in methods enable the labeling of individual endogenous proteins to faithfully determine their spatiotemporal distribution in cells. However, reliable multiplexing of knock-in events in neurons remains challenging because of cross talk between editing events. To overcome this, we developed conditional activation of knock-in expression (CAKE), allowing efficient, flexible, and accurate multiplex genome editing. To diminish cross talk, CAKE is based on sequential, recombinase-driven guide RNA (gRNA) expression to control the timing of genomic integration of each donor sequence. We show that CAKE is broadly applicable in rat neurons to co-label various endogenous proteins, including cytoskeletal proteins, synaptic scaffolds, ion channels and neurotransmitter receptor subunits. To take full advantage of CAKE, we resolved the nanoscale co-distribution of endogenous synaptic proteins using super-resolution microscopy, demonstrating that their co-organization correlates with synapse size. Finally, we introduced inducible dimerization modules, providing acute control over synaptic receptor dynamics in living neurons. These experiments highlight the potential of CAKE to reveal new biological insight. Altogether, CAKE is a versatile method for multiplex protein labeling that enables the detection, localization, and manipulation of endogenous proteins in neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Polybasic Patches in Both C2 Domains of Synaptotagmin-1 Are Required for Evoked Neurotransmitter Release</a></h4>

              
                <p>Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) is a vesicular calcium sensor required for synchronous neurotransmitter release, composed of a single-pass transmembrane domain linked to two C2 domains (C2A and C2B) that bind calcium, acidic lipids, and SNARE proteins that drive fusion of the synaptic vesicle with the plasma membrane. Despite its essential role, how Syt1 couples calcium entry to synchronous release is poorly understood. Calcium binding to C2B is critical for synchronous release, and C2B additionally binds the SNARE complex. The C2A domain is also required for Syt1 function, but it is not clear why. Here, we asked what critical feature of C2A may be responsible for its functional role and compared this to the analogous feature in C2B. We focused on highly conserved poly-lysine patches located on the sides of C2A (K189-192) and C2B (K324-327). We tested effects of charge-neutralization mutations in either region (Syt1<sup>K189-192A</sup> and Syt1<sup>K326-327A</sup>) side by side to determine their relative contributions to Syt1 function in cultured cortical neurons from mice of either sex and in single-molecule experiments. Combining electrophysiological recordings and optical tweezers measurements to probe dynamic single C2 domain&ndash;membrane interactions, we show that both C2A and C2B polybasic patches contribute to membrane binding, and both are required for evoked release. The size of the readily releasable vesicle pool and the rate of spontaneous release were unaffected, so both patches are likely required specifically for synchronization of release. We suggest these patches contribute to cooperative membrane binding, increasing the overall affinity of Syt1 for negatively charged membranes and facilitating evoked release.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Synaptotagmin-1 is a vesicular calcium sensor required for synchronous neurotransmitter release. Its tandem cytosolic C2 domains (C2A and C2B) bind calcium, acidic lipids, and SNARE proteins that drive fusion of the synaptic vesicle with the plasma membrane. How calcium binding to Synaptotagmin-1 leads to release and the relative contributions of the C2 domains are unclear. Combining electrophysiological recordings from cultured neurons and optical tweezers measurements of single C2 domain&ndash;membrane interactions, we show that conserved polybasic regions in both domains contribute to membrane binding cooperatively, and both are required for evoked release, likely by increasing the overall affinity of Synaptotagmin-1 for acidic membranes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Integrins Bidirectionally Regulate the Efficacy of Inhibitory Synaptic Transmission and Control GABAergic Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                <p>For many decades, synaptic plasticity was believed to be restricted to excitatory transmission. However, in recent years, this view started to change, and now it is recognized that GABAergic synapses show distinct forms of activity-dependent long-term plasticity, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Herein, we asked whether signaling mediated by &beta;1 or &beta;3 subunit-containing integrins might be involved in regulating the efficacy of GABAergic synapses, including the NMDA receptor-dependent inhibitory long-term potentiation (iLTP) in the hippocampus. We found that activation of &beta;3 integrin with fibrinogen induced a stable depression, whereas inhibition of &beta;1 integrin potentiated GABAergic synapses at CA1 pyramidal neurons in male mice. Additionally, compounds that interfere with the interaction of &beta;1 or &beta;3 integrins with extracellular matrix blocked the induction of NMDA-iLTP. In conclusion, we provide the first evidence that integrins are key players in regulating the endogenous modulatory mechanisms of GABAergic inhibition and plasticity in the hippocampus.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Epilepsy, schizophrenia, and anxiety are just a few medical conditions associated with dysfunctional inhibitory synaptic transmission. GABAergic synapses are known for their extraordinary susceptibility to modulation by endogenous factors and exogenous pharmacological agents. We describe here that integrins, adhesion proteins, play a key role in the modulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission. Specifically, we show that interference with integrin-dependent adhesion results in a variety of effects on the amplitude and frequency of GABAergic mIPSCs. Activation of &beta;3 subunit-containing integrins induces inhibitory long-term depression, whereas the inhibition of &beta;1 subunit-containing integrins induces iLTP. Our results unveil an important mechanism controlling synaptic inhibition, which opens new avenues into the usage of integrin-aimed pharmaceuticals as modulators of GABAergic synapses.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Corticotropin Releasing Factor Mediates KCa3.1 Inhibition, Hyperexcitability, and Seizures in Acquired Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the most common focal seizure disorder in adults, can be instigated in experimental animals by convulsant-induced status epilepticus (SE). Principal hippocampal neurons from SE-experienced epileptic male rats (post-SE neurons) display markedly augmented spike output compared with neurons from nonepileptic animals (non-SE neurons). This enhanced firing results from a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A-mediated inhibition of K<SUB>Ca</SUB>3.1, a subclass of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels generating the slow afterhyperpolarizing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-gated K<sup>+</sup> current (<I>I</I><SUB>sAHP</SUB>). The inhibition of K<SUB>Ca</SUB>3.1 in post-SE neurons leads to a marked reduction in amplitude of the <I>I</I><SUB>sAHP</SUB> that evolves during repetitive firing, as well as in amplitude of the associated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent component of the slow afterhyperpolarization potential (K<SUB>Ca</SUB>-sAHP). Here we show that K<SUB>Ca</SUB>3.1 inhibition in post-SE neurons is induced by corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) through its Type 1 receptor (CRF<SUB>1</SUB>R). Acute application of CRF<SUB>1</SUB>R antagonists restores K<SUB>Ca</SUB>3.1 activity in post-SE neurons, normalizing K<SUB>Ca</SUB>-sAHP/<I>I</I><SUB>sAHP</SUB> amplitudes and neuronal spike output, without affecting these variables in non-SE neurons. Moreover, pharmacological antagonism of CRF<SUB>1</SUB>Rs <I>in vivo</I> reduces the frequency of spontaneous recurrent seizures in post-SE chronically epileptic rats. These findings may provide a new vista for treating TLE.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Epilepsy, a common neurologic disorder, often develops following a brain insult. Identifying key cellular mechanisms underlying acquired epilepsy is critical for developing effective antiepileptic therapies. In an experimental model of acquired epilepsy, principal hippocampal neurons manifest hyperexcitability because of downregulation of K<SUB>Ca</SUB>3.1, a subtype of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-gated K<sup>+</sup> ion channels. We show that K<SUB>Ca</SUB>3.1 downregulation is mediated by corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) acting through its Type 1 receptor (CRF<SUB>1</SUB>R). Congruently, acute application of selective CRF<SUB>1</SUB>R antagonists restores K<SUB>Ca</SUB>3.1 channel activity, leading to normalization of neuronal excitability. In the same model, injection of a CRF<SUB>1</SUB>R antagonist to epileptic animals markedly decreases the frequency of electrographic seizures. Therefore, targeting CRF<SUB>1</SUB>Rs may provide a new strategy in the treatment of acquired epilepsy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">SECISBP2L-Mediated Selenoprotein Synthesis Is Essential for Autonomous Regulation of Oligodendrocyte Differentiation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Thyroid hormone (TH) controls the timely differentiation of oligodendrocytes (OLs), and its deficiency can delay myelin development and cause mental retardation. Previous studies showed that the active TH T3 is converted from its prohormone T4 by the selenoprotein DIO2, whose mRNA is primarily expressed in astrocytes in the CNS. In the present study, we discovered that SECISBP2L is highly expressed in differentiating OLs and is required for DIO2 translation. Conditional knock-out (CKO) of Secisbp2l in OL lineage resulted in a decreased level of DIO2 and T3, accompanied by impaired OL differentiation, hypomyelination and motor deficits in both sexes of mice. Moreover, the defective differentiation of OLs in Secisbp2l mutants can be alleviated by T3 or its analog, but not the prohormone T4. The present study has provided strong evidence for the autonomous regulation of OL differentiation by its intrinsic T3 production mediated by the novel SECISBP2L-DIO2-T3 pathway during myelin development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Secisbp2l is specifically expressed in differentiating oligodendrocytes (OLs) and is essential for selenoprotein translation in OLs. Secisbp2l regulates Dio2 translation for active thyroid hormone (TH) T3 production in the CNS. Autonomous regulation of OLs differentiation via SECISBP2L-DIO2-T3 pathway.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Postsurgical Latent Pain Sensitization Is Driven by Descending Serotonergic Facilitation and Masked by {micro}-Opioid Receptor Constitutive Activity in the Rostral Ventromedial Medulla</a></h4>

              
                <p>Following tissue injury, latent sensitization (LS) of nociceptive signaling can persist indefinitely, kept in remission by compensatory &micro;-opioid receptor constitutive activity (MOR<SUB>CA</SUB>) in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. To demonstrate LS, we conducted plantar incision in mice and then waited 3&ndash;4 weeks for hypersensitivity to resolve. At this time (remission), systemic administration of the opioid receptor antagonist/inverse agonist naltrexone reinstated mechanical and heat hypersensitivity. We first tested the hypothesis that LS extends to serotonergic neurons in the rostral ventral medulla (RVM) that convey pronociceptive input to the spinal cord. We report that in male and female mice, hypersensitivity was accompanied by increased Fos expression in serotonergic neurons of the RVM, abolished on chemogenetic inhibition of RVM 5-HT neurons, and blocked by intrathecal injection of the 5-HT<SUB>3</SUB>R antagonist ondansetron; the 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB>R antagonist MDL-11 939 had no effect. Second, to test for MOR<SUB>CA</SUB>, we microinjected the MOR inverse agonist <scp>d</scp>-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2 (CTAP) and/or neutral opioid receptor antagonist 6&beta;-naltrexol. Intra-RVM CTAP produced mechanical hypersensitivity at both hindpaws; 6&beta;-naltrexol had no effect by itself, but blocked CTAP-induced hypersensitivity. This indicates that MOR<SUB>CA</SUB>, rather than an opioid ligand-dependent mechanism, maintains LS in remission. We conclude that incision establishes LS in descending RVM 5-HT neurons that drives pronociceptive 5-HT<SUB>3</SUB>R signaling in the dorsal horn, and this LS is tonically opposed by MOR<SUB>CA</SUB> in the RVM. The 5-HT<SUB>3</SUB> receptor is a promising therapeutic target for the development of drugs to prevent the transition from acute to chronic postsurgical pain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Surgery leads to latent pain sensitization and a compensatory state of endogenous pain control that is maintained long after tissue healing. Here, we show that either chemogenetic inhibition of serotonergic neuron activity in the RVM or pharmacological inhibition of 5-HT<SUB>3</SUB> receptor signaling at the spinal cord blocks behavioral signs of postsurgical latent sensitization. We conclude that MOR<SUB>CA</SUB> in the RVM opposes descending serotonergic facilitation of LS and that the 5-HT<SUB>3</SUB> receptor is a promising therapeutic target for the development of drugs to prevent the transition from acute to chronic postsurgical pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cortical Motion Perception Emerges from Dimensionality Reduction with Evolved Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity Rules</a></h4>

              
                <p>The nervous system is under tight energy constraints and must represent information efficiently. This is particularly relevant in the dorsal part of the medial superior temporal area (MSTd) in primates where neurons encode complex motion patterns to support a variety of behaviors. A sparse decomposition model based on a dimensionality reduction principle known as non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was previously shown to account for a wide range of monkey MSTd visual response properties. This model resulted in sparse, parts-based representations that could be regarded as basis flow fields, a linear superposition of which accurately reconstructed the input stimuli. This model provided evidence that the seemingly complex response properties of MSTd may be a by-product of MSTd neurons performing dimensionality reduction on their input. However, an open question is how a neural circuit could carry out this function. In the current study, we propose a spiking neural network (SNN) model of MSTd based on evolved spike-timing-dependent plasticity and homeostatic synaptic scaling (STDP-H) learning rules. We demonstrate that the SNN model learns compressed and efficient representations of the input patterns similar to the patterns that emerge from NMF, resulting in MSTd-like receptive fields observed in monkeys. This SNN model suggests that STDP-H observed in the nervous system may be performing a similar function as NMF with sparsity constraints, which provides a test bed for mechanistic theories of how MSTd may efficiently encode complex patterns of visual motion to support robust self-motion perception.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The brain may use dimensionality reduction and sparse coding to efficiently represent stimuli under metabolic constraints. Neurons in monkey area MSTd respond to complex optic flow patterns resulting from self-motion. We developed a spiking neural network model that showed MSTd-like response properties can emerge from evolving spike-timing-dependent plasticity with STDP-H parameters of the connections between then middle temporal area and MSTd. Simulated MSTd neurons formed a sparse, reduced population code capable of encoding perceptual variables important for self-motion perception. This model demonstrates that complex neuronal responses observed in MSTd may emerge from efficient coding and suggests that neurobiological plasticity, like STDP-H, may contribute to reducing the dimensions of input stimuli and allowing spiking neurons to learn sparse representations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Caution Influences Avoidance and Approach Behaviors Differently</a></h4>

              
                <p>While conflict between incompatible goals has well-known effects on actions, in many situations the same action may produce harmful or beneficial consequences during different periods in a nonconflicting manner, e.g., crossing the street during a red or green light. To avoid harm, subjects must be cautious to inhibit the action specifically when it is punished, as in passive avoidance, but act when it is beneficial, as in active avoidance or active approach. In mice of both sexes performing a signaled action to avoid harm or obtain reward, we found that addition of a new rule that punishes the action when it occurs unsignaled delays the timing of the signaled action in an apparent sign of increased caution. Caution depended on task signaling, contingency, and reinforcement type. Interestingly, caution became persistent when the signaled action was avoidance motivated by danger but was only transient when it was approach motivated by reward. Although caution is represented by the activity of neurons in the midbrain, it developed independent of frontal cortex or basal ganglia output circuits. These results indicate that caution disrupts actions in different ways depending on the motivational state and may develop from unforeseen brain circuits.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Actions, such as crossing the street at a light, can have benefits during one light signal (getting somewhere) but can be harmful during a different signal (being run over). Humans must be cautious to cross the street during the period marked by the appropriate signal. In mice performing a signaled action to avoid harm or obtain reward, we found that addition of a new rule that punishes the action when it occurs unsignaled, delays the timing of the signaled action in an apparent sign of increased caution. Caution became persistent when the signaled action was motivated by danger, but not when it was motivated by reward. Moreover, the development of caution did not depend on prototypical frontal cortex circuits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Assimilation of Novel Information into Schemata and Its Efficient Consolidation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Schemata enhance memory formation for related novel information. This is true even when this information is neutral with respect to schema-driven expectations. This assimilation of novel information into schemata has been attributed to more effective organizational processing that leads to more referential connections with the activated associative schema network. Animal data suggest that systems consolidation of novel assimilated information is also accelerated. In the current study, we used both multivariate and univariate fMRI analyses to provide further support for these proposals and to elucidate the neural underpinning of these processes. Twenty-eight participants (5 male) overlearned fictitious schemata for 7 weeks and then encoded novel related and control facts in the scanner. These facts were retrieved both immediately and 2 weeks later, also in the scanner. Our results conceptually replicate previous findings with respect to enhanced vmPFC&ndash;hippocampus coupling during encoding of novel related information and point to a prior knowledge effect that is distinct from situations where novel information is experienced as congruent or incongruent with a schema. Moreover, the combination of both multivariate and univariate results further specified the proposed contributions of the vmPFC, precuneus and angular gyrus network to the more efficient encoding of schema-related information. In addition, our data provide further evidence for more efficient systems consolidation of such novel schema-related and potentially assimilated information.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our prior knowledge in a certain domain, often termed schema, heavily influences whether and how we form memories for novel information that can be related to them. The results of the current study show how a ventromedial prefrontal-precuneal-angular network contributes to the more efficient encoding of novel related information. Furthermore, the observed increase in prefrontal&ndash;hippocampal coupling during this process points to a critical distinction from the previously described mechanisms supporting the encoding of information that is experienced as congruent with schema-driven expectations. In addition, we find further support for the proposal based on animal data that prior knowledge enhances also the consolidation of schema-related information.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Oxytocin and the Punitive Hub--Dynamic Spread of Cooperation in Human Social Networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human society operates on large-scale cooperation. However, individual differences in cooperativeness and incentives to free ride on others' cooperation make large-scale cooperation fragile and can lead to reduced social welfare. Thus, how individual cooperation spreads through human social networks remains puzzling from ecological, evolutionary, and societal perspectives. Here, we identify oxytocin and costly punishment as biobehavioral mechanisms that facilitate the propagation of cooperation in social networks. In three laboratory experiments (<I>n</I> = 870 human participants: 373 males, 497 females), individuals were embedded in heterogeneous networks and made repeated decisions with feedback in games of trust (<I>n</I> = 342), ultimatum bargaining (<I>n</I> = 324), and prisoner's dilemma with punishment (<I>n</I> = 204). In each heterogeneous network, individuals at central positions (hub nodes) were given intranasal oxytocin (or placebo). Giving oxytocin (vs matching placebo) to central individuals increased their trust and enforcement of cooperation norms. Oxytocin-enhanced norm enforcement, but not elevated trust, explained the spreading of cooperation throughout the social network. Moreover, grounded in evolutionary game theory, we simulated computer agents that interacted in heterogeneous networks with central nodes varying in terms of cooperation and punishment levels. Simulation results confirmed that central cooperators' willingness to punish noncooperation allowed the permeation of the network and enabled the evolution of network cooperation. These results identify an oxytocin-initiated proximate mechanism explaining how individual cooperation facilitates network-wide cooperation in human society and shed light on the widespread phenomenon of heterogeneous composition and enforcement systems at all levels of life.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Human society operates on large-scale cooperation. Yet because cooperation is exploitable by free riding, how cooperation in social networks emerges remains puzzling from evolutionary and societal perspectives. Here we identify oxytocin and altruistic punishment as key factors facilitating the propagation of cooperation in human social networks. Individuals played repeated economic games in heterogeneous networks where individuals at central positions were given oxytocin or placebo. Oxytocin-enhanced cooperative norm enforcement, but not elevated trust, explained cooperation spreading throughout the social network. Evolutionary simulations confirmed that central cooperators' willingness to punish noncooperation allowed the permeation of the network and enabled the evolution of cooperation.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Exploring Information Flow from Posteromedial Cortex during Visuospatial Working Memory: A Magnetoencephalography Study</a></h4>

              
                <p>The posteromedial cortex (PMC) is a major hub of the brain's default mode network, and is implicated in a broad range of internally driven cognitions, including visuospatial working memory. However, its precise contribution to these cognitive processes remains unclear. Using MEG, we measured PMC activity in healthy human participants (young adults of both sexes) while they performed a visuospatial working memory task. Multivariate pattern classification analyses revealed stimulus-related information during encoding and retrieval in a set of <I>a priori</I> defined cortical ROIs, including prefrontal, occipital, and ventrotemporal cortices, in addition to PMC. We measured the extent to which this stimulus information was exchanged between areas in an information flow analysis, measuring Granger-causal relationships between areas over time. Consistent with the visual nature of the task, information from occipital cortex shaped other regions across most epochs. However, the PMC shaped object representations in occipital and prefrontal cortices during visuospatial working memory, influencing occipital cortex during retrieval and PFC across all task epochs. Our findings are consistent with a proposed role for the PMC in the representation of internal content, including remembered information, and in the comparison of external stimuli with remembered material.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The human brain operates as a collection of highly interconnected regions. Mapping the function of this interconnectivity, as well as the specializations within different regions, is central to understanding the neural processes underlying cognition. The posteromedial cortex (PMC) is a highly connected cortical region, implicated in visuospatial working memory, although its precise contribution remains unclear. We measured the activity of PMC during a visuospatial working memory task, testing how different regions represented the stimuli, and whether these representations were driven by other cortical regions. We found that PMC influenced stimulus information in other regions across all task phases, suggesting that PMC plays a key role in shaping stimulus representations during visuospatial working memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Contextual Expectations Shape Cortical Reinstatement of Sensory Representations</a></h4>

              
                <p>When making a turn at a familiar intersection, we know what items and landmarks will come into view. These perceptual expectations, or predictions, come from our knowledge of the context; however, it is unclear how memory and perceptual systems interact to support the prediction and reactivation of sensory details in cortex. To address this, human participants learned the spatial layout of animals positioned in a cross maze. During fMRI, participants of both sexes navigated between animals to reach a target, and in the process saw a predictable sequence of five animal images. Critically, to isolate activity patterns related to item predictions, rather than bottom-up inputs, one-fourth of trials ended early, with a blank screen presented instead. Using multivariate pattern similarity analysis, we reveal that activity patterns in early visual cortex, posterior medial regions, and the posterior hippocampus showed greater similarity when seeing the same item compared with different items. Further, item effects in posterior hippocampus were specific to the sequence context. Critically, activity patterns associated with seeing an item in visual cortex and posterior medial cortex, were also related to activity patterns when an item was expected, but omitted, suggesting sequence predictions were reinstated in these regions. Finally, multivariate connectivity showed that patterns in the posterior hippocampus at one position in the sequence were related to patterns in early visual cortex and posterior medial cortex at a later position. Together, our results support the idea that hippocampal representations facilitate sensory processing by modulating visual cortical activity in anticipation of expected items.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our visual world is a series of connected events, where we can predict what we might see next based on our recent past. Understanding the neural circuitry and mechanisms of the perceptual and memory systems that support these expectations is fundamental to revealing how we perceive and act in our world. Using brain imaging, we studied what happens when we expect to see specific visual items, and how such expectations relate to top-down memory signals. We find both visual and memory systems reflect item predictions, and moreover, we show that hippocampal activity supports predictions of future expected items. This demonstrates that the hippocampus acts to predict upcoming items, and reinstates such predictions in cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Modulating the Excitability of Olfactory Output Neurons Affects Whole-Body Metabolism</a></h4>

              
                <p>Metabolic state can alter olfactory sensitivity, but it is unknown whether the activity of the olfactory bulb (OB) may fine tune metabolic homeostasis. Our objective was to use CRISPR gene editing in male and female mice to enhance the excitability of mitral/tufted projection neurons (M/TCs) of the OB to test for improved metabolic health. <I>Ex vivo</I> slice recordings of MCs in CRISPR mice confirmed increased excitability due the targeted loss of Kv1.3 channels, which resulted in a less negative resting membrane potential (RMP), enhanced action potential (AP) firing, and insensitivity to the selective channel blocker margatoxin (MgTx). CRISPR mice exhibited enhanced odor discrimination using a habituation/dishabituation paradigm. CRISPR mice were challenged for 25 weeks with a moderately high-fat (MHF) diet, and compared with littermate controls, male mice were resistance to diet-induced obesity (DIO). Female mice did not exhibit DIO. CRISPR male mice gained less body weight, accumulated less white adipose tissue, cleared a glucose challenge more quickly, and had less serum leptin and liver triglycerides. CRISPR male mice consumed equivalent calories as control littermates, and had unaltered energy expenditure (EE) and locomotor activity, but used more fats for metabolic substrate over that of carbohydrates. Counter to CRISPR-engineered mice, by using chemogenetics to decrease M/TC excitability in male mice, activation of inhibitory designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) caused a decrease in odor discrimination, and resulted in a metabolic profile that was obesogenic, mice had reduced EE and oxygen consumption (VO<SUB>2</SUB>). We conclude that the activity of M/TC projection neurons canonically carries olfactory information and simultaneously can regulate whole-body metabolism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The olfactory system drives food choice, and olfactory sensitivity is strongly correlated to hunger and fullness. Olfactory function thereby influences nutritional balance and obesity outcomes. Obesity has become a health and financial crisis in America, shortening life expectancy and increasing the severity of associated illnesses. It is expected that 51% of Americans will be obese by the year 2030. Using CRISPR gene editing and chemogenetic approaches, we discovered that changing the excitability of output neurons in the olfactory bulb (OB) affects metabolism and body weight stabilization in mice. Our results suggest that long-term therapeutic targeting of OB activity to higher processing centers may be a future clinical treatment of obesity or type II Diabetes.</p>

                The reverse order law for outer inverses and the Moore-Penrose inverse is discussed in the context of associative rings. A class of pairs of outer inverses that satisfy reverse order law is determined. The notions of left-star and right-star orders have been extended to the case of arbitrary associative rings with involution and many of their interesting properties are explored. The distinct behavior of projectors in association with the star, right-star, and left-star partial orders led to several equivalent conditions for the reverse order law for the Moore-Penrose inverse.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A cross-sectional analysis in order to validate the translation of FSFI-6 to Bahasa Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Numerous tools have been developed to assess female sexual dysfunction. Several of them have also conducted validity tests. Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) is one of these surveys that has been effectively translated into several different languages. The previous study on the translation and validation of the FSFI-6 questionnaire into Bahasa Indonesia used the original form (FSFI-19), which had many questions. Thus, this study was done to validate and translate a condensed version of the original questionnaire to make it more practicable for individuals to complete in a clinical context. Methods: FSFI-6 was translated into Bahasa Indonesia. Then the data were collected via questionnaires by 72 women in Rumah Sakit Cipto Mangunkusumo (RSCM or Mangunkusumo National Central General Hospital) during the data collection period (January 2018 until April 2018). The data obtained were processed for validity and reliability using the SPSS software program 20. The tests conducted on the data included a normality test, a validity test, descriptive analysis, and reliability testing. The r-value and the value of Cronbach‚Äôs Alpha were the parameters used to determine the validity and reliability of the questionnaire. Results: The r-value on each question in the translated FSFI-6 questionnaire was greater than 0.3, while the value of Cronbach's Alpha of the questionnaire FSFI-6 was greater than 0.6, equal to 0.831. Conclusions: The FSFI-6 questionnaire short version that has been translated into Bahasa Indonesia is valid and reliable.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A systematic review of retinoic acid in the journey of spermatogonium to spermatozoa: From basic to clinical application [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Retinoic acid plays an essential role in testicular development and functions, especially spermatogenesis. We have reviewed the role of retinoic acid from basic (molecular) to clinical application. Methods: A search was conducted in the online database including PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus for English studies published in the last eight years about this issue. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines in assessing the studies we are going to investigate. Results: Studies indicated that retinoic acid plays an essential role during pluripotent stem cell migration and lineage commitment, cell differentiation, apoptosis, stem cell number regulation, and maturation arrest in spermatogenic cells. Retinoic acid can also affect related protein expression and signaling pathways at different stages of spermatogenesis. Four studies have applied retinoic acid to humans, all of them in the single-arm observational study. The results look promising but need further research with more controlled study methods, randomization, and large samples. Conclusions: This current systematic review emphasizes a novel retinoic acid mechanism that has not been well described in the literature previously on its functions during the first seven days of spermatogenesis, leading to new directions or explanations of male infertility cause and treatments as a part of reproductive health care.

                Background: Globally, India is the country with the highest tuberculosis (TB) burden with respect to the number of new cases occurring each year. Annual incident cases of TB in India accounts for more than 25% of total TB morbidity and mortality worldwide. Several factors have been associated with the adherence of TB medication, which can be broadly classified as patient/personal, social, structural and health service. The aims of the present study were to determine the compliance to daily regimen of directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) therapy among TB patients registered at the Tuberculosis Unit (TU) of Mangalore and to identify the factors influencing non-compliance for treatment. Methods: A cross sectional study was performed. The study sample was drawn from the TUs, General Hospital, Mangalore, after taking permission from District TB Officer. The names and addresses of TB patients were collected from treatment cards. The TB patients were approached at their homes/DOTS centers/Primary Health Centre‚Äôs (PHCs) with the help of senior treatment supervisors. Results: It was found that patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were more likely to be non-adherent, which was statistically significant. Amongst the participants, 66 (33%) were diabetic and 28.8% of them were found to be non-adherent. The proportion of non-adherence was 27 times higher in those with poor patient provider relationships. Patients who reported to have side effects of TB medication were 5.23 times more likely to be non-adherent. Conclusions: Advice on routine consultation with the health care facility, adherence to treatment regimen and education about its benefits should be the prime focus of providing health education to all TB patients, both at the individual and community levels.

                Background: Vemurafenib (VEM) was a licensed drug for the treatment of skin melanoma and is available only in the market as oral tablets prescribed in huge doses (1920 mg/day). One reason for the high dose is vemurafenib's low oral bioavailability. Methods: VEM-lipid complex (DLC) was predicted based on Conquest and Mercury programs and prepared using the solvent evaporation method using the lipid (phosphatidylethanolamine). DLC was subjected to characterization (FT-IR, Raman spectroscopy, DSC, TGA, P-XRD, and FESEM) to confirm complexation. ¬†DLC was used to prepare solid in oil nanodispersion (DLC-SON) and subjected to in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo evaluation in comparison to our recently prepared conventional SON (VEM-SON) and DLC-control. Results: Conquest and Mercury predict the availability of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between VEM and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). All characterization tests of DLC ensure the complexation of the drug with PE. Ex vivo studies showed that the drug in DLC-SON has significantly (P<0.05) higher skin permeation than DLC-control but lower drug permeation than conventional SON but it has a higher % skin deposition (P<0.05) than others. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the prepared DLC-SON is significantly high (P<0.05) in comparison to the conventional SON and pure VEM. In vivo permeation using confocal laser scanning microscopy (on the rat) results indicated that both conventional SON and DLC-SON can cross the SC and infiltrate the dermis and epidermis but DLC-SON has a higher luminance/gray value after 24 h in the dermis in comparison to the conventional SON. Conclusion: The novel lipid complex for VEM prepared using PE as a lipid and enclosed in SON showed higher anticancer activity and topical permeation as well as sustained delivery and good retention time in the dermis that localize the drug in a sufficient concentration to eliminate early diagnosed skin melanoma.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Suprathreshold perceptual decisions constrain models of confidence</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shannon M. Locke, Michael S. Landy, Pascal Mamassian</p>

Perceptual confidence is an important internal signal about the certainty of our decisions and there is a substantial debate on how it is computed. We highlight three confidence metric types from the literature: observers either use 1) the full probability distribution to compute probability correct (Probability metrics), 2) point estimates from the perceptual decision process to estimate uncertainty (Evidence-Strength metrics), or 3) heuristic confidence from stimulus-based cues to uncertainty (Heuristic metrics). These metrics are rarely tested against one another, so we examined models of all three types on a suprathreshold spatial discrimination task. Observers were shown a cloud of dots sampled from a dot generating distribution and judged if the mean of the distribution was left or right of centre. In addition to varying the horizontal position of the mean, there were two sensory uncertainty manipulations: the number of dots sampled and the spread of the generating distribution. After every two perceptual decisions, observers made a confidence forced-choice judgement whether they were more confident in the first or second decision. Model results showed that the majority of observers were best-fit by either: 1) the Heuristic model, which used dot cloud position, spread, and number of dots as cues; or 2) an Evidence-Strength model, which computed the distance between the sensory measurement and discrimination criterion, scaled according to sensory uncertainty. An accidental repetition of some sessions also allowed for the measurement of confidence agreement for identical pairs of stimuli. This N-pass analysis revealed that human observers were more consistent than their best-fitting model would predict, indicating there are still aspects of confidence that are not captured by our modelling. As such, we propose confidence agreement as a useful technique for computational studies of confidence. Taken together, these findings highlight the idiosyncratic nature of confidence computations for complex decision contexts and the need to consider different potential metrics and transformations in the confidence computation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Investigating microscale patchiness of motile microbes under turbulence in a simulated convective mixed layer</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexander Kier Christensen, Matthew D. Piggott, Erik van Sebille, Maarten van Reeuwijk, Samraat Pawar</p>

Microbes play a primary role in aquatic ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles. Spatial patchiness is a critical factor underlying these activities, influencing biological productivity, nutrient cycling and dynamics across trophic levels. Incorporating spatial dynamics into microbial models is a long-standing challenge, particularly where small-scale turbulence is involved. Here, we combine a fully 3D direct numerical simulation of convective mixed layer turbulence, with an individual-based microbial model to test the key hypothesis that the coupling of gyrotactic motility and turbulence drives intense microscale patchiness. The fluid model simulates turbulent convection caused by heat loss through the fluid surface, for example during the night, during autumnal or winter cooling or during a cold-air outbreak. We find that under such conditions, turbulence-driven patchiness is depth-structured and requires high motility: Near the fluid surface, intense convective turbulence overpowers motility, homogenising motile and non-motile microbes approximately equally. At greater depth, in conditions analogous to a thermocline, highly motile microbes can be over twice as patch-concentrated as non-motile microbes, and can substantially amplify their swimming velocity by efficiently exploiting fast-moving packets of fluid. Our results substantiate the predictions of earlier studies, and demonstrate that turbulence-driven patchiness is not a ubiquitous consequence of motility but rather a delicate balance of motility and turbulent intensity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Expanded ACE2 dependencies of diverse SARS-like coronavirus receptor binding domains</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sarah M. Roelle, Nidhi Shukla, Anh T. Pham, Anna M. Bruchez, Kenneth A. Matreyek</p>

Viral spillover from animal reservoirs can trigger public health crises and cripple the world economy. Knowing which viruses are primed for zoonotic transmission can focus surveillance efforts and mitigation strategies for future pandemics. Successful engagement of receptor protein orthologs is necessary during cross-species transmission. The clade 1 sarbecoviruses including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 enter cells via engagement of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), while the receptor for clade 2 and clade 3 remains largely uncharacterized. We developed a mixed cell pseudotyped virus infection assay to determine whether various clades 2 and 3 sarbecovirus spike proteins can enter HEK 293T cells expressing human or <i>Rhinolophus</i> horseshoe bat ACE2 proteins. The receptor binding domains from BtKY72 and Khosta-2 used human ACE2 for entry, while BtKY72 and Khosta-1 exhibited widespread use of diverse rhinolophid ACE2s. A lysine at ACE2 position 31 appeared to be a major determinant of the inability of these RBDs to use a certain ACE2 sequence. The ACE2 protein from <i>Rhinolophus alcyone</i> engaged all known clade 3 and clade 1 receptor binding domains. We observed little use of <i>Rhinolophus</i> ACE2 orthologs by the clade 2 viruses, supporting the likely use of a separate, unknown receptor. Our results suggest that clade 3 sarbecoviruses from Africa and Europe use <i>Rhinolophus</i> ACE2 for entry, and their spike proteins appear primed to contribute to zoonosis under the right conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mechanistic contribution of CaV3.2 calcium channels to trigeminal neuralgia pathophysiology not clarified [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a rare, yet debilitating trigeminal pain disorder, with jolts of supramaximal-debilitating pain in one or more of the three trigeminal branches. Familial TN is now recognized, with a recent report describing several human genetic polymorphisms. One affected gene is the voltage-gated calcium channel, CaV3.2 (CACNA1H), with 19 polymorphisms first described. A recent study in PAIN by Gambeta-et-al (DOI:10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002651) is entitled "CaV3.2 calcium channels contribute to trigeminal neuralgia ". Here, I call into question their claim. My main arguments are 1)-3):¬† 1) Gambeta-et-al studied 4/19 mutations reported in heterologous cellular expression, with two mutations showing gain-of-function of CaV3.2, two mutations not showing gain-of-function. Therefore the exemplary picks of familial TN-associated CaV3.2 mutations do not show a uniform change of channel function, such as gain-of-function. ¬†2) In Gambeta-et-al, one gain-of-function mutation, CaV3.2(G563R) was directed to mouse trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons, and their resulting hyperexcitability was demonstrated. A critical control of a non-gain-of-function channel was not included here, it was unclear whether neurons were separated by sex, and human sensory neurons were not used. Importantly, it is not clear that TG ¬†neurons are the critical cellular site of CaV3.2 mutations. 3) Gambeta-et-al used CaV3.2-/- pan-null knockout mice. Human TN-associated CaV3.2 mutations were not over-expressed. They used a infraorbital nerve constriction injury and measured facial heat hyperalgesia.¬† CaV3.2-/- show a pain phenotype similar to control, yet are not affected by a CaV3-inhibitory compound, Z944. My argument is that when starting with TN-associated human mutations, use of a trigeminal neuropathic pain model is of limited value, and that human mutations have to be expressed against a mouse null background. Re thermal cue, Gambeta-et-al failed to study cold-evoked pain which is a TN clinical hallmark. Thus, Gambeta-et-al's 2022 PAIN-paper offers little new mechanistic evidence why CaV3.2 polymorphisms are associated with trigeminal neuralgia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Introducing the Task Switching Game: a paradigm for neuroimaging and online studies [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                While writing this abstract I received an email, which I promptly answered. When I returned my attention to the abstract, I struggled to regain my flow of writing. In order to understand this deficit in performance associated with switching from one task to another, or "switch cost", cognitive neuroscientists use task switching paradigms to recreate similar experiences. However, many researchers may be familiar with the difficulties that accompany modifying an established paradigm to suit their experimental design, or even the challenge of creating a new, unvalidated paradigm to perturb a particular aspect of cognitive function. This software tool article introduces a novel task switching paradigm for use and adaptation in online and neuroimaging task switching studies. The paradigm was constructed with a flexible, easily-adapted framework that can accommodate a variety of designs. This paradigm utilizes three psychometrically opposed but visually similar tasks- the Digit Span, the Spatial Span, and the Spatial Rotation. In two Use Cases we demonstrate the reliable nature of overall task performance and the dependence of switch costs on certain task parameters. This task framework can be adapted for use across different experimental designs and environment, and we encourage researchers to modify the task switching game for their experiments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">In silico and in vitro analysis of THCA synthase gene in Moroccan Cannabis Sativa, L [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cannabis (Cannabis sativa, L.) is an archaic, most infamous plant with unique therapeutic characteristics, and great economic interest. The identification of its THCAS synthesizing enzyme was a great leap forward in Cannabis investigation. However, basic molecular biology for THCAS gene expression remains largely unstudied. Methods: In this paper, we explored the ability of bioinformatics resources in the design of molecular cloning protocol and prediction of three-dimensional structure of recombinant THCAS in Moroccan Cannabis sativa variety. We further described conventional experiments performed in vitro. We used specific markers to isolate the nucleotide sequence of THCAS from the leaves of Cannabis, without including the native signal sequence. Results: As a result, we found high sequence similarity with THCAS and the mRNA precursor of the same gene as previously reported. In addition, we predicted the structure of the recombinant THCAS using the organic crystal structure prediction method, the amino acid sequence reference, and the artificial intelligence technology. Conclusions: This study paves the way to successfully express recombinant THCAS enzyme in hosts like Pichia pastori.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pandemic Pedagogy: Perception of Nursing students‚Äô: A cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic impacted across the globe disrupting all sectors including the higher education universities. Nursing institutions faced various challenges due to the pandemic restrictions, of which the abrupt shift of implementing the curriculum to online mode posed a major challenge to both the teachers and the students. To assess nursing students' perception of pandemic pedagogy and the challenges faced in remote teaching-learning, this cross-sectional survey was conducted among 982 undergraduate nursing students from three Deemed to be University nursing institutions of Southern India. Institutional Ethics Committee approval (IEC 444/2020), permission from the heads of the institutions and study participant‚Äôs consent was obtained. Data was collected using an online survey questionnaire which had three domains, including student-related (19 items), teacher-related(5 items), and physical learning environment-related factors (11 items).¬† The reliability was established using Cronbach‚Äôs Alpha (0.86). Explored the favouring, hindering factors and challenges faced during the emergency remote instruction with open-ended items. The overall mean score of perceptions on pandemic pedagogy was 89.03¬±10.03. Sixty-three percent of students had a total perception score above 87 which indicates that they preferred remote learning (synchronous) during the pandemic whereas 45% preferred face-to-face classes. There was a significant difference in the total perception scores and the years of study( F (3, 978) = 4.96, p = 0.002). The factors favouring remote learning were, an opportunity to view the recorded classes even after the live classes‚Äô (n=165), and ‚Äòmore time to spend for learning activities‚Äô (n=152). Factors that hindered the learning or the challenges faced were poor network connectivity (n=451), and lack of opportunity for group study¬† (n=326). Students favoured remote learning during the pandemic; however, there were several challenges. The educational institutions need to prepare themselves to overcome this and focus on a blended learning curriculum.

                Background: This study aimed to determine the potential anti-aging effects of sea grapes and tempe (fermented soybeans) collagen particle size, by measuring the activities of anti-glycation, antioxidant, and tyrosinase inhibitors. Methods: Collagen was isolated from freeze-dried sea grapes and tempe powder and treated with different NaOH concentrations (0.10 M; 0.20 M; 0.30 M), and CH3COOH 1 M solution, separately. The collagen particle size was adjusted by stirring at 1000 rpm for 5 and 10 hours. 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) was used to measure the antioxidant activity, and L-tyrosine and L-DOPA (l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) was used as a marker of tyrosine inhibition.¬†Results: ¬†The collagen treated with 0.10 M NaOH produced the highest collagen yield (11.65%), and the largest particle size (2455 nm). Additionally, this collagen, when treated for 5 hours, exhibited 24.70% antioxidant activity, 62.60% anti-glycation, 8.97% L-tyrosine, and 26.77% L-Dopa inhibition activities. Meanwhile, the collagen treated for 10 hours had a 9.98% antioxidant activity, 41.48% anti-glycation, 7.89% L-tyrosine, and 2.67% L-Dopa inhibition activity.¬†Conclusion: Sea grapes and tempe collagen powder treated with 0.10 M NaOH and stirred for 5 hours, possess the best potential anti-aging properties as a functional food.

Changes in these conditions could therefore influence future ice-mass loss.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Unsupervised detection of fragment length signatures of circulating tumor DNA using non-negative matrix factorization</a></h4>

              
                Sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is currently being used to detect cancer by searching both for mutational and non-mutational alterations. Recent work has shown that the length distribution of cfDNA fragments from a cancer patient can inform tumor load and type. Here, we propose non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) of fragment length distributions as a novel and completely unsupervised method for studying fragment length patterns in cfDNA. Using shallow whole-genome sequencing (sWGS) of cfDNA from a cohort of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), we demonstrate how NMF accurately infers the true tumor fragment length distribution as an NMF component - and that the sample weights of this component correlate with ctDNA levels (r=0.75). We further demonstrate how using several NMF components enables accurate cancer detection on data from various early stage cancers (AUC=0.96). Finally, we show that NMF, when applied across genomic regions, can be used to discover fragment length signatures associated with open chromatin.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Flexible and efficient simulation-based inference for models of decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Inferring parameters of computational models that capture experimental data is a central task in cognitive neuroscience. Bayesian statistical inference methods usually require the ability to evaluate the likelihood of the model‚Äîhowever, for many models of interest in cognitive neuroscience, the associated likelihoods cannot be computed efficiently. Simulation-based inference (SBI) offers a solution to this problem by only requiring access to simulations produced by the model. Previously, Fengler et al. introduced Likelihood Approximation Networks (LAN, Fengler et al., 2021) which make it possible to apply SBI to models of decision-making, but require billions of simulations for training. Here, we provide a new SBI method that is substantially more simulation-efficient. Our approach, Mixed Neural Likelihood Estimation (MNLE), trains neural density estimators on model simulations to emulate the simulator, and is designed to capture both the continuous (e.g., reaction times) and discrete (choices) data of decision-making models. The likelihoods of the emulator can then be used to perform Bayesian parameter inference on experimental data using standard approximate inference methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. We demonstrate MNLE on two variants of the drift-diffusion model (DDM) and show that it is substantially more efficient than LANs: MNLE achieves similar likelihood accuracy with six orders of magnitude fewer training simulations, and is significantly more accurate than LANs when both are trained with the same budget. This enables researchers to perform SBI on custom-tailored models of decision-making, leading to fast iteration of model design for scientific discovery.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rewiring of liver diurnal transcriptome rhythms by triiodothyronine (T3) supplementation</a></h4>

              
                Diurnal (i.e., 24-hour) physiological rhythms depend on transcriptional programs controlled by a set of circadian clock genes/proteins. Systemic factors like humoral and neuronal signals, oscillations in body temperature, and food intake align physiological circadian rhythms with external time. Thyroid hormones (THs) are major regulators of circadian clock target processes such as energy metabolism, but little is known about how fluctuations in TH levels affect the circadian coordination of tissue physiology. In this study, a high triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) state was induced in mice by supplementing T<sub>3</sub> in the drinking water, which affected body temperature, and oxygen consumption in a time-of-day dependent manner. 24-hour transcriptome profiling of liver tissue identified 37 robustly and time independently T<sub>3</sub> associated transcripts as potential TH state markers in the liver. Such genes participated in xenobiotic transport, lipid and xenobiotic metabolism. We also identified 10 - 15% of the liver transcriptome as rhythmic in control and T<sub>3</sub> groups, but only 4% of the liver transcriptome (1,033 genes) were rhythmic across both conditions - amongst these several core clock genes. In-depth rhythm analyses showed that most changes in transcript rhythms were related to mesor (50%), followed by amplitude (10%), and phase (10%). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed TH state dependent reorganization of metabolic processes such as lipid and glucose metabolism. At high T<sub>3</sub> levels, we observed weakening or loss of rhythmicity for transcripts associated with glucose and fatty acid metabolism, suggesting increased hepatic energy turnover. In sum, we provide evidence that tonic changes in T<sub>3</sub> levels restructure the diurnal liver metabolic transcriptome independent of local molecular circadian clocks.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Association analyses of host genetics, root-colonizing microbes, and plant phenotypes under different nitrogen conditions in maize</a></h4>

              
                The root-associated microbiome (rhizobiome) affects plant health, stress tolerance, and nutrient use efficiency. However, it remains unclear to what extent the composition of the rhizobiome is governed by intraspecific variation in host plant genetics in the field and the degree to which host plant selection can reshape the composition of the rhizobiome. Here we quantify the rhizosphere microbial communities associated with a replicated diversity panel of 230 maize (<i>Zea mays L</i>.) genotypes grown in agronomically relevant conditions under high N (+N) and low N (-N) treatments. We analyze the maize rhizobiome in terms of 150 abundant and consistently reproducible microbial groups and we show that the abundance of many root-associated microbes is explainable by natural genetic variation in the host plant, with a greater proportion of microbial variance attributable to plant genetic variation in -N conditions. Population genetic approaches identify signatures of purifying selection in the maize genome associated with the abundance of several groups of microbes in the maize rhizobiome. Genome-wide association study was conducted using the abundance of microbial groups as rhizobiome traits, and identified n = 622 plant loci that are linked to the abundance of n = 104 microbial groups in the maize rhizosphere. In 62/104 cases, which is more than expected by chance, the abundance of these same microbial groups was correlated with variation in plant vigor indicators derived from high throughput phenotyping of the same field experiment. We provide comprehensive datasets about the three-way interaction of host genetics, microbe abundance, and plant performance under two N treatments to facilitate targeted experiments towards harnessing the full potential of root-associated microbial symbionts in maize production.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Three-dimensional structure of kinetochore-fibers in human mitotic spindles</a></h4>

              
                During cell division, kinetochore microtubules (KMTs) provide a physical linkage between the chromosomes and the rest of the spindle. KMTs in mammalian cells are organized into bundles, so-called kinetochore-fibers (k-fibers), but the ultrastructure of these fibers is currently not well characterized. Here we show by large-scale electron tomography that each k-fiber in HeLa cells in metaphase is composed of approximately nine KMTs, only half of which reach the spindle pole. Our comprehensive reconstructions allowed us to analyze the three-dimensional (3D) morphology of k-fibers and their surrounding MTs in detail. We found that k-fibers exhibit remarkable variation in circumference and KMT density along their length, with the pole-proximal side showing a broadening. Extending our structural analysis then to other MTs in the spindle, we further observed that the association of KMTs with non-KMTs predominantly occurs in the spindle pole regions. Our 3D reconstructions have implications for KMT growth and k-fiber self-organization models as covered in a parallel publication applying complementary live-cell imaging in combination with biophysical modeling (Conway et al., 2022). Finally, we also introduce a new visualization tool allowing an interactive display of our 3D spindle data that will serve as a resource for further structural studies on mitosis in human cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mapping the single-cell landscape of acral melanoma and analysis of the molecular regulatory network of the tumor microenvironments</a></h4>

              
                Acral melanoma (AM) exhibits a high incidence in Asian patients with melanoma, and it is not well treated with immunotherapy. However, little attention has been paid to the characteristics of the immune microenvironment in AM. Therefore, in this study, we collected clinical samples from Chinese patients with AM and conducted single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the heterogeneity of its tumour microenvironments (TMEs) and the molecular regulatory network . Our analysis revealed that genes, such as <i>TWIST1</i>, <i>EREG</i>, <i>TNFRSF9</i>, and <i>CTGF</i> could drive the deregulation of various TME components. The molecular interaction relationships between TME cells, such as MIF-CD44 and TNFSF9-TNFRSF9, might be an attractive target for developing novel immunotherapeutic agents.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distinct elongation stalls during translation are linked with distinct pathways for mRNA degradation</a></h4>

              
                Key protein adapters couple translation to mRNA decay on specific classes of problematic mRNAs in eukaryotes. Slow decoding on non-optimal codons leads to codon-optimality-mediated decay (COMD) and prolonged arrest at stall sites leads to no-go decay (NGD). The identities of the decay factors underlying these processes and the mechanisms by which they respond to translational distress remain open areas of investigation. We use carefully-designed reporter mRNAs to perform genetic screens and functional assays in S. cerevisiae. We characterize the roles of Hel2, Syh1, and Smy2 in coordinating translational repression and mRNA decay on NGD reporter mRNAs, finding that Syh1 and, to a lesser extent its paralog Smy2, act in a distinct pathway from Hel2. This Syh1/Smy2-mediated pathway acts as a redundant, compensatory pathway to elicit NGD when Hel2-dependent NGD is impaired. Importantly, we observe that these NGD factors are not involved in the degradation of mRNAs enriched in non-optimal codons. Further, we establish that a key factor previously implicated in COMD, Not5, contributes modestly to the degradation of an NGD-targeted mRNA. Finally, we use ribosome profiling to reveal distinct ribosomal states associated with each reporter mRNA that readily rationalize the contributions of NGD and COMD factors to degradation of these reporters. Taken together, these results provide new insight into the role of Syh1 and Smy2 in NGD and into the ribosomal states that correlate with the activation of distinct pathways targeting mRNAs for degradation in yeast.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Exogenous capture accounts for fundamental differences between pro- and antisaccade performance</a></h4>

              
                To generate the next eye movement, oculomotor circuits take into consideration the physical salience of objects in view and current behavioral goals, exogenous and endogenous influences, respectively. However, the interactions between exogenous and endogenous mechanisms and their dynamic contributions to target selection have been difficult to resolve because they evolve extremely rapidly. In a recent study (Salinas et al., 2019), we achieved the necessary temporal precision using an urgent variant of the antisaccade task wherein motor plans are initiated early and choice accuracy depends sharply on when exactly the visual cue information becomes available. Empirical and modeling results indicated that the exogenous signal arrives ‚àº80 ms after cue onset and rapidly accelerates the (incorrect) plan toward the cue, whereas the informed endogenous signal arrives ‚àº25 ms later to favor the (correct) plan away from the cue. Here, we scrutinize a key mechanistic hypothesis about this dynamic, that the exogenous and endogenous signals act at different times and independently of each other. We test quantitative model predictions by comparing the performance of human participants instructed to look toward a visual cue or away from it under high urgency. We find that, indeed, the exogenous response is largely impervious to task instructions; it simply flips its sign relative to the correct choice, and this largely explains the drastic differences in psychometric performance between the two tasks. Thus, saccadic choices are strongly dictated by the alignment between salience and behavioral goals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural contributions to reduced fluid intelligence across the adult lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Fluid intelligence - the ability to solve novel, complex problems - declines steeply during healthy human aging. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), fluid intelligence has been repeatedly associated with activation of a frontoparietal brain network, and focal damage to these regions suggests that fluid intelligence depends on their integrity. It is therefore possible that age-related functional differences in frontoparietal activity contribute to the reduction in fluid intelligence. This paper reports on analysis of the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) data, a large, population-based, healthy, adult lifespan cohort. The data support a model in which age-related differences in fluid intelligence are partially mediated by the responsiveness of frontoparietal regions to novel problem-solving. We first replicate a prior finding of such mediation using an independent sample. We then precisely localise the mediating brain regions, and show that mediation is specifically associated with voxels most activated by cognitive demand, but not with voxels suppressed by cognitive demand. We quantify the robustness of this result to potential unmodelled confounders, and estimate the causal direction of the effects. Finally, exploratory analyses suggest that neural mediation of age-related differences in fluid intelligence is moderated by the variety of regular physical activities, more reliably than by their frequency or duration. An additional moderating role of the variety of non-physical activities emerged when controlling for head motion. A better understanding of the mechanisms that link healthy aging with lower fluid intelligence may suggest strategies for mitigating such decline.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Presynaptic contact and activity opposingly regulate postsynaptic dendrite outgrowth</a></h4>

              
                The organization of neural circuits determines nervous system function. Variability can arise during neural circuit development (e.g. neurite morphology, axon/dendrite position). To ensure robust nervous system function, mechanisms must exist to accommodate variation in neurite positioning during circuit formation. Previously we developed a model system in the Drosophila ventral nerve cord to conditionally induce positional variability of a proprioceptive sensory axon terminal, and used this model to show that when we altered the presynaptic position of the sensory neuron, its major postsynaptic interneuron partner modified its dendritic arbor to match the presynaptic contact, resulting in functional synaptic input (Sales et al., 2019). Here we investigate the cellular mechanisms by which the interneuron dendrites detect and match variation in presynaptic partner location and input strength. We manipulate the presynaptic sensory neuron by (a) ablation; (b) silencing or activation; or (c) altering its location in the neuropil. From these experiments we conclude that there are two opposing mechanisms used to establish functional connectivity in the face of presynaptic variability: presynaptic contact stimulates dendrite outgrowth locally, whereas presynaptic activity inhibits postsynaptic dendrite outgrowth globally. These mechanisms are only active during an early larval critical period for structural plasticity. Collectively, our data provide new insights into dendrite development, identifying mechanisms that allow dendrites to flexibly and robustly respond to developmental variability in presynaptic location and input strength.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Arc Regulates a "Second-Guessing" Cognitive Bias During Naturalistic Foraging</a></h4>

              
                Foraging involves innate decision heuristics that are adapted for the wild but can cause economically irrational cognitive biases in some contexts. The mechanisms underlying cognitive biases are poorly understood but likely involve genetic mechanisms. Here, we investigate foraging in fasted mice using a naturalistic paradigm and uncover an innate "second-guessing" cognitive bias that involves repeatedly investigating a former depleted food patch instead of consuming available food. Second guessing is economically irrational because it incurs energetic costs in place of caloric benefits. Since learning and memory are involved, we tested roles for Arc and found that Arc-/- mice lack second guessing, which causes increased food consumption in males during foraging. Using unsupervised machine learning, decompositions of Arc-/- and +/+ mouse behavior show that Arc affects discrete foraging sequences involved in second-guessing and later stages of memory. Thus, revealing a genetic basis for this bias and ethological role for Arc in a naturalistic behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">DREADD activation of the lateral septum alters prosocial and antisocial behaviors, but not partner preferences in male prairie voles</a></h4>

              
                Although much has been written on the topic of social behavior, many terms referring to different aspects of social behavior have become inappropriately conflated and the specific mechanisms governing them remains unclear. It is therefore critical that we disentangle the pro- and anti-social elements associated with different forms of social behavior to fully understand the social brain. The lateral septum (LS) mediates social behaviors, emotional processes, and stress responses necessary for individuals to navigate day-to-day social interactions. The LS is particularly important in general and selective prosocial behavior (monogamy) but its role in how these two behavioral domains intersect is unclear. Here, we investigate the effects of chemogenetic-mediated LS activation on social responses in male prairie voles when they are 1) sex-naive and generally affiliative and 2) after they become pair-bonded and display selective aggression. Amplifying neural activity in the LS augments same-sex social approach behaviors. Despite partner preference formation remaining unaltered, LS activation in pair-bonded males leads to reduced selective aggression while increasing social affiliative behaviors. These results suggest that LS activation alters behavior within certain social contexts, by increasing sex-naive affiliative behaviors and reducing pair bonding-induced selective aggression with same-sex conspecifics, but not altering bonding with opposite-sex individuals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating the capabilities and challenges of layer-fMRI VASO at 3T</a></h4>

              
                Sub-millimeter functional imaging has the potential to capture cortical layer-specific functional information flow within and across brain systems. Recent sequence advancements of fMRI signal readout and contrast generations resulted in wide adaptation of layer-fMRI protocols across the global ultra high-field (UHF) neuroimaging community. However, most layer-fMRI applications are confined to one of {approx}100 privileged UHF imaging centers, and sequence contrasts with unwanted sensitivity to large draining veins. In this work, we propose the application of vein-signal free vascular space occupancy (VASO) sequences at widely accessible 3T scanners. Specifically, we implement, characterize, and apply a cerebral blood volume (CBV)-sensitive VASO fMRI at a 3T scanner setup, as it is typically used in the majority of cognitive neuroscience and clinical neuroscience fMRI studies. We find that the longer T2*, and stronger relative T1 contrast at 3T can account for some of the lower z-magnetization in the inversion-recovery VASO sequence compared to 7T and 9.4T. In the main series of experiments (N=16), we test the utility of this setup for motor tasks and find that -while being limited by thermal noise- 3T layer-fMRI VASO is feasible within conventional scan durations. In a series of auxiliary studies, we furthermore explore the generalizability of the developed protocols for a larger range of study designs including: visual stimulation, whole brain movie watching paradigms, and cognitive tasks with weaker effect sizes. We hope that the developed imaging protocols will help to increase accessibility of vein-free layer-fMRI imaging tools to a wider community of neuroimaging centers.

                Humans synchronize with one another to foster successful interactions. Here, we use a multimodal data fusion approach with the aim of elucidating the neurobiological mechanisms by which interpersonal neural synchronization (INS) occurs. Our meta-analysis of 22 functional magnetic resonance imaging and 69 near-infrared spectroscopy hyperscanning experiments (740 and 3,721 subjects) revealed robust brain-region correlates of INS in the right temporoparietal junction and left ventral prefrontal cortex. Integrating this meta-analytic information with public databases, biobehavioral and brain-functional association analyses suggested that INS involves sensory-integrative hubs with functional connections to mentalizing and attention networks. On the molecular and genetic levels, we found INS to be associated with GABAergic neurotransmission and layer IV/V neuronal circuits, protracted developmental gene expression patterns, and disorders of neurodevelopment. Although limited by the indirect nature of phenotypic-molecular association analyses, our findings generate new testable hypotheses on the neurobiological basis of INS.

                The underlying anatomical structure is fundamental to the study of brain networks and is likely to play a key role in the generation of conscious experience. We conduct a computational and graph-theoretical study of the human structural connectome incorporating a variety of subcortical structures including the brainstem, which is typically not considered in similar studies. Our computational scheme involves the use of Python DIPY and Nibabel libraries to develop an averaged structural connectome comprised of 100 healthy adult subjects. We then compute degree, eigenvector, and betweenness centralities to identify several highly connected structures and find that the brainstem ranks highest across all examined metrics. Our results highlight the importance of including the brainstem in structural network analyses. We suggest that structural network-based methods can inform theories of consciousness, such as global workspace theory (GWT), integrated information theory (IIT), and the thalamocortical loop theory.

                The discovery that the structural connectome serves as a compact representation of brain activity allowed us to apply compressed sensing to M/EEG source reconstruction of brain electrical activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural integration and segregation revealed by a joint time-vertex connectome spectral analysis</a></h4>

              
                Brain oscillations are produced by the coordinated activity of large groups of neurons and different rhythms are thought to reflect different modes of information processing. These modes, in turn, are known to occur at different spatial scales. Nevertheless, how these rhythms support different modes of information processing at the brain scale is not yet fully understood. Here we present "Joint Time-Vertex Connectome Spectral Analysis", a framework for characterizing the spectral content of brain activity both in time (temporal frequencies) and in space (spatial connectome harmonics). This method allows us to estimate the contribution of integration (global communication) and segregation (functional specialization) mechanisms at different temporal frequency bands in source-reconstructed M/EEG signals, thus providing a better understanding of the complex interplay between different information processing modes. We validated our method on two different datasets, an auditory steady-state response (ASSR) and a visual grating task. Our results suggest that different information processing mechanisms are carried out at different frequency channels: while integration seems to be a specific mechanism occurring at low temporal frequencies (alpha and theta), segregation is only observed at higher temporal frequencies (high and low gamma). Crucially, the estimated contribution of the integration and segregation mechanisms predicts performance in a behavioral task, demonstrating the neurophysiological relevance of this new framework.

                Neural trajectories constitute propagating sequences of activity that are essential to cognitive representations. Understanding how neural trajectories overcome the disorganizing influence of neural noise in the awake state remains challenging. Theoretical and artificial network models have focused on optimizing the synaptic pathways underlying trajectory propagation. However, in a biophysical network with synaptic plasticity, solely altering synaptic connectivity induces a tight tradeoff between spurious trajectory interruptions and inductions by noise. Formal analysis predicts that separating the inhibitory fluctuations-driven spontaneous activity from the excitatory-driven trajectory propagation is key to reliable triggering and propagation. Amongst biophysical solutions, calcium-activated suprathreshold intrinsic conductances provided the best trajectory reliability by mitigating the reliance of propagation on connectivity. These mechanisms display parametric robustness and generalize to a variety of static and dynamic attractors with uni- and bidirectional propagation. Thus, we provide a unified framework for cognitive-associated neural trajectories robust to neural noise in the awake state.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Anticipation of appetitive operant action induces sustained dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens</a></h4>

              
                The mesolimbic dopamine system is implicated in signaling reward-related information as well as in actions that generate rewarding outcomes. These implications are commonly investigated in either Pavlovian or operant reinforcement paradigms, where only the latter requires instrumental action. To parse contributions of reward- and action-related information to dopamine signals, we directly compared the two paradigms: rats underwent either Pavlovian or operant conditioning while dopamine release was measured in the nucleus accumbens, a brain region central for processing this information. Task conditions were identical with the exception of the operant-lever response requirement. Rats in both groups released the same quantity of dopamine at the onset of the reward-predictive cue. However, only the operant-conditioning group showed a subsequent, sustained plateau in dopamine concentration throughout the entire five-second cue presentation (preceding the required action). This dopamine ramp was unaffected by probabilistic reward delivery, occurred exclusively prior to operant actions, and was not related to task performance or task acquisition, as it persisted throughout the two-week daily behavioral training. Instead, the ramp flexibly increased in duration with longer cue presentation, seemingly modulating the initial cue-onset triggered dopamine release (i.e., the reward-prediction error (RPE) signal), as both signal amplitude and sustain diminished when reward timing was made more predictable. Thus, our findings suggest that RPE and action components of dopamine release can be differentiated temporally into phasic and ramping/sustained signals, respectively, where the latter depends on the former and presumably reflects the anticipation or incentivization of appetitive action, conceptually akin to motivation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Exploring Neural Heterogeneity in Inattention and Hyperactivity</a></h4>

              
                Inattention and hyperactivity are cardinal symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). These characteristics have also been observed across a range of other neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism and dyspraxia, suggesting that they might best be studied across diagnostic categories. Here, we evaluated the associations between inattention and hyperactivity behaviours and features of the structural brain network (connectome) in a large transdiagnostic sample of children (Centre for Attention, Learning, and Memory; n = 383). In our sample, we found that a single latent factor explains 77.6% of variance in scores across multiple questionnaires measuring inattention and hyperactivity. Partial Least-Squares (PLS) regression revealed that variability in this latent factor could not be explained by a linear component representing nodewise properties of connectomes. We then investigated the type and extent of neural heterogeneity in a subset of our sample with clinically-elevated levels of inattention and hyperactivity. Multidimensional scaling combined with k-means clustering revealed two neural subtypes in children with elevated levels of inattention and hyperactivity (n = 232), differentiated primarily by nodal communicability - a measure which demarcates the extent to which neural signals propagate through specific brain regions. These different clusters had indistinguishable behavioural profiles, which included high levels of inattention and hyperactivity. However, one of the clusters scored higher on multiple cognitive assessment measures of executive function. We conclude that inattention and hyperactivity are so common in children with neurodevelopmental difficulties because they emerge from multiple different trajectories of brain development. In our own data, we can identify two of these possible trajectories, which are reflected by measures of structural brain network topology and cognition.

                Flexible Electrocorticography (ECoG) electrode arrays that conform to the cortical surface and record surface field potentials from multiple brain regions provide unique insights into how computations occurring in distributed brain regions mediate behavior. Current flexible ECoG devices require highly specialized microfabrication methods, precluding the ability to fabricate customizable and low-cost flexible ECoG devices easily. Here we present a fully desktop fabricated flexible graphene ECoG array. First, we synthesized a stable, conductive ink via liquid exfoliation of Graphene in Cyrene. Next, we have established a stencil-printing process for patterning the graphene ink via laser-cut stencils on flexible polyimide substrates. Benchtop tests indicate that the graphene electrodes have good conductivity of ~ 1.1 x 103 S.cm-1, flexibility to maintain their electrical connection under static bending, and electrochemical stability in a 15-day accelerated corrosion test. Chronically implanted graphene ECoG devices remain fully functional for up to 180 days, with average in vivo impedances of 24.72 {+/-} 95.23 k{Omega} at 1 kHz. The ECoG device can measure spontaneous surface field potentials from mice under awake and anesthetized states and sensory stimulus-evoked responses. The stencil-printing fabrication process can be used to create Graphene ECoG devices with customized electrode layouts within 24 hours using commonly available laboratory equipment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinguishing strategic orienting toward memory age from retrieval difficulty: An ERP study</a></h4>

              
                A well-established finding in episodic memory research is that the likelihood of successful retrieval is affected by the age of the targeted memory (i.e. based on the duration of the encoding-retrieval interval). Although such findings are usually interpreted in terms of the memory trace changing in quality or accessibility over time, there is growing evidence that retrieval also depends on how well search attempts can be strategically oriented. Here, we investigated the strategic orienting of retrieval processing, as indexed by event-related brain potentials (ERPs), when retrieval was aimed toward candidate memories of different ages. As retrieving remote versus recent memories is associated with increased difficulty, the current study was designed to dissociate the difficulty and memory age effects. Subjects encoded two lists of pictures separated by one week, with the items in each list presented once or four times. A series of memory tests targeting pictures from only one week-by-repetition condition at a time were then completed, while new pictures and those from the other conditions were rejected. Consistent with previous results, new-item ERPs were more positive over posterior scalp when recent compared to remote lists were targeted. Importantly, this difference remained when difficulty was matched, and the ERP correlates of difficulty were distinct in both timing and polarity from those of orienting. Together, these findings provide further support for the idea that the age of a targeted memory alone can lead to the adoption of retrieval orienting strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Muscle synergies are flexibly recruited during gait pattern exploration using motor control-based biofeedback</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how the central nervous system coordinates diverse motor outputs has been a topic of extensive investigation. While it is generally accepted that a small set of synergies underlies many common activities, such as walking, whether synergies are equally robust across a broader array of gait patterns or can be flexibly modified remains unclear. Here, we evaluated the extent to which synergies changed as nondisabled adults (n = 14) explored gait patterns using custom biofeedback. Secondarily, we used Bayesian Additive Regression Trees to identify factors which were predictive of synergy modulation. Participants performed 41.1 {+/-} 8.0 gait patterns using biofeedback, during which synergy recruitment changed depending on the type and magnitude of gait pattern modification. Specifically, a consistent set of synergies was recruited to accommodate small deviations from baseline, but additional synergies emerged for larger gait changes. Synergy complexity was similarly modulated; complexity decreased for 82.6% of the attempted gait patterns, however, distal gait mechanics were highly predictive of these changes. In particular, greater ankle dorsiflexion moments and knee flexion through stance, as well as greater knee extension moments at initial contact corresponded to a reduction in synergy complexity. Taken together, these results suggest that the central nervous system preferentially adopts a low-dimensional, largely invariant control strategy, but can modify that strategy to produce diverse gait patterns. Beyond improving understanding of how synergies are recruited during gait, study outcomes may also help identify parameters that can be targeted with interventions to alter synergies and improve motor control following neurological injury.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rhesus Infant Nervous Temperament Predicts Peri-Adolescent Central Amygdala Metabolism & Behavioral Inhibition Measured by a Machine-Learning Approach</a></h4>

              
                Anxiety disorders affect millions of people worldwide and impair health, happiness, and productivity on a massive scale. Developmental research points to a connection between early-life behavioral inhibition and the eventual development of these disorders. Our group has previously shown that measures of behavioral inhibition in young rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) predict anxiety-like behavior later in life. In recent years, clinical and basic researchers have implicated the central extended amygdala (EAc), a neuroanatomical concept that includes the central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), as a key neural substrate for the expression of anxious and inhibited behavior. An improved understanding of how early-life behavioral inhibition relates to an increased lifetime risk of anxiety disorders, and how this relationship is mediated by alterations in the EAc, could lead to improved treatments and preventive strategies. In this study, we explored the relationships between infant behavioral inhibition and peri-adolescent defensive behavior and brain metabolism in 18 female rhesus monkeys. We coupled a mildly threatening behavioral assay with concurrent multimodal neuroimaging, and related those findings to various measures of infant temperament. To score the behavioral assay, we developed and validated UC-Freeze, a semi-automated machine-learning (ML) tool that uses unsupervised clustering to quantify freezing. Consistent with previous work, we found that heightened Ce metabolism predicted elevated defensive behavior (i.e., more freezing) in the presence of an unfamiliar human intruder. Although we found no link between infant inhibited temperament and peri-adolescent EAc metabolism or defensive behavior, we did identify infant nervous temperament as a significant predictor of peri-adolescent defensive behavior. Our findings suggest a connection between infant nervous temperament and the eventual development of anxiety and depressive disorders. Moreover, our approach highlights the potential for ML tools to augment existing behavioral neuroscience methods.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deciphering structural asymmetry of the habenula in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Functional laterality of the habenula has been suggested in both animal models and the humans. Understanding this evolutionarily conserved brain feature is of fundamental importance and has been attracting attention due to its potential role in human cognition and a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. Deciphering structural asymmetry of the human habenula remains to be challenging. Here, we present a large-scale meta-analysis of the left-right differences in the habenular volume in the human brain with 52 datasets (N = 1,427), and also assessed the potential moderating effects of the sampling variability and other methodological factors. Results showed significant heterogeneity in the left-right differences across the datasets, which seems to be mainly due to different MRI scanners and segmentation approaches used. While little evidence was found for the volume asymmetry across all the datasets, the most pronounced and significant leftward asymmetry was found in the datasets from 3 T scanners and when using manual segmentation approaches. We did not find significant disorder-related differences relative to healthy controls in either the left-right asymmetry or the unilateral volume. This study not only provides useful data for future studies of brain imaging and methodological developments related to precision habenula measurements, but also helps to understand potential roles of habenular laterality in health and disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Epigenetic Modifier Kdm6a/Utx Controls the Specification of Hypothalamic Neuronal Subtypes in a Sex-Dependent Manner</a></h4>

              
                Kdm6a is an X chromosome-linked H3K27me2/3 demethylase that promotes chromatin accessibility and gene transcription and is critical for tissue/cell-specific differentiation. Previous results showed higher Kdm6a levels in XX than in XY hypothalamic neurons and a female-specific requirement for Kdm6a in mediating increased axogenesis before brain masculinization. Here we explored the sex-specific role of Kdm6a in the specification of neuronal subtypes in the developing hypothalamus. Hypothalamic neuronal cultures were established from sex-segregated E14 mouse embryos and transfected with siRNAs to knockdown Kdm6a expression (Kdm6a-KD). We evaluated by immunofluorescence the effect of Kdm6a-KD on Ngn3, a bHLH transcription factor regulating neuronal sub-specification in hypothalamus. Kdm6a-KD decreased Ngn3 expression in females but not in males, abolishing basal sex differences. Then, we analyzed Kdm6a-KD effect on Ascl1, Pomc, Npy, Sf1, Gad1 and Th expression by RT-qPCR. While Kdm6a-KD downregulated Ascl1 in both sexes equally, we found sex-specific results for Pomc, Npy and Th. Pomc and Th expressed higher in female than in male neurons and Kdm6a-KD reduced their levels only in females, while Npy expressed higher in male than in female neurons and Kdm6a-KD upregulated its expression only in females. Identical results were found by immunofluorescence for Pomc and Npy neuropeptides. Finally, using ChIP-qPCR we found higher H3K27me3 levels at Ngn3, Pomc and Npy promoters in male neurons, in line with Kdm6a higher expression and demethylase activity in females. These results indicate that Kdm6a plays a key sex-specific role in controlling the differentiation of neuronal populations regulating food intake and energy homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">To praise or to blame? Neural signals predict divergent responses to moral hypocrisy.</a></h4>

              
                Moral hypocrisy is common in society and could be discouraged if observers always respond negatively. Understanding the observers' responses to moral hypocrisy is critical for promoting genuine morality. This study took the perspective from the observers and compared their behavioral and neural responses to moral hypocrisy versus clear moral/immoral acts. Behaviorally, we found that claiming to help but avoiding the cost of help (i.e., moral hypocrisy) was endorsed as more moral than rejecting to help and even received monetary praise from 40% of observers. Neurally, moral hypocrisy versus clear moral acts elicited reduced responses in the reward system (e.g., ventromedial prefrontal cortex) and increased responses in regions responsible for disgust (e.g., anterior insula). The neural signals together with the interplay to the mentalizing network (e.g., temporoparietal junction) predicted divergent responses, even five months later. Our findings provide behavioral and neural accounts of how hypocrisy is perceived and why it prevails.

                The twin pandemics of opioid abuse and HIV infection can have devastating effects on physiological systems, including on the brain. Our previous work found that morphine increased the viral reservoir in the brains of treated SIV-infected macaques. In this study, we investigated the interaction of morphine and SIV to identify novel host-specific targets using a multimodal approach. We probed systemic parameters and performed single-cell examination of the targets for infection in the brain, microglia and macrophages. Morphine treatment created an immunosuppressive environment, blunting initial responses to infection, which persisted during antiretroviral treatment. Antiretroviral drug concentrations and penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid and brain were unchanged by morphine treatment. Interestingly, the transcriptional signature of both microglia and brain macrophages was transformed to one of a neurodegenerative phenotype. Notably, the expression of osteopontin, a pleiotropic cytokine, was significantly elevated in microglia. This was especially notable in the white matter, which is also dually affected by HIV and opioids. Increased osteopontin expression was linked to numerous HIV neuropathogenic mechanisms, including those that can maintain a viral reservoir. The opioid morphine is detrimental to SIV/HIV infection, especially in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ketamine selectively changes outcome valuation in a biased matching pennies task</a></h4>

              
                Throughout our daily lives we make multitudes of decisions. Occasionally, these decisions may lead to favorable outcomes, such as gains, while at other times they may lead to unfavorable outcomes, such as losses. We generally tend to repeat those decisions that have led to favorable outcomes in the past, and we tend to refrain from repeating those decisions that previously led to unfavorable outcomes. How relevant information is integrated over time in order to form optimal decisions is likely influenced by NMDA receptor activity. Here we tested the effects of ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, which has been suggested to affect a wide array of cognitive functions, on choice behavior in a biased matching pennies task in monkeys. In this task, monkeys had to collect six tokens in order to receive a reward. With every binary choice, monkeys would either gain tokens, lose tokens or the number of tokens would remain unchanged. Monkeys generally tended to switch choice targets following losses and to repeat choice targets following gains. Low doses of ketamine temporarily changed choice behavior in particular following unfavorable (loss or neutral) outcomes, but not after favorable (gain) outcomes. Specifically, monkeys were less likely to switch away from a choice target after it had led to an unfavorable outcome under ketamine conditions. Reinforcement learning models suggest that ketamine independently and to varying degrees increased the value of the three possible outcomes in this task. The strongest value increase occurred for loss outcomes. This was the case when ketamine was administered intramuscularly or intranasally, whereby intranasal ketamine induced substantially less side-effects on eye movements. Overall, we found evidence that ketamine may temporarily mitigate in particular the negative valuations of unfavorable outcomes, potentially allowing some insights into its underlying cognitive effects.

                Neuroinflammation plays an important role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. The cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2R) is an emerging target for neuroinflammation and therapeutics of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we aimed to assess the alterations in brain CB2R levels and evaluate novel CB2R imaging tracers in the arcA{beta} mouse model of Alzheimer's disease amyloidosis. Immunohistochemical staining for A{beta} deposits (6E10), microgliosis (anti-Iba1 and anti-CD68 antibodies), astrocytes (GFAP) and the anti-CB2R antibody was performed on brain slices from arcA{beta} mice 17 months of age. Autoradiography using the CB2R imaging probes [18F]RoSMA-18-d6, [11C]RSR-056 and [11C]RS-028 and mRNA analysis were performed in brain tissue from arcA{beta} and nontransgenic littermate (NTL) mice at 6, 17, and 24 months of age. Specific increased CB2R immunofluorescence intensities on the increased number of GFAP-positive astrocytes and Iba1-positive microglia were detected in the hippocampus and cortex of 17-month-old arcA{beta} mice compared to NTL mice. CB2R immunofluorescence was higher in the glial cells inside 6E10-positive amyloid-{beta} deposits than peri-plaque with a low background. Ex vivo autoradiography showed that the binding of [18F]RoSMA-18-d6 and [11C]RSR-056 was comparable in arcA{beta} and NTL mice at 6, 17 and 24 months. The level of Cnr2 mRNA expression in the brain was not significantly different between arcA{beta} and NTL mice at 6, 17 or 24 months. In conclusion, we demonstrated pronounced specific increases in microglial and astroglial CB2R expression levels in a model of AD-related cerebral amyloidosis/AD mouse model, emphasizing CB2R as a suitable target for imaging neuroinflammation.

                Schemas, or internal representation models of the environment, are thought to be central in organising our everyday life behaviour by giving stability and predictiveness to the structure of the world. However, when an element from an unfolding event mismatches the schema-derived expectations, the coherent narrative is interrupted and an update to the current event model representation is required. Here, we asked whether the perceived incongruence of an item from an unfolding event and its impact on memory relied on the disruption of neural stability patterns preceded by the neural reactivation of the memory representations of the just-encoded event. Our study includes data from 3 different experiments whereby participants encoded images of target objects preceded by trial-unique sequences of events depicting daily routine. We found that neural stability patterns gradually increased throughout the ongoing exposure to a schema-consistent episodic narrative and that the brain stability pattern was interrupted when the encoding of an object of the event was lowly congruent within the ongoing schema representation. We found that the decrease in neural stability for low-congruence items was best seen at {+/-} 1000 ms from object encoding onset when compared to high-congruence items and that this effect was preceded by an enhanced N400 ERP and an increased degree of neural reactivation of the just-encoded episode for low-congruence items. Current results offer new insights into the neural mechanisms and their temporal orchestration that are engaged during online encoding of schema-consistent episodic narratives and the detection of incongruencies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">On the functional role of gamma synchronization in the retinogeniculate system of the cat</a></h4>

              
                Fast gamma oscillations, generated within the retina, and transmitted to the cortex via the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), are thought to carry information about stimulus size and continuity. This hypothesis relies mainly on studies carried out under anesthesia and the extent to which it holds under more naturalistic conditions remains unclear. Using multi-electrode recordings of spiking activity in the retina and the LGN of the cat, we show that visually driven gamma oscillations are absent for awake states and are highly dependent on halothane (or isoflurane). Under ketamine, responses were non-oscillatory, as in the awake condition. Response entrainment to the monitor refresh was commonly observed up to 120 Hz and was superseded by the gamma oscillatory responses induced by halothane. Given that retinal gamma oscillations are contingent upon halothane anesthesia and absent in the awake cat, such oscillations should be considered artifactual, thus playing no functional role in vision.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ubiquitination of the GluA1 subunit of AMPA receptors is required for synaptic plasticity, memory and cognitive flexibility</a></h4>

              
                Activity-dependent changes in the number of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) at the synapse underpin the expression of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), cellular correlates of learning and memory. Post-translational ubiquitination has emerged as a key regulator of the trafficking and surface expression of AMPARs, with ubiquitination of the GluA1 subunit at Lys-868 controlling the post-endocytic sorting of the receptors into the late endosome for degradation, and thereby regulating their stability at synapses. However, the physiological significance of GluA1 ubiquitination remains unknown. In this study, we generated mice with a knock-in mutation in the major GluA1 ubiquitination site (K868R) to investigate the role of GluA1 ubiquitination in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. Our results reveal that these mice have normal basal synaptic transmission but exhibit enhanced LTP and deficits in LTD. They also display deficits in short-term spatial memory and cognitive flexibility. These findings underscore the critical roles of GluA1 ubiquitination for bidirectional synaptic plasticity and cognition.

	<p>Despite reports of a high incidence and various predictors of post-stroke depression (PSD), the underdiagnosis and undertreatment rates of PSD are still high. This study aimed to examine the incidence of depression in stroke patients and identify factors associated with PSD. This was a retrospective cohort study on ischemic stroke patients from the Geisinger Neuroscience Ischemic Stroke (GNSIS) registry. The following statistical analyses were performed to predict PSD in the studied population: a Kaplan&amp;amp;ndash;Meier estimator and a Cox proportional hazards model. A total of 5882 patients were included in the study. The median age at the time of an ischemic stroke was 72 years and 56% were males. A total of 294 patients were diagnosed with PSD within one year of a stroke. The cumulative incidence of depression was found to be 6.4% (95% CI 5.7&amp;amp;ndash;7.1%) at one year for the entire cohort. Women were found to have a higher risk of PSD than men (HR for women = 1.47, 95% CI 1.18&amp;amp;ndash;1.85, p = 0.001). A history of prior stroke (HR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.18&amp;amp;ndash;2.11, p = 0.002) and myocardial infarction (HR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.05&amp;amp;ndash;2.06, p = 0.025) were associated with PSD. Medicaid patients had a higher risk for PSD (HR = 2.16, 95% CI 1.5&amp;amp;ndash;3.12, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) than those with commercial insurance or health maintenance organization plans. Our findings showed that women, patients with a history of prior stroke or myocardial infarction, and with Medicaid insurance were more likely to develop PSD. Through an observational study on the EHR data, we confirmed that chronic stress, including financial and health-related stress, irrespective of age, significantly increased the risk for PSD.</p>

	<p>Background: Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein immunoglobulin G (MOG-IgG) has been considered a diagnostic marker for patients with demyelinating disease, termed &amp;amp;ldquo;MOG-IgG associated disorder&amp;amp;rdquo; (MOGAD). Recently, the coexistence of MOG-IgG and other neuronal or glial antibodies has attracted extensive attention from clinicians. In this article, we systematically review the characteristics of MOG-IgG-related antibody coexistence syndrome. Methods: Two authors independently searched PubMed for relevant studies published before October 2021. We also manually searched the references of each related article. The appropriateness of the included studies was assessed by reading the titles, abstracts, and full texts if necessary. Results: Thirty-five relevant publications that met our inclusion criteria were finally included, of which fourteen were retrospective studies and twenty-one were case reports. A total of 113 patients were reported to show the coexistence of MOG-IgG and neuronal or glial antibodies. Additionally, 68.14% of patients were double positive for MOG-IgG and N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor-IgG (NMDAR-IgG), followed by 23.01% of patients who were double positive for MOG-IgG and aquaporin4-IgG (AQP4-IgG). Encephalitis was the predominant phenotype when MOG-IgG coexisted with NMDAR-IgG, probably accompanied by imaging features of demyelination. Patients with dual positivity for MOG-IgG and AQP4-IgG experienced more severe disease and more frequent relapses. The coexistence of MOG-IgG and antibodies other than NMDAR-IgG and AQP4-IgG was extremely rare, and the clinical presentations were diverse and atypical. Except for patients who were double positive for MOG-IgG and AQP4-IgG, most patients with multiple antibodies had a good prognosis. Conclusions: MOG-IgG may coexist with neuronal or glial antibodies. Expanded screening for neuronal or glial antibodies should be performed in patients with atypical clinical and radiological features.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: This systematic review aimed to focus on the effects of rehabilitation interventions combined with noninvasive brain stimulation on upper limb motor function in stroke patients. (2) Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, and CINAHL were used for the literature research. Articles were searched using the following terms: &amp;amp;ldquo;Stroke OR CVA OR cerebrovascular accident&amp;amp;rdquo; AND &amp;amp;ldquo;upper limb OR upper extremity&amp;amp;rdquo; AND &amp;amp;ldquo;NIBS OR Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation&amp;amp;rdquo; OR &amp;amp;ldquo;rTMS&amp;amp;rdquo; OR &amp;amp;ldquo;repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation&amp;amp;rdquo; OR &amp;amp;ldquo;tDCS&amp;amp;rdquo; OR &amp;amp;ldquo;transcranial direct current stimulation&amp;amp;rdquo; AND &amp;amp;ldquo;RCT&amp;amp;rdquo; OR randomized control trial.&amp;amp;rdquo; In total, 12 studies were included in the final analysis. (3) Results: Analysis using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale for qualitative evaluation of the literature rated eight articles as &amp;amp;ldquo;excellent&amp;amp;rdquo; and four as &amp;amp;ldquo;good.&amp;amp;rdquo; Combined rehabilitation interventions included robotic therapy, motor imagery using brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interaction, sensory control, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, task-oriented approach, task-oriented mirror therapy, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, and behavior observation therapy. (4) Conclusions: Although it is difficult to estimate the recovery of upper limb motor function in stroke patients treated with noninvasive brain stimulation alone, a combination of a task-oriented approach, occupational therapy, action observation, wrist robot-assisted rehabilitation, and physical therapy can be effective.</p>

     alt="Localization of chemical synapses and modulatory release sites in the cardiac ganglion of the crab, Cancer borealis"/>
<p>The crustacean cardiac ganglion is a heavily modulated nine-neuron central pattern generator. We describe the distribution of chemical synapses and several neuromodulators within this system, which includes unusual clusters of synapsin-like immunoreactivity surrounding motor neuron cell bodies. These putative synapses near somata colocalize with many neuromodulators including the excitatory peptide proctolin (shown).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The crustacean cardiac ganglion (CG) comprises nine neurons that provide rhythmic drive to the heart. The CG is the direct target of multiple modulators. Synapsin-like immunoreactivity was found clustered around the somata of the large cells (LC) and in a neuropil at the anterior branch of the CG trunk of <i>Cancer borealis</i>. This implicates the soma as a key site of synaptic integration, an unusual configuration in invertebrates. Proctolin is an excitatory neuromodulator of the CG, and proctolin-like immunoreactivity exhibited partial overlap with putative chemical synapses near the LCs and at the neuropil. A proctolin-like projection was also found in a pair of excitatory nerves entering the CG. GABA-like immunoreactivity was nearly completely colocalized with chemical synapses near the LCs but absent at the anterior branch neuropil. GABA-like projections were found in a pair of inhibitory nerves entering the CG. <i>C. borealis</i> Allatostatin B1 (CbASTB), red pigment concentrating hormone, and FLRFamide-like immunoreactivity each had a unique pattern of staining and co-localization with putative chemical synapses. These results provide morphological evidence that synaptic input is integrated at LC somata in the CG. Our findings provide a topographical organization for some of the multiple inhibitory and excitatory modulators that alter the rhythmic output of this semi-autonomous motor circuit.</p>

<h2>Graphical Abstract</h2>
<p>The large black beetle, the chafer <i>Holotrichia parallela</i>, shows a unique ca. 48-h endogenous rhythm (viz., a circabidian rhythm) in appearance on the ground. The ecological significance and the molecular mechanism remain obscure, but a previous study implied that the circadian clock system is responsible for the 2-day rhythm. In the present study, we investigated neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor-immunoreactive (PDF-ir) neurons in the brain of <i>H. parallela</i> in order to search for circadian neural components since PDF is a well-known output neuromodulator of circadian pacemakers in several insects. We anatomically identified ‚àº 100 PDF-ir cells near the accessory medulla (AME) in the optic lobe, which is a site for circadian pacemakers in the cockroach and flies, and furthermore, we found that their varicose terminal arbors in the lateral protocerebrum form output synapses upon unknown fibers as well as other PDF-ir fibers. Their conceivable function in the circabidian rhythm was discussed based on the anatomical insights.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) is a well-known output neuropeptide modulator of circadian pacemakers in insects. Here, we investigated PDF-immunoreactive (ir) neurons in the brain of the large black chafer <i>Holotrichia parallela</i> to search for circadian neural components, which are potentially involved in its circabidian rhythm. PDF-ir cells were exclusively detected near the accessory medulla (AME) as a cluster of ‚àº 100 cells with almost homogeneous size. No other cells exhibited immunoreactivity. The PDF-ir cells send beaded fibers into the proximal half of the AME and ventral elongation in an anterior region between the medulla (ME) and lobula (LO). Neither the lamina, ME, LO, nor lobula plate receives PDF-ir fibers. Primary axons derived from the PDF-ir cells extend toward the contralateral hemisphere through the dorsolateral protocerebrum anterior to the calyx to connect the bilateral AME. The axons form varicose outgrowths exclusively in the lateral protocerebrum. Double labeling with antisynapsin revealed partial overlaps between PDF-ir varicosities and synapsin-ir puncta. Thus, it was assumed that the PDF-ir fibers form output synapses there. To verify this, we investigated the ultrastructure of the PDF-ir varicosities in the lateral protocerebrum by preembedding immunoelectron microscopy. The PDF-ir profiles contain small clear synaptic vesicles as well as both PDF-positive and PDF-negative dense-core vesicles, and the profiles form output synapses upon unknown profiles and receive synapses from other PDF-ir profiles. PDF neurons near the AME are considered to be prominent circadian pacemakers in the cockroach and flies. Their possible function in the circabidian rhythm was discussed based on these anatomical insights.</p>

                Background: Optimum productivity of beef cattle is achieved with adequate feed supply, both in quality and quantity. Consumption of local feedstuff Neptunia plena L. Benth and Leersia hexandra Swartz as a ration by the animal subject is expected to promote cost efficiency and production, as well as provide essential nutrition needs. Therefore, this research aimed to evaluate dry matter digestibility (DMD), organic matter digestibility (OMD), N-NH3 production, and volatile fatty acid (VFA) in beef cattle. Methods: Feed and rumen inoculum samples were prepared and analyzed for their proximate contents. There were five treatment groups based on the diet received by beef cattle. In vitro approaches were used to determine the DMD, OMD, N-NH3 production, and VFA in beef cattle. The research was conducted in the Laboratory of Feed Nutrient Science, Faculty of Animal Husbandry and Agriculture, Diponegoro University, Semarang. The data were analyzed using ANOVA at a significance level of 95%, and a Duncan Multiple Range Test. Results: The results showed that the highest DMD (P<0.05) was derived from T5 (56.47%), followed by T4 (56.45%) and T3 (55.90%). T5=62.40% significantly (P<0.05) generated the highest OMD followed by T4=61.95% and T3=60.82%. This treatment had the highest N-NH3 value, namely 5.02 mM, compared with T3=4.55 mM, T4=4.50 mM, T2=4.22 mM, and T1=3.99 mM. Furthermore, T5 had the highest VFA (P<0.05) compared with T4, T3, T2, and T1 with the value of 150.5, 133.0, 130.5, 130.0, and 123.5 mM, respectively. Conclusions: The local feedstuff-based ration contributed to beef cattle production.

Each decade during the 70-year period from 1961 to 2021 has been examined in this study. Funding source, first author ‚Äì last author gender, their demographics and proportion of papers with at least one female author were the parameters considered while studying each publication. It was predicted that the number of female authors per paper would increase with time, as would the range of degrees held by the authors, demographical variations in authorship, and the funding source. The aim was also to determine the distribution of female first authors and senior authors in endocrinology journals over a 70-year period, as well as to check the gender combinations using the Punnett square.¬†¬† Results¬† Female initial authors rose from 7% to 29.6% (p<0.0006) between 1961 and 2021, whereas female senior authors rose from 15.6% to 22.2%. Despite women's small contributions to first and senior authors, female participation rose from 17.48% (25/143) to 70% (170/250) between 1961 and 2021. Male-Female¬†and Female-Male¬†combinations rose with Chi-Square = 124.6, (p<0.0001). Europe and the Americas had the most female academic medical contributors (p<0.0001) Regardless of author status, female participation rose from 17.48% in 1961 to 68% in 2021.¬† Conclusion¬†¬† In papers published in endocrinology journals, there was a rising trend in female contributions to academic medicine. Even with the large growth of female endocrinologists, there is still a disparity in why the increase in female authors is comparably fewer.

                Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines efficacy and safety have been tested in phase 3 studies in which cancer patients were not included or were underrepresented. Methods: The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety profile of the mRNA-1273 vaccine across cancer patients and its relationship to patients‚Äô demographics. We selected from our records all 18-years or older solid cancer patients under active treatment vaccinated with the complete three-dose schedule mRNA-1273 vaccine whose adverse drug reactions (ADRs) ¬†after each dose were recorded. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively to collect data between April 19, 2021, and December 31, 2021. Patients with documented previous infection by SARS-Cov-2 were excluded. Results: A total of 93 patients met the inclusion criteria. Local ADRs were reported more frequently after the first and second dose than after the third (41.9%, 43% and 31.1% of the patients respectively), while systemic ADRs followed the opposite pattern (16.1%, 34.4% and 52.6% of the patients respectively). We found a statistically significant association between sex and systemic adverse reactions after the third dose, p < 0.001 and between systemic adverse reactions after the second dose and systemic adverse reactions after the third dose, p = 0.001 A significant linear trend, p = 0.012, with a higher Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score associated with a lower proportion of patients suffering from systemic side effects was found. Women had 5.79 times higher odds to exhibit systemic ADRs after the third dose (p=0.01) compared to males. Increasing age was associated with a decreased likelihood of exhibiting ADRs (p=0.016). Conclusion:¬†The mRNA-1273 vaccine shows a tolerable safety profile. The likelihood of ADRs appears to be associated with gender and age. Its association with ECOG scores is less evident. Further studies are needed to elucidate this data in cancer patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The role of angiotensin receptor blocker (losartan) on decreasing fibrotic process of corpora cavernosa in priapism model of wistar rats [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Priapism induces regulation of Transforming Growth Factor-Œ≤1 (TGF-Œ≤1) expression and collagen-type-1 deposition. This will replace the normal corpora cavernosa with fibrotic tissue which eventually resulted in erectile dysfunction. It is also known that the fibrosis process of corpora cavernosa is related to Renin-Angiotensin II System (RAS). Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), especially losartan, inhibit the inflammation process and fibrotic tissue formation. This study evaluated the effect of losartan in reducing fibrosis in priapism by evaluating TGF-Œ≤1 and collagen-type-1 in cavernous tissue and determined the effect of losartan in preventing fibrosis in priapism model of Wistar rats assessed by the metavir score. Methods: A total of eighteen male Wistar rats mean were divided into five groups. For the priapism models, we applied negative pressure on the penis to make an artificial erection to mimic the priapism process. The control groups were observed and the treatment groups were orally given losartan 15 mg/kg/day. Corpora cavernosa was harvested for TGF-Œ≤1 and collagen-type-1 measurement using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The fibrotic tissue of each rat was then collected and assessed histopathologically with the metavir scoring system. Results: Penile TGF-Œ≤1 concentration in the losartan-treated group was not significantly different on day 10 and day 28 of observation (p10=0,30; p28=0,17). Meanwhile, collagen-type-1 concentration was significantly lower compared to control group (p10=0,002; p28=0,01). There was a significant difference in metavir scores in rats that received losartan and those who did not (p<0,05). Conclusion: Losartan could suppress the fibrosis process in the priapism model. It could decrease the collagen type 1 deposition during corpora cavernosa tissue regeneration. Based on the metavir score, the group receiving losartan therapy was better than the control group.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Epidemiological and evolutionary consequences of different types of CRISPR-Cas systems</a></h4>

              
                <p>by H√©l√®ne Chabas, Viktor M√ºller, Sebastian Bonhoeffer, Roland R. Regoes</p>

Bacteria have adaptive immunity against viruses (phages) in the form of CRISPR-Cas immune systems. Currently, 6 types of CRISPR-Cas systems are known and the molecular study of three of these has revealed important molecular differences. It is unknown if and how these molecular differences change the outcome of phage infection and the evolutionary pressure the CRISPR-Cas systems faces. To determine the importance of these molecular differences, we model a phage outbreak entering a population defending exclusively with a type I/II or a type III CRISPR-Cas system. We show that for type III CRISPR-Cas systems, rapid phage extinction is driven by the probability to acquire at least one resistance spacer. However, for type I/II CRISPR-Cas systems, rapid phage extinction is characterized by an a threshold-like behaviour: any acquisition probability below this threshold leads to phage survival whereas any acquisition probability above it, results in phage extinction. We also show that in the absence of autoimmunity, high acquisition rates evolve. However, when CRISPR-Cas systems are prone to autoimmunity, intermediate levels of acquisition are optimal during a phage outbreak. As we predict an optimal probability of spacer acquisition 2 factors of magnitude above the one that has been measured, we discuss the origin of such a discrepancy. Finally, we show that in a biologically relevant parameter range, a type III CRISPR-Cas system can outcompete a type I/II CRISPR-Cas system with a slightly higher probability of acquisition.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Turning promise into practice: Crop biotechnology for increasing genetic diversity and climate resilience</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sarah Garland, Helen Anne Curry</p>

As climate change increasingly threatens agricultural production, expanding genetic diversity in crops is an important strategy for climate resilience in many agricultural contexts. In this Essay, we explore the potential of crop biotechnology to contribute to this diversification, especially in industrialized systems, by using historical perspectives to frame the current dialogue surrounding recent innovations in gene editing. We unearth comments about the possibility of enhancing crop diversity made by ambitious scientists in the early days of recombinant DNA and follow the implementation of this technology, which has not generated the diversification some anticipated. We then turn to recent claims about the promise of gene editing tools with respect to this same goal. We encourage researchers and other stakeholders to engage in activities beyond the laboratory if they hope to see what is technologically possible translated into practice at this critical point in agricultural transformation.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Tau mediates synergistic influence of vascular risk and AŒ≤ on cognitive decline</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Elevated vascular risk and amyloid-beta (AŒ≤) burden have been synergistically associated with cognitive decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We examined whether accelerated longitudinal tau accumulation mediates the vascular risk-AŒ≤ interaction on cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 175 cognitively unimpaired older adults (age 70.5¬±8.0y). Baseline vascular risk was quantified using the office-based Framingham Heart Study general cardiovascular disease risk score (FHS-CVD). Baseline AŒ≤ burden was measured with Pittsburgh Compound-B PET. Tau burden was measured longitudinally (3.6¬±1.5y) with Flortaucipir PET, focusing on inferior temporal cortex (ITC). Cognition was assessed longitudinally (7.0¬±2.0y) using the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite. Linear mixed effects models examined the interactive effects of baseline vascular risk and AŒ≤ on longitudinal ITC tau. Additionally, moderated mediation was used to determine whether tau accumulation mediated the FHS-CVD*AŒ≤ effect on cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We observed a significant interaction between elevated baseline FHS-CVD and AŒ≤ on greater ITC tau accumulation (p=0.004), even in individuals with AŒ≤ burden below the conventional threshold for amyloid-positivity. Examining individual vascular risk factors, we found elevated systolic blood pressure and body mass index showed independent interactions with AŒ≤ on longitudinal tau (both p&lt;0.0001). ITC tau accumulation mediated 33% of the interactive association of FHS-CVD and AŒ≤ on cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Vascular risks interact with subthreshold levels of AŒ≤ to promote cognitive decline, partially by accelerating early neocortical tau accumulation. Our findings support vascular risk reduction, especially treating hypertension and obesity, to attenuate AŒ≤-related tau pathology and reduce late-life cognitive decline.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Decreasing Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Expenditures and Improving Quality at the Health System Level</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to evaluate a multicomponent health system intervention designed to reduce escalating disease-modifying treatment (DMT) expenditures and improve multiple sclerosis (MS) outcomes by increasing use of preferred formulary and highly effective DMTs (HETs).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a trend study of treatment utilization and expenditure outcomes prior to (2009‚Äì2011) and during (2012‚Äì2018) MS Treatment Optimization Program (MSTOP) implementation in Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) compared to a Kaiser Permanente region of similar size. Annual relapse rates (ARRs) were obtained from KPSC's electronic health records.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Adherence to preferred formulary DMTs increased from 25.4% in 2011 to 72.2% in 2017 following MSTOP implementation in KPSC and 22.1% to 43.8%, respectively, in the comparator. KPSC's annual DMT expenditures in 2018 were less than in 2011 despite an 11.3% increase in DMT-treated members. The decline in average per patient per year of treatment expenditures from a peak of $43.1¬†K in 2014 to $26.3¬†K in 2018 in KPSC was greater than the comparator, which peaked at $52.1¬†K and declined to $40.0‚ÄâK in 2018. Over the 7‚Äâyears following initiation of MSTOP, cumulative MS DMT expenditures were $161.6 million less than the comparator. HET use increased to 62.5% of per patient treatment-years versus 32.4% in the comparator. This corresponded to a 69% decline in adjusted ARR (95% confidence interval¬†=¬†64.1‚Äì73.2%; <i>p</i>¬†&lt;‚Äâ0.0001) among DMT-treated patients in KPSC.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A novel, expert-led health system intervention reduced MS DMT expenditures despite rising prices while simultaneously reducing MS relapse rates. Our focus on health system progress toward meaningful, measurable targets could serve as a model to improve quality and affordability of MS care in other settings.

                <p>Oxidative stress (OS) induces inflammation, which in turn exacerbates OS and the expression of acute phase proteins (APPs). Regulatory T lymphocyte (Treg) therapy was assessed for suppression of OS and APP responses in longitudinal serum samples from subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) enrolled in a phase I clinical trial. The first round of Treg therapy suppressed levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). During a 6-month washout period, ox-LDL levels increased. A second round of therapy again suppressed ox-LDL levels and then rose following the cessation of treatment. Serum levels of APPs, soluble CD14, lipopolysaccharide binding protein, and C-reactive protein, were stabilized during Treg administrations, but rose during the washout period and again after therapy was discontinued. Treg therapy potentially suppresses peripheral OS and the accompanying circulating pro-inflammatory induced APPs, both of which may serve as peripheral candidates for monitoring efficacies of immunomodulating therapies.

                <p>We sought to determine whether racial and socioeconomic disparities in the utilization of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD) have improved over time. We examined DBS utilization and analyzed factors associated with placement of DBS. The odds of DBS placement increased across the study period, whereas White patients with PD were 5 times more likely than Black patients to undergo DBS. Individuals, regardless of racial background, with 2 or more comorbidities were 14 times less likely to undergo DBS. Privately insured patients were 1.6 times more likely to undergo DBS. Despite increasing DBS utilization, significant disparities persist in access to DBS. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:246‚Äì254</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Human genomics established that pathogenic variation in diverse genes can underlie a single disorder. For example, hereditary spastic paraplegia is associated with &gt;80 genes, with frequently only few affected individuals described for each gene. Herein, we characterize a large cohort of individuals with biallelic variation in <i>ENTPD1</i>, a gene previously linked to spastic paraplegia 64 (Mendelian Inheritance in Man # 615683).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Individuals with biallelic <i>ENTPD1</i> variants were recruited worldwide. Deep phenotyping and molecular characterization were performed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 27 individuals from 17 unrelated families were studied; additional phenotypic information was collected from published cases. Twelve novel pathogenic <i>ENTPD1</i> variants are described (NM 001776.6): c.398_399delinsAA; p.(Gly133Glu), c.540del; p.(Thr181Leufs*18), c.640del; p.(Gly216Glufs*75), c.185‚ÄâT‚Äâ&gt;‚ÄâG; p.(Leu62*), c.1531‚ÄâT‚Äâ&gt;‚ÄâC; p.(*511Glnext*100), c.967C‚Äâ&gt;‚ÄâT; p.(Gln323*), c.414-2_414-1del, and c.146 A‚Äâ&gt;‚ÄâG; p.(Tyr49Cys) including 4 recurrent variants c.1109‚ÄâT‚Äâ&gt;‚ÄâA; p.(Leu370*), c.574-6_574-3del, c.770_771del; p.(Gly257Glufs*18), and c.1041del; p.(Ile348Phefs*19). Shared disease traits include childhood onset, progressive spastic paraplegia, intellectual disability (ID), dysarthria, and white matter abnormalities. <i>In vitro</i> assays demonstrate that <i>ENTPD1</i> expression and function are impaired and that c.574-6_574-3del causes exon skipping. Global metabolomics demonstrate <i>ENTPD1</i> deficiency leads to impaired nucleotide, lipid, and energy metabolism.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The <i>ENTPD1</i> locus trait consists of childhood disease onset, ID, progressive spastic paraparesis, dysarthria, dysmorphisms, and white matter abnormalities, with some individuals showing neurocognitive regression. Investigation of an allelic series of <i>ENTPD1</i> (1) expands previously described features of <i>ENTPD1</i>-related neurological disease, (2) highlights the importance of genotype-driven deep phenotyping, (3) documents the need for global collaborative efforts to characterize rare autosomal recessive disease traits, and (4) provides insights into disease trait neurobiology.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">ZSCAN1 Autoantibodies Are Associated with Pediatric Paraneoplastic ROHHAD</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Rapid-onset Obesity with Hypothalamic Dysfunction, Hypoventilation and Autonomic Dysregulation (ROHHAD), is a severe pediatric disorder of uncertain etiology resulting in hypothalamic dysfunction and frequent sudden death. Frequent co-occurrence of neuroblastic tumors have fueled suspicion of an autoimmune paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS); however, specific anti-neural autoantibodies, a hallmark of PNS, have not been identified. Our objective is to determine if an autoimmune paraneoplastic etiology underlies ROHHAD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Immunoglobulin G (IgG) from pediatric ROHHAD patients (n¬†=¬†9), non-inflammatory individuals (n¬†=¬†100) and relevant pediatric controls (n¬†=¬†25) was screened using a programmable phage display of the human peptidome (PhIP-Seq). Putative ROHHAD-specific autoantibodies were orthogonally validated using radioactive ligand binding and cell-based assays. Expression of autoantibody targets in ROHHAD tumor and healthy brain tissue was assessed with immunohistochemistry and mass spectrometry, respectively.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Autoantibodies to ZSCAN1 were detected in ROHHAD patients by PhIP-Seq and orthogonally validated in 7/9 ROHHAD patients and 0/125 controls using radioactive ligand binding and cell-based assays. Expression of ZSCAN1 in ROHHAD tumor and healthy human brain tissue was confirmed.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results support the notion that tumor-associated ROHHAD syndrome is a pediatric PNS, potentially initiated by an immune response to peripheral neuroblastic tumor. ZSCAN1 autoantibodies may aid in earlier, accurate diagnosis of ROHHAD syndrome, thus providing a means toward early detection and treatment. This work warrants follow-up studies to test sensitivity and specificity of a novel diagnostic test. Last, given the absence of the ZSCAN1 gene in rodents, our study highlights the value of human-based approaches for detecting novel PNS subtypes. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:279‚Äì291</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Using a multi-cohort, discovery-replication-validation design, we sought new plasma biomarkers that predict which individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) will experience cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In 108 discovery cohort PD individuals and 83 replication cohort PD individuals, we measured 940 plasma proteins on an aptamer-based platform. Using proteins associated with subsequent cognitive decline in both cohorts, we trained a logistic regression model to predict which patients with PD showed fast (&gt;¬†=¬†1 point drop/year on Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]) versus slow (&lt;‚Äâ1 point drop/year on MoCA) cognitive decline in the discovery cohort, testing it in the replication cohort. We developed alternate assays for the top 3 proteins and confirmed their ability to predict cognitive decline ‚Äì defined by change in MoCA or development of incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia ‚Äì in a validation cohort of 118 individuals with PD. We investigated the top plasma biomarker for causal influence by Mendelian randomization (MR).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A model with only 3 proteins (melanoma inhibitory activity protein [MIA], C-reactive protein [CRP], and albumin) separated fast versus slow cognitive decline subgroups with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80 in the validation cohort. The individuals with PD in the validation cohort in the top quartile of risk for cognitive decline based on this model were 4.4 times more likely to develop incident MCI or dementia than those in the lowest quartile. Genotypes at MIA single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2233154 associated with MIA levels and cognitive decline, providing evidence for MIA's causal influence.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>An easily obtained plasma-based predictor identifies individuals with PD at risk for cognitive decline. MIA may participate causally in development of cognitive decline. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:255‚Äì269</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy is associated with various degrees of cognitive impairment and behavioral disturbances. Emotional and memory deficits also constitute reliable outcome measures to assess efficacy of treatments in the <i>mdx</i> mouse lacking the muscle and neuronal full-length dystrophins. The present study aimed to evaluate whether these deficits could be alleviated by the restoration of brain dystrophin.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed intracerebroventricular administration of a new potent tricyclo-DNA antisense oligonucleotide (tcDNA-ASO) containing a full phosphodiester backbone conjugated to a palmitic acid moiety (tcDNA-ASO), designed to skip the mutated exon 23 of <i>mdx</i> mice.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We first show that the tcDNA-ASO rescues expression of brain dystrophin to 10‚Äì30% of wild-type levels and significantly reduces the abnormal unconditioned fear responses in <i>mdx</i> mice in a dose-dependent manner, 5‚Äâweeks post-injection. Exon skipping efficiency, ASO biodistribution, protein restoration and effect on the fear response were optimal with a dose of 400‚ÄâŒºg at 6‚Äì7‚Äâweeks post-injection, with synaptic-like expression in brain tissues such as the hippocampus and amygdala. Furthermore, this dose of tcDNA-ASO restored long-term memory retention of <i>mdx</i> mice in an object recognition task, but only had minor effects on fear conditioning.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results suggest for the first time that postnatal re-expression of brain dystrophin could reverse or at least alleviate some cognitive deficits associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:213‚Äì229</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We performed a population-based study on inclusion body myositis with the primary aims to define the prevalence, survival rate, and incidence, and to investigate the symptom profiles associated with disease duration and sex over a 33-year period.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients diagnosed between 1985 and 2017 in Region V√§stra G√∂taland, Sweden, were identified according to the European Neuromuscular Centre diagnostic criteria from 2011.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 128 patients, 89 men and 39 women, with the strict clinicopathological definition of inclusion body myositis. The prevalence was 32 per million inhabitants, 19 per million women and 45 per million men, by December 31, 2017. Mean incidence was 2.5 per million inhabitants and year. Mean age at symptom onset was 64.4‚Äâyears with quadriceps weakness being the most common presenting symptom followed by finger flexor weakness. Dysphagia was a common presenting symptom being more frequent in women (23%) than men (10%) and was during the disease course reported in 74% of men and 84% of women. Seventy-three patients were deceased, with a mean survival of 14‚Äâyears from symptom onset. Survival rates from both diagnosis date and symptom onset were decreased compared to the matched population.</p>
<p>Twenty-one percent of the patients had an additional autoimmune disease. A cross-sectional analysis of autoantibodies in 50 patients and 28 matched controls showed autoantibodies to cytosolic 5‚Ä≤-nucleotidase 1A in 40% of the patients and 3.6% of controls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Inclusion body myositis is an autoimmune disease with decreased survival rate and with marked sex differences in both prevalence and clinical manifestations. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:201‚Äì212</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Astrocytes outline the perivascular space (PVS) and regulate fluid exchange through the aquaporin-4 water channel. As neuromyelitis optica is an autoimmune astrocytopathy targeting aquaporin-4, we hypothesized that it could be associatied with PVS abnormalities.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 34 patients, and 46 age- and sex-matched healthy controls from two independent cohorts (exploratory and validation dataset) underwent a standardized 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging protocol including conventional and diffusion tensor imaging. Susceptibility-weighted imaging was also acquired in the exploratory dataset. We evaluated macroscopic and microstructural abnormalities of PVS in terms of enlargement and water diffusivity (DTI-ALPS index). In the exploration dataset, a susceptibility-weighted sequence was used to draw the regions of interest for the DTI-ALPS index calculation in areas having veins perpendicular to lateral ventricles. Between-group comparisons, correlations, and regression models were run to assess associations between PVS abnormalities, and clinical and magnetic resonance imaging variables.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients had a higher frequency of severe PVS enlargement in the centrum semiovale (29.4% vs 8.7%), which correlated with brain atrophy, deep grey matter atrophy, and poorer cognitive performance (<i>r</i>-values range: ‚àí0.44, ‚àí0.36; <i>p</i> values: 0.01‚Äì0.046).</p>
<p>In both datasets, patients had reduced DTI-ALPS index compared with controls (<i>p</i> values 0.004‚Äì0.038). Lower DTI-ALPS index, deep gray matter volume, and cortical volume could discriminate between patients and controls (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup>¬†=¬†0.62), whereas lower DTI-ALPS index, higher number of myelitis, and higher T2-lesion volume were associated with worse disability (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup>¬†=¬†0.55).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder are characterized by abnormal enlargement and impaired water diffusion along the PVS, whose clinical implications suggest a direct correlation with disease pathogenesis and severity. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:173‚Äì183</p>

Recently, researchers have considered that extracellular vesicles (EVs) may play an important role in protein exportation and propagation, and Œ±-syn-containing EVs derived from the central nervous system (CNS) have been detected in peripheral blood. However, mechanistic insights into CNS-derived EVs have not been well-described.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Likely neurogenic EVs were purified from the plasma of PD patients and healthy controls using a well-established immunoprecipitation assay with anti-L1CAM-coated beads. A <i>Prnp-SNCA</i>
<sup>A53T</sup> transgenic PD mouse model was used to evaluate the neuronal pathology induced by PD-derived L1CAM-purified EVs. EV-associated microRNA (miRNA) profiling was used to screen for altered miRNAs in PD-derived L1CAM-purified EVs.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>PD patient-derived L1CAM-purified (likely neurogenic) EVs facilitated Œ±-syn pathology and neuron loss in <i>Prnp-SNCA</i>
<sup>A53T</sup> transgenic PD mice. The miRNA, novel_miR_44438, was significantly increased in the PD group, which promoted Œ±-syn accumulation and neuronal degeneration in a dose-dependent manner. Novel _miR_44438 directly targets NDST1 mRNA and inhibits the function of heparan sulfate, thus preventing exosome biogenesis and Œ±-syn release from exosomes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Novel_miR_44438 in PD-derived L1CAM-purified EVs inhibits the Œ±-syn efflux from neurons thereby promoting the pathological accumulation and aggregation of Œ±-syn. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:230‚Äì245</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine rates of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), mechanical thrombectomy (MT), door-to-needle (DTN) time, door-to-puncture (DTP) time, and functional outcome between patients with admission magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) versus computed tomography (CT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>An observational cohort study of consecutive patients using a target trial design within the nationwide Swiss-Stroke-Registry from January 2014 to August 2020 was carried out. Exclusion criteria included MRI contraindications, transferred patients, and unstable or frail patients. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression with multiple imputation was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for IVT, MT, DTN, DTP, and good functional outcome (mRS 0‚Äì2) at 90‚Äâdays.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of the 11,049 patients included (mean [SD] age, 71 [15] years; 4,811 [44%] women; 69% ischemic stroke, 16% transient ischemic attack, 8% stroke mimics, 6% intracranial hemorrhage), 3,741 (34%) received MRI and 7,308 (66%) CT. Patients undergoing MRI had lower National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (median [interquartile range] 2 [0‚Äì6] vs 4 [1‚Äì11]), and presented later after symptom onset (150 vs 123‚Äâmin, <i>p</i>¬†&lt;‚Äâ0.001). Admission MRI was associated with: lower adjusted odds of IVT (aOR 0.83, 0.73‚Äì0.96), but not with MT (aOR 1.11, 0.93‚Äì1.34); longer adjusted DTN (+22‚Äâmin [13‚Äì30]), but not with longer DTP times; and higher adjusted odds of favorable outcome (aOR 1.54, 1.30‚Äì1.81).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We found an association of MRI with lower rates of IVT and a significant delay in DTN, but not in DTP and rates of MT. Given the delays in workflow metrics, prospective trials are required to show that tissue-based benefits of baseline MRI compensate for the temporal benefits of CT.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Polygenic Resilience Modulates the Penetrance of Parkinson Disease Genetic Risk Factors</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim of the current study is to understand why some individuals avoid developing Parkinson disease (PD) despite being at relatively high genetic risk, using the largest datasets of individual-level genetic data available.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We calculated polygenic risk score to identify controls and matched PD cases with the highest burden of genetic risk for PD in the discovery cohort (International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium, 7,204 PD cases and 9,412 controls) and validation cohorts (Comprehensive Unbiased Risk Factor Assessment for Genetics and Environment in Parkinson's Disease, 8,968 cases and 7,598 controls; UK Biobank, 2,639 PD cases and 14,301 controls; Accelerating Medicines Partnership‚ÄìParkinson's Disease Initiative, 2,248 cases and 2,817 controls). A genome-wide association study meta-analysis was performed on these individuals to understand genetic variation associated with resistance to disease. We further constructed a polygenic resilience score, and performed multimarker analysis of genomic annotation (MAGMA) gene-based analyses and functional enrichment analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A higher polygenic resilience score was associated with a lower risk for PD (Œ≤¬†=¬†‚àí0.054, standard error [SE]¬†=¬†0.022, <i>p</i>¬†=‚Äâ0.013). Although no single locus reached genome-wide significance, MAGMA gene-based analyses nominated <i>TBCA</i> as a putative gene. Furthermore, we estimated the narrow-sense heritability associated with resilience to PD (<i>h</i>
<sup>2</sup>¬†=‚Äâ0.081, SE¬†=¬†0.035, <i>p</i>¬†=‚Äâ0.0003). Subsequent functional enrichment analysis highlighted histone methylation as a potential pathway harboring resilience alleles that could mitigate the effects of PD risk loci.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The present study represents a novel and comprehensive assessment of heritable genetic variation contributing to PD resistance. We show that a genetic resilience score can modify the penetrance of PD genetic risk factors and therefore protect individuals carrying a high-risk genetic burden from developing PD.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to assess whether non-invasive brain stimulation with transcranial alternating current stimulation at gamma-frequency (Œ≥-tACS) applied over the precuneus can improve episodic memory and modulate cholinergic transmission by modulating cerebral rhythms in early Alzheimer's disease (AD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this randomized, double-blind, sham controlled, crossover study, 60‚ÄâAD patients underwent a clinical and neurophysiological evaluation including assessment of episodic memory and cholinergic transmission pre and post 60¬†minutes treatment with Œ≥-tACS targeting the precuneus or sham tACS. In a subset of 10 patients, EEG analysis and individualized modelling of electric field distribution were carried out. Predictors to Œ≥-tACS efficacy were evaluated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We observed a significant improvement in the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning (RAVL) test immediate recall (<i>p</i>¬†&lt;‚Äâ0.001) and delayed recall scores (<i>p</i>¬†&lt;‚Äâ0.001) after Œ≥-tACS but not after sham tACS. Face-name associations scores improved with Œ≥-tACS (<i>p</i>¬†&lt;‚Äâ0.001) but not after sham tACS. Short latency afferent inhibition, an indirect measure of cholinergic transmission, increased only after Œ≥-tACS (<i>p</i>¬†&lt;‚Äâ0.001). <i>ApoE</i> genotype and baseline cognitive impairment were the best predictors of response to Œ≥-tACS. Clinical improvement correlated with the increase in gamma frequencies in posterior regions and with the amount of predicted electric field distribution in the precuneus.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Precuneus Œ≥-tACS, able to increase Œ≥-power activity on the posterior brain regions, showed a significant improvement of episodic memory performances, along with restoration of intracortical excitability measures of cholinergic transmission. Response to Œ≥-tACS was dependent on genetic factors and disease stage. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:322‚Äì334</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Glycine encephalopathy, also known as nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH), is an inherited neurometabolic disorder with variable clinical course and severity, ranging from infantile epileptic encephalopathy to psychiatric disorders. A precise phenotypic characterization and an evaluation of predictive approaches are needed.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Longitudinal clinical and biochemical data of 25 individuals with NKH from the patient registry of the International Working Group on Neurotransmitter Related Disorders were studied with in silico analyses, pathogenicity scores, and molecular modeling of <i>GLDC</i> and <i>AMT</i> variants.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Symptom onset (<i>p</i>¬†&lt;‚Äâ0.01) and diagnosis occur earlier in life in severe NKH (<i>p</i>¬†&lt;‚Äâ0.01). Presenting symptoms affect the age at diagnosis. Psychiatric problems occur predominantly in attenuated NKH. Onset age ‚â•‚Äâ3‚Äâmonths (66% specificity, 100% sensitivity, area under the curve [AUC]¬†=¬†0.87) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/plasma glycine ratio ‚â§‚Äâ0.09 (57% specificity, 100% sensitivity, AUC¬†=¬†0.88) are sensitive indicators for attenuated NKH, whereas CSF glycine concentration ‚â•‚Äâ116.5Œºmol/l (100% specificity, 93% sensitivity, AUC¬†=¬†0.97) and CSF/plasma glycine ratio ‚â•‚Äâ0.15 (100% specificity, 64% sensitivity, AUC¬†=¬†0.88) are specific for severe forms. A ratio threshold of 0.128 discriminates the overlapping range. We present 10 new <i>GLDC</i> variants. Two mild variants resulted in attenuated, whereas 2 severe variants or 1 mild and 1 severe variant led to severe phenotype. Based on clinical, biochemical, and genetic parameters, we propose a severity prediction model.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study widens the phenotypic spectrum of attenuated NKH and expands the number of pathogenic variants. The multiparametric approach provides a promising tool to predict disease severity, helping to improve clinical management strategies. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:292‚Äì303</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Acute Kidney Injury associated with "Triple whammy" combination: a protocol for a systematic review. [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: ‚ÄúTriple whammy‚Äù (TW) refers to the simultaneous use of diuretics, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). To date, the risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) associated to this combination has not been deeply investigated. The objectives are to analyze the incidence of AKI associated to the exposure to ‚Äútriple whammy‚Äù including all NSAIDs versus non-exposure to this combination. Secondarily, the risk of hospitalization, severe adverse events, requirement of renal replacement therapy and mortality will be assessed. Also, the incidence of AKI associated to the exposure to ‚Äútriple whammy‚Äù versus non-exposure will be analyzed, including only metamizole as NSAID.¬†¬† Methods: A systematic literature search of intervention studies and analytical observational studies will be conducted in the Cochrane Library, Medline and EMBASE, among others. AKI 12 months after the last prescription of the triple combination will be the main outcome. Relative frequencies, risk of bias and certainty of evidence will be analyzed. Additionally, sensitivity and subgroup analyses will be performed.¬†¬† Results: Once this systematic review has been completed, the results are expected to provide an estimate of the risk associated with this triple combination and the renal variables, in addition to new guidance on the renal treatment of patients potentially receiving triple therapy.¬† Conclusions: This is intended to be the first systematic review of observational studies to analyse TW combination and AKI's risk based on well-validated epidemiological databases exploring drug safety issues.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Plant tissue culture challenges in Ethiopia and alternative options for low-cost media [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Plant tissue culture (PTC) is the cultivation of any part of a plant in nutritionally defined media under an aseptic and controlled environment, regardless of season and weather. The application of PTC leads to the mass propagation of varietal, high-quality seedlings of ornamental plants, medicinal plants, plantation crops, fruit trees, and forest trees. PTC technology, on the other hand, is more expensive in developing nations, such as Ethiopia, than traditional propagation methods such as seeds, cuttings, grafting, and so on. As a result, it is critical to take steps to cut production costs and explore alternate choices for present PTC obstacles (budget restrictions, procedural and operational matters, and unfortunate interactions and partnerships). In order to lower the unit cost of crop production, cost-effective procedures and the optimal utilization of equipment are required. This can be accomplished by increasing the efficiency of processes and optimizing resource allocation. Gelling agents, macro and micronutrients, equipment, carbon sources, and the utilization of bioreactors, which can minimize space, energy, and labor needs, can all be replaced to lower production costs. Therefore, these alternative options are recommended as a workaround to the problems and are briefly described in this document.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A retrospective cohort study on effects of antenatal steroids on respiratory morbidity for term elective caesarean sections in South Asian women [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Respiratory distress (RD) is higher among newborns born by caesarean section (CS) compared to vaginal delivery. Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommend steroid administration for CS prior to 39 weeks. Effectiveness of steroids for neonatal RD at term is inconclusive. The racial differences are yet to be studied. Methods A single center retrospective cohort study was conducted in Colombo, Sri Lanka from December 2016 to February 2019. All mothers delivered by CS between 37+0 and 38+6 weeks were included. Mothers with severe maternal hypertension, fetal rhesus sensitization, intrauterine infection, multiple pregnancies and who received steroids at a prior gestation were excluded. Cohort was subdivided according to administration of intramuscular dexamethasone prior to CS. Primary outcomes measured were RD, admissions to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and special care baby unit (SCBU). Neonatal infections and maternal duration of hospital stay were recorded as secondary outcome measures. Results 560 patients were included. 23.2% of patients received antenatal corticosteroids. Incidence of RD, NICU admissions and SCBU admissions in the study cohort was 10%, 0.9%, and 2.7% respectively. Relative risk for developing RD in the steroid group compared to non-steroid group was 2.67 (95CI 1.64-4.35). 4.6% of the steroid group and 3.3% of the non-steroid group needed to be admitted to the NICU/SCBU (p=0.464). A significantly higher number of babies in the steroid group needed IV antibiotics. The average number of days the mothers were admitted to the hospital was 2.45 days (SD+/- 1.424) for steroid group and 1.4 days (SD+/- 0.856) for the non-steroid group (p < 0.001). Conclusions There is a significant increase in the respiratory morbidity in the dexamethasone administered south Asian mothers at term prior to CS. However, this effect has no clinical significance since the admissions to NICU and SCBU were not significantly different.
