              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21063">Make Silence Speak for Itself: a multi-modal learning analytic approach with neurophysiological data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.21063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Silence is a common phenomenon in classrooms, yet its implicit nature limits a clear understanding of students' underlying learning statuses. Aim: This study proposed a nuanced framework to classify classroom silence based on class events and student status, and examined neurophysiological markers to reveal similarities and differences in silent states across achievement groups. Sample: The study involved 54 middle school students during 34 math lessons, with simultaneous recordings of electroencephalogram (EEG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and heart rate signals, alongside video coding of classroom behaviors. Results: We found that high-achieving students showed no significant difference in mean EDA features between strategic silence (i.e., students choose silence deliberately) and active speaking during open questioning but exhibited higher EEG high-frequency relative power spectral density (RPSD) during strategic silence. In structural silence (i.e., students maintain silence following an external command) during directed questioning, they demonstrated significantly higher heart rates while listening to lectures compared to group activities, indicating heightened engagement. Both high- and medium-achieving students displayed elevated heart rates and EDA tonic components in structural silence during questioning compared to teaching. Furthermore, high-achieving students exhibited lower high-frequency RPSD during structural silence than strategic silence, a pattern not observed in other groups, highlighting group heterogeneity. Conclusions: The findings contribute to validating the complexity of silence, challenge its traditional association with passivity, and offer a novel classification framework along with preliminary empirical evidence to deepen the understanding of silent learning behaviors in classroom contexts.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21140">Gender Similarities Dominate Mathematical Cognition at the Neural Level: A Japanese fMRI Study Using Advanced Wavelet Analysis and Generative AI</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.21140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent large scale behavioral studies suggest early emergence of gender differences in mathematical performance within months of school entry. However, these findings lack direct neural evidence and are constrained by cultural contexts. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during mathematical tasks in Japanese participants (N = 156), employing an advanced wavelet time frequency analysis to examine dynamic brain processes rather than static activation patterns. Wavelet decomposition across four frequency bands (0.01-0.25 Hz) revealed that neural processing mechanisms underlying mathematical cognition are fundamentally similar between genders. Time frequency analysis demonstrated 89.1% similarity in dynamic activation patterns (p = 0.734, d = 0.05), with identical temporal sequences and frequency profiles during mathematical processing. Individual variation in neural dynamics exceeded group differences by 3.2:1 (p $<$ 0.001). Machine learning classifiers achieved only 53.8% accuracy in distinguishing gender based neural patterns essentially at chance level even when analyzing sophisticated temporal spectral features. Cross frequency coupling analysis revealed similar network coordination patterns between genders, indicating shared fundamental cognitive architecture. These findings provide robust process level neural evidence that gender similarities dominate mathematical cognition, particularly in early developmental stages, challenging recent claims of inherent differences and demonstrating that dynamic brain analysis reveals neural mechanisms that static behavioral assessments cannot access.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21871">Representations in vision and language converge in a shared, multidimensional space of perceived similarities</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.21871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans can effortlessly describe what they see, yet establishing a shared representational format between vision and language remains a significant challenge. Emerging evidence suggests that human brain representations in both vision and language are well predicted by semantic feature spaces obtained from large language models (LLMs). This raises the possibility that sensory systems converge in their inherent ability to transform their inputs onto shared, embedding-like representational space. However, it remains unclear how such a space manifests in human behaviour. To investigate this, sixty-three participants performed behavioural similarity judgements separately on 100 natural scene images and 100 corresponding sentence captions from the Natural Scenes Dataset. We found that visual and linguistic similarity judgements not only converge at the behavioural level but also predict a remarkably similar network of fMRI brain responses evoked by viewing the natural scene images. Furthermore, computational models trained to map images onto LLM-embeddings outperformed both category-trained and AlexNet controls in explaining the behavioural similarity structure. These findings demonstrate that human visual and linguistic similarity judgements are grounded in a shared, modality-agnostic representational structure that mirrors how the visual system encodes experience. The convergence between sensory and artificial systems suggests a common capacity of how conceptual representations are formed-not as arbitrary products of first order, modality-specific input, but as structured representations that reflect the stable, relational properties of the external world.

                arXiv:2507.20205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately characterizing higher-order interactions of brain regions and extracting interpretable organizational patterns from Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging data is crucial for brain disease diagnosis. Current graph-based deep learning models primarily focus on pairwise or triadic patterns while neglecting signed higher-order interactions, limiting comprehensive understanding of brain-wide communication. We propose HOI-Brain, a novel computational framework leveraging signed higher-order interactions and organizational patterns in fMRI data for brain disease diagnosis. First, we introduce a co-fluctuation measure based on Multiplication of Temporal Derivatives to detect higher-order interactions with temporal resolution. We then distinguish positive and negative synergistic interactions, encoding them in signed weighted simplicial complexes to reveal brain communication insights. Using Persistent Homology theory, we apply two filtration processes to these complexes to extract signed higher-dimensional neural organizations spatiotemporally. Finally, we propose a multi-channel brain Transformer to integrate heterogeneous topological features. Experiments on Alzheimer' s disease, Parkinson' s syndrome, and autism spectrum disorder datasets demonstrate our framework' s superiority, effectiveness, and interpretability. The identified key brain regions and higher-order patterns align with neuroscience literature, providing meaningful biological insights.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21474">Hebbian Memory-Augmented Recurrent Networks: Engram Neurons in Deep Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.21474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite success across diverse tasks, current artificial recurrent network architectures rely primarily on implicit hidden-state memories, limiting their interpretability and ability to model long-range dependencies. In contrast, biological neural systems employ explicit, associative memory traces (i.e., engrams) strengthened through Hebbian synaptic plasticity and activated sparsely during recall. Motivated by these neurobiological insights, we introduce the Engram Neural Network (ENN), a novel recurrent architecture incorporating an explicit, differentiable memory matrix with Hebbian plasticity and sparse, attention-driven retrieval mechanisms. The ENN explicitly models memory formation and recall through dynamic Hebbian traces, improving transparency and interpretability compared to conventional RNN variants. We evaluate the ENN architecture on three canonical benchmarks: MNIST digit classification, CIFAR-10 image sequence modeling, and WikiText-103 language modeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that the ENN achieves accuracy and generalization performance broadly comparable to classical RNN, GRU, and LSTM architectures, with all models converging to similar accuracy and perplexity on the large-scale WikiText-103 task. At the same time, the ENN offers significant enhancements in interpretability through observable memory dynamics. Hebbian trace visualizations further reveal biologically plausible, structured memory formation processes, validating the potential of neuroscience-inspired mechanisms to inform the development of more interpretable and robust deep learning models.

                arXiv:2507.21377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir Computing is a machine learning approach that uses the rich repertoire of complex system dynamics for function approximation. Current approaches to reservoir computing use a network of coupled integrating neurons that require a steady current to maintain activity. Here, we introduce a small world graph of differentiating neurons that are active only when there are changes in input as an alternative to integrating neurons as a reservoir computing substrate. We find the coupling strength and network topology that enable these small world networks to function as an effective reservoir. We demonstrate the efficacy of these networks in the MNIST digit recognition task, achieving comparable performance of 90.65% to existing reservoir computing approaches. The findings suggest that differentiating neurons can be a potential alternative to integrating neurons and can provide a sustainable future alternative for power-hungry AI applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21740">Knowledge-Guided Memetic Algorithm for Capacitated Arc Routing Problems with Time-Dependent Service Costs</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.21740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capacitated arc routing problem with time-dependent service costs (CARPTDSC) is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem that arises from winter gritting applications. CARPTDSC has two main challenges about time consumption. First, it is an NP-hard problem. Second, the time-dependent service costs of tasks require frequent evaluations during the search process, significantly increasing computational effort. These challenges make it difficult for existing algorithms to perform efficient searches, often resulting in limited efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes a knowledge-guided memetic algorithm with golden section search and negatively correlated search (KGMA-GN), where two knowledge-guided strategies are introduced to improve search efficiency. First, a knowledge-guided initialization strategy (KGIS) is proposed to generate high-quality initial solutions to speed up convergence. Second, a knowledge-guided small-step-size local search strategy (KGSLSS) is proposed to filter out invalid moves, thereby reducing unnecessary evaluations and saving the computation time. Experimental results on five benchmark test sets, including both small- and larger-scale instances, demonstrate that KGMA-GN achieves higher search efficiency than the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the ablation study further confirms that the knowledge-guided local search operators in KGSLSS can significantly reduce runtime compared to traditional operators, especially for the knowledge-guided swap operator, which achieves more than a tenfold improvement in speed.

                arXiv:2503.08394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-task optimization is typically characterized by a fixed and finite set of optimization tasks. The present paper relaxes this condition by considering a non-fixed and potentially infinite set of optimization tasks defined in a parameterized, continuous and bounded task space. We refer to this unique problem setting as parametric multi-task optimization (PMTO). Assuming the bounds of the task parameters to be ($\boldsymbol{\theta}_l$, $\boldsymbol{\theta}_u$), a novel ($\boldsymbol{\theta}_l$, $\boldsymbol{\theta}_u$)-PMTO algorithm is crafted to enable joint search over tasks and their solutions. This joint search is supported by two approximation models: (1) for mapping solutions to the objective spaces of all tasks, which provably accelerates convergence by acting as a conduit for inter-task knowledge transfers, and (2) for probabilistically mapping tasks to the solution space, which facilitates evolutionary exploration of under-explored regions of the task space. At the end of a full ($\boldsymbol{\theta}_l$, $\boldsymbol{\theta}_u$)-PMTO run, the acquired models enable rapid identification of optimized solutions for any task lying within the specified bounds. This outcome is validated on both synthetic test problems and practical case studies, with the significant real-world applicability of PMTO shown towards fast reconfiguration of robot controllers under changing task conditions. The potential of PMTO to vastly speedup the search for solutions to minimax optimization problems is also demonstrated through an example in robust engineering design.

                arXiv:2502.03086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the implementation of large Quantum Restricted Boltzmann Machines (QRBMs), a key advancement in Quantum Machine Learning (QML), as generative models on D-Wave's Pegasus quantum hardware to address dataset imbalance in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). By leveraging Pegasus's enhanced connectivity and computational capabilities, a QRBM with 120 visible and 120 hidden units was successfully embedded, surpassing the limitations of default embedding tools. The QRBM synthesized over 1.6 million attack samples, achieving a balanced dataset of over 4.2 million records. Comparative evaluations with traditional balancing methods, such as SMOTE and RandomOversampler, revealed that QRBMs produced higher-quality synthetic samples, significantly improving detection rates, precision, recall, and F1 score across diverse classifiers. The study underscores the scalability and efficiency of QRBMs, completing balancing tasks in milliseconds. These findings highlight the transformative potential of QML and QRBMs as next-generation tools in data preprocessing, offering robust solutions for complex computational challenges in modern information systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15064">HiPreNets: High-Precision Neural Networks through Progressive Training</a></h4>

Abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful tools for solving nonlinear problems in science and engineering, but training highly accurate models becomes challenging as problem complexity increases. Non-convex optimization and numerous hyperparameters to tune make performance improvement difficult, and traditional approaches often prioritize minimizing mean squared error (MSE) while overlooking $L^{\infty}$ error, which is the critical focus in many applications. To address these challenges, we present a progressive framework for training and tuning high-precision neural networks (HiPreNets). Our approach refines a previously explored staged training technique for neural networks that improves an existing fully connected neural network by sequentially learning its prediction residuals using additional networks, leading to improved overall accuracy. We discuss how to take advantage of the structure of the residuals to guide the choice of loss function, number of parameters to use, and ways to introduce adaptive data sampling techniques. We validate our framework's effectiveness through several benchmark problems.

">UBR-1 enzyme network regulates glutamate homeostasis to affect organismal behavior and developmental viability</a></h4>

              
                Johanson-Blizzard Syndrome (JBS) is an autosomal recessive spectrum disorder associated with the UBR-1 ubiquitin ligase that features developmental delay including motor abnormalities. Here, we demonstrate that C. elegans UBR-1 regulates high-intensity locomotor behavior and developmental viability via both ubiquitin ligase and scaffolding mechanisms. Super-resolution imaging with CRISPR-engineered UBR-1 and genetic results demonstrated that UBR-1 is expressed and functions in the nervous system including in pre-motor interneurons. To decipher mechanisms of UBR-1 function, we deployed CRISPR-based proteomics using C. elegans which identified a cadre of glutamate metabolic enzymes physically associated with UBR-1 including GLN-3, GOT-2.2, GFAT-1 and GDH-1. Similar to UBR-1, all four glutamate enzymes are genetically linked to human developmental and neurological deficits. Proteomics, multi-gene interaction studies, and pharmacological findings indicated that UBR-1, GLN-3 and GOT-2.2 form a signaling axis that regulates glutamate homeostasis. Developmentally, UBR-1 is expressed in embryos and functions with GLN-3 to regulate viability. Overall, our results suggest UBR-1 is an enzyme hub in a GOT-2.2/UBR-1/GLN-3 axis that maintains glutamate homeostasis required for efficient locomotion and organismal viability. Given the prominent role of glutamate within and outside the nervous system, the UBR-1 glutamate homeostatic network we have identified could contribute to JBS etiology.

">Motor prediction reduces beta-band power and enhances cerebellar-somatosensory connectivity before self-touch to enable its attenuation</a></h4>

              
                Prevailing theories suggest that the brain uses an internal forward model to predict tactile input during voluntary movements, thereby reducing the intensity of the reafferent tactile sensation, a phenomenon known as self-touch attenuation. Although self-touch attenuation is a well-documented effect, it remains unclear how prediction-related neural mechanisms drive the attenuation prior to the actual self-touch input. In this study, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to examine the neural correlates of self-touch prediction. Participants performed a self-touch task with two control conditions. In one control, the touch was externally generated without any movement. In the other, the moving and the touched hands were spatially misaligned, thereby disrupting the sensorimotor alignment of self-touch. Self-touch evoked weaker early somatosensory activity (M50 component) than both control conditions. A psychophysics task also mirrored the pattern of neural attenuation, as the perception of self-touch was attenuated compared to the two control conditions. To isolate predictive neural mechanisms from general movement-related activity, we subtracted activity from corresponding stimulus-absent trials. To further refine the signal specific to predictive processing in self-touch, we compared self-touch with misaligned touch, the two conditions that both involved voluntary movement but differed in their prediction of self-touch. This revealed greater pre-stimulus beta-band desynchronization and increased cerebellar-to-somatosensory connectivity prior to self-touch compared to misaligned touch. Our results provide the first evidence of predictive neural activity that shapes the sensory consequences of self-touch, offering insight into the mechanisms through which predictive models modulate somatosensory processing.

">Striatal pathways oppositely shift cortical activity along the decision axis</a></h4>

              
                The cortex and basal ganglia are organized into multiple parallel loops that serve motor, limbic, and cognitive functions. The classic model of cortico-basal ganglia interactions posits that within each loop, the direct pathway of the basal ganglia activates the cortex and the indirect pathway inhibits it. While this model has found support in the motor domain, whether opponent control by the two pathways extends to the cognitive domain remains unknown. Here, we record from anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsomedial striatum (DMS) while inhibiting direct or indirect pathway neurons in DMS, as mice perform an accumulation-of-evidence task. Inconsistent with the classic model, the manipulations do not produce opponent changes in overall ACC activity. Instead, the pathways exert opponent influence over a subpopulation of ACC neurons that encode accumulated sensory evidence, the task-relevant decision variable. The direction of the modulation depends on a neurons tuning to ipsilateral versus contralateral evidence, such that the two pathways generate opponent shifts in coding specifically along the decision axis. Thus, our results uncover unexpected specificity in the effects of basal ganglia pathways on the cortex, with the two pathways of the DMS exerting opponent control not on overall activity but on coding of the relevant task variable. This functional specificity may extend to other basal ganglia loops to support different aspects of adaptive behavior, with the pathways serving a general role in selecting and shifting cortical representations to subserve circuit-specific functions.

">Glucose Metabolism echoes Long-Range Temporal Correlations in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                Intrinsic brain activity is characterized by pervasive long-range temporal correlations. While these scale-invariant dynamics are a fundamental hallmark of brain function, their implications for individual-level metabolic regulation remain poorly understood. Here, we address this gap by integrating resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and dynamic [18F]FDG Positron Emission Tomography (PET) data acquired from the same cohort of participants. We uncover a systematic relationship between long-range temporal correlations, quantified via the Hurst exponent, and glucose metabolism. Our findings reveal that persistent temporal dependencies impose a measurable metabolic cost, with brains exhibiting higher long-range temporal correlations incurring greater energetic demands. Beyond glucose metabolism, we also show that these dynamics are likely supported by continuous biosynthetic processes, such as protein synthesis, which are critical for neural circuit maintenance and remodeling. Overall, our results suggest that a significant fraction of the brain's so-called "Dark Energy" is actively spent to power spontaneous long-range temporal correlations.

">Hippocampal Synchrony Dynamically Gates Cortical Connectivity Across Brain States</a></h4>

              
                Memory consolidation is thought to rely on hippocampo-cortical dialogue orchestrated by three cardinal sleep oscillations: cortical slow oscillations, thalamic spindles, and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. However, how hippocampal outputs are routed to specific cortical targets and dynamically regulated across brain states remains incompletely understood. Here, we performed simultaneous multisite recordings from the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, and frontal and parietal cortex in rats alternating between wakefulness and sleep. Frontal slow oscillations operated as a global clock, resetting thalamic circuits and initiating spindle volleys that propagated from anterior to posterior cortex, while parietal slow oscillations more effectively recruited hippocampal ripples. Hippocampal ripples reflected anatomical connectivity, as dorsal ripples preferentially enhanced parietal spindles, whereas ventral ripples engaged mainly frontal spindling. Notably, when ripples synchronized in dorsal and ventral hippocampus, local excitatory drive sharply decreased and neuronal spiking redistributed, associated cortical slow oscillations and spindle responses diminished, and cortical neuronal reactivation was suppressed, indicating that dorso-ventral ripple synchrony gates, rather than amplifies, hippocampo-cortical communication. This gating effect was most evident through interactions with brain state, as dorsal-driven reactivation persisted across vigilance states, while ventral pathways were more pronounced during sleep. Collectively, our results outline a multilayer architecture in which slow oscillations provide a global temporal scaffold, spindles implement anatomically specific reactivation channels, and ripple coordination gates hippocampo-cortical communication, likely shaping the precision and specificity of memory consolidation within a highly variable neural substrate.

">Neurotrophin-3 produced by motor neurons non-cell autonomously regulate the development of pre-motor interneurons in the developing spinal cord</a></h4>

              
                The development of multicellular organisms requires proper interplays between cell-autonomous genetic programs controlled by combinations of transcription factors that regulate the differentiation of distinct cell populations and non-cell autonomous processes that coordinate the proliferation, the fate, the survival, the respective location, and the proper interactions of these populations. During the development of the nervous system, non-cell autonomous mechanisms determine neuronal fate, survival, distribution, axon guidance, and connectivity. Although similar processes are suggested to be at work in the formation of spinal motor circuits, the molecular mechanisms involved remain mostly elusive. Here, we provide evidence that the Onecut transcription factors regulate a non-cell autonomous mechanism that modulate pre-motor interneuron development. We show that conditional inactivation of the Onecut factors in spinal motor neurons affects the differentiation and the positioning of pre-motor interneuron populations. We identify that Neurotrophin-3 produced by motor neurons under the control of the Onecut factors non-cell autonomously regulate the production and the distribution of pre-motor interneuron populations. Thus, we elucidated one of the non-cell autonomous mechanisms that coordinate the formation of the spinal motor circuits.

">A left-to-right bias in spatial numerical associations with dots and symbols</a></h4>

              
                Number and space are intertwined in human and non-human cognition. A substantial body of research has shown that numerical magnitudes are mentally represented along a spatial continuum, akin to a ''mental number line''. Some suggested that its directionality is determined by culture and context. Nevertheless, evidence from preverbal infants and non-human animals indicates a consistent left-to-right directional mapping of numerosities, suggesting a biologically predisposed Spatial-Numerical Association (SNA) that may precede cultural factors. A recent study has shown that an implicit association between ''left'' and ''small''emerges not only in literate adults, but also in unschooled indigenous populations and preschool Western children. This finding suggests that SNAs may originate from universal innate mechanisms rather than being solely a by-product of cultural learning. However, while the study reported a strong association between ''left'' and ''decreasing'' numerosity, there was only a very weak association between ''right'' and ''increasing'' numerosity. This asymmetry was not predicted and needs further investigations to be understood. Here we further investigated the number/space association in implicit tasks in educated Western adults by using more variable and better controlled stimuli compared to the ones used in the previous study, and also manipulating stimulus format, using both dot patterns and symbolic numbers. Fifty-one adult participants performed a numerical comparison task within a Go-No-Go paradigm on subsequent pairs of visual stimuli (with ratios spanning from 0.75 to 0.94) that could appear on the left or on the right of a fixation point and completed two different tasks: ''press when more'' and ''press when less''. Results revealed distinct response patterns depending on the symbolic/non-symbolic nature of the stimuli. When non-symbolic stimuli were used, a consistent association between small numerosities and the left side and large numerosities and the right side was observed. When symbolic stimuli were used, only an association between large numerosities and the right side was observed. These findings support the hypothesis that SNAs may reflect a biological predisposition associated with brain asymmetry, and that task demands may interact with the underlying hemispheric specializations

                <p>Experimental behavioral neuroscience relies on the ability to deliver precise amounts of liquid volumes to animal subjects. Among others, it allows the progressive shaping of behavior through successive, automated, reinforcement, thus allowing training in more demanding behavioral tasks and the manipulation of variables that underlie the decision-making process. Here we introduce a stepper motor-based, fully integrated, open-source solution, that allows the reproducible delivery of small (&lt;1&mu;l) liquid volumes. The system can be controlled via software using the Harp protocol (e.g., from Bonsai or Python interfaces), or directly through a low-level I/O interface. Both the control software and electronics are compatible with a wide variety of motor models and mechanical designs. However, we also provide schematics, and step-by-step assembly instructions, for the mechanical design used and characterized in this manuscript. We provide benchmarks of the full integrated system using a computer vision method capable of measuring across-trial delivery of small volumes, an important metric when having behavior experiments in mind. Finally, we provide experimental validation of our system by employing it in a psychophysics rodent task, and during electrophysiological recordings.</p>

                <p>Hippocampal synaptic activity is tightly regulated to ensure appropriate synaptic function and plasticity, which are important for critical cognitive processes such as learning and memory. Altered hippocampal synaptic function can lead to cognitive and behavioral deficits observed in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), necessitating a deeper fundamental understanding of hippocampal synaptic control mechanisms. Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 2 (GDE2 or GDPD5) is a surface transmembrane enzyme that cleaves the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor that tethers some proteins to the membrane. Mice lacking GDE2 (<I>Gde2</I>KO) display behavioral deficits in learning and memory that are hippocampal-dependent. However, roles of GDE2 in mouse hippocampal function are not known. Here, we show that GDE2 is expressed in pre- and postsynaptic compartments along apical dendrites in hippocampal CA1 cells. <I>Gde2</I>KO CA1 cells showed increased dendritic length and complexity and increased numbers of mushroom spines localized to the stratum radiatum. Furthermore, adult <I>Gde2</I>KOs displayed an increased frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents, impaired paired-pulse facilitation, and disrupted <I>N</I>-methyl-<scp>d</scp>-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated long&ndash;term depression (LTD). The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-glycogen synthase kinase 3 (PI3K-AKT-GSK3) signaling pathway, implicated in the inhibition of NMDAR-mediated LTD, was abnormally activated in the <I>Gde</I>2KO hippocampus, and inhibition of PI3K restored <I>Gde2</I>KO NMDAR-mediated LTD to WT levels. These observations identify GDE2 as an essential physiological regulator of CA1 synaptic morphology and hippocampal pre- and postsynaptic function, including the modulation of NMDAR-mediated LTD via the PI3K-AKT-GSK3 signaling axis.</p>

                <p>by Xueqing Peng, Rui Qiao, Peiluan Li, Luonan Chen</p>

Typically, in dynamic biological processes, there is a critical state or tipping point that marks the transition from one stable state to another, surpassing which a considerable qualitative shift takes place. Identifying this tipping point and its driving network is essential to avert or delay disastrous outcomes. However, most traditional approaches built upon undirected networks still suffer from a lack of robustness and effectiveness when implemented based on high-dimensional small-sample data, especially for single-cell data. To address this challenge, we develop a directed network flow entropy (DNFE) method, which can transform measured omics data into a directed network. This method is applicable to both single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk data. Applying this algorithm to six real datasets, including three single-cell datasets, two bulk tumor datasets, and a blood dataset, the method is proved to be effective not only in identifying critical states, as well as their dynamic network biomarkers, but also in helping explore regulatory relationships between genes. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the DNFE algorithm is robust across various noise levels and outperforms existing methods in detecting tipping points. Furthermore, the numerical simulations for 100-node and 1000-node gene regulatory networks illustrate the method’s application for large-scale data. The DNFE method predicts active transcription factors, and further identified “dark genes”, which are usually overlooked with traditional methods.

Recent advancements in spatial transcriptomics (ST) have significantly enhanced biological research in various domains. However, the high cost for current ST data generation techniques restricts the large-scale application of ST. Consequently, maximization of the use of available resources to achieve robust statistical power for ST data is a pressing need. One fundamental question in ST analysis is detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under different conditions using ST data. Such DEG analyses are performed frequently, but their power calculations are rarely discussed in the literature. To address this gap, we developed PoweREST, a power estimation tool designed to support the power calculation for DEG detection with 10X Genomics Visium data. PoweREST enables power estimation both before any ST experiments and after preliminary data are collected, making it suitable for a wide variety of power analyses in ST studies. We also provide a user-friendly, program-free web application that allows users to interactively calculate and visualize study power along with relevant parameters.

                <p>by Robin Vloeberghs, Anne E. Urai, Kobe Desender, Scott W. Linderman</p>

Classical decision models assume that the parameters giving rise to choice behavior are stable, yet emerging research suggests these parameters may fluctuate over time. Such fluctuations, observed in neural activity and behavioral strategies, have significant implications for understanding decision-making processes. However, empirical studies on fluctuating human decision-making strategies have been limited due to the extensive data requirements for estimating these fluctuations. Here, we introduce hMFC (Hierarchical Model for Fluctuations in Criterion), a Bayesian framework designed to estimate slow fluctuations in the decision criterion from limited data. We first showcase the importance of considering fluctuations in decision criterion: incorrectly assuming a stable criterion gives rise to apparent history effects and underestimates perceptual sensitivity. We then present a hierarchical estimation procedure capable of reliably recovering the underlying state of the fluctuating decision criterion with as few as 500 trials per participant, offering a robust tool for researchers with typical human datasets. Critically, hMFC does not only accurately recover the state of the underlying decision criterion, it also effectively deals with the confounds caused by criterion fluctuations. Lastly, we provide code and a comprehensive demo to enable widespread application of hMFC in decision-making research.

                <p>by Jovana Deretic, Seyma Cengiz-Emek, Ece Seyrek, Elif Nur Firat-Karalar</p>

The primary cilium is a conserved, microtubule-based organelle that transduces signaling pathways essential for development and homeostasis. It dynamically assembles and disassembles in response to intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli while maintaining remarkable structural stability and tightly regulated length. The mechanisms underlying this stability and length control are not well understood. Here, we characterized CCDC66, a microtubule-associated protein linked to ciliopathies, as an important regulator of cilium maintenance and disassembly in mouse epithelial cells. Live imaging revealed that cilia in CCDC66-depleted cells frequently fluctuate in length and exhibit increased cilium disassembly and ectocytosis. Phenotypic rescue experiments and in vitro assays showed that microtubule stabilization activity of CCDC66 is required for these functions. Temporal proximity mapping identified potential new regulators and molecular pathways involved in cilium disassembly. Further characterization revealed actin cytoskeleton and vesicular trafficking as additional mechanisms by which CCDC66 may mediate its ciliary functions. Finally, depletion of CCDC66 compromised Hedgehog and Wnt pathway activation and disrupted epithelial cell organization and polarity in two- and three‐dimensional cultures. Collectively, we showed that CCDC66 regulates both ciliary and non-ciliary processes through diverse mechanisms involving microtubules, actin, and vesicular trafficking, providing insights into the pathologies associated with CCDC66.

                <p>by Denis C. L. Lan, Laurence T. Hunt, Christopher Summerfield</p>

Much has been learned about the cognitive and neural mechanisms by which humans and other animals navigate to reach their goals. However, most studies have involved a single, well-learned environment. By contrast, real-world wayfinding often occurs in unfamiliar settings, requiring people to combine memories of landmark locations with on-the-fly information about transitions between adjacent states. Here, we studied the strategies that support human navigation in wholly novel environments. We found that during goal-directed navigation, people use a mix of strategies, adaptively deploying both associations between proximal states (state transitions) and directions between distal landmarks (vectors) at stereotyped points on a journey. Deep neural networks meta-trained with reinforcement learning to find the shortest path to goal exhibited near-identical strategies, and in doing so, developed units specialized for the implementation of vector- and state transition-based strategies. These units exhibited response patterns and representational geometries that resemble those previously found in mammalian navigational systems. Overall, our results suggest that effective navigation in novel environments relies on an adaptive mix of state transition- and vector-based strategies, supported by different modes of representing the environment in the brain.

                <p>by Vincent Paget-Blanc, Anna Cavaccini, Alessandra Longaretti, Luca Nava, Massimo Trusel, Anna Rocchi, Maria Pennuto, Elena Marcello, Fabrizio Gardoni, Barbara Greco, Raffaella Tonini</p>

The control of instrumental actions engages distinct behavioral strategies whose contributions are regulated with experience. Instrumental performance, which depends on the causal relationship between actions and their outcomes (A–O), relies on flexible, goal-directed control of behavior. Actions can become less sensitive to changes in action–outcome (A–O) contingencies with repetition, resulting in more inflexible, habitual behaviors. The loss of flexibility with repetition requires plasticity at corticostriatal circuits. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet established, and how these mechanisms specifically relate to the inability to adapt to new contingencies is unknown. In mice, we find that inflexible behavioral performance following overtraining of an appetitive instrumental task is associated with a reduced capacity of mGluR5 receptors in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) to engage intracellular signaling in response to changes in action–outcome contingency. We also observed dichotomous modulation of timing-dependent synaptic depression (tLTD) at striatal projection neurons of the indirect (iSPNs) and direct (dSPNs) pathways. Preventing overstimulation of mGluR5 signaling through a homotypic process preserved behavioral sensitivity to changes in A–O contingencies despite overtraining, and averted the related biochemical and synaptic changes. Furthermore, mGluR5 couples to different signaling pathways to regulate tLTD in iSPNs and dSPNs. Our findings demonstrate that decreased signaling capacity of mGluR1/5, accompanied by cell-type-specific modulation of corticostriatal synapses in the DLS, represents a key molecular mechanism underlying overtraining-induced behavioral inflexibility.

Metabolic cross-feeding networks are central to shaping microbial community dynamics in environments ranging from the rhizosphere, gut, and marine carbon cycling. Yet cross-feeding has predominantly been viewed by examining exchanged small metabolites. In contrast, the role of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS)—a complex mixture of proteins, polysaccharides, DNA, and humic-like compounds—in cross-feeding remains poorly understood, mainly due to technical challenges in measuring their secretion relative to small metabolites. Using chitin-degrading microbes as a model system, we used a bicarbonate-buffered bioreactor coupled with elemental analysis, which allowed us to quantify both EPS and small metabolite secretion. This revealed that ~25% of carbon exuded by a chitin degrader is in the form of EPS. EPS was produced at similar levels across marine chitin-degrading isolates and seawater communities, underscoring its importance relative to small metabolites. Notably, different sources of EPS were found to select for distinct and diverse microbial communities. Combining in vitro enzyme assays and untargeted metabolomics, we show that EPS undergoes sequential degradation—from large oligomers to smaller, broadly accessible monomers. This sequential breakdown creates a temporal succession of metabolic niches, potentially fueling a shift from specialist species degrading complex substrates to a more diverse community of generalists using simpler monomers. By identifying EPS as a major and dynamic contributor to cross-feeding networks, our findings reveal a hidden layer of complexity in how microbial communities assemble and function across ecosystems.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003277">Mapping cerebral blood perfusion and its links to multi-scale brain organization across the human lifespan</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Asa Farahani, Zhen-Qi Liu, Eric G. Ceballos, Justine Y. Hansen, Karl Wennberg, Yashar Zeighami, Mahsa Dadar, Claudine J. Gauthier, Alain Dagher, Bratislav Misic</p>

Blood perfusion delivers oxygen and nutrients to all cells, making it a fundamental feature of brain organization. How cerebral blood perfusion maps onto micro-, meso- and macro-scale brain structure and function is therefore a key question in neuroscience. Here we analyze pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (ASL) data from 1305 healthy individuals in the HCP Lifespan studies (5–22 and 36–100 years) to reconstruct a high-resolution normative cerebral blood perfusion map. At the cellular and molecular level, cerebral blood perfusion co-localizes with granular layer IV, biological pathways for maintenance of cellular relaxation potential and mitochondrial organization, and with neurotransmitter and neuropeptide receptors involved in vasomodulation. At the regional level, blood perfusion aligns with cortical arealization and is greatest in regions with high metabolic demand and resting-state functional hubs. Looking across individuals, blood perfusion is dynamic throughout the lifespan, follows micro-architectural changes in development, and maps onto individual differences in physiological changes in aging. In addition, we find that cortical atrophy in multiple neurodegenerative diseases (late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, TDP-43C, and dementia with Lewy bodies) is most pronounced in regions with lower perfusion, highlighting the utility of perfusion topography as an indicator of transdiagnostic vulnerability. Finally, we show that ASL-derived perfusion can be used to delineate arterial territories in a data-driven manner, providing insights into how the vascular system is linked to human brain function. Collectively, this work highlights how cerebral blood perfusion is central to, and interlinked with, multiple structural and functional systems in the brain.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To examine volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (vMRI) in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD), compared to multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), and healthy controls (HC).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Standardized vMRI in MOGAD were compared to age, sex, and disease duration matched MS (5:1), and non-matched NMOSD and HC, in mixed linear models with time and group interactions. Disability assessments included; patient determined disease steps (PDDS), manual dexterity (MDT), walking speed (WST), processing speed (PST), and contrast sensitivity tests (CST). Correlations between vMRI and disability in MOGAD were examined.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 293 patients were included; 32 MOGAD, 160 MS, 49 NMOSD, and 52 HC. MOGAD had a faster rate of volume loss in all brain regions compared to HC (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). At baseline, MOGAD had preserved thalamic (0.000507, <i>p</i> = 0.005), caudate (0.000287, <i>p</i> = 0.004), and putamen (0.000341, <i>p</i> = 0.007) fractions than MS. Longitudinally, MOGAD had increased lateral ventricle fraction (LVF) (−0.000645, <i>p</i> = 0.032), but less hippocampal (0.000031, <i>p</i> = 0.044) and upper cervical cord area (UCCA) loss (1.482887, <i>p</i> = 0.005), compared to NMOSD. MOGAD had increased LVF (0.00529, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), but less UCCA loss (0.538656, <i>p</i> = 0.042) longitudinally compared to MS. Among MOGAD, UCCA was associated with PDDS (−0.72, <i>p</i> = 0.004) and CST (0.60, <i>p</i> = 0.014). Whole brain fraction (WBF) was associated with PDDS (−0.66, <i>p</i> = 0.01) and PST (0.52, <i>p</i> = 0.019). LVF was associated with PDDS (0.78, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MOGAD showed longitudinal brain volume loss compared to HC. Deep gray matter was relatively preserved compared to MS, while MS and NMOSD had greater UCCA loss, indicating regional differences in atrophy. Despite less overall atrophy, volume loss in MOGAD was associated with disability. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Exenatide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, has neuroprotective effects in preclinical models of multiple system atrophy (MSA). We investigated these effects in a proof-of-concept clinical trial.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this single-center, randomized, open label trial, participants with MSA were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive subcutaneous injections of exenatide 2 mg weekly for 48 weeks, or as controls, followed by a 48-week washout period. The primary outcome was the Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS) parts I + II combined score at 48 weeks. Objective secondary outcome measures included the numbers of participants losing ambulation; scoring ≥ 3 on UMSARS part I items for falls, speech, swallowing, as well as timed walking and measures of quality of life and cognition.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between September 23, 2020, and May 6, 2022, 50 participants were recruited (25 in each group). At 48 weeks, UMSARS parts I + II scores had worsened by 6.1 points (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.0 to 9.3, SD = 6.9) in the exenatide group and by 13 3 points (95% CI = 9.2 to 17.3, SD = 9.4) in the control group, an adjusted mean difference of −7.4 points (−11.3 to −3.6, <i>p</i> = 0.0003). There were no statistically significant differences at either 48 or 96 weeks in the secondary outcome measures. Biomarker analysis of neurofilament light chain and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) alpha-synuclein oligomer load, sensor-derived gait measures, and imaging findings were also similar between groups.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Exenatide was associated with positive effects on participant-reported symptoms and clinician-rated MSA severity. In contrast, none of the objective comparisons differed according to randomization. Given the open label trial design, the discrepancy between the primary outcome and the objective measures may be explicable as placebo effects/observer bias. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

     alt="Transcriptomic Profiling Reveals Injury Responses of Peripheral Glial Cells in Sensory Neuron Microenvironment"/>
<p>This study reanalyzed single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from naïve and injured DRGs at 1 and 3 days post-sciatic nerve crush in mice. It identified differentially expressed genes and the biological processes associated with Schwann cells and satellite glial cells within the DRGs, highlighting the upregulation of Atf3 following injury.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Schwann cells and satellite glial cells (SGCs) are important peripheral glial cells in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and commendable participants in regulating neuronal functions. Herein, through re-analysis of publicly available single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from naïve and injured DRG at 1 and 3 days following sciatic nerve crush, we systematically characterized the transcriptomic alterations in Schwann cells and SGCs. Cell clustering and counting showed that peripheral glial cells occupied a large population after sciatic nerve crush injury. Using differentially expression analysis, we found that apoptosis and immune responses were involved in all these examined peripheral glial cells. Unique glial cells also responded differently to sciatic nerve crush injury, with myelinating Schwann cells characterized by enriched adenosine 5′-monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) metabolic signaling, non-myelinating Schwann cells characterized by enriched tissue-remodeling-related signaling, and SGCs characterized by enriched ion channels. Using single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering (SCENIC) to determine essential transcription factors in specific cell type at the naïve state and at multiple time points after sciatic nerve crush injury, we found that Schwann cells and SGCs possessed their own elevated transcription factor-coding genes, with activating factor 3 (Atf3) commonly highly up-regulated in all peripheral glial cells. This study provides a profiling map of peripheral glial cells at the naïve and injured states, expands the acknowledgment of the molecular background of nerve injury, and can lead to novel strategies to promote sensory nerve regeneration.</p>

                Lambert et al. describe an antibody-based approach targeting the pleiotropic TGF-β1 cytokine in a manner unexplored thus far. At variance with existing TGF-β1-targeting strategies aiming to block TGF-β1 immunosuppression in cancer or fibrosis, their antibodies augment TGF-β1 activity to treat severe diseases characterized by excessive immune responses.

                Beyond its established role in glycolysis, PFKFB3 directly phosphorylates CAD to promote de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. This dual function enables PFKFB3 to regulate cell growth not only through glycolysis but also by supporting nucleotide production, thereby linking glycolysis to nucleic acid metabolism.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92068">N-cadherin mechanosensing in ovarian follicles controls oocyte maturation and ovulation</a></h4>

              
                The cell adhesion molecule N-cadherin (CDH2) is a membrane component of adherens junctions which regulates tissue morphogenesis and architecture. In the follicles of mammalian ovaries, N-cadherin adherens junctions are present between granulosa cells, cumulus cells, and at the interface of cumulus cell transzonal projections and the oocyte. We demonstrate a mechanosensory role of N-cadherin integrating tissue structure and hormonal regulation of follicular morphogenic events including expansion of the cumulus–oocyte complex (COC) matrix, oocyte maturation, and ovulation. Two small molecule N-cadherin antagonists inhibited COC maturation in vitro. Transcriptome profiling revealed that targets of β-catenin and YAP1 pathways were dysregulated by N-cadherin antagonists. In vivo, N-cadherin antagonist significantly reduced ovulation in mice compared to controls (11 vs 26 oocytes/ovary; p = 5.8 × 10<sup>−6</sup>). Ovarian follicles exhibited structural dysgenesis with granulosa and cumulus cell layers becoming disorganised and the connection between cumulus cells and the oocyte disrupted and the transcriptome again indicated altered mechanical sensing causing dysregulation of the Hippo/YAP and β-catenin pathways and extracellular matrix reorganisation. Granulosa-specific N-cadherin depletion in <i>Cdh2</i><sup>Fl/FL</sup>;<i>Amhr2</i><sup>Cre/+</sup> also showed significantly altered mechanosensitive gene expression and reduced ovulation. Our findings demonstrate a critical role for N-cadherin in ovarian follicular development and ovulation, and the potential to inhibit ovulation through targeting this signalling mechanism.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87722">Specific modulation of CRISPR transcriptional activators through RNA-sensing guide RNAs in mammalian cells and zebrafish embryos</a></h4>

              
                Cellular transcripts encode important information regarding cell identity and disease status. The activation of CRISPR in response to RNA biomarkers holds the potential for controlling CRISPR activity with spatiotemporal precision. This would enable the restriction of CRISPR activity to specific cell types expressing RNA biomarkers of interest while preventing unwanted activity in other cells. Here, we present a simple and specific platform for modulating CRISPR activity in response to RNA detection through engineering <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> Cas9 single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs). sgRNAs are engineered to fold into complex secondary structures that, in the ground state, inhibit their activity. Engineered sgRNAs become activated upon recognising complementary RNAs, thus enabling Cas9 to perform its function. Our approach enables CRISPR activation in response to RNA detection in both HEK293T cells and zebrafish embryos. Iterative design optimisations allowed the development of computational tools for generating sgRNAs capable of detecting RNA sequences of choice. Mechanistic investigations reveal that engineered sgRNAs are cleaved during RNA detection, and we identify key positions that benefit from chemical modifications to improve the stability of engineered sgRNAs in vivo. Our sensors open up novel opportunities for developing new research and therapeutic applications using CRISPR activation in response to endogenous RNA biomarkers.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90905">Altered reactivity to threatening stimuli in Drosophila models of Parkinson’s disease, revealed by a trial-based assay</a></h4>

              
                The fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> emerges as an affordable, genetically tractable model of behavior and brain diseases. However, despite the surprising level of evolutionary conservation from flies to humans, significant genetic, circuit-level, and behavioral differences hinder the interpretability of fruit fly models for human disease. Therefore, to allow a more direct fly-versus-human comparison, we surveyed the rarely exploited, rich behavioral repertoire of fruit flies with genetic alterations relevant to Parkinson’s disease (PD), including overexpression of human mutant Parkin or α-synuclein proteins and mutations in dopamine receptors. Flies with different genetic backgrounds displayed variable behaviors, including freezing, slowing, and running, in response to predator-mimicking passing shadows used as threatening stimuli in a single-animal trial-based assay. We found that the expression of human mutant Parkin in flies resulted in reduced walking speed and decreased reactivity to passing shadows. Flies with dopamine receptor mutations showed similar alterations, consistent with the motor and cognitive deficits typical in humans with PD. We also found age-dependent trends in behavioral choice during the fly lifespan, while dopamine receptor mutant flies maintained their decreased general reactivity throughout all age groups. Our data demonstrate that single-trial behavioral analysis can reveal subtle behavioral changes in mutant flies that can be used to further our understanding of disease pathomechanisms and help gauge the validity of genetic <i>Drosophila</i> models of neurodegeneration, taking us one step closer to bridging the gap in fly-to-human translation.

">Reducing type II error: Sample size affects fMRI cluster-extent threshold to correct for multiple comparisons</a></h4>

              
                Many procedures to correct for multiple comparisons in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis require a minimum cluster-extent threshold; however, sample size is often not modeled. In the present study, a series of simulations was conducted where sample size was varied to determine whether this parameter affected cluster threshold. The primary hypothesis was that modeling sample size in the simulations would reduce cluster thresholds. A secondary hypothesis was that this reduction in cluster size was due to between-subject variability, which was tested by eliminating the corresponding standard error term. Whole-brain acquisition volume parameters were fixed, while the following key parameters were varied to reflect commonly employed ranges: sample size (N = 10, 20, or 30), corrected p-value (.05, .01, or .001), individual-voxel p-value (.01, .005, or .001), FWHM (3, 5, or 7 mm), and voxel resolution (2 or 3 mm). Each simulation consisted of 100 iterations repeated 100 times, with a total of 4,860,000 iterations and 66,420,000 simulated subjects. There was a significant effect of condition; clusters were approximately 18% smaller with versus without N modeled (and there was a significant increase in cluster thresholds for larger sample sizes). Bayesian analysis provided very strong support for the secondary hypothesis. The present findings indicate that sample size should be incorporated into all methods to provide the most accurate thresholds possible and reduce type II error. A broader range of topics is discussed including balancing type I and type II error along with the fallacy that non-task fMRI activity reflects null data.

">Subunit-specific roles of LRRC8 proteins in determining glutamate permeability of astrocytic volume-regulated anion channels</a></h4>

              
                Volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) are ubiquitous chloride channels that play a crucial role in cell volume regulation but are also involved in many other physiological processes. VRACs are heteromers of proteins from the leucine-rich repeat-containing family 8 (LRRC8A-E), with LRRC8A being essential. Other LRRC8 subunits are expressed in a cell type-specific manner and modulate the biophysical properties of VRACs, including permeability to small signaling molecules. Here, we used primary astrocyte cultures from wild-type and genetically modified C57BL/6 mice to investigate (i) LRRC8 subunit composition of endogenous VRACs in the brain and (ii) the subunit determinants of VRAC permeability to the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. qPCR and RNA-seq revealed high expression of Lrrc8a-d in mouse forebrain and astrocytes. As expected, Lrrc8a deletion abolished VRAC activity, measured as swelling-activated release of the glutamate analogue D-[3H]aspartate. RNAi knockdown of individual subunits established that LRRC8A and LRRC8C are key components of astrocytic glutamate-permeable VRACs, with their siRNAs reducing radiotracer release by 85% and 56%, respectively. Downregulation of LRRC8D had a moderate effect, which depended on the severity of swelling. Combined silencing of LRRC8C and LRRC8D suggested that these subunits act in distinct channel populations. LRRC8B silencing alone was ineffective but partially rescued glutamate release in LRRC8C- or LRRC8D-knockdown cells. Overall, these findings indicate that astrocytic glutamate-permeable VRACs are primarily composed of LRRC8A and LRRC8C, with a possible structural role for LRRC8B. The refined understanding of VRAC subunit composition may inform the development of targeted VRAC inhibitors to mitigate glutamate excitotoxicity in neurological disorders.

">A Mechanistic Whole Brain Model to Capture Simultaneous EEG-fMRI Data</a></h4>

              
                This study introduces a novel oscillatory network model to simulate simultaneous EEG-fMRI data, addressing the reconstruction challenge that arises due to their contrasting spatiotemporal scales. Here, each brain region is modelled by two oscillator clusters: a cluster of low-frequency (LFO) and high-frequency Hopf oscillators (HFO) coupled with an innovative power-coupling rule, facilitating cross-frequency interactions. The model is trained in two stages: learning oscillator frequencies and phase relations using a biologically plausible complex-Hebbian rule in the first stage, followed by a modified complex backpropagation for amplitude approximation, overcoming limitations of poor accuracy and computational complexity in existing models. This framework outperforms current methods in replicating empirical Functional Connectivity (FC), Functional Connectivity Dynamics (FCD), and modularity over disparate spatio-temporal scales. The correlation between the FC of fMRI and the FCs of various EEG frequency bands is reflected in the strengths of the LFO-HFO coupling. Furthermore, in-silico structural perturbation studies quantified the effect of pruning of the anatomical connectivity on spatiotemporal dynamics in terms of FC, FCD, modularity, and integration level (ISOR). The model's ability to reconstruct simultaneous EEG-fMRI data showcases significant advancement in understanding the resting-state brain's functionality from multimodal settings and deciphering neurological disorders in diverse spatiotemporal scales.

">Dynamic Inter-Modality Source Coupling Reveals Sex Differences in Children based on Brain Structural-Functional Network Connectivity: A Multimodal MRI Study of the ABCD Dataset</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sex differences in brain development have been widely reported in both structural and functional domains, particularly during late childhood and adolescence. Prior studies have shown that males and females differ in gray matter volume, network connectivity profiles, and their associations with behavior and cognition. However, how these sex differences manifest in the coupling between brain structure and function remains less understood. In this study, we introduce dynamic inter-modality source coupling (dIMSC), an extension of our earlier inter-modality source coupling method (IMSC). While IMSC evaluates the coupling between source-based morphometry (SBM) from structural MRI (sMRI) and static functional network connectivity from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), dIMSC incorporates the temporal dimension by linking SBM with dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC). Objectives: This study investigated the transient coupling between dynamic FNC (dFNC) and sMRI gray matter volume over time, and compared sex differences in dFNC-sMRI coupling across brain regions in children. Methods: We used data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, focusing on children aged 9-11 years. Structural MRI data were analyzed using SBM, applying independent component analysis (ICA) to extract gray matter sources. Resting-state fMRI data were processed to compute dFNC using a sliding window approach. For each subject, dIMSC was computed as the cross-correlation between the dFNC matrix and the SBM vector, resulting in a time-resolved vector that reflects the strength of structure-function coupling across components. Coupling values were categorized into positive, neutral, or negative based on a specific threshold. Sex differences in dFNC-sMRI coupling were evaluated using two-sample t-tests with correction for multiple comparisons. Results: Our analysis revealed significant sex-specific patterns, with males exhibiting stronger positive coupling in the postcentral gyrus and precuneus, whereas females showed stronger coupling in the inferior parietal lobule and middle frontal gyrus. Additional sex differences emerged in the neutral and negative coupling domain, with males demonstrating stronger coupling in the superior temporal gyrus, calcarine gyrus, and superior parietal lobule, whereas females exhibited stronger coupling in the caudate nucleus, cerebellum, and inferior parietal lobule. Conclusion: Together these findings suggest distinct coupling in brain structure-function coupling between sexes, potentially reflecting sex-specific organization of functional networks and their structural substrates. The dIMSC method advances our earlier work by enabling time-resolved analysis of brain structure-function coupling, providing a powerful framework for investigating neurodevelopmental processes.

">A lateralized sensory signaling pathway mediates context-dependent olfactory plasticity in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Lateralization of neuronal functions plays a critical role in regulating behavioral flexibility, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are challenging to establish at a single-neuron level. We previously showed that attraction of C. elegans to a medium-chain alcohol switches to avoidance in a uniform background of a second attractive odorant. This context-dependent behavioral plasticity is mediated by symmetric inversion of the odor-evoked response sign in the bilateral AWC olfactory neurons. Here we show that this symmetric response plasticity is driven by asymmetric molecular mechanisms in the AWC neuron pair. Mutations in the gcy-12 receptor guanylyl cyclase abolish odor response plasticity only in AWCOFF; the opposing odor-evoked response signs in AWCOFF and AWCON in gcy-12 mutants results in these animals being behaviorally indifferent to this chemical. We find that gcy-12 is expressed, and required, in both AWC neurons to regulate odor response plasticity only in AWCOFF. We further show that disruption of AWC fate lateralization results in loss of asymmetry in the response plasticity in gcy-12 mutants. Our results indicate that symmetric neuronal response plasticity can arise from asymmetry in underlying molecular mechanisms, and suggest that lateralization of signaling pathways in defined conditions may enhance neuronal and behavioral flexibility.

">A sensitivity-consistency trade-off in memory formation regulated by dentate gyrus inhibition</a></h4>

              
                A core computational challenge for memory systems is the need to balance two opposing demands: (1) sensitivity to subtle input differences for flexible encoding, and (2) consistency to preserve stable, interference-resistant representations. How the brain dynamically regulates this trade-off remains unclear. Here, we show that modulating parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons in the dentate gyrus regulates this balance by shifting hippocampal computation between sensitivity and consistency regimes. Combining cell-type-specific pharmacogenetics, behavioral assays, and computational modeling, we found that reducing PV+-mediated inhibition during encoding enhanced the subsequent discrimination of similar inputs but it increased vulnerability to interference. In contrast, increased inhibition stabilized memory representations at the cost of discriminability. Together, the results establish PV+ interneurons as key modulators of hippocampal memory processing, enabling the system to prioritize either flexible updating or robust retention based on inhibitory tone at the time of encoding. This sensitivity-consistency continuum may reflect a fundamental organizing principle of memory computation.

">Mature interneuron subtypes arise from distinct spatial and temporal subdomains within the caudal ganglionic eminence</a></h4>

              
                Forebrain inhibitory interneurons are born from transient structures during embryogenesis known as the medial and caudal ganglionic eminences (MGE and CGE, respectively). The MGE and CGE generate distinct, non-overlapping cohorts of interneurons that can be defined by their transcriptomic, morphological, and electrophysiological characteristics. In the MGE, somatostatin-expressing (SST+) cells arise predominantly from the dorsal-posterior MGE from E12-E16 whereas parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) cells are born in the ventral-anterior MGE throughout embryogenesis. This relationship between spatiotemporal origin and mature interneuron subtypes has led to genetic insights regarding fate and maturation of these MGE-derived cells. A similar organization has never been explored in the CGE, despite the significant increase in CGE-derived interneurons in primates compared to rodents. Here we harvested fluorescent cells from distinct CGE subdomains at E13.5 and E15.5 and grafted them into WT neonatal mice cortices. One month post-transplantation, brains were immunostained for interneuron markers to relate mature CGE-derived interneurons with spatiotemporal origins within the CGE. Our results indicate that there are significant spatial biases in the CGE, with specific interneuron subtypes preferentially arising from distinct CGE subdomains. These biases are relatively stable over time, implying a minimal relationship between temporal birthdate and interneuron subtype. In the future, combining these insights with spatial transcriptome profiles will generate critical insights into gene regulation of CGE-derived interneurons.

">The Alzheimer's disease risk gene SORL1 is a regulator of excitatory neuronal function</a></h4>

              
                Background: Synaptic dysfunction is an early feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a significant contributor to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Proper localization of proteins involved in pre-and post-synaptic composition is dependent on endosomal recycling and trafficking. Alterations in trafficking complexes, such as retromer, have been shown to impair neuronal synaptic function. The SORL1 gene has been strongly implicated in AD pathogenesis and its protein product, SORLA, is an endosomal receptor that works in conjunction with retromer to regulate endosomal recycling. Methods: We utilized our established human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived excitatory cortical neuron model to examine SORL1's role in synaptic protein composition and neuronal function. We used Quantitative Multiplex co-Immunoprecipitation (QMI), a mesoscale. proteomics assay to measure synaptic protein interactions, immunocytochemistry to assay synapses and AMPA receptor subunits, and multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) to measure neuronal function of SORL1 KO and isogenic control hiPSC derived neurons. Results: We show that loss of SORL1 expression significantly changes many synaptic protein-protein interactions and patterns of expression. We demonstrate that SORL1 deficient neurons are hyperactive and that the increased activity is driven by glutamatergic neurotransmission. Hyperexcitability has been seen in other models of AD with familial AD variants in amyloid precursor protein and presenilin genes, due to the increases in amyloid beta (Ab) peptides. In the case of SORL1 deficiency, the hyperexcitability we observe is primarily due to mis-trafficking of synaptic proteins, rather than an overall increase in Ab. Finally, we find that SORL1 deficient neurons have impaired synaptic plasticity. Conclusions: These findings further support a growing body of literature implicating early endosomal recycling defects as drivers of AD pathogenesis. Furthermore, our work supports further emphasis on exploring the SORL1-retromer pathway for therapeutic development in AD.

">Evidence from Formal Logical Reasoning Reveals that the Language of Thought is not Natural Language</a></h4>

              
                Humans are endowed with a powerful capacity for both inductive and deductive logical thought: we easily form generalizations based on a few examples and draw conclusions from known premises. Humans also arguably have the most sophisticated communication system in the animal kingdom: natural language allows us to express complex and structured meanings. Some have therefore argued for a tight relationship between complex thought and language, postulating that reasoning, including logical reasoning, relies on linguistic representations. We systematically investigated the relationship between logical reasoning and language using two complementary approaches. First, we used non-invasive brain imaging (fMRI) to examine neural activity as healthy adults engaged in inductive and deductive logical reasoning tasks. And second, we behaviorally evaluated logical abilities in individuals with extensive lesions to the language brain areas and consequent severe linguistic impairment. Our findings reveal that the language system is not engaged during logical reasoning, and patients with severe aphasia exhibit intact performance on logic tasks. Instead, inductive reasoning recruits the domain-general multiple demand system implicated broadly in goal-directed behaviors, whereas deductive reasoning draws on brain regions that are distinct from both the language and the multiple demand systems. Together, these results indicate that linguistic representations are neither utilized nor required for inductive or deductive logical reasoning.

">Slow wave stimulation using a smartwatch improves sleep quality</a></h4>

              
                Poor sleep affects millions, increasing long-term health risks. Slow wave entrainment (SWE) is a promising method for improving sleep. While typically lab-based, we developed a smartwatch app to perform SWE and tested it with 93 participants at home. We found our app significantly increased slow wave and delta power amplitude, consistent with lab-based SWE protocols. This stimulation also reduced sleep fragmentation. Furthermore, we found that the increased slow wave amplitude was linked to improvements in mood and cognition measures, indicating the induced slow waves were functional. SWE produced the largest benefits in mood for participants who reported higher levels of pre-existing sleep problems. Our results demonstrate the potential for individuals to improve their sleep and cognition using a health smartwatch that performs SWE, offering an accessible tool for millions to enhance their sleep quality and health.

">Multi-omic analyses identify molecular targets of Chd7 that mediate CHARGE syndrome model phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                CHARGE syndrome is a developmental disorder that affects 1 in 10,000 births, and patients exhibit both physical and behavioral characteristics. De novo mutations in chd7 (chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7) cause 67% of CHARGE syndrome cases. Chd7 is a DNA-binding chromatin remodeler with thousands of predicted binding sites in the genome, making it challenging to define molecular pathways linking loss of chd7 to CHARGE phenotypes. To address this problem, here we used a previously characterized zebrafish CHARGE model to generate transcriptomic and proteomic datasets from larval zebrafish head tissue at two developmental time points. By integrating these datasets with differential expression, pathway, and upstream regulator analyses, we identified multiple consistently dysregulated pathways and defined a set of candidate genes that link loss of chd7 with disease-related phenotypes. Finally, to functionally validate the roles of these genes, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockdown of capgb, nefla, or rdh5 phenocopies behavioral defects seen in chd7 mutants. Our data provide a resource for further investigation of molecular mediators of chd7 and a template to reveal functionally relevant therapeutic targets to alleviate specific aspects of CHARGE syndrome.

">Spectral decomposition of local field potentials uncovers frequency-tuned gain modulation of working memory in primate visual system</a></h4>

              
                Working memory has been shown to modulate visual processing in a variety of ways, including changes in visual response gain, oscillatory power, spike timing, and phase coding of information1-3. Here we probe working memorys influence on various oscillatory components within visual areas, using the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT) technique to decompose the local field potential(LFP)4; this method allows single-trial quantification of the properties of various oscillatory components. We examine the impact of spatial working memory on visual processing within the extrastriate middle temporal (MT) visual area of rhesus macaque monkeys, comparing the responses in MT when remembering a location inside or outside the receptive fields of the neurons being recorded. Using traditional bandpass filtering, we replicate previous reports that working memory enhances visual responses, low-frequency oscillatory power, spike-phase locking, and phase coding of visual information. Applying the MODWT method, we find that working memory modulates both oscillatory power and the precise frequency of oscillations within a general frequency band. The precise frequency of several lower frequency components (alpha, theta, and beta frequencies, but not gamma or high gamma) correlates with visually-evoked firing rates of MT neurons on a trial-by-trial basis. This relationship between firing rate and oscillatory component frequency is maintained across memory conditions, indicating a close link between the neural mechanisms driving oscillatory frequency and firing rates.

">Compositionality of social gaze in the prefrontal-amygdala circuits</a></h4>

              
                Each social gaze can be deconstructed into primitive components, including gaze content, social state, and gaze duration. To reduce dimensionality and facilitate generalization, the brain needs to represent primitive components in an abstract format. We examined the compositional aspects of social gaze primitives in the brain when macaques were engaged in real-life social gaze interaction. Interactive social gaze behavior was determined by how primitives were combined, rather than by their independent sums, providing evidence for behavioral compositionality. The amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex represented content and state in an abstract format and orthogonally to one another, whereas the dorsomedial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices exhibited limited generalization. Linear mixed selective neurons facilitated the abstraction underlying generalization. The content and state information had distinct communicative patterns across the prefrontal-amygdala circuits to minimize interference, which was mediated by linear mixed selectivity neurons. Our findings provide the neural grammar supporting the compositionality of social gaze.

">Extracting Value Coding Features from Individual Serotonin Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive behaviour requires animals to continually re-evaluate the appetitive or aversive quality of their surroundings. Dorsal raphe serotonin neurons, the main source of serotonergic input to the forebrain, have been implicated in both signaling the quality of an animal's environment and regulating reward-seeking and punishment-avoiding behaviour, but the precise quantity signaled by these neurons has remained unclear, as well as how these neurons relate with behaviour. Using open-access recordings of serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus while animals perform a dynamic Pavlovian task, we compare firing rate and behavioral data with a model that considers reward history accumulated over a tunable timescale. Our Bayesian parameter estimation supports that serotonergic neurons are consistent with reward history being estimated over about a hundred trials on average, with a heterogeneity across individual neurons spanning 30 to 300 trials. Anticipatory licking also correlated with reward history at multiple timescale, but could not be dissociated from that of a time/thirst nuisance variable and otherwise mostly on a timescale faster than seen in serotonergic cells. These results provide a more precise picture of the dynamics of serotonergic cells under a dynamic Pavlovian task.

">Concurrent category-selective neural activity across the ventral occipito-temporal cortex supports a non-hierarchical view of human visual recognition</a></h4>

              
                Visual recognition is a fundamental human brain function, supported by a network of regions in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOTC). This network is thought to be organized hierarchically, with definite processing stages increasing in invariance and time-course from posterior to anterior cortical regions. Here we provide a stringent test of this view by measuring category-selective neural activity to natural images of faces across the VOTC with electrophysiological intracerebral recordings in a large human sample (N=140; >11000 recording sites). Face-selective high frequency broadband (30-160 Hz) neural activity is distributed across the VOTC, with right-hemispheric dominance and regional peaks of activity. Crucially, while a progressive increase in degree of category-selectivity is found along the postero-anterior axis, neural activity occurs largely concurrently (~100ms onset and ~450ms offset) across all VOTC regions. These observations challenge the standard hierarchical view of neural organization of visual object recognition in the human association cortex, calling for alternative models of this key brain function.

">Synaptic density and relative connectivity conservation maintain circuit stability across development</a></h4>

              
                As bodies grow during postembryonic and postnatal development, nervous systems must expand to preserve circuit integrity. To investigate how circuits retain stable wiring and function throughout development, we combined synaptic-level resolution electron microscopy (EM) with computational modeling in the Drosophila larval nociceptive system. Based on EM data, we generated the contactome-the set of synaptic membrane contacts-of this circuit across development to evaluate how different mechanisms contribute to wiring stability. Specifically, we investigated three mechanisms: correlation-based plasticity and synaptic scaling, which modify synaptic strength, and structural plasticity, which preserves synaptic density. We found that synaptic sizes remain largely stable across development, and synapses between the same pre- and postsynaptic neurons do not correlate in size, suggesting that synaptic scaling and correlation-based plasticity play a limited role in shaping connectivity. In contrast, dendritic synaptic density remains invariant despite a previously reported fivefold increase in neuron size and synapse number. This conservation requires increased axonal presynaptic density to compensate for unequal axonal and dendritic growth. As neurons grow, this adjustment is necessary to maintain the relative synaptic input associated with each presynaptic partner across development. Our EM analysis and modeling show that conserving relative connectivity and synaptic density is sufficient to maintain consistent postsynaptic responses across development, highlighting these conserved structural features as key contributors to circuit stability during growth.

">Functional specialisation across the first five years of life: a longitudinal characterisation of social perception with fNIRS</a></h4>

              
                Research in typically developing infants has shown robust and consistent brain activation to social versus non-social visual and auditory stimuli in a network of brain regions, including the inferior frontal, anterior temporal and posterior superior temporal cortex. However, large-scale, longitudinal neuroimaging studies across early childhood, particularly in low- and middle-income countries are rare, yet important, given that they offer a powerful means of capturing within-person changes in neurodevelopment and identifying targets for intervention and support. Here we investigated brain responses to social perception across the first 2000 days of life (conception to five years of age) with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) longitudinally with participants in The Gambia within the Brain Imaging for Global Health (BRIGHT) Project. We found that social visual stimuli elicited a specialised right posterior temporal response across all six age points studied here (5, 8, 12, 18, 24 months and 3-5 years of age), with concurrent specialised left responses at four of the six time points (5, 8, 18 months and 3-5 years of age). Inferior frontal regions showed age-related changes in brain activation, with the youngest (5 months) and oldest (24 months to 3-5 years) time points evidencing more widespread frontal social visual responses. In contrast, social auditory stimuli elicited a significantly stronger and more prolonged response than non-social auditory stimuli across all six age points from 5 months to 3-5 years across a range of frontal and temporal areas. Furthermore, from individual infant trajectories of brain activation, we identified different profiles of age-dependent specialisation to social auditory stimuli, with some specialising earlier than others. Finally, in studying the hemodynamic responses, we showed that their different characteristics were influenced by age and stimulus type, highlighting the limitations of comparing fNIRS signal amplitudes across ages, and the importance of incorporating the timing of the fNIRS response to characterise brain activation more comprehensively.

">Morphometric Interpretation of Postganglionic Sympathetic Neurons that Innervate Myocardium</a></h4>

              
                Background and Aims: The sympathetic nervous system modulates cardiac functions through neurotransmitters such as neuropeptide-Y and galanin released by postganglionic neurons. Hence, we hypothesize that dendritic and axonal morphological architecture of cardiac-innervating neurons might reflect the communicating input and output signals either within the postsynaptic neurons or to the adjacent myocardial cells. Methods: In the current study, we carried-out morphometric analyses of cardiac-innervating neurons, measuring dendritic size, shape, and neuronal-polarity. We used retrograde tracers (adeno-associated virus conjugate to fluorophores) injected either from left-ventricular myocardial tissue or fore-limb skin tissue-beds. Stellate ganglia were harvested from the mice for imaging and morphometric analysis. Results: Our findings revealed that cardiac-projecting neurons exhibit a multipolar structure and are significantly larger in cross-sectional area and volume compared to forelimb skin-pad-innervating neurons. Interpretation: These morphological characteristics may offer valuable insights into the neural architecture underlying cardiac remodeling, although further investigation is needed. This study focuses solely on the structural, not functional, features of cardiac-innervating neurons to better understand their specialization within the autonomic nervous system.

">Mapping neural activity during naturalistic visual and memory search</a></h4>

              
                In everyday life, individuals often search for one of several items stored in memory. This cognitive process, known as hybrid search, is critical for tasks like navigating using landmarks. While the behavioral aspects of hybrid search have been extensively studied, the underlying neural mechanisms remain less understood. In this study, we combined concurrent magnetoencephalography (MEG) and eye movement recordings to investigate the oscillatory and evoked neural dynamics supporting hybrid search in naturalistic settings. Twenty-one participants (12 males, 9 females) performed a free-viewing task involving visual search for targets embedded in memory (hybrid search) across naturalistic scenes. Time-Frequency analyses revealed specific neural signatures during memory encoding, retention, and visual search. During encoding and retention, posterior alpha-band power decreased with memory load, reflecting heightened perceptual and mnemonic demands. During visual search, frontoparietal beta-band activity scaled with memory load, suggesting increased cognitive control. By aligning MEG signals to eye movement events and applying source reconstruction, we identified an early visually evoked lambda response, localized to V1, followed by a distributed P3m component, with maximum activation in the right inferior parietal lobe, that discriminated target from distractor fixations. Together, these findings demonstrate how oscillatory and evoked responses dynamically support hybrid search in naturalistic settings, revealing how memory, attention, and visual processing interact during active vision.

">Physical exercise and motor learning: A scoping review</a></h4>

              
                Physical exercise, as an adjunct to motor task practice, can enhance motor learning by inducing neurophysiological changes known to facilitate this process. This preregistered scoping review mapped current knowledge on physical exercise effect on motor learning. The search strategy used indexed terms and keywords across several databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL Complete, ERIC and Dissertations & Theses Global (ProQuest). A total of 66 sources were included, comprising 62 experimental studies and 4 review articles. Most studies involved healthy populations (83%), while fewer focused on clinical populations (17%). Aerobic exercise was the predominant type used, with lower-limb cycling the most common approach (73%). Among various intensity levels, high-intensity exercise was most frequently investigated; however, in some studies, reported exercise intensity did not accurately reflect the method prescribed (6%). In contrast, resistance exercise was rarely examined (0.6%), highlighting a notable gap in existing literature. While some studies assessed both motor skill acquisition and a retention test (55%), others only employed a retention test (45%). Motor learning was measured at different time points including short-term or long-term delayed retention tests, or both. This underscores the need for consistent inclusion of long-term delayed retention tests to better capture lasting effects of physical exercise on motor learning. This review highlights gaps in the literature, including underrepresentation of clinical populations, inaccurate reporting of exercise intensity, scarce research on resistance exercise, and limited assessment of long-term retention tests, all of which may affect interpretation of the effect of physical exercise on motor learning.

">Electrophysiological effects of psilocybin co-administered with midazolam</a></h4>

              
                The serotonergic psychedelic psilocybin induces glutamatergic neural plasticity and profoundly alters consciousness. Midazolam, a benzodiazepine and positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors, blunts neural plasticity and induces conscious amnesia. In our recent open label pilot study, we co-administered psilocybin (25 mg) with intravenous midazolam, targeting midazolam doses that allowed maintained subjective experience (mild to moderate sedation) while blocking memory encoding. We reported preliminary results from high density scalp electroencephalography (EEG) recorded during dosing session. Here, we used linear mixed effects models to examine changes in EEG band power (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma), normalized Lempel Ziv complexity (LZCn), and spectral exponent (SE) as a function of time during the dosing session, and relate these changes to the subjective effects of the drugs measured with the Observer's Assessment of Arousal and Sedation (OAA/S) and the Altered States of Consciousness (ASC) questionnaire. We found that SE, LZCn, and power in all frequency bands changed during drug administration, with an early (15-30 mins) increase in beta power and decrease in SE followed by increases in LZCn and SE and broadband decreases in power over the next 6 hours. OAA/S improved model fits for alpha power while ASC improved the model fits for SE and LZCn. These data are further evidence that the effects of psilocybin are maintained in the presence of midazolam, and that aspects of the subjective experience are captured by EEG measures.

">Characterizing a hallmark of glymphatic insufficiency: Wasteosomes accumulate in periventricular white matter hyperintensities and exhibit complex relationships with mixed pathology, sclerotic index and perivascular space</a></h4>

              
                The glymphatic system is a recently elucidated waste clearance system in the brain, thought to be critical for the maintenance of homeostasis. Corpora amylacea or wasteosomes, are discontinuous lipid labyrinth structures that are polyglucosan rich, retain cellular waste and are thought to be of astrocytic origin. Wasteosomes have been proposed as a hallmark of glymphatic insufficiency predominantly due to: 1) their spatial localization around glymphatic drainage points including periventricular (PV) regions, perivascular spaces (PVS), and sub-pial regions; and, 2) their correlation with aging, vascular disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and conditions that impair sleep. White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are diffuse hyperintense areas seen on T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans that represent damage to white matter. PV WMHs and are known predictors of mild cognitive impairment, stroke, dementia and death. The relationship between wasteosome accumulation, PV WMHs, vascular pathology and PVS is currently unknown. For the first time, in a mixed diagnostic cohort of pathologically diagnosed: Alzheimers disease (AD), cerebrovascular disease (CVD), mixed AD/CVD, and control tissue with no pathological diagnosis, we connected the histopathological wasteosome profile in periventricular brain sections in relation to 7T FLAIR-MRI confirmed PV WMHs, vascular stenosis and PVS. Our results reveal wasteosomes accumulate in PV WMHs, are increased in proximity to large PV venules, and exhibit complex relationships with WMH severity, mixed pathology, sclerotic index and PVS. These findings suggest wasteosomes may serve as histological markers of impaired glymphatic drainage and provide new insights into the pathophysiology underlying white matter injury.

">Representational drift without synaptic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Neural computations support stable behavior despite relying on many dynamically changing biological processes. One such process is representational drift (RD), in which neurons' responses change over the timescale of minutes to weeks, while perception and behavior remain unchanged. Generally, RD is believed to be caused by changes in synaptic weights, which alter individual neurons' tuning properties. Since these changes alter the population readout, they require adaptation of downstream areas to maintain stable function, a costly and non-local problem. Here we propose that much of the observed drift phenomena can be explained by a simpler mechanism: changes in the excitability of cells without changes in synaptic weights. We show that such excitability changes can change the apparent tuning of neurons without requiring adaptation of population readouts in downstream areas. We use spike coding networks (SCN) to show that the extent of these tuning shifts matches experimentally observed changes. Moreover, specific decoders trained on one excitability setting perform poorly on others, while a general decoder can perform close to optimal across excitability changes if trained across many days. Our work proposes a simple mechanism without synaptic plasticity that explains experimentally observed RD, while downstream decoding and, by extension, behavior remain stable.

Previous studies demonstrated associations between fractional anisotropy and intelligence, but it remains unclear whether this relation is due to greater axon density, parallel, homogenous fiber orientation distributions, or greater myelination, as all influence fractional anisotropy.

We were also interested whether specific white matter indices mediate the pathway linking genetic disposition for intelligence to phenotype. For the first time, we conducted mediation analyses investigating whether neurite density index, orientation dispersion index, and myelin water fraction of 64 white matter tracts mediate the effects of polygenic scores for intelligence on general intelligence (<span style="font-style:italic;">g</span>).

                <p>Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) are critical events implicated in memory consolidation, planning, and the reactivation of recent experiences. Under freely moving conditions, a well-established dichotomy exists: hippocampal networks predominantly generate theta oscillations during periods of reward pursuit (preparatory behaviors) and exhibit pronounced SWR activity once the reward is achieved (consummatory behaviors). Here, it was examined how SWRs are modulated by reward delivery and small movements in head-fixed rats. Contrary to the canonical view established in freely moving settings, the results revealed that the dominant and more enduring effect was a sustained suppression of SWR activity immediately following water delivery. Moreover, even minor, localized movements (such as whisking or body adjustments) decreased SWR occurrence, demonstrating that hippocampal ripple generation is highly sensitive to motor engagement, irrespective of reward timing. Such movement-induced suppression of ripples persisted during both sleep-like states and quiet wakefulness, suggesting that while large-scale brain states modulate the overall likelihood of SWR generation, local motor-related influences exert a state-independent inhibitory effect on hippocampal ripples. These results show that SWR modulation by behavioral states and body movements is more context dependent than previously appreciated.</p>

                <p>Neural circuits that consolidate sensory cues are essential for neurological functioning. Neural circuits that perform sensory integration can vary greatly because the sensory processing regions of the brain employ various neural motifs. Here, we investigate a neural circuit that mediates the response to conflicting stimuli in <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>. We concurrently expose animals to an aversive dispersal pheromone, osas#9, and an attractive bacterial extract. While worms usually avoid osas#9 alone, they suppress this avoidance behavior in the presence of a bacterial extract. Loss-of-function mutants and cell-specific rescues reveal that signaling from the ADF and NSM neurons is essential for bacterial extract-induced osas#9 avoidance attenuation. The inhibitory serotonin receptor, MOD-1, which is widely expressed on interneurons and motor neurons, is required for this sensory integration, suggesting that serotonin acts in an inhibitory manner. By performing calcium imaging on the ADF neurons in synaptic signaling (<I>unc-13</I>) and peptidergic (<I>unc-31</I>) signaling mutant backgrounds, we show that the ADF neurons require input from other neurons to respond to food extracts. We reveal a cue integration neural circuit in which serotonergic signaling and sensory neurons silence an aversive neural signal.</p>

                <p>Recognition of conspecific individuals in mammals is an important skill, thought to be mediated by a distributed array of neural networks, including those processing olfactory cues. Recent data from our groups have shown that social memory can be supported by olfactory cues alone and that interactions with an individual lead to increased neural representations of that individual in the anterior olfactory nucleus, an olfactory network strongly modulated by the neuropeptide oxytocin. We here show, using a computational model, how enhanced representations in the AON can easily arise during the encoding phase, how they can be modulated by OXT, and how a dynamic memory signature in the form of enhanced oscillations in the beta range arises from the architecture of the neural networks involved. These findings have implications for our understanding how social memories are formed and retrieved and generate further hypotheses that can be tested experimentally.</p>

Though chemical exposures are known to potentially have negative impacts on health, including contributing to chronic diseases such as cancer, the quantitative contribution of risk is not fully understood for every chemical. A commonly used approach to quantify levels of risk is to measure the proportion of organisms (such as a total number of zebrafish on a plate or mice in a cage) with abnormal behavioral responses or morphology at increasing concentrations of chemical exposure. A particular challenge with processing the proportional data from these assays is the appropriate estimation of chemical concentration levels that result in malformations or acute toxicity, as these values typically vary between experimental measurements. The recommended approach by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is to fit benchmark dose curves with specific filters and model fitting steps, which are crucial to properly processing the proportional data. Several tools exist for the fitting of benchmark dose response curves, but none are standalone Python libraries built to process both morphological and behavioral with all the EPA recommended filters, filter parameters, models, and model parameters. Thus, here we present the benchmark dose response curve (<i>bmdrc</i>) Python library, which was built to closely follow these EPA guidelines with helpful visualizations of filters and fitted model curves, and reports for reproducibility purposes. <i>bmdrc</i> is open-source and has demonstrated utility as a support package to an existing web portal for information on chemicals (https://srp.pnnl.gov). Our package will support any toxicology analysis where the response is a proportional value at increasing levels of a concentration of a chemical or chemical mixture.

Exploring how local perturbations of cortical activity propagate across the brain network not only helps us understanding causal mechanisms of brain networks, but also offers a network insight into neurobiological mechanisms for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) treatment response. The concurrent combination of TMS and electroencephalography (EEG) enables researchers to track the TMS-evoked activity, defined here as scalp-recorded electrical signals reflecting the brain’s response to TMS, with millisecond-level temporal resolution. Based on this technique, we proposed a quantitative framework which combined sparse non-negative matrix factorization and stage-dependent effective connectivity methods to infer the causal pathways in TMS-evoked brain responses. We found that single-pulse TMS firstly induces local activity in the directly stimulated regions (left primary motor cortex, M1), and then propagates to the contralateral hemisphere and other brain regions. Finally, it propagates back from the contralateral region (right M1) to the stimulation region (left M1). This study provides preliminary evidence demonstrating how local perturbations propagate through brain networks to influence various cortical regions, and offers insights into the neural mechanism of TMS-evoked brain responses from a network perspective.

                <p>by Christian Brodbeck, Thomas Hannagan, James S. Magnuson</p>

Human speech recognition transforms a continuous acoustic signal into categorical linguistic units, by aggregating information that is distributed in time. It has been suggested that this kind of information processing may be understood through the computations of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that receives input frame by frame, linearly in time, but builds an incremental representation of this input through a continually evolving internal state. While RNNs can simulate several key <i>behavioral</i> observations about human speech and language processing, it is unknown whether RNNs also develop computational dynamics that resemble human <i>neural speech processing</i>. Here we show that the internal dynamics of long short-term memory (LSTM) RNNs, trained to recognize speech from auditory spectrograms, predict human neural population responses to the same stimuli, beyond predictions from auditory features. Variations in the RNN architecture motivated by cognitive principles further improved this predictive power. Specifically, modifications that allow more human-like phonetic competition also led to more human-like temporal dynamics. Overall, our results suggest that RNNs provide plausible computational models of the cortical processes supporting human speech recognition.

                <p>by Jordan Moutet, Eric Rivals, Fabio Pardi</p>

Ancestral sequence reconstruction is an important task in bioinformatics, with applications ranging from protein engineering to the study of genome evolution. When sequences can only undergo substitutions, optimal reconstructions can be efficiently computed using well-known algorithms. However, accounting for indels in ancestral reconstructions is much harder. First, for biologically-relevant problem formulations, no polynomial-time exact algorithms are available. Second, multiple reconstructions are often equally parsimonious or likely, making it crucial to correctly display uncertainty in the results. Here, we consider a parsimony approach where only deletions are allowed, while addressing the aforementioned limitations. First, we describe an exact algorithm to obtain all the optimal solutions. The algorithm runs in polynomial time if only one solution is sought. Second, we show that all possible optimal reconstructions for a fixed node can be represented using a graph computable in polynomial time. While previous studies have proposed graph-based representations of ancestral reconstructions, this result is the first to offer a solid mathematical justification for this approach. Finally we provide arguments for the relevance of the deletion-only case for the general case.

During evolution, plants have developed the ability to produce a vast array of specialized metabolites, which play crucial roles in helping plants adapt to different environmental niches. However, their biosynthetic pathways remain largely elusive. In the past decades, increasing numbers of plant biosynthetic pathways have been elucidated based on approaches utilizing genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics. These efforts, however, are limited by the fact that they typically adopt a target-based approach, requiring prior knowledge. Here, we present MEANtools, a systematic and unsupervised computational integrative omics workflow to predict candidate metabolic pathways de novo by leveraging knowledge of general reaction rules and metabolic structures stored in public databases. In our approach, possible connections between metabolites and transcripts that show correlated abundance across samples are identified using reaction rules linked to the transcript-encoded enzyme families. MEANtools thus assesses whether these reactions can connect transcript-correlated mass features within a candidate metabolic pathway. We validate MEANtools using a paired transcriptomic-metabolomic dataset recently generated to reconstruct the falcarindiol biosynthetic pathway in tomato. MEANtools correctly anticipated five out of seven steps of the characterized pathway and also identified other candidate pathways involved in specialized metabolism, which demonstrates its potential for hypothesis generation. Altogether, MEANtools represents a significant advancement to integrate multi-omics data for the elucidation of biochemical pathways in plants and beyond.

Age-related thymic involution leads to diminished output of naïve T-cells. While this process is suggested to increase the risk of disease severity in the elderly following infection, direct evidence is lacking. We developed two mouse models that allow us to experimentally prevent or reverse thymic involution. Constitutive Myc expression in thymic epithelial cells (TEC) of middle-aged mice enhanced thymic function, and increased numbers of peripheral naïve CD4 and CD8 T-cells. Inducible Myc expression reversed age-related thymic involution and partially recovered peripheral naïve T-cell numbers. Importantly, improving thymic function in these settings preserved T-cell-dependent antibody responses and significantly reduced T-cell-associated mortality after infection with <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>. Improved thymic function also rebalanced age-associated alterations in the Treg pool, and mitigated loss of the transcriptional Th1 signature in aged conventional T-cells. Our findings support the value of TEC-focused thymic regeneration strategies for enhancement of T-cell-mediated immunity in the elderly.

Adult stem cell niches relays in the acquisition of a reversible state of quiescence to ensure long-lasting DNA integrity and cell expansion. Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the dentate gyrus (DG) enter quiescence before the adult hippocampal neurogenic niche is fully established. However, the mechanisms controlling NSC first quiescence entry and quiescence deepness are largely unknown. Using conditional mutant mouse during embryonic or postnatal stages, we have determined that transcription factor Sox5 is required to restrict first entry in quiescence. Moreover, we have found a critical window during the second postnatal week when NSCs build up a shallow quiescent state. Loss of Sox5 leads to an excess of NSCs in shallow quiescence, which are prone to activate, leading to a neurogenic burst in the adult DG and precocious depletion of the NSC pool. Mechanistically, Sox5 prevents an excess of BMP canonical signaling, a pathway that is required to maintain the correct levels of NSC quiescence during the second postnatal week. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that Sox5 is required to control the correct balance between shallow and deep quiescence during the first postnatal weeks of DG development, a balance which is essential for establishing long-lasting adult neurogenesis.

                Reid et al. develop MultiVINE-seq to map thousands of non-coding disease variants to genes in human brain vascular cells. Cerebrovascular disease variants compromise vessel integrity, whereas Alzheimer’s variants amplify immune activity, notably in T cells. This reveals how vascular genetic variation drives distinct neurological diseases through divergent molecular pathways.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99302">Learning place cells and remapping by decoding the cognitive map</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal place cells are known for their spatially selective firing and are believed to encode an animal’s location while forming part of a cognitive map of space. These cells exhibit marked tuning curves and rate changes when an animal’s environment is sufficiently manipulated, in a process known as remapping. Place cells are accompanied by many other spatially tuned cells, such as border cells and grid cells, but how these cells interact during navigation and remapping is unknown. In this work, we build a normative place cell model wherein a neural network is tasked with accurate position reconstruction and path integration. Motivated by the notion of a cognitive map, the network’s position is estimated directly from its learned representations. To obtain a position estimate, we propose a non-trainable decoding scheme applied to network output units, inspired by the localized firing patterns of place cells. We find that output units learn place-like spatial representations, while upstream recurrent units become boundary-tuned. When the network is trained to perform the same task in multiple simulated environments, its place-like units learn to remap like biological place cells, displaying global, geometric, and rate remapping. These remapping abilities appear to be supported by rate changes in upstream units. While the model does not learn grid-like units, its place unit centers form clusters organized in a hexagonal lattice in open fields. When we decode the center locations of CA1 place fields in mice, we find preliminary evidence of a similar clustering tendency. This suggests a potential mechanism for the interaction between place cells, border cells, and grid cells. Our model provides a normative framework for learning spatial representations previously reserved for biological place cells, providing new insight into place cell field formation and remapping.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106509">A computational pipeline to track chromatophores and analyze their dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Cephalopod chromatophores are small dermal neuromuscular organs, each consisting of a pigment-containing cell and 10–20 surrounding radial muscles. Their expansions and contractions, controlled and coordinated by the brain, are used to modify the animal’s appearance during camouflaging and signaling. Building up on tools developed by this lab, we propose a flexible computational pipeline to track and analyze chromatophore dynamics from high-resolution videos of behaving cephalopods. This suite of functions, which we call CHROMAS, segments and classifies individual chromatophores, compensates for animal movements and skin deformations, thus enabling precise and parallel measurements of chromatophore dynamics and long-term tracking over development. A high-resolution tool for the analysis of chromatophore deformations during behavior reveals details of their motor control and thus, their likely innervation. When applied to many chromatophores simultaneously and combined with statistical and clustering tools, this analysis reveals the complex and distributed nature of the chromatophore motor units. We apply CHROMAS to the skins of the bobtail squid <i>Euprymna berryi</i> and the European cuttlefish <i>Sepia officinalis</i>, illustrating its performance with species with widely different chromatophore densities and patterning behaviors. More generally, CHROMAS offers many flexible and easily reconfigured tools to quantify the dynamics of pixelated biological patterns.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93906">Refining the resolution of the yeast genotype–phenotype map using single-cell RNA-sequencing</a></h4>

              
                Genotype–phenotype mapping (GPM), or the association of trait variation to genetic variation, has been a long-lasting problem in biology. The existing approaches to this problem allowed researchers to partially understand within- and between-species variation as well as the emergence or evolution of phenotypes. However, traditional GPM methods typically ignore the transcriptome or have low statistical power due to challenges related to dataset scale. Thus, it is not clear to what extent selection modulates transcriptomes and whether cis- or trans-regulatory elements are more important. To overcome these challenges, we leveraged the cost efficiency and scalability of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) by collecting data from 18,233 yeast cells from 4489 F2 segregants derived from an F1 cross between the laboratory strain BY4741 and the vineyard strain RM11-1a. More precisely, we performed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping with the scRNA-seq data to identify single-cell eQTL and transcriptome variation patterns associated with fitness variation inferred from the segregant bulk fitness assay. Due to the larger scale of our dataset and its multidimensionality, we could recapitulate results from decades of work in GPM from yeast bulk assays while revealing new associations between phenotypic and transcriptomic variations at a broad scale. We evaluated the strength of the association between phenotype variation and expression variation, revealed new hotspots of gene expression regulation associated with trait variation, revealed new gene functions with high expression heritability, and highlighted the larger aggregate effect of trans-regulation compared to cis-regulation. Altogether, these results suggest that integrating large-scale scRNA-seq data into GPM improves our understanding of trait variation in the context of transcriptomic regulation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104423">Phosphoglycerate mutase regulates Treg differentiation through control of serine synthesis and one-carbon metabolism</a></h4>

              
                The differentiation and suppressive functions of regulatory CD4 T cells (Tregs) are supported by a broad array of metabolic changes, providing potential therapeutic targets for immune modulation. In this study, we focused on the regulatory role of glycolytic enzymes in Tregs and identified phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) as being differentially overexpressed in Tregs and associated with a highly suppressive phenotype. Pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of PGAM reduced Treg differentiation and suppressive function while reciprocally inducing markers of a pro-inflammatory, T helper 17 (Th17)-like state. The regulatory role of PGAM was dependent on the contribution of 3-phosphoglycerate (3 PG), the PGAM substrate, to de novo serine synthesis. Blocking de novo serine synthesis from 3 PG reversed the effect of PGAM inhibition on Treg polarization, while exogenous serine directly inhibited Treg polarization. Additionally, altering serine levels in vivo with a serine/glycine-free diet increased peripheral Tregs and attenuated autoimmunity in a murine model of multiple sclerosis. Mechanistically, we found that serine limits Treg polarization by contributing to one-carbon metabolism and methylation of Treg-associated genes. Inhibiting one-carbon metabolism increased Treg polarization and suppressive function both in vitro and in vivo in a murine model of autoimmune colitis. Our study identifies a novel physiologic role for PGAM and highlights the metabolic interconnectivity between glycolysis, serine synthesis, one-carbon metabolism, and epigenetic regulation of Treg differentiation and suppressive function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99767">Optimal information gain at the onset of habituation to repeated stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Biological and living systems process information across spatiotemporal scales, exhibiting the hallmark ability to constantly modulate their behavior to ever-changing and complex environments. In the presence of repeated stimuli, a distinctive response is the progressive reduction of the activity at both sensory and molecular levels, known as habituation. In this work, we solve a minimal microscopic model devoid of biological details, where habituation to an external signal is driven by negative feedback provided by a slow storage mechanism. We show that our model recapitulates the main features of habituation, such as spontaneous recovery, potentiation, subliminal accumulation, and input sensitivity. Crucially, our approach enables a complete characterization of the stochastic dynamics, allowing us to compute how much information the system encodes on the input signal. We find that an intermediate level of habituation is associated with a steep increase in information. In particular, we are able to characterize this region of maximal information gain in terms of an optimal trade-off between information and energy consumption. We test our dynamical predictions against experimentally recorded neural responses in a zebrafish larva subjected to repeated looming stimulations, showing that our model captures the main components of the observed neural habituation. Our work makes a fundamental step towards uncovering the functional mechanisms that shape habituation in biological systems from an information-theoretic and thermodynamic perspective.

However, it remains unclear how preparatory brain activity influences the temporal dynamics of ER during reinterpretation. Thirty-four young adults involving an adapted ER task, downregulated their negative emotional experiences through reinterpretation. Strategy preparation nearly aligns with strategy use during reactive ER, while preparation precedes use during proactive ER. Behavioral data showed that reactive ER was more effective than proactive ER. Event-related potential (ERP) and decoding results revealed that goal representation engaged attentional resources to maintain regulatory information and suppress irrelevant interference during preparation. This intensive resource allocation may impair the working memory capacity, thereby reducing the regulatory effect in proactive ER. In contrast, reactive ER, unhindered by the preparation stage, preserved sufficient cognitive resources to adaptively re-engage in ER as necessary. Overall, preparation not only influenced the timing of ER but also impeded strategy use. The regulatory effect was determined by the brain activation patterns observed during the regulation stage.</span>

Previous studies show that individuals with agenesis of the corpus callosum show overall preserved default-mode network functional connectivity, suggesting compensatory mechanisms for maintaining bilaterally correlated activity. In this study, we aimed to explore white matter pathways that support default-mode network-related networks in 15 children with agenesis of the corpus callosum and 27 typically developing controls, using combined diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging. A seed-based and dynamic functional connectivity approach enabled us to examine default-mode network spatial and temporal properties and their white matter substrates. While spatial default-mode network patterns were similar across groups, we found differences in temporal dynamics of 1 network and in white matter–default-mode network correspondence. These differences were either observed in white matter tracts directly associated with complete or partial absence of the corpus callosum or in white matter tracts such as the fornix and the anterior and posterior commissures, which have been previously implicated in neuroplasticity in agenesis of the corpus callosum.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The frontal eye fields (FEFs) are critically involved in voluntary shifts of attention by sending top-down signals to posterior cortices to modulate local alpha-band activity. However, the exact temporo-spatial dynamics of this process are still unclear. Here, we investigated how covert shifts of attention and associated modulations of posterior alpha power are affected after FEF inhibition by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Neither right nor left FEF disruption impaired attention task performance. This absence of behavioral effects seems to be related to the here employed long cue-target intervals, giving the attention system sufficient time to compensate (across trials) for the TMS insult. Alpha power modulation was quantified both in the entire cue-target interval, and in two additional time windows: after cue presentation (early) and before target appearance (late). TMS effects on alpha power clearly differed across time windows, being strongest in the early time window. The reduced TMS effect in the late window might reflect recovery/compensation employed by the attention system, possibly explaining the lack of TMS-induced behavioral effects. These results are in line with a central role of the FEF in the control of visuospatial attention and support the notion of compensation mechanisms in cognitive brain systems in the temporal domain.</span>

                <p>There is a growing imperative to understand the neurophysiological impact of our rapidly changing and diverse technological, social, chemical, and physical environments. To untangle the multidimensional and interacting effects requires data at scale across diverse populations, taking measurement out of a controlled lab environment and into the field. Electroencephalography (EEG), which has correlates with various environmental factors as well as cognitive and mental health outcomes, has the advantage of both portability and cost-effectiveness for this purpose. However, with numerous field researchers spread across diverse locations, data quality issues and researcher idle time due to insufficient participants can quickly become unmanageable and expensive problems. In programs we have established in India and Tanzania, we demonstrate that with appropriate training, structured teams, and daily automated analysis and feedback on data quality, nonspecialists can reliably collect EEG data alongside various survey and assessments with consistently high throughput and quality. Over a 30&nbsp;week period, research teams were able to maintain an average of 25.6 participants per week, collecting data from a diverse sample of 7,933 participants ranging from Hadzabe hunter-gatherers to office workers. Furthermore, data quality, computed on the first 5,831 records using two common methods, PREP and FASTER, was comparable to benchmark datasets from controlled lab conditions. Altogether this resulted in a cost per participant of under $50, a fraction of the cost typical of such data collection, opening up the possibility for large-scale programs particularly in low- and middle-income countries.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/7/ENEURO.0229-25.2025?rss=1">Disrupted Neuronal Dynamics of Reward Encoding in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex and the Ventral Tegmental Area after Episodic Social Stress</a></h4>

              
                <p>Previous research suggests that stress predisposes individuals to develop substance use disorders by disrupting the brain processing of rewards. Yet, how stressful experiences disrupt the brain processing of reward-related cues at the neuronal level is poorly understood. Intermittent social defeat (ISD) is a stress animal model that increases reward-seeking behavior, drug self-administration, and choice impulsivity up to several weeks after stress. We tested the hypothesis that ISD disrupts the neuronal encoding of reward cues in key areas of the brain that regulate reward-seeking. We examined in vivo neuronal dynamics in response to reward cues in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) simultaneously, and longitudinally, in control and stressed Long&ndash;Evans male rats during a discriminative stimulus reward-seeking task. In the dmPFC, ISD decreased cue-evoked neuronal activity 1 and 15&nbsp;d after stress, which indicates a long-term degradation of outcome anticipation-related processing. In the VTA, ISD increased cue-evoked neuronal activity 1&nbsp;d after stress but decreased cue-evoked activity 15&nbsp;d after stress. Moreover, decoding analysis in single neurons and populations showed parallel increases and decreases in reward discrimination accuracy in the VTA which points to time-dependent changes in incentive salience after stress. These results demonstrate that ISD differently disrupts the neuronal encoding of reward cues in the dmPFC and the VTA and identify novel neurofunctional signatures that underlie a higher predisposition to seek out rewards after stress.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the relationships among subthalamic nucleus (STN) activity, gait initiation (GI), and freezing of gait (FOG) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We recorded GI and STN local field potentials (LFPs) via externalized cables in 38 patients with PD (35 reporting FOG in daily life), both OFF- and ON-dopamine (DOPA). GI was also recorded in 24 age-matched controls. GI scores related to pace, rhythm, and balance were derived from kinetics, and FOG was identified using kinematics. We compared GI performance related to FOG and DOPA, and GI-LFP relationships between posterior-sensorimotor versus central-associative STN regions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>DOPA<sup>OFF</sup>, 12 patients with PD had FOG observed (FOG-OBS, 263 episodes), occurring at a mean of 8 steps after GI, and 26 had no FOG observed (NOBS; FOG-NOBS). GI pace scores were worse in FOG-OBS than in FOG-NOBS patients with PD, even when not followed by FOG, with weaker association with alpha/low-beta activity in the posterior STN. Although rhythm/balance scores were similar between groups, their association with low-beta activity was stronger in FOG-OBS patients, with rhythm correlating more in the central STN and balance in the posterior STN. GI was worse preceding imminent FOG, with disrupted low-beta GI-LFP associations and emergent high-beta correlations with reversed spatial distribution (pace/rhythm-posterior STN, balance-central). Dopamine improved pace, rhythm, and FOG, and partially restored STN activity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results reveal 3 distinct GI patterns in patients with PD associated with absence, predisposition to, or imminent occurrence of FOG, with STN neuronal modulations differing dynamically between the posterior and central subregions. These markers could support developing adaptive DBS strategies tailored for episodic gait impairments. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>
