              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12263">EEG-fused Digital Twin Brain for Autonomous Driving in Virtual Scenarios</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.12263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current methodologies typically integrate biophysical brain models with functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) data - while offering millimeter-scale spatial resolution (0.5-2 mm^3 voxels), these approaches suffer from limited temporal resolution (>0.5 Hz) for tracking rapid neural dynamics during continuous tasks. Conversely, Electroencephalogram (EEG) provides millisecond-scale temporal precision (<=1 ms sampling rate) for real-time guidance of continuous task execution, albeit constrained by low spatial resolution. To reconcile these complementary modalities, we present a generalizable Bayesian inference framework that integrates high-spatial-resolution structural MRI(sMRI) with high-temporal-resolution EEG to construct a biologically realistic digital twin brain(DTB) model. The framework establishes voxel-wise mappings between millisecond-scale EEG and sMRI-derived spiking networks, while demonstrating its translational potential through a brain-inspired autonomous driving simulation. Our EEG-DTB model achieves capabilities: (1) Biologically-plausible EEG signal generation (0.88 resting-state,0.60 task-state correlation), with simulated signals in task-state yielding steering predictions outperforming both chance and empirical signals (p<0.05); (2) Successful autonomous driving in the CARLA simulator using decoded steering angles. The proposed approach pioneers a new paradigm for studying sensorimotor integration and for mechanistic studies of perception-action cycles and the development of brain-inspired control systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12417">Spontaneous Spatial Cognition Emerges during Egocentric Video Viewing through Non-invasive BCI</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.12417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable capacity for spatial cognition, allowing for self-localization even in novel or unfamiliar environments. While hippocampal neurons encoding position and orientation are well documented, the large-scale neural dynamics supporting spatial representation, particularly during naturalistic, passive experience, remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on electroencephalography (EEG) can decode spontaneous, fine-grained egocentric 6D pose, comprising three-dimensional position and orientation, during passive viewing of egocentric video. Despite EEG's limited spatial resolution and high signal noise, we find that spatially coherent visual input (i.e., continuous and structured motion) reliably evokes decodable spatial representations, aligning with participants' subjective sense of spatial engagement. Decoding performance further improves when visual input is presented at a frame rate of 100 ms per image, suggesting alignment with intrinsic neural temporal dynamics. Using gradient-based backpropagation through a neural decoding model, we identify distinct EEG channels contributing to position -- and orientation specific -- components, revealing a distributed yet complementary neural encoding scheme. These findings indicate that the brain's spatial systems operate spontaneously and continuously, even under passive conditions, challenging traditional distinctions between active and passive spatial cognition. Our results offer a non-invasive window into the automatic construction of egocentric spatial maps and advance our understanding of how the human mind transforms everyday sensory experience into structured internal representations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11783">Foundation Models for Brain Signals: A Critical Review of Current Progress and Future Directions</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.11783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patterns of electrical brain activity recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) offer immense value for scientific and clinical investigations. The inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research progress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of first-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current state-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end, this study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility. In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. We believe that developing benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies, and applications in collaboration with domain experts may further advance the translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11972">Graph Representations for Reading Comprehension Analysis using Large Language Model and Eye-Tracking Biomarker</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.11972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reading comprehension is a fundamental skill in human cognitive development. With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing need to compare how humans and LLMs understand language across different contexts and apply this understanding to functional tasks such as inference, emotion interpretation, and information retrieval. Our previous work used LLMs and human biomarkers to study the reading comprehension process. The results showed that the biomarkers corresponding to words with high and low relevance to the inference target, as labeled by the LLMs, exhibited distinct patterns, particularly when validated using eye-tracking data. However, focusing solely on individual words limited the depth of understanding, which made the conclusions somewhat simplistic despite their potential significance. This study used an LLM-based AI agent to group words from a reading passage into nodes and edges, forming a graph-based text representation based on semantic meaning and question-oriented prompts. We then compare the distribution of eye fixations on important nodes and edges. Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit high consistency in language understanding at the level of graph topological structure. These results build on our previous findings and offer insights into effective human-AI co-learning strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13257">Modeling Higher-Order Interactions in Sparse and Heavy-Tailed Neural Population Activity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2308.13257v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neurons process sensory stimuli efficiently, showing sparse yet highly variable ensemble spiking activity involving structured higher-order interactions. Notably, while neural populations are mostly silent, they occasionally exhibit highly synchronous activity, resulting in sparse and heavy-tailed spike-count distributions. However, its mechanistic origin - specifically, what types of nonlinear properties in individual neurons induce such population-level patterns - remains unclear. In this study, we derive sufficient conditions under which the joint activity of homogeneous binary neurons generates sparse and widespread population firing rate distributions in infinitely large networks. We then propose a subclass of exponential family distributions that satisfy this condition. This class incorporates structured higher-order interactions with alternating signs and shrinking magnitudes, along with a base-measure function that offsets distributional concentration, giving rise to parameter-dependent sparsity and heavy-tailed population firing rate distributions. Analysis of recurrent neural networks that recapitulate these distributions reveals that individual neurons possess threshold-like nonlinearity followed by supralinear activation that jointly facilitates sparse and synchronous population activity. These nonlinear features resemble those in modern Hopfield networks, suggesting a connection between widespread population activity and the network's memory capacity. The theory establishes sparse and heavy-tailed distributions for binary patterns, forming a foundation for developing energy-efficient spike-based learning machines.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17294">Neural field equations with time-periodic external inputs and some applications to visual processing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2407.17294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to present a mathematical framework for the study of flickering inputs in visual processing tasks. When combined with geometric patterns, these inputs influence and induce interesting psychophysical phenomena, such as the MacKay and the Billock-Tsou effects, where the subjects perceive specific afterimages typically modulated by the flickering frequency. Due to the symmetry-breaking structure of the inputs, classical bifurcation theory and multi-scale analysis techniques are not very effective in our context. We thus take an approach based on the input-output framework of control theory for Amari-type neural fields. This allows us to prove that, when driven by periodic inputs, the dynamics converge to a periodic state. Moreover, we study under which assumptions these nonlinear dynamics can be effectively linearised, and in this case we present a precise approximation of the integral kernel for short-range excitatory and long-range inhibitory neuronal interactions. Finally, for inputs concentrated at the center of the visual field with a flickering background, we directly relate the width of the illusory contours appearing in the afterimage with both the flickering frequency and the strength of the inhibition.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17079">Efficient and faithful reconstruction of dynamical attractors using homogeneous differentiators</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.17079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing the attractors of complex nonlinear dynamical systems from available measurements is key to analyse and predict their time evolution. Existing attractor reconstruction methods typically rely on topological embedding and may produce poor reconstructions, which differ significantly from the actual attractor, because measurements are corrupted by noise and often available only for some of the state variables and/or their combinations, and the time series are often relatively short. Here, we propose the use of Homogeneous Differentiators (HD) to effectively de-noise measurements and more faithfully reconstruct attractors of nonlinear systems. Homogeneous Differentiators are supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees about their de-noising capabilities, and their results can be fruitfully combined with time-delay embedding, differential embedding and functional observability. We apply our proposed HD-based methodology to simulated dynamical models of increasing complexity, from the Lorenz system to the Hindmarsh-Rose model and the Epileptor model for neural dynamics, as well as to empirical data of EEG recordings. In the presence of corrupting noise of various types, we obtain drastically improved quality and resolution of the reconstructed attractors, as well as significantly reduced computational time, which can be orders of magnitude lower than that of alternative methods. Our tests show the flexibility and effectiveness of Homogeneous Differentiators and suggest that they can become the tool of choice for preprocessing noisy signals and reconstructing attractors of highly nonlinear dynamical systems from both theoretical models and real data.

                arXiv:2503.06138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the System 0/1/2/3 framework as an extension of dual-process theory, employing a quad-process model of cognition. Expanding upon System 1 (fast, intuitive thinking) and System 2 (slow, deliberative thinking), we incorporate System 0, which represents pre-cognitive embodied processes, and System 3, which encompasses collective intelligence and symbol emergence. We contextualize this model within Bergson's philosophy by adopting multi-scale time theory to unify the diverse temporal dynamics of cognition. System 0 emphasizes morphological computation and passive dynamics, illustrating how physical embodiment enables adaptive behavior without explicit neural processing. Systems 1 and 2 are explained from a constructive perspective, incorporating neurodynamical and AI viewpoints. In System 3, we introduce collective predictive coding to explain how societal-level adaptation and symbol emergence operate over extended timescales. This comprehensive framework ranges from rapid embodied reactions to slow-evolving collective intelligence, offering a unified perspective on cognition across multiple timescales, levels of abstraction, and forms of human intelligence. The System 0/1/2/3 model provides a novel theoretical foundation for understanding the interplay between adaptive and cognitive processes, thereby opening new avenues for research in cognitive science, AI, robotics, and collective intelligence.

                arXiv:2507.10678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major challenge in the use of neural networks both for modeling human cognitive function and for artificial intelligence is the design of systems with the capacity to efficiently learn functions that support radical generalization. At the roots of this is the capacity to discover and implement symmetry functions. In this paper, we investigate a paradigmatic example of radical generalization through the use of symmetry: base addition. We present a group theoretic analysis of base addition, a fundamental and defining characteristic of which is the carry function -- the transfer of the remainder, when a sum exceeds the base modulus, to the next significant place. Our analysis exposes a range of alternative carry functions for a given base, and we introduce quantitative measures to characterize these. We then exploit differences in carry functions to probe the inductive biases of neural networks in symmetry learning, by training neural networks to carry out base addition using different carries, and comparing efficacy and rate of learning as a function of their structure. We find that even simple neural networks can achieve radical generalization with the right input format and carry function, and that learnability is closely correlated with carry function structure.

                arXiv:2507.11566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Hebbian learning as a novel method for swarm robotics, enabling the automatic emergence of heterogeneity. Hebbian learning presents a biologically inspired form of neural adaptation that solely relies on local information. By doing so, we resolve several major challenges for learning heterogeneous control: 1) Hebbian learning removes the complexity of attributing emergent phenomena to single agents through local learning rules, thus circumventing the micro-macro problem; 2) uniform Hebbian learning rules across all swarm members limit the number of parameters needed, mitigating the curse of dimensionality with scaling swarm sizes; and 3) evolving Hebbian learning rules based on swarm-level behaviour minimises the need for extensive prior knowledge typically required for optimising heterogeneous swarms. This work demonstrates that with Hebbian learning heterogeneity naturally emerges, resulting in swarm-level behavioural switching and in significantly improved swarm capabilities. It also demonstrates how the evolution of Hebbian learning rules can be a valid alternative to Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning in standard benchmarking tasks.

Abstract: Despite tremendous progress in neuroscience, we do not have a compelling narrative for the precise way whereby the spiking of neurons in our brain results in high-level cognitive phenomena such as planning and language. We introduce a simple mathematical formulation of six basic and broadly accepted principles of neuroscience: excitatory neurons, brain areas, random synapses, Hebbian plasticity, local inhibition, and inter-area inhibition. We implement a simulated neuromorphic system based on this formalism, which is capable of basic language acquisition: Starting from a tabula rasa, the system learns, in any language, the semantics of words, their syntactic role (verb versus noun), and the word order of the language, including the ability to generate novel sentences, through the exposure to a modest number of grounded sentences in the same language. We discuss several possible extensions and implications of this result.

Abstract: The very DNA of AI architecture presents conflicting paths: centralized cloud-based models (Software-as-a-Service) versus decentralized edge AI (local processing on consumer devices). This paper analyzes the competitive battleground across computational capability, energy efficiency, and data privacy. Recent breakthroughs show edge AI challenging cloud systems on performance, leveraging innovations like test-time training and mixture-of-experts architectures. Crucially, edge AI boasts a 10,000x efficiency advantage: modern ARM processors consume merely 100 microwatts forinference versus 1 watt for equivalent cloud processing. Beyond efficiency, edge AI secures data sovereignty by keeping processing local, dismantling single points of failure in centralized architectures. This democratizes access throughaffordable hardware, enables offline functionality, and reduces environmental impact by eliminating data transmission costs. The edge AI market projects explosive growth from $9 billion in 2025 to $49.6 billion by 2030 (38.5% CAGR), fueled by privacy demands and real-time analytics. Critical applications including personalized education, healthcare monitoring, autonomous transport, and smart infrastructure rely on edge AI's ultra-low latency (5-10ms versus 100-500ms for cloud). The convergence of architectural innovation with fundamental physics confirms edge AI's distributed approach aligns with efficient information processing, signaling the inevitable emergence of hybrid edge-cloud ecosystems.

Abstract: Accurate building energy forecasting is essential, yet traditional heuristics often lack precision, while advanced models can be opaque and struggle with generalization by neglecting physical principles. This paper introduces BuildEvo, a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design effective and interpretable energy prediction heuristics. Within an evolutionary process, BuildEvo guides LLMs to construct and enhance heuristics by systematically incorporating physical insights from building characteristics and operational data (e.g., from the Building Data Genome Project 2). Evaluations show BuildEvo achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, offering improved generalization and transparent prediction logic. This work advances the automated design of robust, physically grounded heuristics, promoting trustworthy models for complex energy systems.

Abstract: We present Mass-Conserving Evolution (MaCE), a general method for implementing mass conservation in Cellular Automata (CA). MaCE is a simple evolution rule that can be easily 'attached' to existing CAs to make them mass-conserving, which tends to produce interesting behaviours more often, as patterns can no longer explode or die out. We first show that MaCE is numerically stable and admits a simple continuous limit. We then test MaCE on Lenia, and through several experiments, we demonstrate that it produces a wide variety of interesting behaviours, starting from the variety and abundance of solitons up to hints of intrinsic evolution in resource-constrained environments. Finally, we showcase the versatility of MaCE by applying it to Neural-CAs and discrete CAs, and discuss promising research directions opened up by this scheme.

                arXiv:2402.11662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motion detection is a primary task required for robotic systems to perceive and navigate in their environment. Proposed in the literature bioinspired neuromorphic Time-Difference Encoder (TDE-2) combines event-based sensors and processors with spiking neural networks to provide real-time and energy-efficient motion detection through extracting temporal correlations between two points in space. However, on the algorithmic level, this design leads to loss of direction-selectivity of individual TDEs in textured environments. Here we propose an augmented 3-point TDE (TDE-3) with additional inhibitory input that makes TDE-3 direction-selectivity robust in textured environments. We developed a procedure to train the new TDE-3 using backpropagation through time and surrogate gradients to linearly map input velocities into an output spike count or an Inter-Spike Interval (ISI). Our work is the first instance of training a spiking neuron to have a specific ISI. Using synthetic data we compared training and inference with spike count and ISI with respect to changes in stimuli dynamic range, spatial frequency, and level of noise. ISI turns out to be more robust towards variation in spatial frequency, whereas the spike count is a more reliable training signal in the presence of noise. We performed the first in-depth quantitative investigation of optical flow coding with TDE and compared TDE-2 vs TDE-3 in terms of energy-efficiency and coding precision. Results show that on the network level both detectors show similar precision (20 degree angular error, 88% correlation with ground truth). Yet, due to the more robust direction-selectivity of individual TDEs, TDE-3 based network spike less and hence is more energy-efficient. Reported precision is on par with model-based methods but the spike-based processing of the TDEs provides allows more energy-efficient inference with neuromorphic hardware.

                arXiv:2412.18375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article addresses theory in evolutionary many-objective optimization and focuses on the role of crossover operators. The advantages of using crossover are hardly understood and rigorous runtime analyses with crossover are lagging far behind its use in practice, specifically in the case of more than two objectives. We present two many-objective problems $RR_{\text{RO}}$ and $uRR_{\text{RO}}$ together with a theoretical runtime analysis of the GSEMO and the widely used NSGA-III algorithm to demonstrate that one point crossover on $RR_{\text{RO}}$, as well as uniform crossover on $uRR_{\text{RO}}$, can yield an exponential speedup in the runtime. In particular, when the number of objectives is constant, this algorithms can find the Pareto set of both problems in expected polynomial time when using crossover while without crossover they require exponential time to even find a single Pareto-optimal point. For both problems, we also demonstrate a significant performance gap in certain superconstant parameter regimes for the number of objectives. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first rigorous runtime analysis in many-objective optimization which demonstrates an exponential performance gap when using crossover for more than two objectives. Additionally, it is the first runtime analysis involving crossover in many-objective optimization where the number of objectives is not necessarily constant.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a balanced multi-component and multi-layer neural network (MMNN) structure to accurately and efficiently approximate functions with complex features, in terms of both degrees of freedom and computational cost. The main idea is inspired by a multi-component approach, in which each component can be effectively approximated by a single-layer network, combined with a multi-layer decomposition strategy to capture the complexity of the target function. Although MMNNs can be viewed as a simple modification of fully connected neural networks (FCNNs) or multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) by introducing balanced multi-component structures, they achieve a significant reduction in training parameters, a much more efficient training process, and improved accuracy compared to FCNNs or MLPs. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MMNNs in approximating highly oscillatory functions and their ability to automatically adapt to localized features.

Abstract: Living beings are able to solve a wide variety of problems that they encounter rarely or only once. Without the benefit of extensive and repeated experience with these problems, they can solve them in an ad-hoc manner. We call this capacity to always find a solution to a physically solvable problem $hyperadaptability$. To explain how hyperadaptability can be achieved, we propose a theory that frames behavior as the physical manifestation of a self-modifying search procedure. Rather than exploring randomly, our system achieves robust problem-solving by dynamically ordering an infinite set of continuous behaviors according to simplicity and effectiveness. Behaviors are sampled from paths over cognitive graphs, their order determined by a tight behavior-execution/graph-modification feedback loop. We implement cognitive graphs using Hebbian-learning and a novel harmonic neural representation supporting flexible information storage. We validate our approach through simulation experiments showing rapid achievement of highly-robust navigation ability in complex mazes, as well as high reward on difficult extensions of classic reinforcement learning problems. This framework offers a new theoretical model for developmental learning and paves the way for robots that can autonomously master complex skills and handle exceptional circumstances.

Abstract: We analyze the implicit bias of constant step stochastic subgradient descent (SGD). We consider the setting of binary classification with homogeneous neural networks - a large class of deep neural networks with ReLU-type activation functions such as MLPs and CNNs without biases. We interpret the dynamics of normalized SGD iterates as an Euler-like discretization of a conservative field flow that is naturally associated to the normalized classification margin. Owing to this interpretation, we show that normalized SGD iterates converge to the set of critical points of the normalized margin at late-stage training (i.e., assuming that the data is correctly classified with positive normalized margin). Up to our knowledge, this is the first extension of the analysis of Lyu and Li (2020) on the discrete dynamics of gradient descent to the nonsmooth and stochastic setting. Our main result applies to binary classification with exponential or logistic losses. We additionally discuss extensions to more general settings.

Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold superposition theorem, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as an improved backbone for most deep learning frameworks, promising more adaptivity than their multilayer perception (MLP) predecessor by allowing for trainable spline-based activation functions. In this paper, we probe the theoretical foundations of the KAN architecture by showing that it can optimally approximate any Besov function in $B^{s}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$ on a bounded open, or even fractal, domain $\mathcal{X}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ at the optimal approximation rate with respect to any weaker Besov norm $B^{\alpha}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$; where $\alpha < s$. We complement our approximation guarantee with a dimension-free estimate on the sample complexity of a residual KAN model when learning a function of Besov regularity from $N$ i.i.d. noiseless samples. Our KAN architecture incorporates contemporary deep learning wisdom by leveraging residual/skip connections between layers.

                <p>Crows, renowned for advanced cognitive abilities and vocal communication, rely on intricate auditory systems. While the neuroanatomy of corvid auditory pathways is partially explored, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms are largely unknown. This study used functional ultrasound imaging (fUSi) to investigate sound-induced cerebral blood volume (CBV) changes in the Field L complex of the auditory telencephalon in two female crows. fUSi revealed frequency-specific CBV responses, showing a tonotopic organization within the Field L complex, with low frequencies in the posterior dorsal region and high frequencies in the anterior ventral region. Machine learning analyses showed fUSi signals could be used to classify sound types accurately, in both awake and anesthetized states. Variable CBV responses to longer sound stimuli suggest a delineation of subregions within the Field L complex. Together, these findings highlight the potential of fUSi for providing high-resolution insights into functional systems in corvids, enabling future exploration of experimental task-related cognitive dynamics.</p>

                <p>Evidence suggests that the neurotransmitter norepinephrine may play an important role in Parkinson disease (PD). The norepinephrine transporter (NET) regulates noradrenergic signaling and can serve as an index of noradrenergic innervation in neuroimaging studies. The <I>Pink1-/-</I> rat model, which exhibits many signs similar to PD, notably in the nonmotor domain, exhibits abnormal noradrenergic markers. Here, we sought to (1) implement reference region pharmacokinetic modeling of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the novel NET ligand [<sup>18</sup>F]NS12137, (2) validate the resulting indices of NET concentration, and (3) characterize NET in the <I>Pink1-/-</I> model. Long&ndash;Evans <I>Pink1-/-</I> male rats were imaged by PET with [<sup>18</sup>F]NS12137 at 9 and 11&nbsp;months and compared with wild-type (WT) controls. An additional group of WT rats of both sexes were imaged with [<sup>18</sup>F]NS12137 PET after pretreatment with the specific and selective NET ligand nisoxetine. Binding in locus coeruleus (LC), thalamus (Thal), and prelimbic area (PrL), regions rich in NET, was analyzed by a two-tissue compartment reversible binding model using a cerebellar reference region. [<sup>18</sup>F]NS12137 binding exhibited moderate test&ndash;retest reproducibility in LC, Thal, and PrL. Nisoxetine blockade yielded substantial reductions of [<sup>18</sup>F]NS12137 binding in LC. Compared with WT controls, <I>Pink1-/-</I> rats exhibited reduced binding in Thal and PrL. Pharmacokinetic analysis of [<sup>18</sup>F]NS12137 PET provides a reproducible and specific measure of NET binding and indicates reduced NET in PD-related brain regions in <I>Pink1-/-</I> rats. Noninvasive in vivo [<sup>18</sup>F]NS12137 PET imaging is therefore a promising method for the study of potential therapies in the <I>Pink1-/-</I> rat.</p>

                <p>Chronic neuropathic pain is a persistent and debilitating outcome of traumatic central nervous system injury, affecting up to 80% of individuals. Postinjury pain is refractory to treatments due to the limited understanding of the brain&ndash;spinal cord circuits that underlie pain signal processing. The corticospinal tract (CST) plays critical roles in sensory modulation during skilled movements and tactile sensation; however, a direct role for the CST in injury-associated neuropathic pain is unclear. Here we show that complete, selective CST transection at the medullary pyramids leads to hyperexcitability within lumbar deep dorsal horn and hindlimb allodynia-like behavior in chronically injured adult male and female mice. Chemogenetic regulation of CST-targeted lumbar spinal interneurons demonstrates that dysregulation of activity in this circuit underlies the development of tactile allodynia in chronic injury. Our findings shed light on an unrecognized circuit mechanism implicated in CNS injury-induced neuropathic pain and provide a novel target for therapeutic intervention.</p>

                <p>Spinal interneurons shape motor neuron activity. Gata3<sup>+</sup> V2b neurons are a major inhibitory spinal population. These neurons are present at multiple spinal levels in mice, suggesting an important function in motor control. In zebrafish, our previous work showed that V2b neurons are evenly distributed along the spinal cord, where they act to slow down locomotion. However, the timing of V2b activity during locomotion, their postsynaptic targets other than motor neurons, and their recruitment across different behaviors remain unknown. In this study, we address these questions using larval zebrafish. First, via optogenetic mapping of output in the rostrocaudal axis, we demonstrate that V2b neurons robustly inhibit motor neurons and other major spinal populations, including V2a, V1, commissural neurons, and other V2b neurons. V2b inhibition is patterned along the rostrocaudal axis, providing long-range inhibition to motor and V2a neurons but more localized inhibition of V1 neurons. Next, by recording V2b activity during different visually and electrically evoked movements, we show that V2b neurons are specifically recruited for forward swims and turns, but not for fast escape movements. Furthermore, a subset of V2b neurons also exhibited short-latency sensory-evoked activity preceding motor initiation. Finally, we show that V2b inhibition occurs in phase with the leading edge of the motor burst, in contrast to V1 inhibition which occurs in phase with the falling edge of the motor burst. Taken together, these data show that in axial motor networks, V2b neurons act via multiple targets to produce in phase, leading inhibition during locomotion.</p>

                <p>Long-term memory (LTM) formation is negatively regulated by histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), a transcriptional repressor. Emerging evidence suggests that posttranslational phosphorylation of HDAC3 at its serine 424 (S424) residue is critical for its deacetylase activity in transcription. However, it remains unknown if HDAC3 S424 phosphorylation regulates the ability of HDAC3 to modulate LTM formation. To examine the functionality of S424, we expressed an HDAC3-S424D phospho-mimic mutant (constitutively active form) or an HDAC3-S424A phospho-null mutant (phospho-dead form) in the dorsal hippocampus of mice. We assessed the functional consequence of these mutants on LTM formation and long-term potentiation (LTP) in young adult male mice. We also assessed whether the HDAC3-S424A mutant could ameliorate age-related deficits in LTM and LTP in aging male and female mice. Results demonstrate that young adult male mice expressing the HDAC3-S424D phospho-mimic mutant in the dorsal hippocampus exhibit significantly impaired LTM and LTP. In contrast, the HDAC3-S424A phospho-null mutant expressed in the hippocampus of young adult male mice enabled the transformation of subthreshold learning into robust LTM and enhanced LTP. Similarly, expression of the HDAC3-S424A mutant enabled LTM formation and enhanced LTP in aging male and aging female mice. Overall, these findings demonstrate that HDAC3 S424 is a pivotal residue that has the ability to bidirectionally regulate synaptic plasticity and LTM formation in the adult and aging brain.</p>

                <p>Evoked responses in the mouse primary visual cortex can be modulated by the temporal context in which visual inputs are presented. Oddball stimuli embedded in a sequence of regularly repeated visual elements have been shown to drive relatively large deviant responses, a finding that is generally consistent with the theory that cortical circuits implement a form of predictive coding. These results can be confounded by short-term adaptation effects, however, that make interpretation difficult. Here we use various forms of the oddball paradigm to disentangle temporal and ordinal components of the deviant response, showing that it is a complex phenomenon affected by temporal structure, ordinal expectation, and event frequency. Specifically, we use visually evoked potentials to show that deviant responses occur over a large range of time in male and female mice, cannot be explained by a simple adaptation model, scale with predictability, and are modulated by violations of both first- and second-order sequential expectations. We also show that visual sequences can lead to long-term plasticity in some circumstances.</p>

                <p>Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic disease of the brain, and it currently continues at crisis proportions in the United States. Opioid physical withdrawal is a major driver of compulsive drug-taking behavior, triggering short-term relapse of opioid addiction. Early pharmacological evidence shows that midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) plays an important role in morphine withdrawal (MW). However, we still know few details about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Improving our understanding of such mechanisms will enable increasingly safe and effective treatments for patients with OUD. Here, MW was induced by the naloxone precipitation after chronic intraperitoneal administration of morphine for a period of 5&nbsp;d in Sprague Dawley male rats. MW increased phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (pCREB, a primary marker of CREB functional activation), NMDA glutamate receptor 2B subunit (NR2B), and mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) within the ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG). Inhibition of pCREB, NR2B, or MCU within this brain region reduced the severity of MW. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and luciferase report assay demonstrated that pCREB mediated the transcription of the <I>Grin2b</I> (glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 2B, encoding NR2B) and <I>Ccdc109a</I> (encoding MCU) genes. These findings describe the role of pCREB in <I>Grin2b</I> and <I>Ccdc109a</I> <I>gene</I> transcription levels in the vlPAG during MW. The study may provide a novel therapeutic approach for OUD.</p>

                <p>Juvenile zebra finches learn to sing by imitating conspecific songs of adults during a sensitive period early in life. Area X is a basal ganglia nucleus of the song control circuit specialized for song-related sensory&ndash;motor learning during song development. The structural plasticity and the molecular mechanisms regulating neuronal structure in Area X during song development and maturation are unclear. In this study, we examined the structure of spiny neurons, the main neuron type in Area X, at key stages of song development in male zebra finches. We report that dendritic arbor of spiny neurons expands during the sensitive period for song learning, and this initial growth is followed by pruning of dendrites and spines accompanied by changes in spine morphology as the song circuit matures. Previously, we showed that overexpression of miR-9 in Area X impairs song learning and performance and alters the expression of many genes that have important roles in neuronal structure and function (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B59">Shi et al., 2018</cross-ref>). As an extension of that study, we report here that overexpression of miR-9 in spiny neurons in juvenile zebra finches reduces dendritic arbor complexity and spine density in a developmental stage-specific manner. We also show that miR-9 regulates the structural maintenance of spiny neurons in adulthood. Together, these findings reveal dynamic microstructural changes in the song circuit during the sensitive period of song development and provide evidence that miR-9 regulates neuronal structure during song development and maintenance.</p>

                <p>Humans use multiple sensory systems to estimate body orientation in space. Sensory contributions change depending on context. A predominant concept for the underlying multisensory integration (MSI) is the linear summation of weighted inputs from individual sensory systems. Changes of sensory contributions are typically attributed to some mechanism explicitly adjusting weighting factors. We provide evidence for a conceptually different mechanism that performs a multisensory correction if the reference of a sensory input moves in space without the need to explicitly change sensory weights. The correction is based on a reconstruction of the sensory reference frame motion (RFM) and automatically corrects erroneous inputs, e.g., when looking at a moving train. The proposed RFM estimator contains a nonlinear dead zone that blocks corrections at slow velocities. We first demonstrate that this mechanism accounts for the apparent changes in sensory contributions. Second, using a balance control model, we show predictions of specific distortions in body sway responses to perturbations caused by this nonlinearity. Experiments measuring sway responses of 24 subjects (13 female, 11 male) to visual scene movements confirmed these predictions. The findings indicate that the central nervous system resolves sensory conflicts by an internal reconstruction of the cause of the conflict. Thus, the mechanism links the concept of causal inference to shifts in sensory contributions, providing a cohesive picture of the MSI for the estimation of body orientation in space.</p>

                <p>Endosomal system dysfunction within neurons is a prominent early feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Multiple AD risk factors are regulators of endocytosis and known to cause hyperactivity of the early endosome small GTPase rab5, resulting in neuronal endosomal pathway disruption and cholinergic neurodegeneration. Adaptor protein containing Pleckstrin homology domain, Phosphotyrosine binding domain, Leucine zipper motif (APPL1), an important rab5 effector protein and signaling molecule has been shown in vitro to interface between endosomal and neuronal dysfunction through a rab5-activating interaction with the BACE1-generated C-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein (APP-&beta;CTF), a pathogenic APP fragment generated within endosomal compartments. To understand the contribution of APPL1 to AD-related endosomal dysfunction in vivo, we generated a transgenic mouse model overexpressing human APPL1 within neurons (Thy1-APPL1). Strongly supporting the important endosomal regulatory roles of APPL1 and their relevance to AD etiology, Thy1-APPL1 mice (both sexes) develop enlarged neuronal early endosomes and increased synaptic endocytosis due to increased rab5 activation. We demonstrated pathophysiological consequences of APPL1 overexpression, including functional changes in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), degeneration of large projection cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain, and impaired hippocampal-dependent memory. Our evidence shows that neuronal APPL1 elevation modeling its functional increase in the AD brain induces a cascade of AD-related pathological effects within neurons, including early endosome anomalies, synaptic dysfunction, and selective neurodegeneration. Our in vivo model highlights the contributions of APPL1 to the pathobiology and neuronal consequences of early endosomal pathway disruption and its potential value as a therapeutic target.</p>

                Introduction Sharenting involves parents sharing photos, videos, or other information about their children on their social media profiles via online platforms. Research indicated the rising prevalence of parental sharenting behaviour among various countries. Objective The main aim of this article was to explore the role of motivations, perceptions, attitudes, and impression management on parental sharenting behaviours. Methods A systematic review examined empirical studies published from 2019 to 2024 regarding parental motivations, attitudes, perceptions, and impression management associated with sharenting. Relevant studies were identified via Scopus and manual reference searches, with data extraction concentrating on study characteristics, demographics, objectives, design, and principal findings. Findings Parental sharenting is motivated by intrinsic desires, social validation, and impression management, as parents curate content to improve their social image. While children value favourable representations, many object to sharing without consent. Notwithstanding privacy concerns, parents frequently prioritise advantages, raising ethical enquiries regarding children’s autonomy, privacy, and digital identity in digital self-representation. Conclusion Parental sharenting, motivated by emotional satisfaction, social validation, and impression management, frequently neglects privacy risks and ethical considerations. Such practices may compromise children’s autonomy, privacy, and digital identity, resulting in conflicts with their rights. Children’s varied responses underscore these dilemmas, highlighting the necessity of reconciling parental intentions with safeguarding children’s digital futures and overall well-being. Recommendation Parents should engage in mindful sharenting, policymakers must safeguard children’s digital rights, professionals should enhance awareness, and researchers should investigate methods to reconcile parental desires with children’s welfare.

                Background Predicting the number and distribution of Olympic medals in the future has become a hot topic, but predicting the number of Olympic medals is not easy and requires comprehensive consideration of multiple factors such as historical data, athlete performance, and host country effects. Method This article uses the GA-BP algorithm model, combined with genetic algorithm (GA) and backpropagation neural network (BPNN), to optimize the weights and bias parameters of the BP neural network using the global search capability of genetic algorithm, thereby improving training efficiency and prediction performance. By estimating the number of Olympic gold medals and total medals, verifying the accuracy of the model, and predicting the medal table for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. Meanwhile, based on the synthetic control model, Estonia and China were selected as research subjects to construct a virtual control group and two experimental groups for analysis. Result The experimental results showed that Estonia and China won more medals with a head coach than without one. In 1992, Estonia won 1 gold medal and 2 bronze medals under the guidance of excellent coaches, indicating the significant role of head coaches in improving athletes’ performance. Conclusion This study provides valuable insights for the decision-making of the Olympic Committee, revealing key factors in medal distribution, optimizing the allocation of national strategic resources, and predicting the performance of countries at future Olympic Games.

                Background There are many different types of contraception, but not all types are appropriate for all situations. Ensuring access for all people to their preferred contraceptive methods advances several human rights including the right to life and liberty, freedom of opinion, expression and choice and the right to work and education, as well as bringing significant health and other benefits. Use of contraception advances the human right of people to determine the number and spacing of their children. Objectives To explore Middle Eastern women’s attitudes toward family planning methods. To identify the actual practices of women in using family planning methods. To examine the relationship between women’s attitudes and their practices regarding family planning. Methodology A cross sectional study was conducted at six Arabic countries from January 2024 to July 2024. The participants were women in reproductive age, they are urban residency, primiparous and multiparous mothers. A non-probability (purposive sample) consist of (198) reproductive age women. The study instrument was a predesigned, structured, and self-administered questionnaire that had been previously validated and used in the study titled “Evaluation of Women’s Attitudes about Contraceptive Methods Use at Primary Health Care Centers in Baghdad City.” The questionnaire consisted of two main sections. The first section collected demographic data, including age, marital status, number of children, educational level, and employment status. The second section contained a series of closed-ended and Likert-scale questions aimed at assessing women’s attitudes toward family planning methods as well as their actual practices and patterns of use. Participants were informed about the objectives of the study and provided with clear instructions on how to complete the questionnaire. Data were analyzed using R version 4.4.3, and the results were summarized in tables and Figures. Results Women are with average age of 32.23±7.9 years in which the highest percentage is seen with age group of 30-39 (40.4%). women have high affective attitudes to use family planning methods (total grand mean= 2.60); have high behavioral attitudes to use family planning methods (total grand mean= 2.56); and have high cognitive attitudes to use family planning methods (total grand mean= 2.56). So, the mean scores indicate high among most of affective, behavioral, and cognitive attitudes. Conclusions The findings of the study revealed that the majority of participating women held positive attitudes toward family planning methods. Furthermore, most of the women reported actively using some form of contraception. These results highlight a generally favorable perception and widespread acceptance of family planning practices among Middle Eastern women, reflecting both awareness and practical engagement in reproductive health decisions.

                Insulinoma is a rare functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET) originating from the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans and characterized by unregulated insulin secretion. Most insulinomas are benign and solitary, but their clinical manifestations are often nonspecific and primarily result from hypoglycemia, which can be easily misdiagnosed as neurological disorders such as epilepsy or psychiatric conditions. Early diagnosis of insulinoma remains a clinical challenge due to its atypical presentation and the frequent failure to assess blood glucose at symptom onset. A case of a 32-year-old Vietnamese female admitted to a provincial hospital for recurrent neurological symptoms, including loss of consciousness, seizures, and incoherent speech, who had been treated for refractory epilepsy for over two years without improvement. Biochemical investigations revealed inappropriately elevated serum insulin levels and concomitant hypoglycemia. Abdominal imaging with computed tomography (CT) identified a pancreatic tail mass suggestive of insulinoma. The patient underwent laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. Histopathology confirmed an isodense carcinoma consistent with grade 2 insulinoma. This case highlights the importance of considering insulinoma in patients with unexplained neurological symptoms and poor response to antiepileptic therapy.

                Exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5) has emerged as a significant risk factor for depression, particularly among pregnant women. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigate the association between PM2.5 exposure and maternal depression during pregnancy. Adhering to PECO principles and PRISMA 2020 standards, we searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Open, identifying 231 records (Google Scholar: 28; Science Open: 106; PubMed: 58; and 39 from manual searches). After removing 49 duplicates, 182 studies were screened, excluding 110 via title/abstract review. Of 72 full-texts assessed, 65 were excluded (48 for irrelevant outcomes, 14 for incompatible metrics, 3 for lacking PM2.5-specific data), yielding 7 studies (n = 576,737 pregnancies) for meta-analysis. Using Cochran’s Q and I2 statistics (I2 = 85.1%, τ2 = 0.027), a restricted maximum likelihood (REML) random-effects model estimated a pooled relative risk (RR) of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.10–1.50) per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, indicating a 29% higher risk of depression. Subgroup analyses showed stronger effects across whole pregnancy (RR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.23–1.63). High heterogeneity (I2 = 85.1%) and publication bias (Egger’s p = 0.013) were noted. These findings highlight the impact of PM2.5 on maternal depression, urging further mechanistic studies, especially in low-income regions where data remains scarce.

                Background This study aims to detect the efficiency of two Artificial Intelligence (AI) translation models, ChatGPT and DeepSeek, in the translation of Yemeni Sana’ani Arabic (YSA) dialectical terms into English. As dialectal Arabic presents significant linguistic variability and cultural specificity, accurate translation remains a major challenge for the current ChatGPT and DeepSeek (and perhaps other AI models). Methods Fifty Sana’ani Arabic terms were involved in the translation process, assessing the ability of both models to capture their semantic fidelity, cultural relevance, and contextual accuracy. Results The study findings reveal that, while both models demonstrate a foundational understanding of Standard Arabic (SA), their performance diminishes considerably when faced with the nuances and idiomatic expressions of the Sana’ani Arabic dialect. ChatGPT displays a relatively better performance in certain cases, particularly when translating terms with dialectical connotations. However, both models exhibit limitations, such as literal translation, misinterpretation, or complete ignorance of the intended meaning. Conclusions The study concludes by highlighting the critical need for dialect-aware AI development and provides recommendations for improving the dialectical accuracy and cultural sensitivity of AI model translation.

                Background Dual-task assessments, including Walking While Talking (WWT) and Stops Walking While Talking (SWWT) tests, predict fall risk in stroke survivors. However, their effectiveness relative to established predictors, such as the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and Falls Efficacy Scale (FES), remains unclear. This study evaluated the comparative predictive value of WWT and SWWT tests alongside BBS and FES among stroke survivors. Methods This cross-sectional study included 68 stroke survivors who completed WWT-Simple (WWT-S), WWT-Complex (WWT-C), and SWWT, as well as the BBS and FES. Spearman correlations assessed relationships between balance, fear of falling, and dual-task performance. Logistic regression identified fall risk predictors, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis evaluated predictive accuracy. The study adhered to STROBE guidelines. Results BBS scores were strongly negatively correlated with WWT-S (r = -0.734, p < 0.0001) and WWT-C (r = -0.737, p < 0.0001), indicating poorer balance with slower dual-task completion. Positive correlations were found between WWT-S and FES (r = 0.668, p < 0.0001) and WWT-C and FES (r = 0.610, p < 0.0001), linking slower completion times with higher fear of falling. SWWT was significantly negatively correlated with BBS (r = -0.625, p < 0.0001). WWT tests had higher sensitivity (97.8%) and specificity (99%) than SWWT (sensitivity = 68.9%; specificity = 91.3%). Logistic regression identified SWWT (Positive) as a significant predictor of fall risk (p = 0.009), and ROC analysis showed an AUC of 0.911, indicating excellent predictive power. Conclusions Findings highlight the superior predictive value of WWT tests over SWWT in assessing fall risk among stroke survivors. Incorporating dual-task measures into clinical practice may enhance fall risk evaluation, supporting targeted stroke rehabilitation.

                <p>by Pan Li, Sangbo Lee, Kwang-Yeon Choi, Jonathan E. Rubin, Jae Kyoung Kim</p>

Seizure-induced cardiac arrhythmias, such as ictal (during seizure) or postictal (post-seizure) sinus arrhythmias, are potential triggers for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Traditionally, these arrhythmias have been attributed to changes in autonomic balance during ictal or postictal phases, as per the neurogenic mechanism. However, it remains unclear if these arrhythmias may involve intrinsic cardiogenic mechanisms. Furthermore, while circadian and sleep-wake patterns influence both neurogenic and cardiogenic mechanisms, a direct mechanistic link to seizure-induced arrhythmias remains to be established. In this study, we utilized a mathematical model of mouse sinoatrial nodal cell pacemaking and an autonomic clamping protocol, to dissect neurocardiogenic mechanisms in seizure-induced sinus arrhythmias and to test the hypothesis that circadian and sleep-wake rhythms directly modulate cellular susceptibility to these arrhythmias. Our simulations revealed that, in the context of altered autonomic levels associated with seizure progression, diverse seizure-induced sinoatrial nodal cell firing patterns during ictal or postictal phases can be triggered directly by intrinsic cardiac dynamics, without the need for dynamical changes in within-phase autonomic activities. This finding highlights the distinct roles of neurogenic and cardiogenic mechanisms in shaping sinoatrial nodal cell firing patterns, challenging the predominance of the neurogenic mechanism. This neurocardiogenic framework also successfully captures distinct circadian and vigilance state patterns of seizure-induced arrhythmias. Specifically, while daytime sleep predisposed sinoatrial nodal cells to postictal sinus arrhythmias, nighttime wakefulness promoted ictal sinus arrhythmias. However, these circadian patterns can be disrupted when sleep-wake cycles are decoupled from circadian rhythms, supporting the hypothesis that sleep-wake patterns can directly be a key determinant of seizure-induced sinus arrhythmias. Our findings may potentially facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies for managing the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.

Ubiquitination is critical in biomedical research. Predicting ubiquitination sites based on deep learning model have advanced the study of ubiquitination. However, traditional supervised model limits in the scenarios where labels are scarcity across species. To address this issue, we introduce EUP, an online webserver for ubiquitination prediction and model interpretation for multi-species. EUP is constructed by extracting lysine site-dependent features from pretrained language model ESM2. Then, utilizing conditional variational inference to reduce the ESM2 features to a lower-dimensional latent representation. By constructing downstream models built on this latent feature representation, EUP exhibited superior performance in predicting ubiquitination sites across species, while maintaining low inference latency. Furthermore, key features for predicting ubiquitination sites were identified across animals, plants, and microbes. The identification of shared key features that capture evolutionarily conserved traits enhances the interpretability of the EUP model for ubiquitination prediction. EUP is free and available at (https://eup.aibtit.com/).

The vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) bind to cognate ligands to facilitate signaling pathways critical for angiogenesis, the growth of new capillaries from existing vasculature. Intracellular trafficking regulates the availability of receptors on the cell surface to bind ligands, which regulate activation, and the movement of activated receptors between the surface and intracellular pools, where they can initiate different signaling pathways. Using experimental data and computational modeling, we recently demonstrated and quantified the differential trafficking of three VEGF receptors, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and coreceptor Neuropilin-1 (NRP1). Here, we expand that approach to quantify how the binding of different VEGF ligands alters the trafficking of these VEGF receptors and demonstrate the consequences of receptor localization and ligand binding on the localization and dynamics of signal initiation complexes. We include simulations of four different splice isoforms of VEGF-A and PLGF, each of which binds to different combinations of the VEGF receptors, and we use new experimental data for two of these ligands to parameterize and validate our model. We show that VEGFR2 trafficking is altered in response to ligand binding, but that trafficking of VEGFR1 is not; we also show that the altered trafficking can be explained by a single mechanistic process, increased internalization of the VEGFR2 receptor when bound to ligand; other processes are unaffected. We further show that even though the canonical view of receptor tyrosine kinases is of activation on the cell surface, most of the ligand-receptor complexes for both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 are intracellular. We also explore the competition between the receptors for ligand binding, the so-called ‘decoy effect’, and show that while <i>in vitro</i> on the cell surface minimal such effect would be observed, inside the cell the effect can be substantial and may influence signaling. We term this location dependence the ‘reservoir effect’ as the size of the local ligand reservoir (large outside the cell, small inside the cell) plays an integral role in the receptor-receptor competition. These results expand our understanding of receptor-ligand trafficking dynamics and are critical for the design of therapeutic agents to regulate ligand availability to VEGFR1 and hence VEGF receptor signaling in angiogenesis.

Amino acid infusion (AAI) is a technique used in radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) to reduce toxicity in kidney and increase clearance rate of radiopharmaceuticals from body. In this study our aim is to evaluate its effect in personalized RPT considering kidney and salivary glands as dose limiting organs using a multiscale modeling framework. We developed a Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model consisting of 19 compartments, personalized it for four prostate cancer patients using data derived from gamma camera imaging. This model was used to investigate the influence of AAI on the absorbed dose to tumors and organs at risk. We then computed the maximum safe injected activity based on the PBPK model. To address the effects of interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) and tumor heterogeneity, we coupled the PBPK model with convection-diffusion-reaction (CDR) equations. To compare the effectiveness of our modeling approaches, we calculated absorbed doses to the tumors with and without AAI, using both the standalone PBPK model and the coupled PBPK-CDR model. Our findings revealed a relative error (RE) of 9.6% ± 2.2% (mean ± SD) in total tumor absorbed dose calculation between PBPK and CDR equations, attributable to the consideration of IFP. Moreover, AAI proved beneficial for RPT when the kidney was designated as the organ-at-risk. It enabled an increase in radiopharmaceutical injection from 12.3 ± 6.32 MBq (mean ± SD) to 15.45 ± 6.95 MBq (RE: 28.5% ± 15.7%), resulting in a corresponding increase in tumor absorbed dose from 67.8 ± 47.45 Gy to 72.43 ± 51.03 Gy (RE: 8.6% ± 5.4%), while maintaining critical kidney absorbed dose limits. However, this was not observed when the salivary gland was considered the dose-limiting organ. Although, AAI allowed for increased therapeutic injection ranging from 4.22 ± 2.23 MBq to 5.25 ± 3.14 MBq (RE: 19.2% ± 9.9%), it results in a minimal increase in tumor absorbed dose of 0.22 ± 0.04 (RE: 1.4% ± 1.3%). Statistical analysis using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test revealed significant effects of AAI on administered activity and tumor absorbed dose (p-value = 0.007 < 0.05). Finally, a local sensitivity analysis was performed on selected radiation and tumor transportation parameters individually to evaluate their impact on the tumor absorbed dose. In conclusion, selection of organ-at-risk in personalized RPT is critical, as it determines the injected activity amount and the efficacy of delivery-enhancing techniques.

The genomic RNAs of influenza A viruses (IAVs) are replicated in the nucleus of infected cells in the form of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) before being exported to the cytoplasm. The small GTPase RAB11A is involved in the transport of vRNPs to the sites of viral assembly at the plasma membrane, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. Here we show that IAV infection remodels the architecture of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) sheets, where vRNPs tend to accumulate in the absence of RAB11A. To decipher the interplay between RAB11A, vRNPs, and the ER, we investigated viral-induced perturbations of RAB11A proximity interactome. To this end, we generated cells stably expressing a TurboID-RAB11A fusion protein and performed biotin-based proximity labeling upon viral infection. We found that cellular regulators of phophatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) homeostasis, including the autophagic and stress response protein ATG16L1, are significantly enriched at the vicinity of RAB11A in infected cells. Infection induces an increase in cellular PI4P levels in an ATG16L1-dependent manner, while ATG16L1 relocalizes to ER membranes upon infection. Depletion of ATG16L1 decreases the co-distribution of vRNPs with PI4P punctae on ER membranes, and reduces the accumulation of vRNPs at the plasma membrane as well as the production of IAV infectious particles. Our data extend to IAVs the notion that viruses can modulate the metabolism and localization of phosphoinositides to control host membrane dynamics and point to the ER as an essential platform for vRNP transport. They provide evidence for a pivotal role of ATG16L1 in regulating the identity of endomembranes and coordinating RAB11A and PI4P-enriched membranes to ensure delivery of vRNPs to the plasma membrane.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-455/v2?src=rss">Women and nature: Ecofeminist study in social media [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background This research examines how ecofeminist themes are presented and shared on digital platforms. It focuses on three widely used social media networks, namely YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook to explore how their features, such as videos, reels, posts, and images, convey ecofeminist ideas and principles in online spaces. Methods We have adopted a purposive, qualitative, and thematic analysis method. Data have been manually collected from the selected social media platforms using keywords like “ecofeminism” and “women and nature.” Content has been selected based on thematic relevance. Only publicly available materials have been used. Results Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook each contributes uniquely to the ecofeminist discourse by offering visually engaging reels and images, academic and artistic content, and select group and page-based advocacy, respectively. Through various digital entities such as groups, pages, reels, videos, and pictures, many social media accounts vividly demonstrate the close relationship between women and nature, the exploitation they face from patriarchal society and how they can be protected. Despite this vivid portrayal, the content across platforms remains scattered and inconsistent. Conclusion The study highlights both the potential and the limitations of social media in presenting ecofeminist narrative. It emphasizes the need for consistent and dedicated efforts to promote ecofeminist values online. The study adds to the fields of ecofeminism and media studies by showing how online content can reflect, support, and shape ecofeminist thinking today.

                Stress has profound impacts on the ventral tegmental area (VTA). However, the complex and opposing effects of stress on the VTA have limited our ability to reach a clear understanding of how adaptation of the VTA can drive behavior following stress. In this review we provide an overview of VTA responses to acute and chronic stress, with a primary focus on studies in mice and rats. We propose that divergent responses to stress arise from the heterogeneity of VTA neurons, the multidimensional nature of stress, and interactive effects between cumulative stressors. We suggest that the robust and varied plasticity of the VTA in response to stress indicates a role for the VTA as an integrator of homeostatic and affective information during stress to drive flexible and nuanced adjustments in behavioral adaptation.

                Nobre and Gresch call for an upgrade of attention research by considering how the brain shifts its focus between contents in the external sensory stream and internal memory representations. They highlight competing hypotheses, review the few experimental attempts and findings, propose candidate neural mechanisms, and identify major open questions.

                Perkins et al. report that clathrin-coated pits serve as permissive sites for microvillar growth, driven by Arp2/3-dependent actin nucleation. These findings illuminate an unexpected mechanism of microvillar biogenesis and hold broad implications for understanding how epithelial cells from diverse tissues build the apical specializations needed for physiological function.

                Vivo-seq allows the simultaneous capture of transcription and intracellular phosphorylation in droplet-based scRNA-seq. Using this approach in Th17 differentiation, we identify dual phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and c-FOS as required for maximum IL-2 production and associated with enhanced Th17 maintenance or transdifferentiation depending on subsequent cytokine signals received during antigenic restimulation.

                LptM facilitates the assembly of LptDE, the lipopolysaccharide translocon. Miyazaki et al. find that LptM binds the folded LptD intermediate at a late maturation stage. Cryoelectron microscopy analysis of the LptDEM complex and biochemical studies reveal the N-terminal region of LptM stabilizes the LptD β-barrel domain, ensuring its proper assembly.

                Ronan et al. explore the function of trigeminal sensory neurons innervating the inner tooth—herein, intradental neurons. They determine these specialized cells respond to damage of the enamel and initiate both pain and a jaw-opening reflex. Their work shifts our perspective of tooth innervation from pain producing to protective.

                Light determines plant growth through the crosstalk between photoreceptors, downstream components and chromatin modifications. Fang et al. show that HDC1 attenuates transcriptional activation of phyB and other light-induced genes by deacetylating their promoter regions. Furthermore, HDC1 interacts with PIF4, and together they modulate gene expression to fine-tune photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis.

                Haraguchi et al. demonstrate that maternal oral dysbiosis, specifically periodontitis-induced expansion of oral pathobionts, can be transmitted to offspring, altering gut immunity and increasing susceptibility to enteritis. These effects persist into adulthood, highlighting long-term health risks from non-gut maternal microbes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106728">Cryo-EM structures of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel in liposomes</a></h4>

              
                Detergents and lipid nanodiscs affect the cryo-EM structures of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) including ELIC. To determine the structure of a pLGIC in a membrane environment that supports ion channel function, we performed single particle cryo-EM of ELIC in liposomes. ELIC activation and desensitization were confirmed in liposomes with a stopped-flow thallium flux assay. Using WT ELIC and a non-desensitizing mutant (ELIC5), we captured resting, activated, and desensitized structures at high resolution. In the desensitized structure, the ion conduction pore has a constriction at the 9’ leucine of the pore-lining M2 helix, indicating that 9’ is the desensitization gate in ELIC. The agonist-bound structures of ELIC in liposomes are distinct from those in nanodiscs. In general, the transmembrane domain is more loosely packed in liposomes compared to nanodiscs. It has been suggested that large nanodiscs are superior for supporting membrane protein function. However, ELIC localizes to the rim of large circularized nanodiscs, and structures of ELIC in large nanodiscs deviate from the liposome structures more than those in small nanodiscs. Using liposomes for cryo-EM structure determination of a pLGIC increases our confidence that the structures are snapshots of functional states.

                PIEZO channels transmit mechanical force signals to cells, allowing them to make critical decisions during development and in pathophysiological conditions. Their fast/slow inactivation modes have been implicated in mechanopathologies but remain poorly understood. Here, we report several near-atomic resolution cryo-EM structures of fast-inactivating wild-type human PIEZO1 (hPIEZO1) and its slow-inactivating channelopathy mutants with or without its auxiliary subunit MDFIC. Our results suggest that hPIEZO1 has a more flattened and extended architecture than curved mouse PIEZO1 (mPIEZO1). The multi-lipidated MDFIC subunits insert laterally into the hPIEZO1 pore module like mPIEZO1, resulting in a more curved and extended state. Interestingly, the high-resolution structures suggest that the pore lipids, which directly seal the central hydrophobic pore, may be involved in the rapid inactivation of hPIEZO1. While the severe hereditary erythrocytosis mutant R2456H significantly slows down the inactivation of hPIEZO1, the hPIEZO1-R2456H-MDFIC complex shows a more curved and contracted structure with an inner helix twist due to the broken link between the pore lipid and R2456H. These results suggest that the pore lipids may be involved in the mechanopathological rapid inactivation mechanism of PIEZO channels.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98002">Single neurons and networks in the mouse claustrum integrate input from widespread cortical sources</a></h4>

              
                The claustrum is thought to be one of the most highly interconnected forebrain structures, but its organizing principles have yet to be fully explored at the level of single neurons. Here, we investigated the identity, connectivity, and activity of identified claustrum neurons in <i>Mus musculus</i> to understand how the structure’s unique convergence of input and divergence of output support binding information streams. We found that neurons in the claustrum communicate with each other across efferent projection-defined modules which were differentially innervated by sensory and frontal cortical areas. Individual claustrum neurons were responsive to inputs from more than one cortical region in a cell-type and projection-specific manner, particularly between areas of frontal cortex. In vivo imaging of claustrum axons revealed responses to both unimodal and multimodal sensory stimuli. Finally, chronic claustrum silencing specifically reduced animals’ sensitivity to multimodal stimuli. These findings support the view that the claustrum is a fundamentally integrative structure, consolidating information from around the cortex and redistributing it following local computations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105593">The myeloid cell-driven transdifferentiation of endothelial cells into pericytes promotes the restoration of BBB function and brain self-repair after stroke</a></h4>

              
                Ischemic stroke, one of the leading causes of death in the world, is accompanied by the dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which aggravates neuron damage. However, the mechanisms underlying the restoration of BBB in the chronic stage after stroke remain unclear. Here, pericyte pool alterations and their consequences for BBB integrity and brain recovery were analyzed in the C57BL/6 mice stroke model. Lineage tracing, RNA-seq, and immunofluorescence staining revealed endothelial cell (EC) transdifferentiation into pericytes (E-pericytes) in C57BL/6 mice after stroke. E-pericytes depletion by diphtheria toxin A (DTA) aggravated BBB leakage and exacerbated neurological deficits in the MCAO model. The myeloid cell-driven transdifferentiation of ECs into pericytes accelerated BBB restoration and brain self-repair after stroke via endothelial-mesenchymal transformation (EndoMT). Decreasing the number of E-pericytes by specific knockout of the <i>Tgfbr2</i> gene in ECs also aggravated BBB leakage and exacerbated neurological deficits. EC-specific overexpression of the <i>Tgfbr2</i> gene promoting E-pericytes transdifferentiation reduced BBB leakage and exerted neuroprotective effects. Deciphering the mechanism by which E-pericytes coordinate post-stroke recovery may reveal a novel therapeutic opportunity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102858">Physical constraints and biological regulations underlie universal osmoresponses</a></h4>

              
                Microorganisms constantly transition between environments with dramatically different external osmolarities. However, theories of microbial osmoresponse integrating physical constraints and biological regulations are lacking. Here, we propose such a theory, utilizing the separation of timescales for passive responses and active regulations. We demonstrate that regulations of osmolyte production and cell-wall synthesis assist cells in coping with intracellular crowding effects and adapting to a broad range of external osmolarity. Furthermore, we predict a threshold value above which cells cannot grow, ubiquitous across bacteria and yeast. Intriguingly, the theory predicts a dramatic speedup of cell growth after an abrupt decrease in external osmolarity due to cell-wall synthesis regulation. Our theory rationalizes the unusually fast growth observed in fission yeast after an oscillatory osmotic perturbation, and the predicted growth rate peaks match quantitatively with experimental measurements. Our study reveals the physical basis of osmoresponse, yielding far-reaching implications for microbial physiology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103073">Therapeutic effects of PDGF-AB/BB against cellular senescence in human intervertebral disc</a></h4>

              
                Accumulation of senescent cells is closely linked with intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, a prevalent age-dependent chronic disorder causing low back pain. While previous studies have highlighted that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) mitigated IVD degeneration through anti-apoptotic and pro-anabolic effects, its impact on IVD cell senescence remains elusive. In this study, human NP and AF cells derived from aged, degenerated IVDs were treated with recombinant human (rh) PDGF-AB/BB for 5 d. Transcriptome profiling by mRNA sequencing revealed that NP and AF cells responded to the treatment in similar yet distinct ways. The effects of PDGF-AB and BB on human IVD cells were comparable. Specifically, rhPDGF-AB/BB treatment downregulated genes related to neurogenesis and mechanical stimulus response in AF cells, while in NP cells, metabolic pathways were predominantly suppressed. In both NP and AF cells, rhPDGF-AB/BB treatment upregulated genes involved in cell cycle regulation and response to reduced oxygen levels, while downregulating genes related to senescence-associated phenotype, including oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and mitochondria dysfunction. Network analysis revealed that PDGFRA and IL6 were the top hub genes in treated NP cells. Furthermore, in irradiation-induced senescent NP cells, PDGFRA gene expression was significantly reduced compared to non-irradiated cells. However, rhPDGF-AB/BB treatment increased PDGFRA expression and mitigated the senescence progression through increased cell population in the S phase, reduced SA-β-Gal activity, and decreased expression of senescence-related regulators. Our findings reveal a novel anti-senescence role of PDGF in the IVD, making it a promising potential candidate to delay aging-induced IVD degeneration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91915">Heron, a Knowledge Graph editor for intuitive implementation of Python-based experimental pipelines</a></h4>

              
                To realise a research project, experimenters face conflicting design and implementation choices across hardware and software. These include balancing ease of implementation – time, expertise, and resources – against future flexibility, the number of opaque (black box) components and reproducibility. To address this, we present Heron, a Python-based platform for constructing and running experimental and data analysis pipelines. Heron allows researchers to design experiments according to their own mental schemata, represented as a Knowledge Graph – a structure that mirrors the logical flow of an experiment. This approach speeds up implementation (and subsequent updates), while minimising black box components, increasing transparency and reproducibility. Heron supports the integration of software and hardware combinations that are otherwise too complex or costly, making it especially useful in experimental sciences with a large number of interconnected components such as robotics, neuroscience, behavioural sciences, physics, chemistry, and environmental sciences. Unlike visual-only tools, Heron combines full control (of instrument and software combinations) and flexibility with the ease of high-level programming and Graphical User Interfaces. It assumes intermediate Python proficiency and offers a clean, modular code base that encourages documentation and reuse. By removing inaccessible technical barriers, Heron enables researchers without formal engineering backgrounds to construct sophisticated, reliable and reproducible experimental setups – bridging the gap between scientific creativity and technical implementation.

">High-Resolution EEG Source Reconstruction from PCA-Corrected BEM-FMM Reciprocal Basis Funcions: A Study with Visual Evoked Potentials from Intermittent Photic Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Modern automated human head segmentations can generate high-resolution computational meshes involving many non-nested tissues. However, most source reconstruction software is limited to 3-4 nested layers of low resolution and a small number of dipolar sources ~10,000. Recently, we introduced modeling techniques for source econstruction of magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals using the reciprocal approach and the boundary element fast multipole method (BEM-FMM). The technique of BEM-FMM can process both nested and non-nested models with as many as 4 million surface elements. In this paper, we present an analogue technique for source reconstruction of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals based on cortical global basis functions. The present work uses Helmholtz reciprocity to relate the reciprocally-generated lead-field matrices to their direct counterpart, while resolving the issue of possible biases toward the reference electrode. Our methodology is tested with experimental EEG data collected from a cohort of 12, young and healthy, volunteers subjected to intermittent photic stimulation (IPS). Our novel high-resolution source reconstruction models can have impact on mental health screening as well as brain-computer inter- faces.

">Human cortex organizes dynamic co-fluctuations along sensation-association axis</a></h4>

              
                The human brain dynamically organizes its activity through coordinated fluctuations, whose spatiotemporal interactions form the foundation of functional networks. While large-scale co-fluctuations are well-studied, the principles governing their amplitude-dependent transitions--particularly across high, intermediate, and low-amplitude regime--remain unknown. We introduce a co-fluctuation score to quantify how instantaneous functional interactions reorganize with global amplitude dynamics. Using resting-state fMRI data, we identified amplitude-dependent co-fluctuation transitions between functional systems hierarchically aligned with the sensorimotor-association (SA) axis: sensorimotor networks dominated high-amplitude co-fluctuations, associative systems prevailed during intermediate amplitudes, and limbic system preferentially engaged in low-amplitude states. This hierarchy underwent developmental refinement from childhood to adulthood and adaptively reconfigured under external stimuli. Replicated across four independent samples including 7T fMRI, these findings establish the SA axis as infrastructure for amplitude-dependent transitions of co-fluctuation states. Our framework bridges transient coordination and stable functional architecture, demonstrating how brain networks balance external processing (high-amplitude states) with internal cognition/emotion (mid-to-low amplitude states) through amplitude-stratified interactions.

">Predicting Developmental Norms from Baseline Cortical Thickness in Longitudinal Studies</a></h4>

              
                Normative models have gained popularity in computational psychiatry for studying individual-level differences relative to population norms in biological data such as brain imaging, where measures like cortical thickness are typically predicted from variables such as age and sex. Nearly all published models to date are based on cross-sectional data, limiting their ability to predict longitudinal change. Here, we used longitudinal brain data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, comprising cortical thickness measures from 180 regions per hemisphere in youths at baseline (N=6179; 47% females), 2-year (N=6179; 47% females), and 4-year (N=805; 45% females) follow-up. A training set was established from baseline and 2-year follow-up data (N=5374; 47% females), while data from individuals with all three time points available served as an independent test set (N=805; 45% females). We developed sex-specific Baseline-Integrated Norms (B-Norms) that predict brain region thickness at follow-up based on baseline thickness, baseline age, and follow-up age, and compared them to sex-specific standard Cross-Sectional Norms (C-Norms) based on age alone. Out-of-sample testing in 2-year and 4-year follow-up data showed that B-Norms consistently provided better fits than C-Norms for nearly all cortical regions. Explained variance was higher in B-Norms than in C-Norms. We found no significant differences between time points (p = 0.45). Repeated measures ANOVA revealed differences in higher-order moments (e.g., skewness and kurtosis) for both models; for example, skewness varied by model, sex, time point, and their interactions. While improved fit alone does not necessarily indicate a superior normative model - since normative models aim to capture population variance rather than simply optimize fit - we demonstrated that four regions were associated with pubertal changes in B-Norms but not in C-Norms, suggesting enhanced sensitivity of B-Norms to developmental processes. Together, our findings highlight the potential of B-Norms for capturing normative variation in longitudinal structural brain change.

">CK1δ-Dependent SNAPIN Dysregulation Drives Lysosomal Failure in HIV-1 Vpr-Exposed Neurons: A Targetable Mechanism in HAND</a></h4>

              
                HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) persist in nearly 40% of virally suppressed individuals despite antiretroviral therapy (ART). Lysosomal dysfunction has emerged as a key contributor to HAND pathogenesis, yet the molecular mechanisms linking chronic HIV exposure to impaired neuronal degradation remain incompletely defined. Here, we identify HIV-1 Viral Protein R (Vpr) as a driver of lysosomal acidification failure, clustering, and degradative impairment in neurons. We uncovered casein kinase 1 delta (CK1{delta}) as a central mediator of this dysfunction, acting via phosphorylation of the adaptor protein SNAPIN. Vpr-induced CK1{delta} activation leads to hyperphosphorylation of SNAPIN, disrupting lysosomal positioning and motility. These defects are rescued by selective CK1{delta} inhibition, which restores lysosomal acidification, positioning, and mitophagy. Our findings define a novel Vpr-CK1{delta}-SNAPIN axis contributing to HAND and highlight lysosomal transport as a targetable mechanism in neurodegeneration.

">Amyloid beta aggregation promoted by iron leads to neuronal loss in an ex vivo model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by amyloid beta (A{beta}) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Despite well-established iron accumulation in the AD brain, its role in exacerbating A{beta} toxicity is often overlooked in therapeutic research. We developed a 3D ex vivo organotypic brain slice cultures (OBSC) with A{beta} monomers and ferric citrate to mimic A{beta} deposits and iron overload to investigate the impact of excess iron on A{beta} toxicity in pig and human brains. Light and electron microscopy, biochemical assays, and multiple regression modeling were employed to assess iron-mediated A{beta} toxicity in neurons and glial cells. We show that OBSC offer a close approximation of in vivo morphological and physiological properties and can retain both neurons and glial cells for extended periods, and respond to experimental manipulations. We show that iron promotes A{beta} fibrillization into long fibrils, with this process further influenced by temperature. A{beta} selectively accumulated in neurons, leading to their death, sparing glial cells. In contrast, Iron, though generally toxic to neurons, exhibited unspecific cytotoxicity. Notably, the combined presence of A{beta} and iron synergistically increased neuronal death while reducing glial cell loss. Correlation analysis revealed that this synergic interaction enhances the toxicity of each other in a mutual fashion - A{beta} directs the neuronal toxicity while iron promotes A{beta} fibrillization, leading to targeted neuronal loss. In conclusion, our findings emphasize the critical role of excess iron and A{beta} in driving neuronal death in AD, underlining the importance of targeting iron accumulation along with A{beta} clearance but also addressing in future AD therapies, while also supporting our OBSC model as a valuable platform for studying the same.

">Expectation effects on repetition suppression in nociception</a></h4>

              
                Repetition suppression, the reduced neural response upon repeated presentation of a stimulus, can be explained by models focussing on bottom-up (i.e. adaptation) or top-down (i.e. expectation) mechanisms. Predictive coding models fall into the latter category and propose that repetitions are expected and therefore elicit smaller prediction error responses. While studies in the visual and auditory domain provide some support for such models, in nociception evidence remains inconclusive, despite the substantial influence expectations exert on pain perception. To assess expectation effects on repetition suppression in nociception, we developed a paradigm in which healthy volunteers received brief CO2 laser stimuli, while we acquired electroencephalographic (EEG) and peripheral physiological data. Importantly, laser stimuli could be either repeated after one second or not be repeated, with the probability of repetitions manipulated in a block-wise fashion, such that repetitions were either expected or unexpected. We observed repetition suppression in laser-evoked potentials as well as laser-induced gamma band oscillations, but not in laser-induced desynchronisations in the alpha and beta band. Critically, neither these EEG responses, nor the peripheral physiological data showed significant differences between the expectation conditions, with Bayesian analyses mostly providing evidence for an absence of effects. This indicates that repetition suppression to brief nociceptive laser stimuli is not driven by top-down factors, but rather mediated by other adaptation processes. While this does not preclude an influence of predictive coding models in nociception, it suggests that when the nervous system receives highly precise input, its responses are less susceptible to influence from expectations.

">"Backpropagation and the brain" realized in cortical error neuron microcircuits</a></h4>

              
                Neural responses to mismatches between expected and actual stimuli have been widely reported across different species. How does the brain use such error signals for learning? While global error signals can be useful, their ability to learn complex computation at the scale observed in the brain is lacking. In comparison, more local, neuron-specific error signals enable superior performance, but their computation and propagation remain unclear. Motivated by the breakthrough of deep learning, this has inspired the "backpropagation and the brain" hypothesis, i.e. that the brain implements a form of the error backpropagation algorithm. In this work, we introduce a biologically motivated, multi-area cortical microcircuit model, implementing error backpropagation under consideration of recent physiological evidence. We model populations of cortical pyramidal cells acting as representation and error neurons, with bio-plausible local and inter-area connectivity, guided by experimental observations of connectivity of the primate visual cortex. In our model, all information transfer is biologically motivated, inference and learning occur without phases, and network dynamics demonstrably approximate those of error backpropagation. We show the capabilities of our model on a wide range of benchmarks, and compare to other models, such as dendritic hierarchical predictive coding. In particular, our model addresses shortcomings of other theories in terms of scalability to many cortical areas. Finally, we make concrete predictions, which differentiate it from other theories, and which can be tested in experiment.

">When one race is not enough: a relay model explains multisensory response times</a></h4>

              
                Humans typically respond faster to multisensory signals than to their unisensory components, a phenomenon known as the redundant signal effect (RSE). One of the earliest and most influential accounts, the race model, attributes the RSE to statistical facilitation, which arises from parallel, independent processing across sensory modalities. While this model captures some key features of the RSE, it frequently underestimates the observed speed-up leading to violations of the race model inequality (RMI), a benchmark used to test the models validity. To reconcile this discrepancy, we introduce the relay model, a minimal extension of the race architecture that incorporates cross-modal initiation. In this model, responses result from two sequential race processes, allowing a signal in one modality to trigger the onset of perceptual decision processing in another. This structure retains statistical facilitation as a core principle while introducing a single free model parameter that divides unisensory processing into gating and decision stages. Through simulations and fits to foundational empirical datasets, we show that the relay model captures both the magnitude and distributional shape of the RSE, including RMI violations. It also accounts for changes in the RSE under asynchronous stimulus onsets, a critical test in multisensory integration research. By extending the classical race model with minimal added complexity, the relay model offers a mechanistically explicit and biologically plausible framework for explaining the dynamics of multisensory decision-making.

">Adult organotypic brain slice cultures recapitulate extracellular matrix remodelling in haemorrhagic stroke</a></h4>

              
                Haemorrhagic stroke is a devastating condition characterised by vessel rupture and free blood within the brain parenchyma or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) filled spaces. Across the major subtypes of haemorrhagic stroke (subarachnoid, intracerebral, and intraventricular haemorrhages), the presence of blood in the CSF generates significant tissue damage in the first 72 hours after the event, known as early brain injury (EBI). EBI includes neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier breakdown and dysregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) dynamics. ECM dysfunction has been shown to trigger fibrosis of the cortical blood vessels, limiting normal CSF circulation and resulting in the buildup of metabolic waste or the development of post-haemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Limiting or preventing this fibrosis may therefore reduce the rate of morbidity experienced by survivors, providing a potential avenue for non-surgical treatment to reduce secondary brain injury post-stroke. Despite this, current in vivo approaches fail to differentiate between the effect of blood products and secondary consequences including intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation and mass effect. Here, we describe an adult rat organotypic brain slice culture (OBSC) model of haemorrhagic stroke which enables the identification of the effect of blood products on ECM dysregulation. We demonstrate the distribution of key cell types across a time course of 0, 3 and 7 days in culture, indicating that such cultures are viable for a minimum of 7 days. Using immunofluorescence staining, Western blotting and RNA sequencing, we show that exposure of OBSCs to lysed blood markedly increases ECM deposition around cortical blood vessels. This is accompanied by dysregulation of ECM regulatory genes and upregulation of inflammation and oxidative stress-related genes, successfully recapitulating the changes seen in human stroke survivors. This versatile ex vivo model provides a translational platform to further understanding of haemorrhagic stroke pathophysiology and develop or trial novel therapeutics prior to progression to in vivo stroke studies.

">A brain-inspired algorithm enhances automatic speech recognitionperformance in multi-talker scenes</a></h4>

              
                Modern automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are capable of impressive performance recognizing clean speech but struggle in noisy, multi-talker environments, commonly referred to as the "cocktail party problem." In contrast, many human listeners can solve this problem, suggesting the existence of a solution in the brain. Here we present a novel approach that uses a brain inspired sound segregation algorithm (BOSSA) as a preprocessing step for a state-of-the-art ASR system (Whisper). We evaluated BOSSA's impact on ASR accuracy in a spatialized multi-talker scene with one target speaker and two competing maskers, varying the difficulty of the task by changing the target-to-masker ratio. We found that median word error rate improved by up to 54% when the target-to-masker ratio was low. Our results indicate that brain-inspired algorithms have the potential to considerably enhance ASR accuracy in challenging multi-talker scenarios without the need for retraining or fine-tuning existing state-of-the-art ASR systems.

">Much higher covariation with foveation timing by superior colliculus than primary visual cortical neuronal activity</a></h4>

              
                The superior colliculus (SC) is a potent driver for orienting movements, but it also possesses robust, short-latency visual responses. Even though such responses largely derive from direct primary visual cortical (V1) input, their relationship to V1 activity has never been analyzed with the same experimental subjects and stimuli. Here, we revisited pioneering observations that trial-by-trial variability in either the SC or V1 may predict variability in eye movement timing. We found that V1 covariation with behavioral variability was virtually non-existent in comparison to the SC, whether with respect to visual response onset latency, visual response strength, or pre-stimulus state. By far, the largest predictor of behavioral variability was visual response strength in SC visual-motor neurons. These results suggest that the SC reformats its inputs for exploitation of the SC's proximity to the motor periphery; V1 aids in jumpstarting the sensing process, but the SC much more directly supports visually-driven orienting.

">A comprehensive EEG dataset for investigating visual touch perception</a></h4>

              
                Visual touch perception is fundamental to body awareness and social bonding, helping us perceive ourselves and connect with others. However, understanding its neural basis has been limited by a lack of comprehensive public datasets. To address this, we present an electroencephalography (EEG) and self-report dataset from 80 participants. The dataset includes neural responses from 2,880 trials per participant, in which participants viewed touch interactions between two hands involving either direct skin contact or object-mediated contact. Complementing the EEG data are self-report measures on emotional empathy, perspective-taking, vicarious touch, and mirror-touch synaesthesia, providing a robust resource for exploring individual differences in visual touch perception. Ninety unique videos were shown in four orientations, with half the trials depicting a self-perspective and the other half an other-perspective, and showing either a left or right hand being touched. This design supports investigation into how perspective and hand laterality affect touch processing. Technical validation reveals distinct neural patterns associated with visual, sensory, and emotional touch dimensions, highlighting the potential of this dataset to advance research into diverse aspects of visual touch perception.

">Rethinking Kalman Filters for Motor Brain-Machine Interface: The Fundamental Limitations and A Perspective Shift</a></h4>

              
                The Kalman filter has been introduced to the motor brain-machine interface (BMI) field for over 20 years and remains one of the most widely used models due to its simple and intuitive nature. However, this paper demonstrates that the application of Kalman filters in the BMI field violates the model's own assumptions and numerous neuroscience principles, resulting in six critical limitations: (1) the observation matrix mapping from kinematics to neural activity causes individual neurons to be modeled independently, ignoring neural population activity; (2) aligned kinematic and neural activity sequences fail to capture preparatory information; (3) the presence of behaviorally irrelevant neural activity causes observation weights to be excessively underestimated; (4) noise in the observation matrix renders posterior covariance estimates biased; (5) Kalman gain computation in observation space leads to repeated noise accumulation and (6) computational inefficiency. All these problems can be resolved through a simple perspective shift: separating the decoder from the Kalman filter and treating its predicted kinematics as the Kalman filter's observation rather than neural activity. Experiments conducted on CRCNS-recorded monkey dorsal premotor area and primary motor signals performing computer cursor control tasks validate the existence of the six limitations and their violations of neuroscience principles, while demonstrating the superiority of the improved Kalman filter across all evaluated metrics.

                With the rapid development of various whole-brain ex vivo imaging technologies, there is a growing need to develop cross-modal 3D image registration methods to integrate multimodal imaging datasets. While comprehensive cross-modality registration tools such as D-LMBmap and mBrainAligner have been successfully implemented for mouse brains, macaque whole-brain registration presents unique challenges. These include more pronounced non-uniform deformations in larger ex vivo specimens, greater modality-specific contrast differences relative to standard space, and increased inter-individual variability. To address these challenges, we developed Macaca-Star, which incorporates deep learning models and self-individual MRI to tackle cross-modal and ex vivo sample deformation challenges in macaque whole-brain registration. Macaca-Star provides fully automated alignment of fMOST and 2D fluorescent slice images to the NMT MRI standard space, allowing for comprehensive integration of anterograde axonal projections and retrograde-traced neuronal soma profiles.

                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading worldwide cause of cognitive impairment, necessitating accurate, inexpensive diagnostic tools to enable early recognition. In this study, we present a robust deep learning approach for AD classification based on structural MRI scans, ConvNeXt, an emergent convolutional architecture inspired by vision transformers. We further present AlzaSet, a novel, expertly labeled clinical dataset with axial, coronal, and sagittal perspectives from AD and cognitively normal control subjects. Three ConvNeXt sizes (Tiny, Small, Base) were compared and benchmarked against existing state-of-the-art CNN models (VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, DenseNet121). ConvNeXt-Base consistently outperformed the other models on coronal slices with accuracy of 98.37% and an AUC of 0.992. Coronal views were determined to be most diagnostically informative, with emphasis on visualization of the medial temporal lobe. Moreover, comparison with recent ensemble-based techniques showed that superior performance with comparable computational efficiency. These results indicate that ConvNeXt-capable models applied to clinically curated data sets have strong potential to provide scalable, real-time AD screening in diverse settings, including both high-resource and resource-constrained settings.

">Neuron-Microenvironments Associated with Specific Long-Range Connectivity Reveal Functional Modules in the Adult Drosophila Brain</a></h4>

              
                Advances in electron microscopy (EM) and computational neuroscience enable large-scale neuronal reconstruction, yet existing methods often overlook surrounding neurons' influence. Using a whole-brain EM dataset of Drosophila, we analyzed 50 million synapses and derived microenvironmental (MicroEnv) features for over 130,000 neurons categorized by polarity. This refined 78 brain regions into 482 subregions, forming a high-resolution MicroEnv-atlas. MicroEnv features improved spatial coherence by 68% compared to single-neuron morphological features and correlated with long-range projections in the Mushroom Body. Integration with scRNA-seq data revealed associations with transmembrane transport and metabolism, suggesting roles in intercellular communication. Clustering based on distal projections identified submodules aligned with functional hierarchies, including feeding and multisensory processing. Our framework highlights the value of microenvironmental context in mapping brain organization.

">Volitional Attention to Color: Breaking Willed Attention out of the Spatial Domain</a></h4>

              
                Attention can be guided by either voluntary (top-down) or involuntary (bottom-up) influences. In real-world vision, voluntary attention can be directed by a wide range of influences such as reward, priming, meaning, experience, selection history, and volition. Laboratory studies of voluntary attention have commonly used attention-directing cues to induce or instruct human subjects to attend one class of stimuli while ignoring others. In recent years, free choice conditions of attention have been introduced, where self-generated volitional shifts of attention (willed attention) are possible (for a review, see Nadra & Mangun, 2023). Prior willed attention studies have focused on mechanisms of covert spatial attention, investigating the neurophysiological correlates of willed attention related to both post-decision processing, and the pre-decision brain activity patterns that predict participants' free choices about where to attend. Much less work, however, has been done on willed non-spatial attention. In this study, in a fashion similar to prior willed spatial attention studies, we investigated willed attention to stimulus color. In a trial-by-trial cueing design, subjects were either cued what color to attend or were allowed to freely choose what color to attend, in order to subsequently discriminate visual features of the cued or willfully chosen target. Behavioral measures showed that the subjects were selectively attending the cued or willed color. Using support vector machine decoding on EEG alpha (8-12 Hz) signals, we found significant post-decision differences in alpha-band power and broadband EEG voltage when participants chose to attend to orange versus purple. However, in contrast to the findings in prior work on willed spatial attention, no pre-decision EEG signals could be identified that predicted which color participants would choose to attend to.

">Membrane-anchored PrPSc is the trigger for prion synaptotoxicity</a></h4>

              
                The mechanism by which prions composed of PrPSc cause the neuropathological aberrations characteristic of prion diseases remains elusive. Previous studies have defined a synaptotoxic signaling pathway in which extracellular PrPSc stimulates NMDA receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx, activation of p38 MAPK, and collapse of the actin cytoskeleton in dendritic spines, resulting in functional decrements in synaptic transmission. However, these studies did not distinguish the source of the PrPSc that activates the signaling pathway: extracellular PrPSc bound to PrPC on the neuronal surface, or membrane-anchored PrPSc generated by the PrPC-PrPSc conversion process. To address this question, we employed two different experimental strategies, both of which interfere with PrPC-PrPSc conversion: (1) neuronal expression of PrPC mutants that are locked in the PrPC conformation (G126V and V208M); and (2) application of extracellular PrPSc from a species (mouse or hamster) that is unable to convert neuronal PrPC of the other species. We first confirmed that both of these strategies resulted in impaired PrPC-PrPSc conversion in cultured N2a and CAD5 cell lines. To assay synaptotoxicity, we then used lentiviral transduction to express the PrPC variants in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons from PrP-null mice, and quantitated dendritic spine density after exposure to purified prions. Expression of G126V PrP completely prevented spine retraction in response to three different murine prion strains (RML, 22L, and ME7), while the effect of V208M PrP was strain-dependent, consistent with partial stabilization of PrP structure by this mutation. Expression of hamster PrPC or mouse PrPC greatly attenuated spine retraction in response to murine 22L and hamster 263K prions, respectively. These findings support a model in which newly formed PrPSc at the neuronal surface is required to initiate prion-mediated synaptotoxic signaling. This work also suggests use of the G126V mutation as part of a therapeutic strategy to reduce PrPSc conversion in prion diseases.

">Framed RSA: Representational comparisons that honor bothgeometry and population-mean response preferences</a></h4>

              
                Representational similarity analysis (RSA) characterizes the geometry of neural activity patterns elicited by different stimuli while discarding information about neural response preferences, regional population-mean activity and the absolute location and orientation of the patterns in the multivariate response space. Analyses of the tuning of individual neurons or voxels and of the population-mean activation are often performed separately from RSA and thought of as serving complementary purposes. When evaluating alternative representational models, invariance to certain aspects of the neural code is desirable because systems might use superficially different encodings to implement the same computations. However, neural preferences and regional-mean activation are arguably physiologically and mechanistically important, and so we may want for our models to predict them correctly. Here we introduce a novel analysis technique, framed RSA, which honors both the geometry and the population-mean preferences in evaluating model-predicted representations. To achieve this, we augment the set of patterns that define the geometry by two reference patterns: the zero-point (origin) and a uniform constant pattern in the multivariate response space, enabling RSA to incorporate information about the global location, orientation, and mean activation of neural population codes. First we present the mathematical and methodological underpinnings of framed RSA, including how it interacts with different RSA analysis choices, such as the use of cross-validated dissimilarity estimates and whitened RDM comparators. Second, we show empirically that framed RSA generally improves accuracy for both brain-region identification (using fMRI data from the Natural Scenes Dataset and the Things Ventral Stream Spiking Dataset) and deep-neural-network-layer identification relative to existing RSA approaches. By incorporating neural population preferences into model evaluation, framed RSA enables more mechanistically meaningful model comparisons and benefits from improved power for model-comparative inference.

">Blood-brain-barrier permeable fluorescent astrocyte probes.</a></h4>

              
                The brain's astrocytes play pivotal roles in brain homeostasis, but their contributions to neural circuit function are only beginning to be explored. In order to study astrocytes in their native environment, the field needs imaging probes that are cell-specific, non-toxic, and complementary to existing genetic techniques. We recently described a panel of cationic fluorophores that selectively label rodent and zebrafish astrocytes at low concentrations and short incubation times. Here, we expand on those first-generation astrocyte probes with a new class of brighter and more photostable dyes that allow for imaging across various wavelengths. We demonstrate these probes' subcellular localization to the mitochondria and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier in zebrafish. This new class of astrocyte markers will aid researchers in visualizing and identifying subpopulations of astrocytes in both rodent and zebrafish model systems.

">Given the birds, where is the flock? Visual estimation of the location of collections of points</a></h4>

              
                How does the visual system assign locations to collections of points? The perceived location of a flock of birds is influenced by the locations of individual birds but is not synonymous with them. If the collection is a statistical sample from a particular distribution, the location estimation task is analogous to parametric estimation in statistics. The statistician knows the sample and also has partial knowledge of the distribution from which the sample was drawn. We examine how observers carry out parametric estimation tasks that are also visual organization tasks. In our experiment the collections were one-dimensional statistical samples plotted along a horizontal line. They were drawn from one of three location families: the Gaussian, the Laplacian, and the Uniform. Observers saw only the sample and had to estimate the location of the generating probability density function. We compared human performance to unbiased minimum variance estimators (UMVUEs) for each family. We tested whether observers used the same or different estimators for all three distributional families and whether their estimators were UMVUEs. Observers used different estimators for different distributional families. The estimators chosen for samples from the Gaussian and Uniform distributions were significantly different from the corresponding UMVUEs while that for the Laplacian was not. We developed a model of human performance based on clusters in samples. Clusters convey information about the distributions from which they are drawn. We propose a Two-Stage Visual Cluster Model (VCM) of location estimation. The observer first partitions the sample into non-overlapping clusters assigning a location to each cluster and then computes a weighted average of the cluster locations with weights reflecting how well each cluster fit the entire sample. The VCM captured human performance across all three distributions. These findings suggest that the visual system is sensitive to the structural information underlying the locations of individual points and bases their location estimates on Gestalt principles.

">A gradient of complementary learning systems emerges through meta-learning</a></h4>

              
                Long-term learning and memory in the primate brain rely on a series of hierarchically organized subsystems extending from early sensory neocortical areas to the hippocampus. The components differ in their representational attributes and plasticity, with evidence for sparser, more decorrelated activity and faster plasticity in regions higher up in the hierarchy. How and why did the brain arrive at this organization? We explore the principles that allow such an organization to emerge by simulating a hierarchy of learning subsystems in artificial neural networks (ANNs) using a meta-learning approach. As ANNs optimized weights for a series of tasks, they concurrently meta-learned layer-wise plasticity and sparsity parameters. This approach enhanced the computational efficiency of ANNs, promoting hidden activation sparsity while benefitting task performance. Meta-learning also gave rise to a brain-like hierarchical organization, with higher layers displaying faster plasticity and a sparser, more pattern-separated neural code than lower layers. Early layers peaked early in their plasticity and stabilized, whereas higher layers continued to develop and maintained elevated plasticity over time, mirroring empirical developmental trajectories. Moreover, when trained on dual tasks imposing competing demands for item discrimination and categorization, ANNs with parallel pathways developed distinct representational and plasticity profiles, convergent with the distinct properties observed empirically across intra-hippocampal pathways. These results suggest that the macroscale organization and development of heterogeneous learning subsystems in the brain may emerge in part from optimizing biological variables that govern plasticity and sparsity.

">Modelling perceptual uncertainty in a thermosensory illusion across the lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Most studies of perceptual illusions rely on explicit reports alone, offering a limited view into the computations that underlie ambiguous sensory experiences. Here, we introduce a multivariate computational approach to model paradoxical heat sensation (PHS), a thermosensory illusion in which skin cooling evokes sensations of warmth, as an individual-specific process. We tested 75 healthy adults (aged 21 to 80) using a perceptual decision-making task with stimuli designed to elicit PHS. Binary perceptual choices, response times and confidence ratings were jointly analysed using hierarchical multivariate Bayesian modelling to characterise PHS at both the population and individual levels across the lifespan. We tested two distinct perceptual profiles: ''true perceivers'', who experience PHS similarly to a veridical warm percept; and ''unsure perceivers'', who perceive PHS as an ambiguous experience. At the group level, behaviour was best explained by the unsure perceiver model, suggesting that PHS is often an uncertain experience, rather than a categorical misperception. At the individual level, however, both profiles were represented, with considerable inter-individual variability in model fit. Older participants were more likely to report PHS and did so at lower levels of thermal contrast, but we observed no correlation between age and perceptual profile. This suggests that while ageing increases the likelihood of experiencing PHS, it does not alter the qualitative nature of its perception. These findings also show how multivariate modelling of perceptual, decisional and metacognitive responses can reveal distinct subjective profiles and their variation across individuals and age.

">KIASORT: Knowledge-Integrated Automated Spike Sorting for Geometry-Free Neuron Tracking</a></h4>

              
                Identifying single units from extracellularly recorded neural signals is critical for understanding brain circuit dynamics. With the advancements of large-scale recordings, efficient and precise automated spike sorting methods have become essential. Existing approaches face challenges with channel quality variability, neuron-specific waveform drifts, and nonlinear changes in spike shapes that depend on neuronal morphology and electrode proximity. We introduce KIASORT (Knowledge-Integrated Automated Spike Sorting), which integrates knowledge from channel-specific classifiers trained on clustered spike waveforms to sort the data. KIASORT evaluates channel quality, automatically excludes noisy recordings, and identifies spike classes using a hybrid dimensionality reduction approach combining linear with nonlinear embeddings. To validate our approach against existing methods, we developed biophysical simulations demonstrating that conventional one-dimensional drift correction methods cannot address heterogeneous neuron-specific drift and nonlinear waveform changes. KIASORT's geometry-free, per-neuron tracking approach overcomes these limitations without assumptions about cluster shape or temporal stability. Specifically, KIASORT identified significantly greater number of high-quality units than Kilosort4 in ground-truth simulations with neuron-specific drift, while maintaining real-time processing capability. Complementing these advances, KIASORT also includes a unified graphical interface for data inspection, sorting, and curation, which is freely available online through link https://github.com/banaiek/KIASORT.

">Identification of cellular and molecular risk signatures for progression to late-stage age-related macular degeneration using the 9-step Minnesota Grading System</a></h4>

              
                Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex multifactorial disease, and the molecular mechanisms underpinning the progression of intermediate AMD to geographic atrophy are not fully understood. To better understand mechanisms driving progression, we performed bulk RNA sequencing on dissected macular and peripheral RPE/choroid and neural retina tissue from postmortem human eyes graded using the 9-step Minnesota Grading System (MGS). Binning of intermediate AMD cases into three distinct groups (AMD3L, AMD3M, AMD3H) based on the 5-year risk of progression enabled identification of distinct gene and pathway changes associated with progression to late-stage disease. Identified changes in gene expression were validated using ELISA or histological methods. RPE-specific genes and lipid metabolic pathways showed a transient increase in AMD3L followed by a pronounced decrease in AMD3H. In AMD3H, immune response genes such as C3, TREM2, and OLR1 were upregulated when compared to AMD3L samples, as well as genes specific to Muller glia/astrocytes (NGFR, SPP1, GPX3). Our findings support complement inhibition as a promising therapeutic option for slowing conversion to advanced AMD and identify macrophage and Muller/astrocyte genes as potential cell types to target in AMD. Further, we demonstrate the value of combining emerging, outcomes-based, clinically relevant grading systems with profiling technologies to generate new insights into ocular diseases.

">Dynamic Causal White Matter Atlas of Auditory and Visual Speech Networks at Millisecond Resolution: Intracranial Evidence from 125 Patients</a></h4>

              
                Background and Objectives: Since the era of Penfield, invasive neurophysiology has laid a lasting foundation for functional neuroscience by elucidating brain regions necessary for speech. However, whole-brain investigations have yet to distinguish the millisecond-scale dynamics and specific white matter pathways that support rapid naming in the auditory and visual domains. Methods: In this observational study, we constructed a whole-brain Dynamic Causal Tractography atlas using intracranial neurophysiological data from 125 neurosurgical patients. The resulting video atlas captured local cortical high-gamma activity and cortico-cortical coactivation via white matter tracts during rapid and delayed auditory and picture naming. Direct electrical stimulation was employed to assess the causal significance of the observed neural dynamics. Results: The atlas revealed white matter coactivation intensity patterns at specific 5-millisecond time windows that best aligned with sensorimotor and language symptoms elicited by electrical stimulation (Spearman's {rho} = 0.58-0.91; p = 4.8x10-7 to 1.6x10-25). Rapid auditory naming was associated with deactivation of the right rostral middle frontal gyrus and increased coactivation along the left arcuate fasciculus, linked to stimulation-induced receptive and expressive aphasia. In contrast, delayed auditory naming correlated with a late surge in bifrontal coactivation. Rapid picture naming involved early coactivation between cortices connected via the bilateral inferior longitudinal fasciculi--associated with stimulation-induced visual distortions--coinciding with transient co-inactivation of Broca's area. Discussion: These findings delineate dissociable white matter-mediated mechanisms supporting rapid naming in the auditory and visual domains. Reduced inhibitory monitoring by the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may facilitate efficient lexical retrieval via left perisylvian pathways during auditory naming. In contrast, excessive bifrontal interaction may underlie delayed auditory naming. Rapid visual object recognition appears to rely on early occipitotemporal coactivation with minimal involvement of Broca's area. The resulting atlas--accompanied by a publicly available dataset (61.2 GB) and analysis code--serves as a valuable resource for students and trainees studying the network dynamics underlying speech, as well as for presurgical language mapping in patients undergoing cortical or subcortical intervention.
