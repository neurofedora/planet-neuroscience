<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus"><em class="a-plus-plus">PSEN1</em> gene is considered to be the most common gene, which is responsible for the development of an autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease with early onset and sometimes broad phenotype. We present a patient with a spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-like phenotype who was found to carry an M233V mutation. General and neurological exam was carried out. Brain MRI as well as genetic testing for SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 17 were performed. The patient was then referred for a next-generation sequencing-based gene panel test with 723 genes included. A 26-year-old man of an Azerbaijani origin presented with a progressive impairment of coordination followed by memory impairment. Family history was positive for a similar disorder suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance. Brain MRI showed bilateral hippocampal atrophy (more pronounced in the left), as well as mild atrophy of the left temporoparietal cortex. Tests for SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 17 came negative. Gene panel test showed c.697A &gt; G heterozygous variant in the <em class="a-plus-plus">PSEN1</em> gene leading to a M233V amino acid change, which was validated by a Sanger sequencing. So far, M233V mutation has not been associated with a combination of cerebellar and cognitive features at onset. Our case contributes to a better characterization of the <em class="a-plus-plus">PSEN1</em> mutations and expands the phenotype of the M233V carriers. We propose to consider <em class="a-plus-plus">PSEN1</em> mutations in patients presenting with an SCA-like phenotype but negative for common types of SCA.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">A prompt diagnosis and treatment of patients with autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (CA) with antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-Abs) may lead to a better prognosis. Herein, we report prodromal transient neurological symptoms that should raise clinical suspicion of CA with GAD-Abs. We initially identified a 70-year-old man who presented a first acute episode of vertigo, diplopia, and ataxia lasting 2 weeks. Two months later, he experienced a similar episode along with new-onset gaze-evoked nystagmus. After 4 months, downbeat nystagmus, left limb dysmetria, and gait ataxia progressively appeared, and an autoimmune CA was diagnosed based on the positivity of GAD-Abs in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We searched retrospectively for similar presentations in a cohort of 31 patients diagnosed with CA and GAD-Abs. We found 11 (35.4%) patients (all women, median age 62 years; 8/11 [72.7%] with autoimmune comorbidities) with transient neurological symptoms antedating CA onset by a median of 3 months, including vertigo in 9 (81.8%; described as paroxysmal in 8) and fluctuating diplopia in 3 (27.3%) patients. The identification of transient neurological symptoms of unknown etiology, such as paroxysmal vertigo and fluctuating diplopia, should lead to GAD-Abs testing in serum and CSF, especially in patients with autoimmune comorbidities.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by storage of unesterified glycolipids and cholesterol in lysosome. NPC’s clinical presentation is highly heterogeneous, depending on the time of onset. It encompasses visceral, neurological, and/or psychiatric manifestations. As the motor findings are so important and devastating in this disease, there is a lack of description about non-motor symptoms, even though they play important role in quality of life of NPC patients. We described the most common non-motor findings in NPC like cognitive dysfunction, neuroimaging, psychiatric symptoms, sleep disorders, seizures, hearing problems, respiratory and other systemic features, bladder and fecal dysfunction, hypersalivation, and malnutrition. In this review, we highlighted the importance of these undervalued symptoms and their management. Specific measures of all aforementioned clinical features may work as relevant biomarkers in order to evaluate successful therapies in future clinical trials.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) represent a large group of heredodegenerative diseases, with great phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity. However, in the clinical neurological practice, some symptoms and signs might help differentiate the SCAs. This study’s aims were to evaluate the frequency of upward gaze palsy (UGP) and investigate its role in assisting in the clinical differentiation of SCAs. We included 419 patients with SCAs (248 with SCA3, 95 with SCA10, 38 with SCA2, 22 with SCA1, 12 with SCA7, and 4 with SCA6). This study compared UGP with other known markers of disease severity—age of onset, disease duration, SARA score, and size of CAG expansion, and also other semiologic features, as bulging eyes. This sign was significantly more prevalent in SCA3 (64.11%), compared with SCA10 (3.16%; <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001) and other SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA7–11.84%; <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001). UGP showed very high sensibility ins SCA3 (92.9), although lacking of specificity (64.1%). The odds ratio (OR) of UGP were also very high, 23.52 (95% CI 12.38–44.69), and was significantly correlated with larger CAG expansions, age, and disease duration in SCA3 patients, but not with age of onset or severity of the ataxic syndrome. This study showed that UGP is highly suggestive of SCA3 and has high sensitivity for the differential diagnosis among SCAs, and it could be of great value for bedside semiologic tool.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Communication difficulties have considerable impact on people with progressive ataxia, yet there are currently no evidence-based treatments. LSVT LOUD® focuses on the production of healthy vocal loudness whilst also improving breath support, vocal quality, loudness and articulation in participating patients. This study aimed to investigate whether Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD®) can improve communication effectiveness in these patients. We performed a rater-blinded, single-arm study investigating LSVT LOUD® treatment in a population of patients with progressive ataxia including Friedreich’s ataxia (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 18), spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 1), idiopathic cerebellar ataxia (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 1), and spastic paraplegia 7 (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 1). Twenty-one patients were recruited to the study, with 19 completing treatment. Sessions were administered via Skype in the LSVT-X format, meaning two sessions per week over a period of 8 weeks. Assessments included two baseline and two post-treatment measures and focused on outcome measures covering aspects ranging from physiological function to impact and participation. Results indicate improvements in patient-perceived outcomes for 14 of the 19 participants, in both speech and psychosocial domains. Speech data furthermore demonstrate significant improvements in prolonged vowel duration, and voice quality measures. Intelligibility and naturalness evaluations showed no change post-treatment. Patients reported high acceptability of the treatment itself, as well as administration by Skype. This is the largest treatment study for people with progressive ataxia published to date. It provides an indication that LSVT LOUD® can have a positive impact on communication in this patient group and could form the basis for larger-scale trials.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Immune-mediated ataxias account for a substantial number of sporadic otherwise idiopathic ataxias. Despite some well-characterised entities such as paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration where diagnostic markers exist, the majority of immune ataxias remained undiagnosed and untreated. We present here our experience in the treatment of suspected primary autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (PACA) using mycophenolate. All patients reported attend the Sheffield Ataxia Centre on a regular basis and had undergone extensive investigations, including genetic testing using next-generation sequencing, with other causes of ataxia excluded. The diagnosis of PACA was strongly suspected based on investigations, pattern of disease progression, and cerebellar involvement. Patients were treated with mycophenolate and monitored using MR spectroscopy of the cerebellar vermis. Thirty patients with PACA are reported here. Of these, 22 received mycophenolate (group 1). The remaining 8 were not on treatment (group 2-control group). Out of the 22 treated patients, 4 underwent serial MR spectroscopy prior to starting treatment and thus were used as controls making the total number of patients in the control group 12. The mean change of the MRS within the vermis (NAA/Cr area ratio) in the treatment group was + 0.144 ± 0.09 (improved) and in the untreated group − 0.155 ± 0.06 (deteriorated). The difference was significant. We also demonstrated a strong correlation between the spectroscopy and the SARA score. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of mycophenolate in the treatment of PACA. The results suggest that immune-mediated ataxias are potentially treatable, and that there is a need for early diagnosis to prevent permanent neurological deficit. The recently published diagnostic criteria for PACA would hopefully aid the diagnosis and treatment of this entity.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Speech production relies on motor control and cognitive processing and is linked to cerebellar function. In diseases where the cerebellum is impaired, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), speech abnormalities are common and can be detected by instrumental assessments. However, the potential of speech assessments to be used to monitor cerebellar impairment in MS remains unexplored. The aim of this study is to build an objectively measured speech score that reflects cerebellar function, pathology and quality of life in MS. Eighty-five people with MS and 21 controls participated in the study. Speech was independently assessed through objective acoustic analysis and blind expert listener ratings. Cerebellar function and overall disease disability were measured through validated clinical scores; cerebellar pathology was assessed via magnetic resonance imaging, and validated questionnaires informed quality of life. Selected speech variables were entered in a regression model to predict cerebellar function. The resulting model was condensed into one composite speech score and tested for prediction of abnormal 9-hole peg test (9HPT), and for correlations with the remaining cerebellar scores, imaging measurements and self-assessed quality of life. Slow rate of syllable repetition and increased free speech pause percentage were the strongest predictors of cerebellar impairment, complemented by phonatory instability. Those variables formed the acoustic composite score that accounted for 54% of variation in cerebellar function, correlated with cerebellar white matter volume (<em class="a-plus-plus">r</em> = 0.3, <em class="a-plus-plus">p =</em> 0.017), quality of life (<em class="a-plus-plus">r</em> = 0.5, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001) and predicted an abnormal 9HPT with 85% accuracy. An objective multi-feature speech metric was highly representative of motor cerebellar impairment in MS.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is relatively prevalent among the Yemenite Jewish subpopulation living in Israel. Currently, there is no treatment able to modify the disease progression. Trehalose is a disaccharide with protein-stabilizing and autophagy-enhancing properties. In animal models of MJD, trehalose showed reduction of cerebellar lesion size and improved motor function. This study was designed to be a proof-of-concept, phase 2 study lasting 6 to 12 months, to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of weekly IV administration of 15 g or 30 g 10% trehalose solution in 14 MJD patients. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability, which were assessed by various clinical and laboratory tests. Secondary endpoints were changes in the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) score, Neurological Examination Score for Spinocerebellar Ataxia (NESSCA), time to do 9-hole peg test (9HPT), time to do 8-meter walk (8MW), and quality of life assessed by the World Health Organization Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-BREF (WHOQoL-BREF). Trehalose was well tolerated, and no serious drug-related adverse events were noted. The average SARA score, NESSCA, and time to do 9HPT and 8MW and the WHOQoL-BREF for all patients remained stable at 6 months. Six patients received treatment for as long as 12 months and continued to remain stable on all the above tests. IV trehalose seems to be safe in humans and probably effective to stabilize neurological impairment in MJD.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Corticomuscular and intermuscular coherence (CMC, IMC) reflect connectivity between neuronal activity in the motor cortex measured by electroencephalography (EEG) and muscular activity measured by electromyography (EMG), or between activity in different muscles, respectively. There is an ongoing debate on the appropriateness of EMG rectification prior to coherence estimation. This work examines the effects of EMG rectification in CMC and IMC estimation in 20 spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) patients, 16 prodromal SCA2 gene mutation carriers, and 26 healthy controls during a repetitive upper or lower limb motor task. Coherence estimations were performed using the non-rectified raw EMG signal vs. the rectified EMG signal. EMG rectification decreases the level of significance of lower beta-frequency band CMC and IMC values in SCA2 patients and prodromal SCA2 mutation carriers vs. healthy controls, and also results in overall lower coherence values. EMG rectification is detrimental for beta-frequency band CMC and IMC estimation. One likely reason for this effect is distortion of coherence estimation in high-frequency signals, where the level of amplitude cancelation is high.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The cerebellum plays a critical role in promoting learning of new motor tasks, which is an essential function for motor recovery. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the cerebellum can be used to enhance learning. In this study, we investigated the effects of cerebellar intermittent theta burst stimulation (c-iTBS), a high-frequency rTMS protocol, on visuo-motor learning in a sample of hemiparetic patients due to recent stroke in the territory of the contralateral middle cerebral artery. Eight stroke patients were enrolled for the purposes of the study in the chronic stage of recovery (i.e., at least 6 months after stroke). In two sessions, Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with real or sham c-iTBS applied over the cerebellar hemisphere ipsilateral to the affected body side. c-iTBS was applied immediately before the learning phase of a visuo-motor adaptation task. Real, but not sham, c-iTBS improved visuo-motor learning as revealed by an increased performance in of the learning phase of the visuo-moto adaptation task. Moreover, we also found that real but not sham c-iTBS induced a sustained improvement in the re-adaptation of the recently learned skill (i.e., when patients were re-tested after 30 min). Taken together, these data point to c-iTBS as a potential novel strategy to promote motor learning in patients with stroke.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Chromosomal microarray analysis is commonly used as screening test for children with neurodevelopmental issues, also in case of complex neurological phenotypes. Developmental delay/intellectual disability is a common presentation sign in pediatric ataxias, diseases with high clinical and genetic heterogeneity. In order to determine the diagnostic yield of Array-CGH in such conditions, all the tests performed in the last 10-year activity of a single referral center in children who present, besides the neurodevelopmental impairment, cerebellar abnormalities have been systematically gathered. The study demonstrates that, except for Dandy-Walker malformation or poly-malformative phenotypes, chromosomal microarray analysis should be discouraged as first-line diagnostic test in pediatric ataxias with neurodevelopmental disability.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">We sought to assess structural and functional patterns of cerebellum in multiple system atrophy (cerebellar type), and investigate the associations of structural and functional cerebellar gray matter abnormalities. We collected magnetic resonance imaging data of 18 patients with multiple system atrophy (cerebellar type) and 18 health control subjects. The gray matter loss across the motor and cognitive cerebellar territories in patients was assessed using voxel-based morphometry. And change in the connectivity between the cerebellum and large-scale cortical networks was assessed using resting-state functional MRI analysis. Furthermore, we assessed the relationship between the extent of cerebellar atrophy and reduced-activation in the cerebellar-cortical and subthalamo-cerebellar functional connectivities. We confirmed the gray matter loss across the motor and cognitive cerebellar territories in patients and found that the extent of cerebellar atrophy was correlated with decreased connectivity between the cerebellum and large-scale cortical networks, including the default, frontal parietal, and sensorimotor networks. The volume reduction in the motor cerebellum was closely associated with the clinical motor severity. A post hoc analysis showed reduced-activation in the subthalamo-cerebellar functional connectivity without the subthalamic nucleus atrophy. These results emphasized significant atrophy in the cerebellar subsystem and its association with the large-scale cortical networks in multiple system atrophy (cerebellar type), which may improve our understanding of the neural pathophysiology mechanisms of disease.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Cerebellar volume, in particular vermal lobule areas VI–VII, have been extensively researched in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), although findings are often unclear. The aim of the present study is to consolidate all existing cerebellar and age data of individuals with ASD, and compare this data to typically developing (TD) controls. Raw data, or the means and standard deviations of cerebellar volume and age, were obtained from 17 studies (<em class="a-plus-plus">N</em><sub class="a-plus-plus">Cerebellum</sub>: 421 ASD and 370 TD participants; <em class="a-plus-plus">N</em><sub class="a-plus-plus">VI–VII</sub>: 506 ASD and 290 TD participants). Total cerebellar volume, or VI–VII area, was plotted against age and lines of fit of ASD and TD data were compared. Mean differences in cerebellar volume and VI–VII area between participants with ASD and TD participants were then compared via ANCOVA analyses. Findings revealed multiple differences in VI–VII area between participants with ASD and TD participants below 18 years of age. Additionally, cerebellar volume was greater in males with ASD than TD males between 2 and 4 years. In the present study, cerebellar volume and VI–VII area show different rates of change across age for those with autism compared with those without. These morphological differences provide a neurobiological justification to investigate related behavioural correlates.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) give rise to the cerebellar granule neurons in the developing cerebellum. Generation of large number of these neurons is made possible by the high proliferation rate of CGNPs in the external granule layer (EGL) in the dorsal cerebellum. Here, we show that upregulation of β-catenin can maintain murine CGNPs in a state of proliferation. Further, we show that β-catenin mRNA and protein levels can be regulated by the mitogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Shh signaling led to an increase in the level of the transcription factor N-myc. N-myc was found to bind the β-catenin promoter, and the increase in β-catenin mRNA and protein levels could be prevented by blocking N-myc upregulation downstream of Shh signaling. Furthermore, blocking Wingless-type MMTV integration site (Wnt) signaling by Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor Dickkopf 1 (Dkk-1) in the presence of Shh did not prevent the upregulation of β-catenin. We propose that in culture, Shh signaling regulates β-catenin expression through N-myc and results in increased CGNP proliferation.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Alzheimer’s disease (AD) represents one of the main forms of dementia that afflicts our society. The expression of several genes has been associated with disease development. Despite this, the number of genes known to be capable of discriminating between AD patients according to sex remains deficient. In our study, we performed a transcriptomes meta-analysis on a large court of brains of healthy control subjects (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 2139) (NDHC) and brains of AD patients (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 1170). Our aim was to verify the brain expression levels of CHI3L2 and its correlation with genes associated with microglia-mediated neuroinflammation (IBA1), alteration of the blood–brain barrier (PECAM1), and neuronal damage (CALB1). We showed that the CHI3L2, IBA1, PECAM1, and CALB1 expression levels were modulated in the brains of patients with AD compared to NDHC subjects. Furthermore, both in NDHC and in AD patient’s brains, the CHI3L2 expression levels were directly correlated with IBA1 and PECAM1 and inversely with CALB1. Additionally, the expression levels of CHI3L2, PECAM1, and CALB1 but not of IBA1 were sex-depended. By stratifying the samples according to age and sex, correlation differences emerged between the expression levels of CHI3L2, IBA1, PECAM1, and CALB1 and the age of NDHC subjects and AD patients. CHI3L2 represents a promising gene potentially involved in the key processes underlying Alzheimer’s disease. Its expression in the brains of sex-conditioned AD patients opens up new possible sex therapeutic strategies aimed at controlling imbalance in disease progression.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">To explore plasma protein panels as potential biomarkers to screen for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among elderly Chinese individuals with different educational backgrounds. Forty-four illiterate, 36 lower education (1–6 years), and 55 higher education (7 years or more) elderly individuals were included in the present study. Among all subjects, 67 were healthy individuals and 68 were diagnosed with MCI. Fifty plasma proteins in blood samples collected from these subjects were analyzed via the Luminex assay. Binary logistic regression was utilized to explore diagnostic models for MCI among the three educational subgroups. Then, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were conducted for the clinical validity of the MCI models. Among the analyzed proteins, clusterin was used in the model of MCI among the total sample with a sensitivity (se) of 67.6%, a specificity (sp) of 59.7%, and a classification rate of 63.68%. The MCI model for the illiterate group included cystatin C, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and apolipoprotein A-I (se: 71.4%, sp.: 82.6%, accuracy: 77.25%). The sensitivity, specificity, and classification rate of the diagnostic model of MCI in elderly adults with lower education (human serum albumin) were each 75.0%. Additionally, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy rate of the diagnostic model for MCI elderly individuals with higher education (alpha-acid glycoprotein + soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 + pancreatic polypeptide) were 77.8%, 89.3%, and 83.60%, respectively. The performance of diagnostic models for MCI based on different educational levels is superior to that of diagnostic models for MCI without grouping by educational level.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Recent studies have shown contribution of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the pathogenesis of immune-related disorders including multiple sclerosis (MS). Based on the role of these transcripts in the regulation of immune response, peripheral levels of lncRNAs can reflect the level of immune activation. In the present study, we quantified expression of four lncRNAs namely <em class="a-plus-plus">SPRY4-IT1</em>, <em class="a-plus-plus">HOXA-AS2</em>, <em class="a-plus-plus">LINC-ROR</em>, and <em class="a-plus-plus">MEG3</em> in venous blood of MS patients and controls using quantitative real-time PCR method. Relative expressions of <em class="a-plus-plus">SPRY4-IT1</em>, <em class="a-plus-plus">HOXA-AS2</em>, <em class="a-plus-plus">LINC-ROR</em>, and <em class="a-plus-plus">MEG3</em> were significantly lower in female MS patients compared with female healthy subjects. For <em class="a-plus-plus">MEG3</em>, this pattern of expression was also observed in male subjects. However, for other lncRNAs, no significant difference was detected between male patients and male controls. Expression of <em class="a-plus-plus">HOXA-AS2</em> was correlated with progression index (<em class="a-plus-plus">r</em> = 0.36, <em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> &lt; 0.001). Besides, there was a significant correlation between expression of this lncRNA and expression of <em class="a-plus-plus">LINC-ROR</em> in MS patients (<em class="a-plus-plus">r</em> = 0.44, <em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> &lt; 0.0001). There was no other correlation between expression of lncRNAs and clinical data in MS patients. In control group, expressions of none of lncRNAs were correlated with age of persons. Notably, significant correlations were demonstrated between expression levels of all lncRNAs in healthy subjects with <em class="a-plus-plus">r</em> values ranging from 0.23 to 0.42. The current investigation shows dysregulation of lncRNAs in MS patients in a sex-specific manner and warrants further studies to unravel the clinical and therapeutic implications of such dysregulation.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most serious brain tumor and shows a high rate of drug resistance. Wnt signaling is a very important pathway in GBM that can activate/inhibit other pathways, such as apoptosis and autophagy. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of a combination of temozolomide (TMZ) plus curcumin or nanomicellar-curcumin on the inhibition of GBM growth in vitro, via effects on autophagy, apoptosis, and the Wnt signaling pathway. Two concentrations of curcumin and nanomicellar-curcumin (i.e., 20 μM and 50 μM) alone, and in combination with TMZ (50 μM) were used to induce cytotoxicity in the U87 GBM cell line. Wnt signaling–, autophagy-, and apoptosis-related genes were assessed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blots. All treatments (except 20 μM curcumin alone) significantly decreased the viability of U87 cells compared to controls. Curcumin (50 μM), nanomicellar-curcumin alone and in combination with TMZ significantly decreased the invasion and migration of U87 cells. Autophagy-related proteins (Beclin 1, LC3-I, LC3-II) were significantly increased. Apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2 and caspase 8) were also significantly increased, while Bax protein was significantly decreased. The expression levels of Wnt pathway–associated genes (β-catenin, cyclin D1, Twist, and ZEB1) were significantly reduced.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Serine Incorporator 2 (SERINC2) is a transmembrane protein that incorporates serine into membrane lipids. The function of SERINC2 in tumors has been reported, but the role of SERINC2 in gliomas is not fully understood. RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (530 cases of low-grade glioma (LGG) and 173 cases of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)) and microarray data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (Accession No. GSE16011, 284 cases gliomas were included) were acquired. Bioinformatics analysis was performed as the primary method to examine the function of SERINC2 and its correlated genes in glioma. SERINC2 was highly expressed in GBM compared with LGG and normal brain tissues. Elevated SERINC2 expression predicted shorter 5-, 10-, and 15-year overall survival (OS) of LGG patients and isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH-1) mutation-type LGG patients but had no effect on the OS of GBM patients. Cox regression analysis showed that SERINC2 was an independent factor in LGG OS. Methylation analysis found that 13 CpG methylation sites (methylation450k) correlated with SERINC2 expression in LGG. The mRNA expression level of SERINC2 was significant lower in the DNA deletion group than in the intact and amplification groups. A total of 390 copositive and 244 conegative correlation genes with SERINC2 were obtained from LGG in TCGA-LGG and GSE16011. Gene ontology (GO) category and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses showed that the copositive correlation genes were primarily enriched in the mitotic process and cell cycle. Combining the results from the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of SERINC2 correlation genes and CytoHubba led to the selection of 10 hub genes (CDC20, FN1, AURKB, AURKA, KIF2C, BIRC5, CCNB2, UBE2C, CCNA2, and CENPE). OncoLnc analysis confirmed that high expression levels of these hub genes were associated with poor OS in LGG. Our results suggested that aberrant SERINC2 expression existed in glioma and that its expression might be a potential prognostic marker in LGG patients. CDC20, FN1, AURKB, AURKA, KIF2C, BIRC5, CCNB2, UBE2C, CCNA2, and CENPE may be potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for LGG.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive and deadly malignancies with a very poor prognosis. Pancreatic cancer-induced visceral pain is very common and is generally presented among the initial symptoms in patients; such pain is strongly associated with poor quality of life, impaired functional activity, and decreased survival. However, the principal neurobiological mechanisms of pain caused by pancreatic cancer have not been fully elucidated. Accumulating studies have shown that miRNAs play a major role in chronic pain by suppressing key molecules involved in nociception. In the present study, we report that microRNA (miR)-330 is highly expressed in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) of nude mice with pancreatic cancer pain. Mimicking pancreatic carcinoma-induced SDH miR-330 upregulation by microinjection of miR-330 mimic into the SDH significantly induced abdominal mechanical allodynia in normal nude mice. Additionally, we found that the expression of GABA<sub class="a-plus-plus">B</sub>R2 was significantly decreased in the SDH of nude mice with pancreatic cancer pain and was regulated directly by miR-330 both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-330 rescued the expression of GABA<sub class="a-plus-plus">B</sub>R2 and alleviated pancreatic carcinoma-induced abdominal pain hypersensitivity in nude mice with pancreatic carcinoma. These results show that miR-330 participates in the genesis of pancreatic carcinoma-induced pain hypersensitivity by inhibiting GABA<sub class="a-plus-plus">B</sub>R2 expression in the SDH and might be a potential therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer pain.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most prevalent representation of dementia, is a neurodegenerative disease resulting from the degenerative disturbance of the central nervous system. Previous studies have indicated that miR-107 is reduced in the brain neocortex of patients with AD; however, its underlying mechanism is not clear. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore the question of whether miR-107 participates in AD development. The study confirmed that the miR-107 expression levels were dramatically decreased in patients with AD and in beta-amyloid (Aβ) (Aβ)-treated SH-SY5Y cells compared with control groups. Upregulation of miR-107 reversed the inhibitory role of Aβ on cell proliferation and viability. In addition, miR-107 upregulation also ameliorated the Aβ-induced inflammation and apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, using bioinformatic prediction, dual-luciferase reporter assay (DLRA), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and Western blot (WB), miR-107 was confirmed to reduce the expression level of FGF7, and it subsequently deactivated the FGFR2/PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover, FGF7 overexpression counteracted the role of miR-107 in the viability, proliferation, inflammation, and apoptosis of Aβ-induced SH-SY5Y cells.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is the second most common type of dementia that accounts for 15 to 30%. To date, VCI still lacks an effective therapeutic strategy and an objective diagnostic tool. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that control gene expression at the post-translational level, playing an essential role in the pathogenesis of VCI. Moreover, accumulating evidence has indicated that miRNAs could be used as therapeutic strategies and diagnostic biomarkers of diseases. In this review, we summarize various mechanisms of miRNA-based therapeutics and candidate miRNAs for clinical diagnosis in VCI. Results showed that miRNAs participate in VCI via different mechanisms, including neuronal death, inflammation, oxidative stress, blood-brain barrier permeability, and synaptic translation. Circulating miRNAs of VCI have been detected in serum, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid with various diagnostic power. Taking together, miRNAs are a potential biomarker for being a therapeutic agent and a diagnostic tool of VCI.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Ethanol exposure to the fetus during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). These disorders vary in severity, can affect multiple organ systems, and can lead to lifelong disabilities. Damage to the central nervous system (CNS) is common in FASD, and can result in altered behavior and cognition. The incidence of FASD is alarmingly high, resulting in significant personal and societal costs. There are no cures for FASD. Alcohol can directly alter the function of neurons in the developing CNS. In addition, ethanol can alter the function of CNS glial cells including microglia and astrocytes which normally maintain homeostasis in the CNS. These glial cells can function as resident immune cells in the CNS to protect against pathogens and other insults. However, activation of glia can also damage CNS cells and lead to aberrant CNS function. Ethanol exposure to the developing brain can result in the activation of glia and neuroinflammation, which may contribute to the pathology associated with FASD. This suggests that anti‐inflammatory agents may be effective in the treatment of FASD.</p>

<p>When employing non-linear methods to characterise complex systems, it is
important to determine to what extent they are capturing genuine non-linear
phenomena that could not be assessed by simpler spectral methods. Specifically,
we are concerned with the problem of quantifying spectral and phasic effects on
an observed difference in a non-linear feature between two systems (or two
states of the same system). Here we derive, from a sequence of null models, a
decomposition of the difference in an observable into spectral, phasic, and
spectrum-phase interaction components. Our approach makes no assumptions about
the structure of the data and adds nuance to a wide range of time series
analyses.

<p>Weight initialization is critical in being able to successfully train
artificial neural networks (ANNs), and even more so for recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) which can easily suffer from vanishing and exploding gradients.
In neuroevolution, where evolutionary algorithms are applied to neural
architecture search, weights typically need to be initialized at three
different times: when initial genomes (ANN architectures) are created at the
beginning of the search, when offspring genomes are generated by crossover, and
when new nodes or edges are created during mutation. This work explores the
difference between using Xavier, Kaiming, and uniform random weight
initialization methods, as well as novel Lamarckian weight inheritance methods
for initializing new weights during crossover and mutation operations. These
are examined using the Evolutionary eXploration of Augmenting Memory Models
(EXAMM) neuroevolution algorithm, which is capable of evolving RNNs with a
variety of modern memory cells (e.g., LSTM, GRU, MGU, UGRNN and Delta-RNN
cells) as well recurrent connections with varying time skips through a high
performance island based distributed evolutionary algorithm. Results show that
with statistical significance, utilizing the Lamarckian strategies outperforms
Kaiming, Xavier and uniform random weight initialization, and can speed
neuroevolution by requiring less backpropagation epochs to be evaluated for
each generated RNN.

<p>Black-box artificial intelligence (AI) induction methods such as deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) are increasingly being used to find optimal
policies for a given control task. Although policies represented using a
black-box AI are capable of efficiently executing the underlying control task
and achieving optimal closed-loop performance -- controlling the agent from
initial time step until the successful termination of an episode, the developed
control rules are often complex and neither interpretable nor explainable. In
this paper, we use a recently proposed nonlinear decision-tree (NLDT) approach
to find a hierarchical set of control rules in an attempt to maximize the
open-loop performance for approximating and explaining the pre-trained
black-box DRL (oracle) agent using the labelled state-action dataset. Recent
advances in nonlinear optimization approaches using evolutionary computation
facilitates finding a hierarchical set of nonlinear control rules as a function
of state variables using a computationally fast bilevel optimization procedure
at each node of the proposed NLDT. Additionally, we propose a re-optimization
procedure for enhancing closed-loop performance of an already derived NLDT. We
evaluate our proposed methodologies on four different control problems having
two to four discrete actions. In all these problems our proposed approach is
able to find simple and interpretable rules involving one to four non-linear
terms per rule, while simultaneously achieving on par closed-loop performance
when compared to a trained black-box DRL agent. The obtained results are
inspiring as they suggest the replacement of complicated black-box DRL policies
involving thousands of parameters (making them non-interpretable) with simple
interpretable policies. Results are encouraging and motivating to pursue
further applications of proposed approach in solving more complex control
tasks.

<p>Deeply-learned planning methods are often based on learning representations
that are optimized for unrelated tasks. For example, they might be trained on
reconstructing the environment. These representations are then combined with
predictor functions for simulating rollouts to navigate the environment. We
find this principle of learning representations unsatisfying and propose to
learn them such that they are directly optimized for the task at hand: to be
maximally predictable for the predictor function. This results in
representations that are by design optimal for the downstream task of planning,
where the learned predictor function is used as a forward model.
</p>
<p>To this end, we propose a new way of jointly learning this representation
along with the prediction function, a system we dub Latent Representation
Prediction Network (LARP). The prediction function is used as a forward model
for search on a graph in a viewpoint-matching task and the representation
learned to maximize predictability is found to outperform a pre-trained
representation. Our approach is shown to be more sample-efficient than standard
reinforcement learning methods and our learned representation transfers
successfully to dissimilar objects.

<p>Continuous-depth learning has recently emerged as a novel perspective on deep
learning, improving performance in tasks related to dynamical systems and
density estimation. Core to these approaches is the neural differential
equation, whose forward passes are the solutions of an initial value problem
parametrized by a neural network. Unlocking the full potential of
continuous-depth models requires a different set of software tools, due to
peculiar differences compared to standard discrete neural networks, e.g
inference must be carried out via numerical solvers. We introduce TorchDyn, a
PyTorch library dedicated to continuous-depth learning, designed to elevate
neural differential equations to be as accessible as regular plug-and-play deep
learning primitives. This objective is achieved by identifying and subdividing
different variants into common essential components, which can be combined and
freely repurposed to obtain complex compositional architectures. TorchDyn
further offers step-by-step tutorials and benchmarks designed to guide
researchers and contributors.

<p>With growing model complexity, mapping Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-based
applications to tile-based neuromorphic hardware is becoming increasingly
challenging. This is because the synaptic storage resources on a tile, viz. a
crossbar, can accommodate only a fixed number of pre-synaptic connections per
post-synaptic neuron. For complex SNN models that have many pre-synaptic
connections per neuron, some connections may need to be pruned after training
to fit onto the tile resources, leading to a loss in model quality, e.g.,
accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel unrolling technique that decomposes
a neuron function with many pre-synaptic connections into a sequence of
homogeneous neural units, where each neural unit is a function computation
node, with two pre-synaptic connections. This spatial decomposition technique
significantly improves crossbar utilization and retains all pre-synaptic
connections, resulting in no loss of the model quality derived from connection
pruning. We integrate the proposed technique within an existing SNN mapping
framework and evaluate it using machine learning applications on the DYNAP-SE
state-of-the-art neuromorphic hardware. Our results demonstrate an average 60%
lower crossbar requirement, 9x higher synapse utilization, 62% lower wasted
energy on the hardware, and between 0.8% and 4.6% increase in model quality.

<p>Neurons are connected to other neurons by axons and dendrites that conduct
signals with finite velocities, resulting in delays between the firing of a
neuron and the arrival of the resultant impulse at other neurons. Since delays
greatly complicate the analytical treatment and interpretation of models, they
are usually neglected or taken to be uniform, leading to a lack in the
comprehension of the effects of delays in neural systems. This paper shows that
heterogeneous transmission delays make small groups of neurons respond
selectively to inputs with differing frequency spectra. By studying a single
integrate-and-fire neuron receiving correlated time-shifted inputs, it is shown
how the frequency response is linked to both the strengths and delay times of
the afferent connections. The results show that incorporating delays alters the
functioning of neural networks, and changes the effect that neural connections
and synaptic strengths have.

<p>Deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) show promising performance on a range of
graph tasks, yet at present are costly to run and lack many of the
optimisations applied to DNNs. We show, for the first time, how to
systematically quantise GNNs with minimal or no loss in performance using
Network Architecture Search (NAS). We define the possible quantisation search
space of GNNs. The proposed novel NAS mechanism, named Low Precision Graph NAS
(LPGNAS), constrains both architecture and quantisation choices to be
differentiable. LPGNAS learns the optimal architecture coupled with the best
quantisation strategy for different components in the GNN automatically using
back-propagation in a single search round. On eight different datasets, solving
the task of classifying unseen nodes in a graph, LPGNAS generates quantised
models with significant reductions in both model and buffer sizes but with
similar accuracy to manually designed networks and other NAS results. In
particular, on the Pubmed dataset, LPGNAS shows a better size-accuracy Pareto
frontier compared to seven other manual and searched baselines, offering a 2.3
times reduction in model size but a 0.4% increase in accuracy when compared to
the best NAS competitor. Finally, from our collected quantisation statistics on
a wide range of datasets, we suggest a W4A8 (4-bit weights, 8-bit activations)
quantisation strategy might be the bottleneck for naive GNN quantisations.

<p>Robots are ideal for open-pit mining on the Moon as its a dull, dirty, and
dangerous task. The challenge is to scale up productivity with an
ever-increasing number of robots. This paper presents a novel method for
developing scalable controllers for use in multi-robot excavation and
site-preparation scenarios. The controller starts with a blank slate and does
not require human-authored operations scripts nor detailed modeling of the
kinematics and dynamics of the excavator. The 'Artificial Neural Tissue' (ANT)
architecture is used as a control system for autonomous robot teams to perform
resource gathering. This control architecture combines a variable-topology
neural-network structure with a coarse-coding strategy that permits specialized
areas to develop in the tissue. Our work in this field shows that fleets of
autonomous decentralized robots have an optimal operating density. Too few
robots result in insufficient labor, while too many robots cause antagonism,
where the robots undo each other's work and are stuck in gridlock. In this
paper, we explore the use of templates and task cues to improve group
performance further and minimize antagonism. Our results show light beacons and
task cues are effective in sparking new and innovative solutions at improving
robot performance when placed under stressful situations such as severe
time-constraint.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09081">Closed-loop spiking control on a neuromorphic processor implemented on the iCub. (arXiv:2009.09081v1 [cs.ET])</a></h4>

<p>Despite neuromorphic engineering promises the deployment of low latency,
adaptive and low power systems that can lead to the design of truly autonomous
artificial agents, the development of a fully neuromorphic artificial agent is
still missing. While neuromorphic sensing and perception, as well as
decision-making systems, are now mature, the control and actuation part is
lagging behind. In this paper, we present a closed-loop motor controller
implemented on mixed-signal analog-digital neuromorphic hardware using a
spiking neural network. The network performs a proportional control action by
encoding target, feedback, and error signals using a spiking relational
network. It continuously calculates the error through a connectivity pattern,
which relates the three variables by means of feed-forward connections.
Recurrent connections within each population are used to speed up the
convergence, decrease the effect of mismatch and improve selectivity. The
neuromorphic motor controller is interfaced with the iCub robot simulator. We
tested our spiking P controller in a single joint control task, specifically
for the robot head yaw. The spiking controller sends the target positions,
reads the motor state from its encoder, and sends back the motor commands to
the joint. The performance of the spiking controller is tested in a step
response experiment and in a target pursuit task. In this work, we optimize the
network structure to make it more robust to noisy inputs and device mismatch,
which leads to better control performances.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12126">A Survey on Dragonfly Algorithm and its Applications in Engineering. (arXiv:2002.12126v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>Dragonfly algorithm (DA) is one of the most recently developed heuristic
optimization algorithms by Mirjalili in 2016. It is now one of the most widely
used algorithms. In some cases, it outperforms the most popular algorithms.
However, this algorithm is not far from obstacles when it comes to complex
optimization problems. In this work, along with the strengths of the algorithm
in solving real-world optimization problems, the weakness of the algorithm to
optimize complex optimization problems is addressed. This survey presents a
comprehensive investigation of DA in the engineering area. First, an overview
of the algorithm is discussed. Additionally, the different variants of the
algorithm are addressed too. The combined versions of the DA with other
techniques and the modifications that have been done to make the algorithm work
better are shown. Besides, a survey on applications in engineering area that
used DA is offered. The algorithm is compared with some other metaheuristic
algorithms to demonstrate its ability to optimize problems comparing to the
others. The results of the algorithm from the works that utilized the DA in the
literature and the results of the benchmark functions showed that in comparison
with some other algorithms DA has an excellent performance, especially for
small to medium problems. Moreover, the bottlenecks of the algorithm and some
future trends are discussed. Authors conduct this research with the hope of
offering beneficial information about the DA to the researchers who want to
study the algorithm and utilize it to optimize engineering problems.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03983">Interaction-Transformation Evolutionary Algorithm for Symbolic Regression. (arXiv:1902.03983v4 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>The Interaction-Transformation (IT) is a new representation for Symbolic
Regression that restricts the search space into simpler, but expressive,
function forms. This representation has the advantage of creating a smoother
search space unlike the space generated by Expression Trees, the common
representation used in Genetic Programming. This paper introduces an
Evolutionary Algorithm capable of evolving a population of IT expressions
supported only by the mutation operator. The results show that this
representation is capable of finding better approximations to real-world data
sets when compared to traditional approaches and a state-of-the-art Genetic
Programming algorithm.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59422">Homeostatic plasticity in the retina is associated with maintenance of night vision during retinal degenerative disease</a></h4>

Neuronal plasticity of the inner retina has been observed in response to photoreceptor degeneration. Typically, this phenomenon has been considered maladaptive and may preclude vision restoration in the blind. However, several recent studies utilizing triggered photoreceptor ablation have shown adaptive responses in bipolar cells expected to support normal vision. Whether such homeostatic plasticity occurs during progressive photoreceptor degenerative disease to help maintain normal visual behavior is unknown. We addressed this issue in an established mouse model of Retinitis Pigmentosa caused by the P23H mutation in rhodopsin. We show robust modulation of the retinal transcriptomic network, reminiscent of the neurodevelopmental state, and potentiation of rod – rod bipolar cell signaling following rod photoreceptor degeneration. Additionally, we found highly sensitive night vision in P23H mice even when more than half of the rod photoreceptors were lost. These results suggest retinal adaptation leading to persistent visual function during photoreceptor degenerative disease.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58142">Spectral clustering of risk score trajectories stratifies sepsis patients by clinical outcome and interventions received</a></h4>

Sepsis is not a monolithic disease, but a loose collection of symptoms with diverse outcomes. Thus, stratification and subtyping of sepsis patients is of great importance. We examine the temporal evolution of patient state using our previously-published method for computing risk of transition from sepsis into septic shock. Risk trajectories diverge into four clusters following early prediction of septic shock, stratifying by outcome: the highest-risk and lowest-risk groups have a 76.5% and 10.4% prevalence of septic shock, and 43% and 18% mortality, respectively. These clusters differ also in treatments received and median time to shock onset. Analyses reveal the existence of a rapid (30–60 min) transition in risk at the time of threshold crossing. We hypothesize that this transition occurs as a result of the failure of compensatory biological systems to cope with infection, resulting in a bifurcation of low to high risk. Such a collapse, we believe, represents the true onset of septic shock. Thus, this rapid elevation in risk represents a potential new data-driven definition of septic shock.

Female mosquitoes need a blood meal to reproduce, and in obtaining this essential nutrient they transmit deadly pathogens. Although crucial for the spread of mosquito-borne diseases, blood feeding remains poorly understood due to technological limitations. Indeed, studies often expose human subjects to assess biting behavior. Here, we present the biteOscope, a device that attracts mosquitoes to a host mimic which they bite to obtain an artificial blood meal. The host mimic is transparent, allowing high-resolution imaging of the feeding mosquito. Using machine learning we extract detailed behavioral statistics describing the locomotion, pose, biting, and feeding dynamics of <i>Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, Anopheles stephensi,</i> and <i>Anopheles coluzzii</i>. In addition to characterizing behavioral patterns, we discover that the common insect repellent DEET repels <i>Anopheles coluzzii</i> upon contact with their legs. The biteOscope provides a new perspective on mosquito blood feeding, enabling the high-throughput quantitative characterization of this lethal behavior.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56686">Nutrient status shapes selfish mitochondrial genome dynamics across different levels of selection</a></h4>

Cooperation and cheating are widespread evolutionary strategies. While cheating confers an advantage to individual entities within a group, competition between groups favors cooperation. Selfish or cheater mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) proliferates within hosts while being selected against at the level of host fitness. How does environment shape cheater dynamics across different selection levels? Focusing on food availability, we address this question using heteroplasmic <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We find that the proliferation of selfish mtDNA within hosts depends on nutrient status stimulating mtDNA biogenesis in the developing germline. Interestingly, mtDNA biogenesis is not sufficient for this proliferation, which also requires the stress-response transcription factor FoxO/DAF-16. At the level of host fitness, FoxO/DAF-16 also prevents food scarcity from accelerating the selection against selfish mtDNA. This suggests that the ability to cope with nutrient stress can promote host tolerance of cheaters. Our study delineates environmental effects on selfish mtDNA dynamics at different levels of selection.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55744">Host-induced spermidine production in motile <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> triggers phagocytic uptake</a></h4>

Exploring the complexity of host-pathogen communication is vital to understand why&lt;br /&gt; microbes persist within a host, while others are cleared. Here, we employed a Dual-sequencing approach to unravel conversational turn-taking of dynamic host-pathogen communications. We demonstrate that upon hitting a host cell, motile <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> induce a specific gene expression program. This results in the expression of spermidine on the surface, which specifically activates the PIP<sub>3</sub>-pathway to induce phagocytic uptake into primary or immortalized murine cells. Non-motile bacteria are more immunogenic due to a lower expression of <i>arnT </i>upon host cell contact, but do not produce spermidine and are phagocytosed less. We demonstrate that not only the presence of pathogen inherent molecular patterns induces immune responses, but that bacterial motility is linked to a host-cell induced expression of additional immune modulators. Our results emphasize on the value of integrating microbiological and immunological findings to unravel complex and dynamic host-pathogen interactions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52371">Tuning movement for sensing in an uncertain world</a></h4>

While animals track or search for targets, sensory organs make small unexplained movements on top of the primary task-related motions. While multiple theories for these movements exist—in that they support infotaxis, gain adaptation, spectral whitening, and high-pass filtering—predicted trajectories show poor fit to measured trajectories. We propose a new theory for these movements called energy-constrained proportional betting, where the probability of moving to a location is proportional to an expectation of how informative it will be balanced against the movement’s predicted energetic cost. Trajectories generated in this way show good agreement with measured trajectories of fish tracking an object using electrosense, a mammal and an insect localizing an odor source, and a moth tracking a flower using vision. Our theory unifies the metabolic cost of motion with information theory. It predicts sense organ movements in animals and can prescribe sensor motion for robots to enhance performance.

<p>by Mikael Jagan, Michelle S. deJonge, Olga Krylova, David J. D. Earn</p>

Compartmental epidemic models have been used extensively to study the historical spread of infectious diseases and to inform strategies for future control. A critical parameter of any such model is the transmission rate. Temporal variation in the transmission rate has a profound influence on disease spread. For this reason, estimation of time-varying transmission rates is an important step in identifying mechanisms that underlie patterns in observed disease incidence and mortality. Here, we present and test fast methods for reconstructing transmission rates from time series of reported incidence. Using simulated data, we quantify the sensitivity of these methods to parameters of the data-generating process and to mis-specification of input parameters by the user. We show that sensitivity to the user’s estimate of the initial number of susceptible individuals—considered to be a major limitation of similar methods—can be eliminated by an efficient, “peak-to-peak” iterative technique, which we propose. The method of transmission rate estimation that we advocate is extremely fast, for even the longest infectious disease time series that exist. It can be used independently or as a fast way to obtain better starting conditions for computationally expensive methods, such as iterated filtering and generalized profiling.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/i5KNomOoCiA" width="1" />

Highly coordinated water molecules are frequently an integral part of protein-protein and protein-ligand interfaces. We introduce an updated energy model that efficiently captures the energetic effects of these ordered water molecules on the surfaces of proteins. A two-stage method is developed in which polar groups arranged in geometries suitable for water placement are first identified, then a modified Monte Carlo simulation allows highly coordinated waters to be placed on the surface of a protein while simultaneously sampling amino acid side chain orientations. This “semi-explicit” water model is implemented in Rosetta and is suitable for both structure prediction and protein design. We show that our new approach and energy model yield significant improvements in native structure recovery of protein-protein and protein-ligand docking discrimination tests.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2TvV8In5LmU" width="1" />

The insular cortex (IC) participates in diverse complex brain functions, including social function, yet their cellular bases remain to be fully understood. Using microendoscopic calcium imaging of the agranular insular cortex (AI) in mice interacting with freely moving and restrained social targets, we identified 2 subsets of AI neurons—a larger fraction of “Social-ON” cells and a smaller fraction of “Social-OFF” cells—that change their activity in opposite directions during social exploration. Social-ON cells included those that represented social investigation independent of location and consisted of multiple subsets, each of which was preferentially active during exploration under a particular behavioral state or with a particular target of physical contact. These results uncover a previously unknown function of AI neurons that may act to monitor the ongoing status of social exploration while an animal interacts with unfamiliar conspecifics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/fP2gnP6B3TE" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The parabrachial nucleus (PB) is a complex structure located at the junction of the midbrain and hindbrain. Its neurons have diverse genetic profiles and influence a variety of homeostatic functions. While its cytoarchitecture and overall efferent projections are known, we lack comprehensive information on the projection patterns of specific neuronal subtypes in the PB. In this study, we compared the projection patterns of glutamatergic neurons here with a subpopulation expressing the transcription factor <i>Foxp2</i> and a further subpopulation expressing the neuropeptide <i>Pdyn</i>. To do this, we injected an AAV into the PB region to deliver a Cre‐dependent anterograde tracer (synaptophysin‐mCherry) in three different strains of Cre‐driver mice. We then analyzed 147 neuroanatomical regions for labeled boutons in every brain (<i>n</i> = 11). Overall, glutamatergic neurons in the PB region project to a wide variety of sites in the cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala, diencephalon, and brainstem. <i>Foxp2</i> and <i>Pdyn</i> subpopulations project heavily to the hypothalamus, but not to the cortex, basal forebrain, or amygdala. Among the few differences between <i>Foxp2</i> and <i>Pdyn</i> cases was a notable lack of <i>Pdyn</i> projections to the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. Our results indicate that genetic identity determines connectivity (and therefore, function), providing a framework for mapping all PB output projections based on the genetic identity of its neurons. Using genetic markers to systematically classify PB neurons and their efferent projections will enhance the translation of research findings from experimental animals to humans.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Space and time are both essential features of episodic memory, for which the hippocampus is critical (Howard &amp; Eichenbaum, 2015). Spatial tasks have been used effectively to study the behavioral relevance of place cells. However, the behavioral paradigms utilized for the study of time cells have not used time duration as a variable that animals need to be aware of to solve the task. Therefore, the behavioral relevance of this cell firing is unclear. In order to directly study the role of the hippocampus in processing elapsed time, we created a novel time duration discrimination task. Rats learned to make a decision to turn left or right depending on the preceding tone duration (10 s, left turn; 20 s, right turn). Once the rats reached criterion performance of 90% correct on two out of three consecutive days, they received either an excitotoxic hippocampal lesion or a sham‐lesion surgery. After recovery, rats were tested to determine hippocampal involvement in discriminating time duration. Rats with hippocampal lesions performed at chance level on their first testing day postlesion, and they were impaired relative to the sham‐lesioned rats. Although the hippocampal‐lesioned rats began discriminating at above chance level, their performance never returned to criterion even with 50 days of postoperative testing. Furthermore, while sham rats showed no difference in the number of errors they made on 10‐ versus 20‐s delay trials, hippocampal lesion rats similarly improved their performance under the 10‐s delay condition, but not under the 20‐s delay condition. Results indicate that hippocampal lesions resulted in a selective impairment in discriminating elapsed time only during the longer delay trials. The implications of these results are discussed in relation to the limits of working‐memory capacity and to the role of sustained hippocampal time cell activity in memory performance depending on the perceived relevance of the delay period.</p>

<p>Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a neuropeptide produced in various hypothalamic nuclei including the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, the supraoptic nucleus, and the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The <i>AVP</i> gene encodes pre‐pro‐AVP that comprises the signal peptide, AVP, neurophysin II (NPII), and the glycopeptide copeptin. Here, we report that there is a marked species difference between rodents and primates in the processing of the pro‐AVP precursor and production of free copeptin, and that the processing may not be the same in different groups of pro‐AVP‐expressing cells within a given species.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is synthesized in parvocellular‐ and magnocellular neuroendocrine neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Whereas magnocellular AVP neurons project primarily to the posterior pituitary, parvocellular AVP neurons project to the median eminence (ME) and to extrahypothalamic areas. The <i>AVP</i> gene encodes pre‐pro‐AVP that comprises the signal peptide, AVP, neurophysin (NPII), and a copeptin glycopeptide. In the present study, we used an N‐terminal copeptin antiserum to examine copeptin expression in magnocellular and parvocellular neurons in the hypothalamus in the mouse, rat, and macaque monkey. Although magnocellular NPII‐expressing neurons exhibited strong N‐terminal copeptin immunoreactivity in all three species, a great majority (~90%) of parvocellular neurons that expressed NPII was devoid of copeptin immunoreactivity in the mouse, and in approximately half (~53%) of them in the rat, whereas in monkey hypothalamus, virtually all NPII‐immunoreactive parvocellular neurons contained strong copeptin immunoreactivity. Immunoelectron microscopy in the mouse clearly showed copeptin‐immunoreactivity co‐localized with NPII‐immunoreactivity in neurosecretory vesicles in the internal layer of the ME and posterior pituitary, but not in the external layer of the ME. Intracerebroventricular administration of a prohormone convertase inhibitor, hexa‐<span class="smallCaps">d</span>‐arginine amide resulted in a marked reduction of copeptin‐immunoreactivity in the NPII‐immunoreactive magnocellular PVN neurons in the mouse, suggesting that low protease activity and incomplete processing of pro‐AVP could explain the disproportionally low levels of N‐terminal copeptin expression in rodent AVP (NPII)‐expressing parvocellular neurons. Physiologic and phylogenetic aspects of copeptin expression among neuroendocrine neurons require further exploration.</p>

<p>A comprehensive look at the whole brain serotonergic projection using the SERT‐EGFP transgenic mice. The area‐specific pattern and rostro‐caudal change from the raphe nuclei in brainstem were mapped.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>It is well established that serotonergic fibers distribute throughout the brain. Abnormal densities or patterns of serotonergic fibers have been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. Although many classical studies have examined the distribution pattern of serotonergic fibers, most of them were either limited to specific brain areas or had limitations in demonstrating the fine axonal morphology. In this study, we utilize male mice expressing green fluorescence protein under the serotonin transporter (SERT) promoter to map the topography of serotonergic fibers across the rostro‐caudal extent of each brain area. We demonstrate previously unreported regional density and fine‐grained anatomy of serotonergic fibers. Our findings include: (a) SERT fibers distribute abundantly in the thalamic nuclei close to the midline and dorsolateral areas, in most of the hypothalamic nuclei with few exceptions such as the median eminence and arcuate nuclei, and within the basal amygdaloid complex and lateral septal nuclei, (b) the source fibers of innervation of the hippocampus traverse through the septal nuclei before reaching its destination, (c) unique, filamentous type of straight terminal fibers within the nucleus accumbens, (d) laminar pattern of innervation in the hippocampus, olfactory bulb and cortex with heterogenicity in innervation density among the layers, (e) cortical labeling density gradually decreases rostro‐caudally, (f) fibers traverse and distribute mostly within the gray matter, leaving the white fiber bundles uninnervated, and (g) most of the highly labeled nuclei and cortical areas have predominant anatomical connection to limbic structures. In conclusion, we provide novel, regionally specific insights on the distribution map of serotonergic fibers using transgenic mouse.</p>

<p>We propose PESA, a novel approach combining Particle Swarm Optimisation
(PSO), Evolution Strategy (ES), and Simulated Annealing (SA) in a hybrid
Algorithm, inspired from reinforcement learning. PESA hybridizes the three
algorithms by storing their solutions in a shared replay memory. Next, PESA
applies prioritized replay to redistribute data between the three algorithms in
frequent form based on their fitness and priority values, which significantly
enhances sample diversity and algorithm exploration. Additionally, greedy
replay is used implicitly within SA to improve PESA exploitation close to the
end of evolution. The validation against 12 high-dimensional continuous
benchmark functions shows superior performance by PESA against standalone ES,
PSO, and SA, under similar initial starting points, hyperparameters, and number
of generations. PESA shows much better exploration behaviour, faster
convergence, and ability to find the global optima compared to its standalone
counterparts. Given the promising performance, PESA can offer an efficient
optimisation option, especially after it goes through additional
multiprocessing improvements to handle complex and expensive fitness functions.

<p>Realization of deep learning with coherent diffraction has achieved
remarkable development nowadays, which benefits on the fact that matrix
multiplication can be optically executed in parallel as well as with little
power consumption. Coherent optical field propagated in the form of
complex-value entity can be manipulated into a task-oriented output with
statistical inference. In this paper, we present a unitary learning protocol on
deep diffractive neural network, meeting the physical unitary prior in coherent
diffraction. Unitary learning is a backpropagation serving to unitary weights
update through the gradient translation between Euclidean and Riemannian space.
The temporal-space evolution characteristic in unitary learning is formulated
and elucidated. Particularly a compatible condition on how to select the
nonlinear activations in complex space is unveiled, encapsulating the
fundamental sigmoid, tanh and quasi-ReLu in complex space. As a preliminary
application, deep diffractive neural network with unitary learning is
tentatively implemented on the 2D classification and verification tasks.

<p>The recently proposed network model, Operational Neural Networks (ONNs), can
generalize the conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that are
homogenous only with a linear neuron model. As a heterogenous network model,
ONNs are based on a generalized neuron model that can encapsulate any set of
non-linear operators to boost diversity and to learn highly complex and
multi-modal functions or spaces with minimal network complexity and training
data. However, the default search method to find optimal operators in ONNs, the
so-called Greedy Iterative Search (GIS) method, usually takes several training
sessions to find a single operator set per layer. This is not only
computationally demanding, also the network heterogeneity is limited since the
same set of operators will then be used for all neurons in each layer. To
address this deficiency and exploit a superior level of heterogeneity, in this
study the focus is drawn on searching the best-possible operator set(s) for the
hidden neurons of the network based on the Synaptic Plasticity paradigm that
poses the essential learning theory in biological neurons. During training,
each operator set in the library can be evaluated by their synaptic plasticity
level, ranked from the worst to the best, and an elite ONN can then be
configured using the top ranked operator sets found at each hidden layer.
Experimental results over highly challenging problems demonstrate that the
elite ONNs even with few neurons and layers can achieve a superior learning
performance than GIS-based ONNs and as a result the performance gap over the
CNNs further widens.

<p>Single layer feedforward networks with random weights are successful in a
variety of classification and regression problems. These networks are known for
their non-iterative and fast training algorithms. A major drawback of these
networks is that they require a large number of hidden units. In this paper, we
propose the use of multi-activation hidden units. Such units increase the
number of tunable parameters and enable formation of complex decision surfaces,
without increasing the number of hidden units. We experimentally show that
multi-activation hidden units can be used either to improve the classification
accuracy, or to reduce computations.

<p>Most of the real world is governed by complex and chaotic dynamical systems.
All of these dynamical systems pose a challenge in modelling them using neural
networks. Currently, reservoir computing, which is a subset of recurrent neural
networks, is actively used to simulate complex dynamical systems. In this work,
a two dimensional activation function is proposed which includes an additional
temporal term to impart dynamic behaviour on its output. The inclusion of a
temporal term alters the fundamental nature of an activation function, it
provides capability to capture the complex dynamics of time series data without
relying on recurrent neural networks.

<p>Evolutionary methods are effective tools for obtaining high-quality results
when solving hard practical problems. Linkage learning may increase their
effectiveness. One of the state-of-the-art methods that employ linkage learning
is the Parameter-less Population Pyramid (P3). P3 is dedicated to solving
single-objective problems in discrete domains. Recent research shows that P3 is
highly competitive when addressing problems with so-called overlapping blocks,
which are typical for practical problems. In this paper, we consider a
multi-objective industrial process planning problem that arises from practice
and is NP-hard. To handle it, we propose a multi-objective version of P3. The
extensive research shows that our proposition outperforms the competing methods
for the considered practical problem and typical multi-objective benchmarks.

<p>With neural networks having demonstrated their versatility and benefits, the
need for their optimal performance is as prevalent as ever. A defining
characteristic, hyperparameters, can greatly affect its performance. Thus
engineers go through a process, tuning, to identify and implement optimal
hyperparameters. That being said, excess amounts of manual effort are required
for tuning network architectures, training configurations, and preprocessing
settings such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE). In this study, we propose an
automatic tuning method modeled after Darwin's Survival of the Fittest Theory
via a Genetic Algorithm (GA). Research results show that the proposed method, a
GA, outperforms a random selection of hyperparameters.

<p>We implemented two neural network based benchmark tasks on a prototype chip
of the second-generation SpiNNaker (SpiNNaker 2) neuromorphic system: keyword
spotting and adaptive robotic control. Keyword spotting is commonly used in
smart speakers to listen for wake words, and adaptive control is used in
robotic applications to adapt to unknown dynamics in an online fashion. We
highlight the benefit of a multiply accumulate (MAC) array in the SpiNNaker 2
prototype which is ordinarily used in rate-based machine learning networks when
employed in a neuromorphic, spiking context. In addition, the same benchmark
tasks have been implemented on the Loihi neuromorphic chip, giving a
side-by-side comparison regarding power consumption and computation time. While
Loihi shows better efficiency when less complicated vector-matrix
multiplication is involved, with the MAC array, the SpiNNaker 2 prototype shows
better efficiency when high dimensional vector-matrix multiplication is
involved.

<p>Statistical field theory captures collective non-equilibrium dynamics of

connectivity to implement a desired dynamics. We here show for an analytically
solvable network model that the effective action in statistical field theory is
identical to the rate function in large deviation theory; using field
theoretical methods we derive this rate function. It takes the form of a
Kullback-Leibler divergence and enables data-driven inference of model
parameters and Bayesian prediction of time series.

<p>The payload performance of conventional computing systems, from single
processors to supercomputers, reached its limits the nature enables. Both the
growing demand to cope with "big data" (based on, or assisted by, artificial
intelligence) and the interest in understanding the operation of our brain more
completely, stimulated the efforts to build biology-mimicking computing systems
from inexpensive conventional components and build different ("neuromorphic")
computing systems. On one side, those systems require an unusually large number
of processors, which introduces performance limitations and nonlinear scaling.
On the other side, the neuronal operation drastically differs from the
conventional workloads. The conventional computing (including both its
mathematical background and physical implementation) is based on assuming
instant interaction, while the biological neuronal systems have a
"spatiotemporal" behavior. This difference alone makes imitating biological
behavior in technical implementation hard. Besides, the recent issues in
computing called the attention to that the temporal behavior is a general
feature of computing systems, too. Some of their effects in both biological and
technical systems were already noticed. Nevertheless, handling of those issues
is incomplete/improper. Introducing temporal logic, based on the Minkowski
transform, gives quantitative insight into the operation of both kinds of
computing systems, furthermore provides a natural explanation of decades-old
empirical phenomena. Without considering their temporal behavior correctly,
neither effective implementation nor a true imitation of biological neural
systems are possible.

<p>The music signal comprises of different features like rhythm, timbre, melody,
harmony. Its impact on the human brain has been an exciting research topic for
the past several decades. Electroencephalography (EEG) signal enables
non-invasive measurement of brain activity. Leveraging the recent advancements
in deep learning, we proposed a novel approach for song identification using a
Convolution Neural network given the electroencephalography (EEG) responses. We
recorded the EEG signals from a group of 20 participants while listening to a
set of 12 song clips, each of approximately 2 minutes, that were presented in
random order. The repeating nature of Music is captured by a data slicing
approach considering brain signals of 1 second duration as representative of
each song clip. More specifically, we predict the song corresponding to one
second of EEG data when given as input rather than a complete two-minute
response. We have also discussed pre-processing steps to handle large
dimensions of a dataset and various CNN architectures. For all the experiments,
we have considered each participant's EEG response for each song in both train
and test data. We have obtained 84.96\% accuracy for the same. The performance
observed gives appropriate implication towards the notion that listening to a
song creates specific patterns in the brain, and these patterns vary from
person to person.

<p>In this work, we leverage ensemble learning as a tool for the creation of
faster, smaller, and more accurate deep learning models. We demonstrate that we
can jointly optimize for accuracy, inference time, and the number of parameters
by combining DNN classifiers. To achieve this, we combine multiple ensemble
strategies: bagging, boosting, and an ordered chain of classifiers. To reduce
the number of DNN ensemble evaluations during the search, we propose EARN, an
evolutionary approach that optimizes the ensemble according to three objectives
regarding the constraints specified by the user. We run EARN on 10 image

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08667">Event-based update of synapses in voltage-based learning rules. (arXiv:2009.08667v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Due to the point-like nature of neuronal spiking, efficient neural network
simulators often employ event-based simulation schemes for synapses. Yet many
types of synaptic plasticity rely on the membrane potential of the postsynaptic
cell as a third factor in addition to pre- and postsynaptic spike times.
Synapses therefore require continuous information to update their strength
which a priori necessitates a continuous update in a time-driven manner. The
latter hinders scaling of simulations to realistic cortical network sizes and
relevant time scales for learning. Here, we derive two efficient algorithms for
archiving postsynaptic membrane potentials, both compatible with modern
simulation engines based on event-based synapse updates. We theoretically
contrast the two algorithms with a time-driven synapse update scheme to analyze
advantages in terms of memory and computations. We further present a reference
implementation in the spiking neural network simulator NEST for two
prototypical voltage-based plasticity rules: the Clopath rule and the
Urbanczik-Senn rule. For both rules, the two event-based algorithms
significantly outperform the time-driven scheme. Depending on the amount of
data to be stored for plasticity, which heavily differs between the rules, a
strong performance increase can be achieved by compressing or sampling of
information on membrane potentials. Our results on computational efficiency
related to archiving of information provide guiding principles for the future
design of learning rules in order to make them practically usable in
large-scale networks.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08576">Pruning Neural Networks at Initialization: Why are We Missing the Mark?. (arXiv:2009.08576v1 [cs.LG])</a></h4>

<p>Recent work has explored the possibility of pruning neural networks at
initialization. We assess proposals for doing so: SNIP (Lee et al., 2019),
GraSP (Wang et al., 2020), SynFlow (Tanaka et al., 2020), and magnitude
pruning. Although these methods surpass the trivial baseline of random pruning,
they remain below the accuracy of magnitude pruning after training, and we
endeavor to understand why. We show that, unlike pruning after training,
accuracy is the same or higher when randomly shuffling which weights these
methods prune within each layer or sampling new initial values. As such, the
per-weight pruning decisions made by these methods can be replaced by a
per-layer choice of the fraction of weights to prune. This property undermines
the claimed justifications for these methods and suggests broader challenges
with the underlying pruning heuristics, the desire to prune at initialization,
or both.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08497">The Next Big Thing(s) in Unsupervised Machine Learning: Five Lessons from Infant Learning. (arXiv:2009.08497v1 [cs.LG])</a></h4>

<p>After a surge in popularity of supervised Deep Learning, the desire to reduce
the dependence on curated, labelled data sets and to leverage the vast
quantities of unlabelled data available recently triggered renewed interest in
unsupervised learning algorithms. Despite a significantly improved performance
due to approaches such as the identification of disentangled latent
representations, contrastive learning, and clustering optimisations, the
performance of unsupervised machine learning still falls short of its
hypothesised potential. Machine learning has previously taken inspiration from
neuroscience and cognitive science with great success. However, this has mostly
been based on adult learners with access to labels and a vast amount of prior
knowledge. In order to push unsupervised machine learning forward, we argue
that developmental science of infant cognition might hold the key to unlocking
the next generation of unsupervised learning approaches. Conceptually, human
infant learning is the closest biological parallel to artificial unsupervised
learning, as infants too must learn useful representations from unlabelled
data. In contrast to machine learning, these new representations are learned
rapidly and from relatively few examples. Moreover, infants learn robust
representations that can be used flexibly and efficiently in a number of
different tasks and contexts. We identify five crucial factors enabling
infants' quality and speed of learning, assess the extent to which these have
already been exploited in machine learning, and propose how further adoption of
these factors can give rise to previously unseen performance levels in
unsupervised learning.

<p>Since its discovery 30 years ago, α-synuclein (α-syn) has been one of the most studied proteins in the field of neuroscience. Dozens of groups worldwide have tried to reveal not only its role in the CNS but also in other organs. α-syn has been linked to several processes essential in brain homeostasis such as neurotransmitter release, synaptic function, and plasticity. However, despite the efforts made in this direction, the main function of α-syn is still unknown. Moreover, α-syn became a protein of interest for neurologists and neuroscientists when mutations in its gene were found associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and even more when α-syn protein deposits were observed in the brain of PD, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA) patients. At present, the abnormal accumulation of α-syn constitutes one of the pathological hallmarks of these disorders, also referred to as α-synucleinopathies, and it is used for post-mortem diagnostic criteria. Whether α-syn aggregation is cause or consequence of the pathogenic events underlying α-synucleinopathies remains unclear and under discussion. Recently, different in vitro and in vivo studies have shown the ability of pathogenic α-syn to spread between cells, not only within the CNS but also from peripheral locations such as the gut, salivary glands, and through the olfactory network into the CNS, inducing abnormal misfolding of endogenous α-syn and leading to neurodegeneration and motor and cognitive impairment in animal models. Thus, it has been suggested that α-syn should be considered a prion protein. Here we present an update of what we know about α-syn function, aggregation and spreading, and its role in neurodegeneration. We also discuss the rationale and findings supporting the hypothetical prion nature of α-syn, its weaknesses, and future perspectives for research and the development of disease-modifying therapies.</p>

Background<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) small nucleolar RNA host gene 14 (SNHG14) has been demonstrated as an important regulator in PD pathology. However, the functional mechanisms played by SNHG14 in PD remain largely unclear.</p>Methods<p>We used 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP<sup>+</sup>) to establish PD mouse and cell models. The levels of SNHG14, miR-214-3p, and Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) were gauged by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or western blot analysis. Cell viability and apoptosis were determined using the Cell Counting-8 Kit (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The levels of inflammatory cytokines were evaluated by ELISA. The relationships among SNHG14, miR-214-3p, and KLF4 were confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays.</p>Results<p>Our data indicated that SNHG14 was upregulated and miR-214-3p was downregulated in PD models. SNHG14 knockdown ameliorated MPP<sup>+</sup>-stimulated damage in SK-N-SH cells, as evidenced by the enhancement in cell viability and the suppression in cell apoptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Mechanistically, SNHG14 directly targeted miR-214-3p via binding to miR-214-3p, and SNHG14 knockdown protected SK-N-SH cell from MPP<sup>+</sup>-stimulated cytotoxicity by upregulating miR-214-3p. KLF4 was a direct target of miR-214-3p, and SNHG14 regulated KLF4 expression by acting as a miR-214-3p sponge. Furthermore, miR-214-3p overexpression alleviated MPP<sup>+</sup>-stimulated damage in SK-N-SH cells by downregulating KLF4.</p>Conclusion<p>Our current study first demonstrated the protective effect of SNHG14 knockdown on MPP<sup>+</sup>-stimulated cytotoxicity in SK-N-SH cells at least partially by targeting the miR-214-3p/KLF4 axis, illuminating a promising target for PD intervention and treatment.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60742">Ubiquitin-interacting motifs of ataxin-3 regulate its polyglutamine toxicity through Hsc70-4-dependent aggregation</a></h4>

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) belongs to the family of polyglutamine neurodegenerations. Each disorder stems from the abnormal lengthening of a glutamine repeat in a different protein. Although caused by a similar mutation, polyglutamine disorders are distinct, implicating non-polyglutamine regions of disease proteins as regulators of pathogenesis. SCA3 is caused by polyglutamine expansion in ataxin-3. To determine the role of ataxin-3’s non-polyglutamine domains in disease, we utilized a new, allelic series of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. We found that ataxin-3 pathogenicity is saliently controlled by polyglutamine-adjacent ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) that enhance aggregation and toxicity. UIMs function by interacting with the heat shock protein, Hsc70-4, whose reduction diminishes ataxin-3 toxicity in a UIM-dependent manner. Hsc70-4 also enhances pathogenicity of other polyglutamine proteins. Our studies provide a unique insight into the impact of ataxin-3 domains in SCA3, identify Hsc70-4 as a SCA3 enhancer, and indicate pleiotropic effects from HSP70 chaperones, which are generally thought to suppress polyglutamine degeneration.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60498">Genome-wide alterations of uracil distribution patterns in human DNA upon chemotherapeutic treatments</a></h4>

Numerous anti-cancer drugs perturb thymidylate biosynthesis and lead to genomic uracil incorporation contributing to their antiproliferative effect. Still, it is not yet characterized if uracil incorporations have any positional preference. Here, we aimed to uncover genome-wide alterations in uracil pattern upon drug treatments in human cancer cell line models derived from HCT116. We developed a straightforward U-DNA sequencing method (U-DNA-Seq) that was combined with in situ super-resolution imaging. Using a novel robust analysis pipeline, we found broad regions with elevated probability of uracil occurrence both in treated and non-treated cells. Correlation with chromatin markers and other genomic features shows that non-treated cells possess uracil in the late replicating constitutive heterochromatic regions, while drug treatment induced a shift of incorporated uracil towards segments that are normally more active/functional. Data were corroborated by colocalization studies <i>via</i> dSTORM microscopy. This approach can be applied to study the dynamic <i>spatio-temporal</i> nature of genomic uracil.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60474">The effect of hybridization on transposable element accumulation in an undomesticated fungal species</a></h4>

Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile genetic elements that can profoundly impact the evolution of genomes and species. A long-standing hypothesis suggests that hybridization could deregulate TEs and trigger their accumulation, although it received mixed support from studies in plants and animals. Here, we tested this hypothesis in fungi using incipient species of the undomesticated yeast <i>Saccharomyces paradoxus</i>. Population genomic data revealed no signature of higher transposition in natural hybrids. As we could not rule out the elimination of past transposition increase signatures by natural selection, we performed a laboratory evolution experiment on a panel of artificial hybrids to measure TE accumulation in the near absence of selection. Changes in TE copy numbers were not predicted by the level of evolutionary divergence between the parents of a hybrid genotype. Rather, they were highly dependent on the individual hybrid genotypes, showing that strong genotype-specific deterministic factors govern TE accumulation in yeast hybrids.

Acid-base conditions modify artery tone and tissue perfusion but the involved vascular sensing mechanisms and disease consequences remain unclear. We experimentally investigated transgenic mice and performed genetic studies in a UK-based human cohort. We show that endothelial cells express the putative HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>-sensor receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase RPTPg, which enhances endothelial intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responses in resistance arteries and facilitates endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation only when CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> is present. Consistent with waning RPTPg-dependent vasorelaxation at low [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>], RPTPg limits increases in cerebral perfusion during neuronal activity and augments decreases in cerebral perfusion during hyperventilation. RPTPg does not influence resting blood pressure but amplifies hyperventilation-induced blood pressure elevations. Loss-of-function variants in <i>PTPRG</i>, encoding RPTPg, are associated with increased risk of cerebral infarction, heart attack, and reduced cardiac ejection fraction. We conclude that <i>PTPRG</i> is an ischemia susceptibility locus; and RPTPg-dependent sensing of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> adjusts endothelium-mediated vasorelaxation, microvascular perfusion, and blood pressure during acid-base disturbances and altered tissue metabolism.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57148">Dynamic encoding of social threat and spatial context in the hypothalamus</a></h4>

Social aggression and avoidance are defensive behaviors expressed by territorial animals in a manner appropriate to spatial context and experience. The ventromedial hypothalamus controls both social aggression and avoidance, suggesting that it may encode a general internal state of threat modulated by space and experience. Here, we show that neurons in the mouse ventromedial hypothalamus are activated both by the presence of a social threat as well as by a chamber where social defeat previously occurred. Moreover, under conditions where the animal could move freely between a home and defeat chamber, firing activity emerged that predicted the animal’s position, demonstrating the dynamic encoding of spatial context in the hypothalamus. Finally, we found that social defeat induced a functional reorganization of neural activity as optogenetic activation could elicit avoidance after, but not before social defeat. These findings reveal how the hypothalamus dynamically encodes spatial and sensory cues to drive social behaviors.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56954">Localized inhibition in the Drosophila mushroom body</a></h4>

Many neurons show compartmentalized activity, in which activity does not spread readily across the cell, allowing input and output to occur locally. However, the functional implications of compartmentalized activity for the wider neural circuit are often unclear. We addressed this problem in the <i>Drosophila</i> mushroom body, whose principal neurons, Kenyon cells, receive feedback inhibition from a non-spiking interneuron called APL. We used local stimulation and volumetric calcium imaging to show that APL inhibits Kenyon cells’ dendrites and axons, and that both activity in APL and APL’s inhibitory effect on Kenyon cells are spatially localized (the latter somewhat less so), allowing APL to differentially inhibit different mushroom body compartments. Applying these results to the <i>Drosophila</i> hemibrain connectome predicts that individual Kenyon cells inhibit themselves via APL more strongly than they inhibit other individual Kenyon cells. These findings reveal how cellular physiology and detailed network anatomy can combine to influence circuit function.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56359">Therapeutic effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation in a rat model of ADHD</a></h4>

Most therapeutic candidates for treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have focused on modulating the dopaminergic neurotransmission system with neurotrophic factors. Regulation of this system by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) could contribute to the recovery of cognitive symptoms observed in patients with ADHD. Here, male spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats were subjected to consecutive high-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) (20 min, 50 μA, current density 63.7 A/m<sup>2</sup>, charge density 76.4 kC/m<sup>2</sup>) over the prefrontal cortex. This treatment alleviated cognitive deficits, with an increase in tyrosine hydroxylase and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 and significantly decreased plasma membrane reuptake transporter (DAT). HD-tDCS application increased the expression of several neurotrophic factors, particularly brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and activated hippocampal neurogenesis. Our results suggest that anodal HD-tDCS over the prefrontal cortex may ameliorate cognitive dysfunction via regulation of DAT and BDNF in the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic pathways, and therefore represents a potential adjuvant therapy for ADHD.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56171">Chronic postnatal chemogenetic activation of forebrain excitatory neurons evokes persistent changes in mood behavior</a></h4>

Early adversity is a risk factor for the development of adult psychopathology. Common across multiple rodent models of early adversity is increased signaling via forebrain Gq-coupled neurotransmitter receptors. We addressed whether enhanced Gq-mediated signaling in forebrain excitatory neurons during postnatal life can evoke persistent mood-related behavioral changes. Excitatory hM3Dq DREADD-mediated chemogenetic activation of forebrain excitatory neurons during postnatal life (P2-14), but not in juvenile or adult windows, increased anxiety-, despair-, and schizophrenia-like behavior in adulthood. This was accompanied by an enhanced metabolic rate of cortical and hippocampal glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. Furthermore, we observed reduced activity and plasticity-associated marker expression, and perturbed excitatory/inhibitory currents in the hippocampus. These results indicate that Gq signaling mediated activation of forebrain excitatory neurons during the critical postnatal window is sufficient to program altered mood-related behavior, as well as functional changes in forebrain glutamate and GABA systems, recapitulating aspects of the consequences of early adversity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55851">Genetic mapping of etiologic brain cell types for obesity</a></h4>

The underlying cell types mediating predisposition to obesity remain largely obscure. Here, we integrated recently published single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from 727 peripheral and nervous system cell types spanning 17 mouse organs with body mass index (BMI) genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from &gt;457,000 individuals. Developing a novel strategy for integrating scRNA-seq data with GWAS data, we identified 26, exclusively neuronal, cell types from the hypothalamus, subthalamus, midbrain, hippocampus, thalamus, cortex, pons, medulla, pallidum that were significantly enriched for BMI heritability (p&lt;1.6×10<sup>−4</sup>). Using genes harboring coding mutations associated with obesity, we replicated midbrain cell types from the anterior pretectal nucleus and periaqueductal gray (p&lt;1.2×10<sup>−4</sup>). Together, our results suggest that brain nuclei regulating integration of sensory stimuli, learning and memory are likely to play a key role in obesity and provide testable hypotheses for mechanistic follow-up studies.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55589">Apelin signaling drives vascular endothelial cells towards a pro-angiogenic state</a></h4>

To form new blood vessels (angiogenesis), endothelial cells (ECs) must be activated and acquire highly migratory and proliferative phenotypes. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern these processes are incompletely understood. Here, we show that Apelin signaling functions to drive ECs into such an angiogenic state. Zebrafish lacking Apelin signaling exhibit defects in endothelial tip cell morphology and sprouting. Using transplantation experiments, we find that in mosaic vessels, wild-type ECs leave the dorsal aorta (DA) and form new vessels while neighboring ECs defective in Apelin signaling remain in the DA. Mechanistically, Apelin signaling enhances glycolytic activity in ECs at least in part by increasing levels of the growth-promoting transcription factor c-Myc. Moreover, Apelin expression is regulated by Notch signaling, and its function is required for the hypersprouting phenotype in Delta-like 4 (Dll4) knockdown embryos. These data provide new insights into fundamental principles of blood vessel formation and Apelin signaling, enabling a better understanding of vascular growth in health and disease.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55480">Serine phosphorylation regulates the P-type potassium pump KdpFABC</a></h4>

KdpFABC is an ATP-dependent K<sup>+</sup> pump that ensures bacterial survival in K<sup>+</sup>-deficient environments. Whereas transcriptional activation of kdpFABC expression is well studied, a mechanism for down regulation when K<sup>+</sup> levels are restored has not been described. Here we show that KdpFABC is inhibited when cells return to a K<sup>+</sup>-rich environment. The mechanism of inhibition involves phosphorylation of Ser162 on KdpB, which can be reversed in vitro by treatment with serine phosphatase. Mutating Ser162 to Alanine produces constitutive activity, whereas the phosphomimetic Ser162Asp mutation inactivates the pump. Analyses of the transport cycle show that serine phosphorylation abolishes the K<sup>+</sup>-dependence of ATP hydrolysis and blocks the catalytic cycle after formation of the aspartyl phosphate intermediate (E1~P). This regulatory mechanism is unique amongst P-type pumps and this study furthers our understanding of how bacteria control potassium homeostasis to maintain cell volume and osmotic potential.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55331">Site-specific effects of neurosteroids on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor activation and desensitization</a></h4>

This study examines how site-specific binding to three identified neurosteroid binding sites in the α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub> GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>R) contributes to neurosteroid allosteric modulation. We found that the potentiating neurosteroid, allopregnanolone, but not its inhibitory 3β-epimer epi-allopregnanolone, binds to the canonical β<sub>3</sub>(+)–α<sub>1</sub>(-) intersubunit site that mediates receptor activation by neurosteroids. In contrast, both allopregnanolone and epi-allopregnanolone bind to intrasubunit sites in the β<sub>3</sub> subunit, promoting receptor desensitization and the α<sub>1</sub> subunit promoting effects that vary between neurosteroids. Two neurosteroid analogues with diazirine moieties replacing the 3-hydroxyl (KK148 and KK150) bind to all three sites, but do not potentiate GABA<sub>A</sub>R currents. KK148 is a desensitizing agent, whereas KK150 is devoid of allosteric activity. These compounds provide potential chemical scaffolds for neurosteroid antagonists. Collectively, these data show that differential occupancy and efficacy at three discrete neurosteroid binding sites determine whether a neurosteroid has potentiating, inhibitory, or competitive antagonist activity on GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs.

Advances in DNA sequencing have revolutionized our ability to read genomes. However, even in the most well-studied of organisms, the bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i>, for ≈ 65% of promoters we remain ignorant of their regulation. Until we crack this regulatory Rosetta Stone, efforts to read and write genomes will remain haphazard. We introduce a new method, Reg-Seq, that links massively-parallel reporter assays with mass spectrometry to produce a base pair resolution dissection of more than 100 <i>E. coli </i>promoters in 12 growth conditions. We demonstrate that the method recapitulates known regulatory information. Then, we examine regulatory architectures for more than 80 promoters which previously had no known regulatory information. In many cases, we also identify which transcription factors mediate their regulation. This method clears a path for highly multiplexed investigations of the regulatory genome of model organisms, with the potential of moving to an array of microbes of ecological and medical relevance.

How the brain controls the need and acquisition of recovery sleep after prolonged wakefulness is an important issue in sleep research. The monoamines serotonin and dopamine are key regulators of sleep in mammals and in <i>Drosophila</i>. We found that the enzyme arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 (AANAT1) is expressed by <i>Drosophila</i> astrocytes and specific subsets of neurons in the adult brain. AANAT1 acetylates monoamines and inactivates them, and we found that AANAT1 limited the accumulation of serotonin and dopamine in the brain upon sleep deprivation. Loss of AANAT1 from astrocytes, but not from neurons, caused flies to increase their daytime recovery sleep following overnight sleep deprivation. Together, these findings demonstrate a crucial role for AANAT1 and astrocytes in the regulation of monoamine bioavailability and homeostatic sleep.

Adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for invasive breast cancer improves patient survival. Unfortunately, long-term treatment comes with side effects that impact health and quality of life, including hot flashes, changes in bone density, and fatigue. Partly due to a lack of proven animal models, the tissues and cell types that mediate these negative side effects are largely unknown. Here we show that mice undergoing a 28-day course of tamoxifen treatment experience dysregulation of core and skin temperature, changes in bone density, and decreased physical activity, recapitulating key aspects of the human physiological response. Single cell RNA sequencing reveals that tamoxifen treatment induces significant and widespread gene expression changes in different cell types of the hypothalamus, most strongly in neurons and ependymal cells. These expression changes are dependent on estrogen receptor alpha (ER), as conditional knockout of ER in the hypothalamus ablated or reversed tamoxifen-induced gene expression. Accordingly, ER-deficient mice do not exhibit changes in thermal regulation, bone density, or movement in response to tamoxifen treatment. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the effects of tamoxifen on the hypothalamus and support a model in which hypothalamic ER mediates several key side effects of tamoxifen therapy.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.306472v1?rss=1">Deciphering how specialized interneuron-specific cell types contribute to circuit function</a></h4>

The wide diversity of inhibitory cells across the brain makes them fit to contribute to network dynamics in specialized fashions. However, the contributions of a particular inhibitory cell type in a behaving animal is challenging to decipher as one needs to both record cellular activities and identify the cell type being recorded. Thus, using computational modeling to explore cell-specific contributions so as to predict and hypothesize functional contributions is desirable. Here we examine potential contributions of interneuron-specific 3 (I-S3) cells - a type of inhibitory interneuron found in CA1 hippocampus that only targets other inhibitory interneurons - during simulated theta rhythms. We use previously developed multi-compartment models of oriens lacunosum-moleculare (OLM) cells, the main target of I-S3 cells, and explore how I-S3 cell inputs during in vitro and in vivo scenarios contribute to theta. We find that I-S3 cells suppress OLM cell spiking, rather than engender its spiking via post-inhibitory rebound mechanisms. To elicit recruitment similar to experiment, the inclusion of disinhibited pyramidal cell inputs is necessary, suggesting that I-S3 cell firing can broaden the window for disinhibiting pyramidal cells. Using in vivo virtual networks, we show that I-S3 cells can contribute to a sharpening of OLM cell recruitment at theta frequencies. Further, a shifting of the timing of I-S3 cell spiking due to external modulation can shift the timing of the OLM cell firing and thus disinhibitory windows. We thus propose a specialized contribution of I-S3 cells to create temporally precise coordination of modulation pathways.

Several studies on rodent models with an Autism Spectrum Disorders-like (ASD) phenotype, notably Magel2-deficient mice, have shown a rescue of deficits in adult social behavior after neonatal administration of oxytocin. However, the neurobiological alterations responsible for the social deficits and the mechanism by which oxytocin-administration in infancy has a rescue effect in adulthood remain unclear. Here we show that Magel2-deficient adult mice exhibit a deficit in social memory that is corrected by neonatal oxytocin administration. We studied hippocampal regions known to be associated with social memory engrams involving the OT-system. At critical stages of development, we characterized cellular, physiological and biochemical alterations of these hippocampal regions in Magel2-deficient mice, alterations present in several ASD models. Overall we demonstrate a strong impact of oxytocin-administration at key stages of postnatal hippocampal neurodevelopment, shedding light on the role for oxytocin in treating neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by deficits in social memory.

There is emerging evidence for delayed brain development in neonates with congenital heart disease (CHD). We hypothesize that the perioperative development of the structural brain connectome is a proxy to such delays. Therefore, we set out to quantify the alterations and longitudinal pre- to postoperative changes in the connectome in CHD neonates and assess risk factors for disturbed perioperative network development relative to healthy term newborns. In this prospective cohort study, 114 term neonates with CHD underwent cardiac surgery at the University Children's Hospital Zurich. Forty-six healthy term newborns were included as controls. Pre- and postoperative structural connectomes were derived from mean fractional anisotropy values of fibre pathways traced using diffusion tractography. Graph theory parameters calculated across a range of proportional cost thresholds were compared between groups by multi-threshold permutation correction adjusting for confounders. Network based statistic was calculated for edgewise network comparison. White matter injury (WMI) volume was quantified on 3D T1-weighted images. Random coefficient mixed models with interaction terms of (i) CHD subtype and (ii) WMI volume with postmenstrual age at MRI respectively were built to assess modifying effects on network development. Pre- and postoperatively, at the global level, efficiency, indicative of network integration, was higher in controls compared to CHD neonates. In contrast, local efficiency and transitivity, indicative of network segregation, were higher in CHD neonates compared to controls (all p&lt;0.025 for one-sided t-tests). Preoperatively these group differences were also found across multiple widespread nodes (all p&lt;0.025, accounting for multiple comparison), whereas postoperatively nodal differences were not evident. At the edge-level, the majority of weaker connections in CHD neonates compared to controls involved interhemispheric connections (66.7% preoperatively; 54.5% postoperatively). A trend showing a more rapid pre- to postoperative decrease in local efficiency was found in class I CHD neonates compared to controls. In CHD neonates, larger WMI volume was associated with lower strength (p=0.0026) and global efficiency (p=0.0097). The maturation of the structural connectome is delayed in neonates with CHD, with a pattern of lower structural integration and higher segregation compared to healthy controls. Trend-level evidence indicated that normalized postoperative cardiac physiology in class I CHD neonates might improve structural network topology. In contrast, the degree of WMI burden negatively impacts network strength and integration. Further research is needed to elucidate how aberrant structural network development in CHD represents neural correlates of later neurodevelopmental impairments.

Cholinergic modulation of hippocampal network function is implicated in multiple behavioral and cognitive states. Activation of nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors affects neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission and rhythmic oscillations in the hippocampus. In this work, we study the ability of the cholinergic system to sustain hippocampal epileptiform activity independently from glutamate and GABA transmission. Simultaneous CA3 and CA1 field potential recordings were obtained during the perfusion of hippocampal slices with the aCSF containing AMPA, NMDA and GABA receptor antagonists. Under these conditions, recurrent field discharges synchronous between CA3 and CA1 were recorded. Field discharges were blocked by addition of calcium-channel blocker Cd 2+  and disappeared in CA1 after a surgical cut between CA3 and CA1. Cholinergic antagonist mecamylamine abolished CA3-CA1 synchronous field discharges, while antagonists of 7 and 4{beta}2 nAChRs - MLA and Dh{beta}E had no effect. Our results suggest that activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors is able to sustain CA3-CA1 synchronous epileptiform activity independently from AMPA NMDA and GABA transmission. In addition, mecamylamine but not 7 and 4{beta}2 nAChRs antagonists reduce bicuculline-induced seizure-like activity. The ability of mecamylamine to decrease hippocampal network synchronization might be associated with its therapeutic effects in a wide variety of CNS disorders including addiction, depression and anxiety.

The balance between excitation and inhibition is essential for maintaining proper brain function in the central nervous system. Inhibitory synaptic transmission plays an important role in maintaining this balance. Inhibitory synaptic transmission faces greater kinetic demands than excitatory synaptic transmission, yet remains less well understood. In particular, the dynamics and exocytosis of single inhibitory vesicles have not been investigated due to both technical and practical limitations. Using quantum dots (QDs)-conjugated antibodies against the luminal domain of the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) to selectively label single GABAergic inhibitory vesicles and dual-focus imaging optics, we tracked single inhibitory vesicles up to the moment of exocytosis (i.e., fusion) in three dimensions in real time. Using three-dimensional trajectories, we found that the total travel length before fusion of inhibitory synaptic vesicles was smaller than that of synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1)-labeled vesicles. Fusion times of inhibitory vesicles were shorter compared with those of Syt1-labeled vesicles. We also found a close relationship between release probability to the proximity to fusion sites and total travel length of inhibitory synaptic vesicles. Furthermore, inhibitory synaptic vesicles exhibited a higher prevalence of kiss-and-run fusion than Syt1-labeled vesicles. Thus, our results showed that inhibitory synaptic vesicles have the unique dynamics and fusion properties that facilitate their ability to support fast synaptic inhibition.

Suicidal ideation (SI) and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) are two distinct yet often co-occurring risk factors for suicide in adolescents. Elucidating the neurobiological patterns that specifically characterize SI and NSSI in adolescents is needed to inform the use of these markers in intervention studies and to develop brain-based treatment targets. Here, we clinically assessed 70 adolescents--49 adolescents with depression and 21 healthy controls--to determine SI and NSSI history. Twenty-eight of the depressed adolescents had a history of SI and 29 had a history of NSSI (20 overlapping). All participants underwent a resting-state fMRI scan. We compared groups in network coherence of subdivisions of the central executive network (CEN), default mode network (DMN), and salience network (SN). We also examined group differences in between-network connectivity and explored brain-behavior correlations. Depressed adolescents with SI and with NSSI had lower coherence in the ventral DMN compared to those without SI or NSSI, respectively, and healthy controls (all ps&lt;0.043). Depressed adolescents with NSSI had lower coherence in the anterior DMN and in insula-SN (all ps&lt;0.030), and higher CEN-DMN connectivity compared to those without NSSI and healthy controls (all ps&lt;0.030). Lower network coherence in all DMN subnetworks and insula-SN were associated with higher SI and NSSI (all ps&lt;0.001). Thus, SI and NSSI are related to brain networks associated with difficulties in self-referential processing and future planning, while NSSI specifically is related to brain networks associated with disruptions in interoceptive awareness. Intrinsic network patterns may be reliable biomarkers of SI and NSSI in adolescents.

In natural settings, learning and decision making often takes place under considerable perceptual uncertainty. Here we investigate the computational principles that govern reward-based learning and decision making under perceptual uncertainty about environmental states. Based on an integrated perceptual and economic decision-making task where unobservable states governed the reward contingencies, we analyzed behavioral data of 52 human participants. We formalized perceptual uncertainty with a belief state that expresses the probability of task states based on sensory information. Using several Bayesian and Q-learning agent models, we examined to which degree belief states and categorical-choice biases determine human learning and decision making under perceptual uncertainty. We found that both factors influenced participants' behavior, which was similarly captured in Bayesian-inference and Q-learning models. Therefore, humans dynamically combine uncertain perceptual and reward information during learning and decision making, but categorical choices substantially modulate this integration. The results suggest that categorical commitments to the most likely state of the environment may generally give rise to categorical biases on learning under uncertainty.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We examined the relationship between tau pathology and neuroinflammation using [<sup>11</sup>C]PK11195 and [<sup>18</sup>F]AV‐1451 PET in seventeen patients with progressive supranuclear palsy Richardson’s syndrome (PSP). We tested the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and tau protein aggregation co‐localize macroscopically, and correlate with clinical severity.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Non‐displaceable binding potential (BP<sub>ND</sub>) for each ligand was quantified in 83 regions of interest (ROIs). The [<sup>11</sup>C]PK11195 and [<sup>18</sup>F]AV‐1451 BP<sub>ND</sub> values were correlated across all regions. The spatial distributions of [<sup>11</sup>C]PK11195 and [<sup>18</sup>F]AV‐1451 binding were determined by principal component analyses (PCAs), and the loading of each spatial component compared against the patients’ clinical severity (using the PSP‐rating‐scale).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Regional [<sup>11</sup>C]PK11195 and [<sup>18</sup>F]AV‐1451 binding were positively correlated (R=0.577, p&lt;0.0001). The PCA identified four components for each ligand, reflecting the relative expression of tau pathology or neuroinflammation in distinct groups of brain regions. Positive associations between [<sup>11</sup>C]PK11195 and [<sup>18</sup>F]AV‐1451 components’ loadings were found in both sub‐cortical (R=0.769, p&lt;0.0001) and cortical regions (R=0.836, p&lt;0.0001). There were positive correlations between clinical severity and both sub‐cortical tau pathology (R=0.667, p=0.003) and neuroinflammation (R=0.788, p&lt;0.001).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We show that tau pathology and neuroinflammation co‐localize in PSP, and that individual differences in subcortical tau pathology and neuroinflammation are linked to clinical severity. Although longitudinal studies are needed to determine causal associations between these molecular pathologies, we suggest that the combination of tau‐ and immune‐oriented strategies may be useful for effective disease‐modifying treatments in PSP.</p>

<p>Growing evidence has suggested an association between sleep duration and Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it is unclear if sleep duration is a manifestation of AD disease process. We studied whether genetic liability for AD predicts sleep duration using a genetic risk score for AD (AD‐GRS), in 406,536 UK Biobank participants with European ancestry and without dementia at enrollment. Higher AD‐GRS score was associated with shorter sleep (b= ‐0.014,95%CI:‐0.022,‐0.006), especially in those aged 55+. Using AD‐GRS as an instrumental variable for AD diagnosis, incipient AD reduced sleep duration by 1.87 hours (95%CI:0.96, 2.78). Short sleep duration might be an early marker of AD.</p>

<h2>
   <i>Objective</i>
</h2>
<p>Current understanding of the neuromodulatory effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on large‐scale brain networks remains elusive, largely due to the lack of techniques that can reveal DBS‐induced activity at the whole‐brain level. Using a novel 3T‐MRI compatible stimulator, we investigated whole‐brain effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation in patients with Parkinson’s disease.</p>


<h2>
   <i>Methods</i>
</h2>
<p>Fourteen patients received STN‐DBS treatment and participated in a block‐design fMRI experiment, wherein stimulations were delivered during “ON” blocks interleaved with “OFF” blocks. FMRI responses to low‐frequency(60Hz) and high‐frequency(130Hz) STN‐DBS were measured 1‐, 3‐, 6‐, and 12‐months post‐surgery. To ensure reliability, multiple runs (48min) of fMRI data were acquired at each post‐surgical visit. Pre‐surgical resting‐state fMRI (30min) data were also acquired.</p>


<h2>
   <i>Results</i>
</h2>
<p>Two neurocircuits showed highly replicable, but distinct responses to STN‐DBS. A circuit involving the globus pallidus internus (GPi), thalamus, and deep cerebellar nuclei was significantly activated, while another circuit involving the primary motor cortex (M1), putamen, and cerebellum showed DBS‐induced deactivation. These two circuits were dissociable in terms of their DBS‐induced responses and resting‐state functional connectivity. The GPi‐circuit was frequency‐dependent, selectively responding to high‐frequency stimulation, whereas the M1‐circuit was responsive in a time‐dependent manner, showing enhanced deactivation over time. Finally, activation of the GPi‐circuit was associated with overall motor improvement, whereas M1‐circuit deactivation was related to reduced bradykinesia.</p>


<h2>
   <i>Interpretation</i>
</h2>
<p>Concurrent DBS‐fMRI using 3T revealed two distinct circuits that responded differentially to STN‐DBS and were related to divergent symptoms, a finding that may provide novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying DBS.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We used behavioral testing and morphological methods to detail the progression of basal ganglia neuron type‐specific pathology and the deficits stemming from them in male heterozygous Q175 mice, compared to age‐matched WT males. A rotarod deficit was not present in Q175 mice until 18 months, but increased open field turn rate (reflecting hyperkinesia) and open field anxiety were evident at 6 months. No loss of striatal neurons was seen out to 18 months, but ENK+ and DARPP32+ striatal perikarya were fewer by 6 months, due to diminished expression, with further decline by 18 months. No reduction in SP+ striatal perikarya or striatal interneurons was seen in Q175 mice at 18 months, but cholinergic interneurons showed dendrite attenuation by 6 months. Despite reduced ENK expression in indirect pathway striatal perikarya, ENK‐immunostained terminals in globus pallidus externus (GPe) were more abundant at 6 months and remained so out to 18 months. Similarly, SP‐immunostained terminals from striatal direct pathway neurons were more abundant in globus pallidus internus and substantia nigra at 6 months and remained so at 18 months. FoxP2+ arkypallidal GPe neurons and subthalamic nucleus neurons were lost by 18 months but not prototypical PARV+ GPe neurons or dopaminergic nigral neurons. Our results show that striatal projection neuron abnormalities and behavioral abnormalities reflecting them develop between 2 and 6 months of age in Q175 male heterozygotes, indicating early effects of the HD mutation. The striatal pathologies resemble those in human HD, but are less severe at 18 months than even in premanifest HD.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Accumulation of the heavy‐chain neurofilaments reflects the maturation status of neuronal structures. The spatial distribution and postnatal developmental dynamic of neurons expressing nonphosphorylated heavy‐chain neurofilaments (labeled by SMI‐32 antibody) were analyzed in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) of the cat. Both interlaminar and intralaminar differences in the dynamic of SMI‐32 staining were observed. The following results were obtained: (a) Ascending dorsoventral gradient in the density of SMI‐32 immunopositive (SMI‐32(+)) neurons (the greatest neuronal density in layer Cm, the minor in the top sublayer of layer A). This gradient was most prominent at the earliest stages of postnatal development (1st–2nd weeks) and slowly flattened up to adulthood; (b) Layer A1 exhibits increases in SMI‐32‐positive cells earlier than layer A; (c) The general transient increment in the number and density of SMI‐32(+) neurons around 2–5 postnatal weeks. Since SMI‐32 antibody is considered to be a putative marker for Y cells forming a motion processing stream, we suggest that peculiarities of SMI‐32 staining at geniculate level could reflect the heterogeneity of Y cell subpopulations and the heterochrony of their postnatal maturation.</p>

<p>Noradrenaline stimulates β<sub>3</sub>‐adrenoceptor in astrocytes and increases the supply of glutathione from astrocytes to neurons, thereby increasing the intracellular glutathione concentration in neurons and protecting them from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>‐induced cell death.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Oxidative stress has been implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Astrocytes play a significant role in maintaining survival of neurons by supplying antioxidants such as glutathione (GSH) to neurons. Recently, we found that noradrenaline increased the intracellular GSH concentration in astrocytes via β<sub>3</sub>‐adrenoceptor stimulation. These observations suggest that noradrenaline protects neurons from oxidative stress‐induced death by increasing the supply of GSH from astrocytes to neurons via the stimulation of β<sub>3</sub>‐adrenoceptor in astrocytes. In the present study, we examined the protective effect of noradrenaline against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>‐induced neurotoxicity using two different mixed cultures: the mixed culture of human astrocytoma U‐251 MG cells and human neuroblastoma SH‐SY5Y cells, and the mouse primary cerebrum mixed culture of neurons and astrocytes. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>‐induced neuronal cell death was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with noradrenaline in both mixed cultures but not in single culture of SH‐SY5Y cells or in mouse cerebrum neuron‐rich culture. The neuroprotective effect of noradrenaline was inhibited by SR59230A, a selective β<sub>3</sub>‐adrenoceptor antagonist, and CL316243, a selective β<sub>3</sub>‐adrenoceptor agonist, mimicked the neuroprotective effect of noradrenaline. DL‐buthionine‐[S,R]‐sulfoximine, a GSH synthesis inhibitor, negated the neuroprotective effect of noradrenaline in both mixed cultures. MK571, which inhibits the export of GSH from astrocytes mediated by multidrug resistance‐associated protein 1, also prevented the neuroprotective effect of noradrenaline. These results suggest that noradrenaline protects neurons against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>‐induced death by increasing the supply of GSH from astrocytes via β<sub>3</sub>‐adrenoceptor stimulation.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The effect of stress on animal behavior and brain activity has been attracting growing attention in the last decades. Stress dramatically affects several aspects of animal behavior, including motivation and cognitive functioning, and has been used to model human pathologies such as post‐traumatic stress disorder. A key question is whether stress alters the plastic potential of synaptic circuits. In this work, we evaluated if stress affects dopamine (DA)‐dependent synaptic plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). On male adolescent rats, we characterized anxiety‐ and depressive‐like behaviors using behavioral testing before and after exposure to a mild stress (elevated platform, EP). After the behavioral protocols, we investigated DA‐dependent long‐term potentiation (DA‐LTP) and depression (DA‐LTD) on acute slices of mPFC and evaluated the activation of DA‐producing brain regions by western and dot blot analysis. We show that exposure to the EP stress enhances DA‐LTP and that desipramine (DMI) treatment abolishes this effect. We also found that DA‐LTD is not affected by EP stress unless when this is followed by DMI treatment. In addition, EP stress reduces anxiety, an effect abolished by both DMI and ketamine, while motivation is promoted by previous exposure to EP stress independently of pharmacological treatments. Finally, this form of stress reduces the expression of the early gene cFOS in the ventral tegmental area. These findings support the idea that mild stressors can promote synaptic plasticity in PFC through a dopaminergic mechanism, an effect that might increase the sensitivity of mPFC to subsequent stressful experiences.</p>

Morphine but especially prolonged exposure to M3G perturbed cellular pathways in astrocytes, which among others, are important for their interaction with neurons and leukocytes. </p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tolerance and hyperalgesia associated with chronic exposure to morphine are major limitations in the clinical management of chronic pain. At a cellular level, neuronal signaling can in part account for these undesired side effects, but unknown mechanisms mediated by central nervous system glial cells are likely also involved. Here we applied data‐independent acquisition mass spectrometry to perform a deep proteome and phosphoproteome analysis of how human astrocytes responds to opioid stimulation. We unveil time‐ and dose‐dependent effects induced by morphine and its major active metabolites morphine‐3‐glucuronide (M3G) and morphine‐6‐glucuronide that converging on activation of mitogen‐activated protein kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathways. We also find that especially longer exposure to M3G leads to significant dysregulation of biological pathways linked to extracellular matrix organization, antigen presentation, cell adhesion, and glutamate homeostasis, which are crucial for neuron– and leukocyte–astrocyte interactions.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Pain, temperature and itch are conventionally thought to be exclusively transduced by the intraepidermal nerve endings. While recent studies have shown that epidermal keratinocytes also participate in sensory transduction, the mechanism underlying keratinocyte communication with intraepidermal nerve endings remains poorly understood. We sought to demonstrate the synaptic character of the contacts between keratinocytes and sensory neurons and their involvement in sensory communication between keratinocytes and sensory neurons.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Contacts were explored by morphological, molecular and functional approaches in cocultures of epidermal keratinocytes and sensory neurons. To interrogate whether structures observed <i>in vitro</i> were also present in the human epidermis, <i>in situ</i> correlative light electron microscopy was performed on human skin biopsies.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Epidermal keratinocytes dialogue with sensory neurons through <i>en passant</i> synaptic‐like contacts. These contacts have the ultrastructural features and molecular hallmarks of chemical synaptic‐like contacts: narrow intercellular cleft, keratinocyte synaptic vesicles expressing synaptophysin and synaptotagmin 1, sensory information transmitted from keratinocytes to sensory neurons through SNARE‐mediated, syntaxin1, vesicle release.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>By providing selective communication between keratinocytes and sensory neurons, synaptic‐like contacts are the hubs of a two‐site receptor. The permanent epidermal turnover, implying a specific <i>en passant</i> structure and a high plasticity, may have delayed their identification, thereby contributing to the long‐held concept of nerve endings passing freely between keratinocytes. The discovery of keratinocyte‐sensory neuron synaptic‐like contacts may call for a reassessment of basic assumptions in cutaneous sensory perception and sheds new light on the pathophysiology of pain and itch as well as the physiology of touch.</p>

Imaging the activity of neurons that are widely distributed across brain regions deep in scattering tissue at high speed remains challenging. Here, we introduce an open-source system with Dual Independent Enhanced Scan Engines for Large Field-of-view Two-Photon imaging (Diesel2p). Combining novel optical design, adaptive optics, and temporal multiplexing, the system offers subcellular resolution over a large field-of-view (~ 25 mm2) with independent scan engines. We demonstrate the flexibility and various use cases of this system for calcium imaging of neurons in the living brain.

Humans can seamlessly combine value signals from diverse motivational incentives, yet it is not well-understood how these signals are 'bundled' in the brain to modulate cognitive control. The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) is theorized to integrate motivational value dimensions in the service of goal-directed action, though this hypothesis has yet to receive rigorous confirmation. Here, we examine the role of dACC in motivational integration using an experimental paradigm that quantifies combined effects of liquid (e.g., juice, neutral, saltwater) and monetary incentives on cognitive task performance. These incentives modulated dACC activity in both a trial-by-trial and block-wise fashion. Incentive-related dACC modulation predicted fluctuations in cognitive performance and self-report motivation ratings. Statistical mediation analyses indicate that dACC encodes incentives in terms of subjective motivational value, and that this value signal is associated with task performance. These results suggest dACC integrates motivational signals to compute the expected value of goal-directed cognitive control.

Levodopa is the Parkinson's disease standard-of-care, but continued loss of dopamine neurons with disease progression decreases its bioconversion to dopamine, leading to increased side effects and decreased efficacy. In theory, dopamine agonists could equal levodopa, but no approved oral "dopamine agonist" matches the efficacy of levodopa. Although there are consistent data in both primate models and in Parkinson's disease showing that selective high intrinsic activity D1 agonists can equal levodopa, there are no data on whether such compounds would be effective in severe disease when levodopa efficacy is lower or even absent. We compared two approved antiparkinson drugs (levodopa and the D2/3 agonist bromocriptine) with the experimental selective D1 full agonist dihydrexidine in two severely parkinsonian MPTP-treated non-human primates. Bromocriptine caused no discernable improvement in parkinsonian signs, whereas levodopa caused a small transient improvement in one of the two subjects. Conversely, the full D1 agonist dihydrexidine caused a dramatic improvement in both subjects, decreasing parkinsonian signs by ca. 75%. No attenuation of dihydrexidine effects was observed when the two subjects were pretreated with the D2 antagonist remoxipride. These data provide evidence that selective D1 agonists may provide profound antiparkinson symptomatic relief even when the degree of nigrostriatal degeneration is so severe that current drugs are ineffective. Until effective disease-modifying therapies are discovered, high intrinsic activity D1 agonists may offer a major therapeutic advance in improving the quality of life, and potentially the longevity, of late stage Parkinson's patients.

Radial glia-like (RGL) cells persist in the adult mammalian hippocampus where they give rise to new neurons and astrocytes throughout life. Many studies have investigated the process of adult neurogenesis, but factors deciding between neuronal and astroglial fate are incompletely understood. Here, we evaluate the functions of the transcription factor zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) in adult hippocampal RGL cells using a conditional-inducible mouse model. We find that ZEB1 is necessary for self-renewal of active RGL cells as well as for astroglial lineage specification. Genetic deletion of Zeb1 causes differentiation-coupled depletion of RGL cells resulting in an increase of newborn neurons at the expense of newly generated astrocytes. This is due to a shift towards symmetric cell divisions that consume the RGL cell and generate pro-neuronal progenies. We identify ZEB1 as a regulator of stem cell self-renewal and lineage specification in the adult hippocampus.

The thalamus is a key element of sensory transmission in the brain, as all sensory information is processed by the thalamus before reaching the cortex. The thalamus is known to gate and select sensory streams through a modulation of its internal activity in which spindle oscillations play a preponderant role, but the mechanism underlying this process is not completely understood. In particular, how do thalamocortical connections convey stimulus- driven information selectively over the background of thalamic internally generated activity (such as spindle oscillations)? Here we investigate this issue with a spiking network model of connectivity between thalamus and primary sensory cortex reproducing the local field potential of both areas. We found two features of the thalamocortical dynamics that filter out spindle oscillations: i) spindle oscillations are weaker in neurons projecting to the cortex, ii) the resonance dynamics of cortical networks selectively blocks frequency in the range encompassing spindle oscillations. This latter mechanism depends on the balance of the strength of thalamocortical connections toward excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the cortex. Our results pave the way toward an integrated understanding of the sensory streams traveling between the periphery and the cortex.

Whether direct manipulation of Parkinson's disease (PD) risk genes in monkey brain can elicit Parkinsonian phenotypes remains an unsolved issue. Here, we employed an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-delivered CRISPR/Cas9 system to directly co-edit PINK1 and DJ-1 genes in the substantia nigra (SN) region of four adult monkey brains. After the operation, two of the monkeys exhibited all classic PD symptoms, including bradykinesia, tremor, and postural instability, accompanied by severe nigral dopaminergic neuron loss (over 60%) and -synuclein pathology. The aged monkeys were more vulnerable to gene editing by showing faster PD progression, higher final total PD scores, and severer pathologic changes compared with their younger counterparts, suggesting both the genetic and aging factors played important roles in PD development. This gene editing system can be used to develop a large quantity of genetically edited PD monkeys over a short period, thus providing a practical transgenic monkey model for future PD studies.

Though dividing one's attention between two input streams typically impairs performance, detecting a behaviorally relevant stimulus can sometimes enhance the encoding of task-irrelevant information presented at the same time. Previous research has shown that temporal selection of this kind boosts visual cortical activity and incidental memory. An important and yet unanswered question is whether such effects are reflected in processing quality and functional connectivity in visual regions and the hippocampus. In this fMRI study, participants were asked to memorize a stream of images and press a button when they heard an auditory tone of a prespecified pitch. Images could be presented with a target tone, with a distractor tone, or without a tone. Auditory target detection increased activity throughout the ventral visual cortex but lowered it in the hippocampus. These effects were accompanied by a widespread enhancement in functional connectivity between the ventral visual cortex and the hippocampus. Image category classification accuracy was higher on target tone trials than on distractor and no tone trials in the fusiform gyrus and the parahippocampal gyrus. This effect was stronger in clusters whose activity was more correlated with the hippocampus on target tone than on distractor tone trials. In agreement with accounts suggesting that subcortical noradrenergic influences play a role in temporal selection, auditory target detection also caused an increase in locus coeruleus activity and phasic pupil responses. These findings outline a network of cortical and subcortical regions that are involved in the selection and processing of information presented at behaviorally relevant moments.

The retinogeniculate visual pathway (RGVP) conveys visual information from the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus. Anatomically, the RGVP can be separated into four subdivisions, including two decussating and two non-decussating fiber pathways, which cannot be identified by conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Diffusion MRI tractography has the potential to trace these subdivisions and is increasingly used to study the anatomy of the RGVP. However, it is not yet known which fiber tracking strategy is most suitable for tractographic reconstruction of the RGVP. In this study, four different tractography algorithms, including constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) model based probabilistic (iFOD1) and deterministic (SD-Stream) methods, and multi-fiber (UKF-2T) and single-fiber (UKF-1T) unscented Kalman filter (UKF) tractography methods, are compared for reconstruction of the RGVP. Experiments are performed using diffusion MRI data of 57 subjects in the Human Connectome Project. The RGVP is identified using regions of interest created by two clinical experts. Anatomical measurements are used to assess the advantages and limitations of the four tracking strategies, including the reconstruction rate of the four RGVP subdivisions, the percentage of decussating fibers, the correlation between volumes of the traced RGVPs and a T1w-based RGVP segmentation, and an expert judgment to rank the anatomical appearance of the reconstructed RGVPs. Overall, we conclude that UKF-2T and iFOD1 produce the best RGVP reconstruction results. The iFOD1 method can better quantitatively estimate the percentage of decussating fibers, while the UKF-2T method produces reconstructed RGVPs that are judged to better correspond to the known anatomy.

One consequence of the opioid epidemic are the lasting neurodevelopmental sequelae afflicting children and adolescents exposed to opioids in the womb. The gravity of these consequences is further amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, in which the use of synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, has increased among pregnant women. A translationally relevant and developmentally accurate preclinical model is needed to understand the behavioral, circuit, network, and molecular abnormalities resulting from fentanyl use during pregnancy. By employing a novel preclinical model of perinatal fentanyl exposure, our data reveal that fentanyl has several dose-dependent, developmental consequences to somatosensory function and behavior. First, newborn mice exhibit signs of withdrawal, and sensory-related deficits that extend at least to adolescence. As fentanyl exposure does not affect dams' health or maternal behavior, these effects appear to result from the direct actions of perinatal fentanyl on the pups' developing brain. At adolescence, exposed mice exhibited reduced adaptation to sensory stimuli, and a corresponding impairment in primary somatosensory (S1) function. Our in vitro electrophysiology data demonstrate that perinatal fentanyl leads to a long- lasting reduction in S1 synaptic excitation, as evidenced by decreases in excitatory release probability, NMDA receptor-mediated postsynaptic currents, and frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents, as well as increased frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents. In contrast, anterior cingulate cortical neurons exhibit an opposite phenotype, with increased synaptic excitation in perinatal fentanyl exposed mice. Consistent with these synaptic changes, analysis of electrocorticograms revealed that exposed adolescent mice exhibited suppressed ketamine-evoked {gamma} oscillations. Morphological analysis of S1 pyramidal neurons from exposed mice indicate reduced dendritic complexity, dendritic length, and soma size. Further, exposed mice exhibited abnormal cortical mRNA expression of key receptors involved in synaptic transmission and neuronal growth and development, changes that were consistent with the electrophysiological and morphological changes. These findings demonstrate the lasting sequela of perinatal fentanyl exposure on sensory processing and function.

Due to a large number of potential applications, a good deal of effort has been recently made towards creating machine learning models that can recognize evoked emotions from one's physiological recordings. In particular, researchers are investigating the use of EEG as a low-cost, non-invasive method. However, the poor homogeneity of the EEG activity across participants hinders the implementation of any such system by a time-consuming calibration stage. In this study, we introduce a new participant-based feature normalization method, so-called stratified normalization, for training deep neural networks in task of cross-subject emotion classification from EEG signals. The new method is able to subtract inter-participant variability while maintaining the emotion information in the data. We carried out our analysis on the SEED dataset, which contains 62-channel EEG recordings collected from 15 participants while watching film clips. Results demonstrate that networks trained with stratified normalization outperformed standard training with batch normalization significantly. In addition, the highest model performance was achieved when extracting EEG features with the multitaper method, reaching a classification accuracy of 91.6% for two emotion categories (positive and negative) and 79.6% for three (also neutral). This analysis provides us with great insight into the potential benefits that stratified normalization can have when developing any cross-subject model based on EEG.

Despite the success of models making use of word embeddings on many natural language tasks, these models often perform significantly worse than humans on several natural language understanding tasks. This difference in performance motivates us to ask: (1) if existing word vector representations have any basis in the brain's representational structure for individual words, and (2) whether features from the brain can be used to improve word embedding model performance, defined as their correlation with human semantic judgements. To answer the first question, we compare the representational spaces of existing word embedding models with that of brain imaging data through representational similarity analysis. We answer the second question by using regression-based learning to constrain word vectors to the features of the brain imaging data, thereby determining if these modified word vectors exhibit increased performance over their unmodified counterparts. To collect semantic judgements as a measure of performance, we employed a novel multi-arrangement method. Our results show that there is variance in the representational space of the brain imaging data that remains uncaptured by word embedding models, and that brain imaging data can be used to increase their coherence with human performance.

The Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control (DMCC) project provides an ambitious and rigorous empirical test of a theoretical framework that posits two key cognitive control modes: proactive and reactive. The framework central tenets are that proactive and reactive control reflect domain-general dimensions of individual variation, with distinctive neural signatures, involving lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) in interactions with other brain networks and circuits (e.g., frontoparietal, cingulo-opercular). In the DMCC project, each participant is scanned while performing theoretically-targeted variants of multiple well-established cognitive control tasks (Stroop, Cued Task-Switching, AX-CPT, Sternberg Working Memory) in three separate imaging sessions, that each encourage utilization of different control modes, plus also completes an extensive out-of-scanner individual differences battery. Additional key features of the project include a high spatio-temporal resolution (multiband) acquisition protocol, and a sample that includes a substantial subset of monozygotic twin pairs and participants recruited from the Human Connectome Project. Although data collection is still continuing (target N=200), we provide an overview of the study design and protocol, planned analytic approaches and methodological development, along with initial results (N=80) revealing novel evidence of a domain-general neural signature of reactive control. In the interests of scientific community building, the dataset will be made public at project completion, so it can serve as a valuable resource.

The brain's white matter microstructure, as assessed using diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI), changes significantly with age and also exhibits significant sex differences. Here we examined the ability of a traditional diffusivity metric (fractional anisotropy derived from diffusion tensor imaging, DTI-FA) and advanced diffusivity metrics (fractional anisotropy derived from the tensor distribution function, TDF-FA; neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging measures of intra-cellular volume fraction, NODDI-ICVF; orientation dispersion index, NODDI-ODI; and isotropic volume fraction, NODDI-ISOVF) to detect sex differences in white matter aging. We also created normative aging reference curves based on sex. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) applies a single-tensor diffusion model to single-shell DWI data, while the tensor distribution function (TDF) fits a continuous distribution of tensors to single-shell DWI data. Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) fits a multi-compartment model to multi-shell DWI data to distinguish intra- and extra-cellular contributions to diffusion. We analyzed these traditional and advanced diffusion measures in a large population sample available through the UK Biobank (15,394 participants; age-range: 45-80 years) by using linear regression and fractional polynomials. Advanced diffusivity metrics (NODDI-ODI, NODDI-ISOVF, TDF-FA) detected significant sex differences in aging, whereas a traditional metric (DTI-FA) did not. These findings suggest that future studies examining sex differences in white matter aging may benefit from including advanced diffusion measures.

In perceptual decisions, subjects infer hidden states of the environment based on noisy sensory information. Here we show that both choice and its associated confidence are explained by a Bayesian framework based on partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). We test our model on monkeys performing a direction-discrimination task with post-decision wagering, demonstrating that the model explains objective accuracy and predicts subjective confidence. Further, we show that the model replicates well-known discrepancies of confidence and accuracy, including the hard-easy effect, opposing effects of stimulus volatility on confidence and accuracy, dependence of confidence ratings on simultaneous or sequential reports of choice and confidence, apparent difference between choice and confidence sensitivity, and seemingly disproportionate influence of choice-congruent evidence on confidence. These effects may not be signatures of sub-optimal inference or discrepant computational processes for choice and confidence. Rather, they arise in Bayesian inference with incomplete knowledge of the environment.

This study used advanced diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) to examine the association between exogenous sex-hormone exposure and the brain's white matter aging trajectories in a large population-based sample of women. To investigate the effect of pre- and post-menopausal sex hormones on brain aging, cross-sectional brain dMRI data from the UK Biobank was analyzed using 3 diffusion models: conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), the tensor distribution function (TDF), and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI). Mean skeletonized diffusivity measures were extracted and averaged across the whole brain, including fractional anisotropy, isotropic volume fraction, intracellular volume fraction and orientation dispersion index. We used general linear models and fractional polynomial regressions to characterize age-related trajectories in white matter measures following hormone therapy (HT) and oral contraceptive (OC) use in women (HT analysis: N=8,301; OC analysis: N=8,913). Sex hormone treatment (HT and OC) was statistically associated with the aging trends in white matter measures. Estrogen therapy alone appeared to exert a neuroprotective effect on age-related white matter processes, compared to HT containing both estrogen and progestin therapy - which was associated with accelerated aging-related processes in women. These results support the hypothesis that exogenous sex hormone exposure may impact white matter aging; white matter metrics may also be sensitive to sex hormone levels in women. Furthermore, we discuss the necessity to test alternative models for lifespan trajectories beyond popular linear and quadratic models, especially when dealing with large samples. Fractional polynomial models may provide a more adaptive alternative to linear or quadratic models.

Adolescence is characterized by changes in reward-related behaviors, social behaviors, and decision making. These behavioral changes are necessary for the transition into adulthood, but they also increase vulnerability to the development of a range of psychiatric disorders. Major reorganization of the dopamine system during adolescence is thought to underlie, in part, the behavioral changes and increased vulnerability. Here, we utilized fast scan cyclic voltammetry to examine differences in regulation of dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core of adolescent and adult male rats. We found that differences between adolescent and adult stimulated dopamine release is driven by a unique multisynaptic mechanism in early adolescence involving acetylcholine acting at alpha6-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to mediate inhibition of dopamine via GABA release. These changes in dopamine regulation across adolescence provides a springboard for our understanding of basic brain development and targeted therapy for a range of psychiatric conditions that emerge in adolescence.

Super-resolution microscopy provides valuable insight for understanding the nanoscale organization within living tissue, although this method is typically restricted to cultured or dissociated cells. Here, we develop a method to track the mobility of individual proteins in ex vivo adult Drosophila melanogaster brains, focusing on a key component of the presynaptic release machinery, syntaxin1A. We show that individual syntaxin1A dynamics can be reliably tracked within neurons in the whole fly brain, and that the mobility of syntaxin1A molecules increases following conditional neural stimulation. We then apply this preparation to the problem of general anesthesia, to address how different anesthetics might affect single molecule dynamics in intact brain synapses. We find that propofol, etomidate, and isoflurane significantly impair syntaxin1A mobility, while ketamine and sevoflurane have little effect. Resolving single molecule dynamics in intact fly brains provides a novel approach to link localized molecular effects with systems-level phenomena such as general anesthesia.

A common task in brain image analysis includes diagnosis of a certain medical condition wherein groups of healthy controls and diseased subjects are analyzed and compared. On the other hand, for two groups of healthy participants with different proficiency in a certain skill, a distinctive analysis of the brain function remains a challenging problem. In this study, we develop new computational tools to explore the functional and anatomical differences that could exist between the brain of healthy individuals identified on the basis of different levels of task experience/proficiency. Towards this end, we look at a dataset of amateur and professional chess players, where we utilize resting-state functional magnetic resonance images to generate functional connectivity (FC) information. In addition, we utilize T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to estimate morphometric connectivity (MC) information. We combine functional and anatomical features into a new connectivity matrix,which we term as the functional morphometric similarity connectome (FMSC). Since, both the FC and MC information is susceptible to redundancy, the size of this information is reduced using statistical feature selection. We employ off-the-shelf machine learning classifier, support vector machine, for both single- and multi-modality classifications. From our experiments, we establish that the saliency and ventral attention network of the brain is functionally and anatomically different between twogroups of healthy subjects (chess players). We argue that, since chess involves many aspects of higher order cognition such as systematic thinking and spatial reasoning and the identified network is task-positive to cognition tasks requiring a response,our results are valid and supporting the feasibility of the proposed computational pipeline. Moreover, we quantitatively validate an existing neuroscience hypothesis that learning a certain skill could cause a change in the brain (functional connectivity and anatomy) and this can be tested via our novel FMSC algorithm

Blood-based biomarkers have proven to be a reliable measure of traumatic brain injury (TBI) severity and outcome, in both murine models and patients. In particular, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and neurofilament light (NFL) have been investigated in the clinical setting post injury. Ethanol intoxication (EI) remains a significant comorbidity in TBI, with 30-40% of patients having a positive blood alcohol level (BAC) post TBI. The effect of ethanol on blood-based biomarkers on the prognosis and diagnosis of TBI remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of EI on NSE and NFL and their correlation with blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity in a murine model of TBI. We have used ultra-sensitive single molecule array technology (SIMOA) and ELISA methods to measure NFL, NSE and Claudin-5 concentrations in plasma 3h post TBI. We showed that both NFL and NSE were increased 3h post TBI. However, ethanol blood concentrations only showed an inverse correlation with NSE, but not NFL. Claudin-5 levels were increased post injury, but no difference was detected in EI. The Claudin-5 increase post TBI was correlated with NFL, but not with NSE. Thus, the data indicate that ethanol has a confined effect on biomarker release in the bloodstream and neuronal biomarkers reflect a different pathophysiology upon TBI.

Bistable perception is characterized by periodic alternation between two different perceptual interpretations, the mechanism of which is poorly understood. Herein, we show that perceptual decisions in bistable perception are strongly correlated with slow rhythmic eye motion, the frequency of which varies across individuals. From eye gaze trajectory measurements during three types of bistable tasks, we found that each subject gaze position oscillates slowly(less than 1Hz), and that this frequency matches that of bistable perceptual alternation. Notably, the motion of the eye apparently moves in opposite directions before two opposite perceptual decisions, and this enables the prediction of the timing and direction of perceptual alternation from eye motion. We also found that the correlation between eye movement and a perceptual decision is maintained during variations of the alternation frequency by the intentional switching or retaining of perceived states. This result suggests that periodic bistable perception is phase-locked with rhythmic eye motion.

The concentration of oxygen in the brain spontaneously fluctuates, and the power distribution in these fluctuations has 1/f-like dynamics. Though these oscillations have been interpreted as being driven by neural activity, the origins of these 1/f-like oscillations is not well understood. Here, to gain insight of the origin of the 1/f-like oxygen fluctuations, we investigated the dynamics of tissue oxygenation and neural activity in awake behaving mice. We found that oxygen signal recorded from the cortex of mice had 1/f-like spectra. However, band-limited power in the local field potential, did not show corresponding 1/f-like fluctuations. When local neural activity was suppressed, the 1/f-like fluctuations in oxygen concentration persisted. Two-photon measurements of erythrocyte spacing fluctuations ("stalls") and mathematical modelling show that stochastic fluctuations in erythrocyte flow and stalling could underlie 1/f-like dynamics in oxygenation. These results show discrete nature of erythrocytes and their irregular flow, rather than neural activity, could drive 1/f-like fluctuations in tissue oxygenation.

Molecular mechanisms of the interaction between pain and reward associated with pain relief processes in the human brain are still incompletely understood. This is partially due to the invasive nature of the available techniques to visualize and measure metabolic activity. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) radioligand studies using radioactive substances are still the only available modality to date that allows for the investigation of the molecular mechanisms in the human brain. For pain and reward studies, the most commonly studied PET radiotracers are [11C]-carfentanil (CFN) and [11C]- or [18F]-diprenorphine (DPN), which bind to opioid receptors, and [11C]-raclopride (RAC) and [18F]-fallypride (FAL) tracers, which bind to dopamine receptors. The current meta-analysis looks at 15 pain-related studies using opioid radioligands and 8 studies using dopamine radioligands in an effort to consolidate the available data into the most likely activated regions. Our primary goal was to identify regions of shared opioid/dopamine neurotransmission during pain-related experiences. SDM analysis of previously published voxel coordinate data showed that opioidergic activations were strongest in the bilateral caudate, thalamus, right putamen, cingulate gyrus, midbrain, inferior frontal gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus. The dopaminergic studies showed that the bilateral caudate, thalamus, right putamen, cingulate gyrus, and left putamen had the highest activations. We were able to see a clear overlap between opioid and dopamine activations in a majority of the regions during pain-related processing, though there were some unique areas of dopaminergic activation such as the left putamen. Regions unique to opioidergic activation include the midbrain, inferior frontal gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus. By investigating the regions of dopaminergic and opioidergic activation, we can potentially provide more targeted treatment to these sets of receptors in patients with pain conditions. These findings could eventually assist in the development of more targeted medication in order to help treat pain conditions and simultaneously prevent physical dependency.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25908?af=R">Absence of neuronal autoantibodies in neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus</a></h4>

<p>This study aimed to characterise both neuronal autoantibodies and levels of IFNα, two proposed causative agents in neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE). CSF and plasma from 35 SLE patients (15 with NPSLE) showed no antibodies against natively‐expressed NMDA receptors, or the surface of live hippocampal neurons. By comparison to controls (n=104), SLE patient antibodies bound a peptide representing the extracellular domain of NMDARs (p&lt;0.0001), however, binding was retained against rearranged peptides and no peptide (r=0.85 and r=0.79, respectively, p&lt;0.0001). IFNα levels were higher in SLE (p&lt;0.0001), without specificity for NPSLE. Neuronal‐surface reactive autoantibodies are not detectable in NPSLE. Our findings mandate a search for novel biomarkers in this condition.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is known to play a critical role in a variety of complex abilities, including visual‐spatial reasoning, social functioning, and math. Nonverbal learning disability (NVLD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in visual‐spatial reasoning that are accompanied by impairment in social function or mathematics, as well as motor or executive function skills. Despite the overlap between behaviors supported by the hippocampus and impairments in NVLD, the structure and function of the hippocampus in NVLD has not been studied. To address this gap in the literature, we first compared hippocampal volume and resting‐state functional connectivity in children with NVLD (<i>n</i> = 24) and typically developing (TD) children (<i>n</i> = 20). We then explored associations between hippocampal structure, connectivity, and performance on measures of spatial, social, and mathematical ability. Relative to TD children, those with NVLD showed significant reductions in left hippocampal volume and greater hippocampal‐cerebellar connectivity. In children with NVLD, reduced hippocampal volume associated with worse mathematical problem solving. Although children with NVLD exhibited more social problems (social responsiveness scale [SRS]) and higher hippocampal‐cerebellar connectivity relative to TD children, greater connectivity was associated with fewer social problems among children with NVLD but not TD children. Such an effect may suggest a compensatory mechanism. These structural and functional alterations of the hippocampus may disrupt its putative role in organizing conceptual frameworks through cognitive mapping, thus contributing to the cross‐domain difficulties that characterize NVLD.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Increased oxidative stress has been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, but also with neurological diseases sharing pathophysiological pathways like epilepsy. Lipofuscin is a nondegradable end‐product of oxidative stress; its cerebral presence reflects the cumulative amount of oxidative stress the brain has endured. In this study, we have observed prominent autofluorescent particles in the pial arterial wall and in neocortical parenchyma of young, drug‐resistant epilepsy patients (18–28 years old) who underwent resective brain surgery (<i>n</i> = 6), as well as in older control patients (<i>n</i> = 3). With fluorescence spectroscopic imaging, brightfield microscopy, histochemistry and fluorescence lifetime imaging, these autofluorescent particles were identified as the <i>age pigment</i> lipofuscin. An evaluation of these lipofuscin particles using Imaris© software allowed robust quantification, while the 3D properties allowed visualization of the complex configuration. We elaborate on the usefulness of lipofuscin as a marker of cumulative oxidative stress in the brain. Furthermore, we speculate on the observed differences in particle size and density that we found between young patients and older controls, which could imply a role for lipofuscin in the pathophysiology of epilepsy and possibly other neurological diseases.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Considering the demonstrated implication of the retina in Parkinson disease (PD) pathology and the importance of dopaminergic cells in this tissue, we aimed to analyze the state of the dopaminergic amacrine cells and some of their main postsynaptic neurons in the retina of PD.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, we evaluated morphology, number, and synaptic connections of dopaminergic cells and their postsynaptic cells, AII amacrine and melanopsin‐containing retinal ganglion cells, in control and PD eyes from human donors.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In PD, dopaminergic amacrine cell number was reduced between 58% and 26% in different retinal regions, involving a decline in the number of synaptic contacts with AII amacrine cells (by 60%) and melanopsin cells (by 35%). Despite losing their main synaptic input, AII cells were not reduced in number, but they showed cellular alterations compromising their adequate function: (1) a loss of mitochondria inside their lobular appendages, which may indicate an energetic failure; and (2) a loss of connexin 36, suggesting alterations in the AII coupling and in visual signal transmission from the rod pathway.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The dopaminergic system impairment and the affection of the rod pathway through the AII cells may explain and be partially responsible for the reduced contrast sensitivity or electroretinographic response described in PD. Also, dopamine reduction and the loss of synaptic contacts with melanopsin cells may contribute to the melanopsin retinal ganglion cell loss previously described and to the disturbances in circadian rhythm and sleep reported in PD patients. These data support the idea that the retina reproduces brain neurodegeneration and is highly involved in PD pathology. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is determined by SARS-CoV-2 replication and host immune response, but studies evaluating viral evasion of immune response are lacking. Here we employed unbiased screening to identify SARS-CoV-2 proteins that antagonize type-I interferon (IFN-I) response. Three proteins were found to antagonize IFN-I production via distinct mechanisms: nsp6 binds TBK1 to suppress IRF3 phosphorylation; nsp13 binds and blocks TBK1 phosphorylation; and ORF6 binds importin KPNA2 to inhibit IRF3 nuclear translocation.

<p>by Cody Baker, Vicky Zhu, Robert Rosenbaum</p>

Balanced excitation and inhibition is widely observed in cortex. How does this balance shape neural computations and stimulus representations? This question is often studied using computational models of neuronal networks in a dynamically balanced state. But balanced network models predict a linear relationship between stimuli and population responses. So how do cortical circuits implement nonlinear representations and computations? We show that every balanced network architecture admits stimuli that break the balanced state and these breaks in balance push the network into a “semi-balanced state” characterized by excess inhibition to some neurons, but an absence of excess excitation. The semi-balanced state produces nonlinear stimulus representations and nonlinear computations, is unavoidable in networks driven by multiple stimuli, is consistent with cortical recordings, and has a direct mathematical relationship to artificial neural networks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/B2R0Z6_Yx-4" width="1" />

Single-cell Hi-C (scHi-C) interrogates genome-wide chromatin interaction in individual cells, allowing us to gain insights into 3D genome organization. However, the extremely sparse nature of scHi-C data poses a significant barrier to analysis, limiting our ability to tease out hidden biological information. In this work, we approach this problem by applying topic modeling to scHi-C data. Topic modeling is well-suited for discovering latent topics in a collection of discrete data. For our analysis, we generate nine different single-cell combinatorial indexed Hi-C (sci-Hi-C) libraries from five human cell lines (GM12878, H1Esc, HFF, IMR90, and HAP1), consisting over 19,000 cells. We demonstrate that topic modeling is able to successfully capture cell type differences from sci-Hi-C data in the form of “chromatin topics.” We further show enrichment of particular compartment structures associated with locus pairs in these topics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1iuSFDLBSb4" width="1" />

<p>by Luca Terruzzi, Giovanni Spagnolli, Alberto Boldrini, Jesús R. Requena, Emiliano Biasini, Pietro Faccioli</p>

Prions are self-replicative protein particles lacking nucleic acids. Originally discovered for causing infectious neurodegenerative disorders, they have also been found to play several physiological roles in a variety of species. Functional and pathogenic prions share a common mechanism of replication, characterized by the ability of an amyloid conformer to propagate by inducing the conversion of its physiological, soluble counterpart. Since time-resolved biophysical experiments are currently unable to provide full reconstruction of the physico-chemical mechanisms responsible for prion replication, one must rely on computer simulations. In this work, we show that a recently developed algorithm called Self-Consistent Path Sampling (SCPS) overcomes the computational limitations of plain MD and provides a viable tool to investigate prion replication processes using state-of-the-art all-atom force fields in explicit solvent. First, we validate the reliability of SCPS simulations by characterizing the folding of a class of small proteins and comparing against the results of plain MD simulations. Next, we use SCPS to investigate the replication of the prion forming domain of HET-s, a physiological fungal prion for which high-resolution structural data are available. Our atomistic reconstruction shows remarkable similarities with a previously reported mechanism of mammalian PrP<sup>Sc</sup> propagation obtained using a simpler and more approximate path sampling algorithm. Together, these results suggest that the propagation of prions generated by evolutionary distant proteins may share common features. In particular, in both these cases, prions propagate their conformation through a very similar templating mechanism.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nCcCtx9jPRE" width="1" />

<p>The prepositus hypoglossi nucleus (PHN) is one of the major sources of cholinergic input to the cerebellum. We report the proportions of cholinergic neurons in PHN projections to distinct cerebellar regions by applying retrograde labeling with dextran‐conjugated Alexa 488 in ChAT‐tdTomato rats.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cerebellar functions are modulated by cholinergic inputs, the density of which varies among cerebellar regions. Although the prepositus hypoglossi nucleus (PHN), a brainstem structure involved in controlling gaze holding, is known as one of the major sources of these cholinergic inputs, the proportions of cholinergic neurons in PHN projections to distinct cerebellar regions have not been quantitatively analyzed. In this study, we identified PHN neurons projecting to the cerebellum by applying retrograde labeling with dextran‐conjugated Alexa 488 in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)‐tdTomato transgenic rats and compared the proportion of cholinergic PHN neurons in the PHN projections to four different regions of the cerebellum, namely the flocculus (FL), the uvula and nodulus (UN), lobules III‐V in the vermis (VM) and the hemispheric paramedian lobule and crus 2 (PC). In the PHN, the percentage of cholinergic PHN neurons was lower in the projection to the FL than in the projection to the UN, VM or PC. Preposito‐cerebellar neurons, except for preposito‐FL neurons, included different proportions of cholinergic neurons at different rostrocaudal positions in the PHN. These results suggest that cholinergic PHN neurons project to not only the vestibulocerebellum but also the anterior vermis and posterior hemisphere and that the proportion of cholinergic neurons among projection neurons from the PHN differs depending on cerebellar target areas and the rostro‐caudal regions of the PHN. This study provides insights regarding the involvement of cerebellar cholinergic networks in gaze holding.</p>

<p>The current study investigated morphological features of all three neuronal populations in the primary olfactory centre of the moth, Helicoverpa armigera, by means of intracellular iontophoretic staining combined with confocal microscopy. The detailed characterizations of individual antennal lobe neurons ‐ covering projection neurons, local interneurons, and centrifugal neurons ‐ include several novel categories not previously described. Amira reconstructions were used to visualize the distinct neuronal types and sub‐types. Confocal images of all 190 neurons demonstrate the impressive morphological variety, suggesting complex signal processing already at this level of the insect olfactory pathway.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The relatively large primary olfactory centre of the insect brain, the antennal lobe (AL), contains several heterogeneous neuronal types. These include projection neurons (PNs), providing olfactory information to higher‐order neuropils via parallel pathways, and local interneurons (LNs), which provide lateral processing within the AL. In addition, various types of centrifugal neurons (CNs) offer top‐down modulation onto the other AL neurons. By performing iontophoretic intracellular staining, we collected a large number of AL neurons in the moth, <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i>, to examine the distinct morphological features of PNs, LNs, and CNs. We characterize 190 AL neurons. These were allocated to 25 distinct neuronal types or sub‐types, which were reconstructed and placed into a reference brain. In addition to six PN types comprising 15 sub‐types, three LN and seven CN types were identified. High‐resolution confocal images allowed us to analyse AL innervations of the various reported neurons, which demonstrated that all PNs innervating ventroposterior glomeruli contact a protocerebral neuropil that is rarely targeted by other PNs, i.e. the posteriorlateral protocerebrum. We also discuss the functional roles of the distinct CNs, which included several previously uncharacterized types, likely involved in computations spanning from multisensory processing to olfactory feedback signalization into the AL.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Alcohol withdrawal directly impacts the brain's stress and memory systems, which may underlie individual susceptibility to persistent drug and alcohol‐seeking behaviors. Numerous studies demonstrate that forced alcohol abstinence, which may lead to withdrawal, can impair fear‐related memory processes in rodents such as extinction learning; however, the underlying neural circuits mediating these impairments remain elusive. Here, we tested an optogenetic strategy aimed at mitigating fear extinction retrieval impairments in male c57BL/6 mice following exposure to alcohol (i.e., ethanol) and forced abstinence. In the first experiment, extensive behavioral extinction training in a fear‐conditioned context was impaired in ethanol‐exposed mice compared to controls. In the second experiment, neuronal ensembles processing a contextual fear memory in the dorsal hippocampus were tagged and optogenetically reactivated repeatedly in a distinct context in ethanol‐exposed and control mice. Chronic activation of these cells resulted in a context‐specific, extinction‐like reduction in fear responses in both control and ethanol‐exposed mice. These findings suggest that while ethanol can impair the retrieval an extinction memory, optogenetic manipulation of a fear engram is sufficient to induce an extinction‐like reduction in fear responses.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are intriguing molecules, able to directly kill several microorganisms and to regulate multiple aspects of the immune response. Despite the extensive studies on the role of AMPs in the epithelial barrier, placing them as a pivotal line of defense against pathogen invasion, little attention has been directed to their role in the maintenance and modulation of the gut microbiota and, by consequence, of the homeostasis of extra intestinal tissues. Here, we review the recent literature about the microbiome–gut–brain axis, focusing on the role of AMPs in this scenario. We provide a straightforward revision of current data in order to provide an overview of the subject, discussing more in depth some points that, in our opinion, are crucial and have received little attention.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The variegated pelage and social complexity of the African wild dog (<i>Lycaon pictus</i>) hint at the possibility of specializations of the visual system. Here, using a range of architectural and immunohistochemical stains, we describe the systems‐level organization of the image‐forming, nonimage forming, oculomotor, and accessory optic, vision‐associated systems in the brain of one representative individual of the African wild dog. For all of these systems, the organization, in terms of location, parcellation and topology (internal and external), is very similar to that reported in other carnivores. The image‐forming visual system consists of the superior colliculus, visual dorsal thalamus (dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, pulvinar and lateral posterior nucleus) and visual cortex (occipital, parietal, suprasylvian, temporal and splenial visual regions). The nonimage forming visual system comprises the suprachiasmatic nucleus, ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, pretectal nuclear complex and the Edinger–Westphal nucleus. The oculomotor system incorporates the oculomotor, trochlear and abducens cranial nerve nuclei as well as the parabigeminal nucleus, while the accessory optic system includes the dorsal, lateral and medial terminal nuclei. The extent of similarity to other carnivores in the systems‐level organization of these systems indicates that the manner in which these systems process visual information is likely to be consistent with that found, for example, in the well‐studied domestic cat. It would appear that the sociality of the African wild dog is dependent upon the processing of information extracted from the visual system in the higher‐order cognitive and affective neural systems.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The number of diagnosed fatal encephalitis cases in humans caused by the classical Borna disease virus (BoDV‐1) has been increasing, ever since it was proved that BoDV‐1 can cause human infections. However, awareness of this entity is low, and a specific imaging pattern has not yet been identified. We therefore provide the first comprehensive description of the morphology of human BoDV‐1 encephalitis, with histopathological verification of imaging abnormalities.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In an institutional review board‐approved multicenter study, we carried out a retrospective analysis of 55 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations of 19 patients with confirmed BoDV‐1 encephalitis. Fifty brain regions were analyzed systematically (T1w, T2w, T2*w, T1w + Gd, and DWI), in order to discern a specific pattern of inflammation. Histopathological analysis of 25 locations in one patient served as correlation for MRI abnormalities.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Baseline imaging, acquired at a mean of 11 ± 10 days after symptom onset, in addition to follow‐up scans of 16 patients, revealed characteristic T2 hyperintensities with a predilection for the head of the caudate nucleus, insula, and cortical spread to the limbic system, whereas the occipital lobes and cerebellar hemispheres were unaffected. This gradient was confirmed by histology. Nine patients (47.4%) developed T1 hyperintensities of the basal ganglia, corresponding to accumulated lipid phagocytes on histology and typical for late‐stage necrosis.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>BoDV‐1 encephalitis shows a distinct pattern of inflammation in both the early and late stages of the disease. Its appearance can mimic sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease on MRI and should be considered a differential diagnosis in the case of atypical clinical presentation. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;88:723–735</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of nabilone, a synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol analogue, as a treatment for non‐motor symptoms (NMS) in Parkinson's disease (PD).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This was a phase II placebo‐controlled, double‐blind, parallel‐group, enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal trial conducted at the Medical University Innsbruck. A random sample of 47 patients with PD with stable motor disease and disturbing NMS defined by a score of ≥4 points on the Movement Disorder Society ‐ Unified PD Rating Scale‐I (MDS‐UPDRS‐I) underwent open‐label nabilone titration (0.25 mg once daily to 1 mg twice daily, phase I). Responders were randomized 1:1 to continue with nabilone or switch to placebo for 4 weeks (phase II). The primary efficacy criterion was the change of the MDS‐UPDRS‐I between randomization and week 4. Safety was analyzed in all patients who received at least one nabilone dose.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between October 2017 and July 2019, 19 patients received either nabilone (median dose = 0.75 mg) or placebo. At week 4, mean change of the MDS‐UPDRS‐I was 2.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53 to 3.74, <i>p</i> = 0.002, effect size = 1.15) in the placebo versus 1.00 (95% CI −0.16 to 2.16, <i>p</i> = 0.280, effect size = 0.42) in the nabilone‐group (difference: 1.63, 95% CI 0.09 to 3.18, <i>p</i> = 0.030, effect size = 0.66). Seventy‐seven percent of patients had adverse events (AEs) during open‐label titration, most of them were transient. In the double‐blind phase, similar proportions of patients in each group had AEs (42% in the placebo group and 32% in the nabilone group). There were no serious AEs.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results highlight the potential efficacy of nabilone for patients with PD with disturbing NMS, which appears to be driven by positive effects on anxious mood and night‐time sleep problems.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We conducted a multisite, randomized, double‐blinded, controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of a digital health intervention targeting the intrinsic regulation of goal‐directed alertness in patients with chronic hemispatial neglect.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Forty‐nine participants with hemispatial neglect, who demonstrated significant spatially biased attention after acquired brain injury, were randomly assigned to the experimental attention remediation treatment or the active control group. The participants engaged with the remotely administered interventions for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was spatial bias on the Posner cueing task (response time difference: left minus right target trials). Secondary outcomes included functional abilities (measured via the Catherine Bergego scale and Barthel index), spatial cognition, executive function, quality of life, and sleep. Assessments were conducted before and immediately after participation in the experimental intervention or control condition, and again after a 3‐month no‐contact period.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared with the active control group, the intervention group exhibited a significant improvement in the primary outcome, a reduction in spatially biased attention on the Posner cueing task (<i>p</i> = 0.010, Cohen's <i>d</i> = 0.96), in addition to significant improvements in functional abilities as measured on the Catherine Bergego and Barthel indices (<i>p</i> = 0.027, Cohen's <i>d</i> = 0.24).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results demonstrate that our attention training program was effective in improving the debilitating attention deficits common to hemispatial neglect. This benefit generalized to improvements in real‐world functional abilities. This safe, highly scalable, and self‐administered treatment for hemispatial neglect might serve as a useful addition to the existing standard of care. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;88:747–758</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Early discrimination of patients with ischemic stroke (IS) from stroke mimics (SMs) poses a diagnostic challenge. The circulating metabolome might reflect pathophysiological events related to acute IS. Here, we investigated the utility of early metabolic changes for differentiating IS from SM.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed untargeted metabolomics on serum samples obtained from patients with IS (N = 508) and SM (N = 349; defined by absence of a diffusion weighted imaging [DWI] positive lesion on magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) who presented to the hospital within 24 hours after symptom onset (median time from symptom onset to blood sampling = 3.3 hours; interquartile range [IQR] = 1.6–6.7 hours) and from neurologically normal controls (NCs; N = 112). We compared diagnostic groups in a discovery‐validation approach by applying multivariable linear regression models, machine learning techniques, and propensity score matching. We further performed a targeted look‐up of published metabolite sets.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Levels of 41 metabolites were significantly associated with IS compared to NCs. The top metabolites showing the highest value in separating IS from SMs were asymmetrical and symmetrical dimethylarginine, pregnenolone sulfate, and adenosine. Together, these 4 metabolites differentiated patients with IS from SMs with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90 in the replication sample, which was superior to multimodal cranial computed tomography (CT; AUC = 0.80) obtained for routine diagnostics. They were further superior to previously published metabolite sets detected in our samples. All 4 metabolites returned to control levels by day 90.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A set of 4 metabolites with known biological effects relevant to stroke pathophysiology shows unprecedented utility to identify patients with IS upon hospital arrival, thus encouraging further investigation, including multicenter studies. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;88:736–746</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to identify the genetic cause for progressive peripheral nerve disease in a Venezuelan family. Despite the growing list of genes associated with Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease, many patients with axonal forms lack a genetic diagnosis.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A pedigree was constructed, based on family clinical data. Next‐generation sequencing of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was performed for 6 affected family members. Muscle biopsies from 4 family members were used for analysis of muscle histology and ultrastructure, mtDNA sequencing, and RNA quantification. Ultrastructural studies were performed on sensory nerve biopsies from 2 affected family members.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Electrodiagnostic testing showed a motor and sensory axonal polyneuropathy. Pedigree analysis revealed inheritance only through the maternal line, consistent with mitochondrial transmission. Sequencing of mtDNA identified a mutation in the mitochondrial tRNA<sup>Val</sup> (<i>mt‐tRNA</i>
<sup>
   <i>Val</i>
</sup>) gene, m.1661A&gt;G, present at nearly 100% heteroplasmy, which disrupts a Watson–Crick base pair in the T‐stem‐loop. Muscle biopsies showed chronic denervation/reinnervation changes, whereas biochemical analysis of electron transport chain (ETC) enzyme activities showed reduction in multiple ETC complexes. Northern blots from skeletal muscle total RNA showed severe reduction in abundance of <i>mt‐tRNA</i>
<sup>
   <i>Val</i>
</sup>, and mildly increased <i>mt‐tRNA</i>
<sup>
   <i>Phe</i>
</sup>, in subjects compared with unrelated age‐ and sex‐matched controls. Nerve biopsies from 2 affected family members demonstrated ultrastructural mitochondrial abnormalities (hyperplasia, hypertrophy, and crystalline arrays) consistent with a mitochondrial neuropathy.</p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We identify a previously unreported cause of Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease, a mutation in the <i>mt‐tRNA</i>
<sup>
   <i>Val</i>
</sup>, in a Venezuelan family. This work expands the list of CMT‐associated genes from protein‐coding genes to a mitochondrial <i>tRNA</i> gene. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;88:830–842</b></p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25853?af=R">Rest‐Activity Pattern Alterations in Idiopathic REM Sleep Behavior Disorder</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in actigraphy‐measured rest‐activity patterns (eg, sleep–wake cycle, circadian rest‐activity rhythm, and physical activity) across different stages of α‐synucleinopathy.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We compared alterations in 7‐day actigraphy‐measured rest‐activity patterns among patients with clinically diagnosed α‐synucleinopathies (n = 44), and their age‐, sex‐, and body mass index (BMI)‐matched patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD, n = 88), and non‐rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) controls (n = 44) in a case–control study (study 1) and between convertors (n = 22) and their age‐, sex‐, BMI‐, iRBD‐duration, and follow‐up duration‐matched non‐convertors (n = 66) in a prospective nested case–control study (study 2).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In study 1, there were significant increases (all <i>p</i> values were adjusted by false discovery rate &lt; 0.01) in probable napping behaviors (percentage, duration, and episodes), activity fragmentation (estimated by k<sub>AR</sub>), and physical inactivity during active periods across controls, and iRBD, to clinically diagnosed α‐synucleinopathies. In study 2, higher levels (all <i>p</i> values were adjusted by false discovery rate &lt; 0.05) of baseline objective probable napping, activity fragmentation, and physical inactivity during active periods were associated with the conversion of patients with iRBD into clinically diagnosed α‐synucleinopathies at 2 years of follow‐up with medium to large effect sizes (Cohen's d: 0.56 to 0.80). These findings were further supported by functional linear modeling analyses.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Rest‐activity pattern alterations, mainly objective probable napping behaviors, activity fragmentation, and physical inactivity during active period, emerge as early as at the stage of iRBD, which serves as early and robust prodromal markers of the conversion of iRBD into clinically diagnosed α‐synucleinopathies. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;88:817–829</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim was to investigate whether neurodegenerative biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) differentiate patients with suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) who respond to CSF drainage from patients who do not respond.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data from 62 consecutive patients who presented with magnetic resonance imaging changes indicative of NPH were studied with regard to cognitive and gait functions before and after drainage of 40–50ml of CSF. Additionally, S100 protein, neuron‐specific enolase, β‐amyloid protein, tau protein and phospho‐tau were determined in CSF. Statistical analyses were carried out with ANOVA and multiple linear regression.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with CSF constellations typical for Alzheimer's disease (n = 28) improved significantly in cognitive and gait‐related functions after CSF drainage. In contrast, those patients without a CSF constellation typical for Alzheimer's disease (n = 34) did not improve in cognitive and gait‐related functions after CSF drainage. In addition, positive CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease predicted these improvements.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data suggest an association between Alzheimer's disease and NPH changes, supporting the recently suggested dichotomy of a neurodegenerative NPH and a true idiopathic NPH, with the latter appearing to be rare. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;88:703–711</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Guidelines recommend initiating anticoagulation within 4 to 14 days after cardioembolic stroke. Data supporting this did not account for key factors potentially affecting the decision to initiate anticoagulation, such as infarct size, hemorrhagic transformation, or high‐risk features on echocardiography.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We pooled data from stroke registries of 8 comprehensive stroke centers across the United States. We included consecutive patients admitted with ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation. The primary predictor was timing of initiating anticoagulation (0–3 days, 4–14 days, or &gt;14 days), and outcomes were recurrent stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolism, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), and major extracranial hemorrhage (ECH) within 90 days.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 2,084 patients, 1,289 met the inclusion criteria. The combined endpoint occurred in 10.1% (n = 130) subjects (87 ischemic events, 20 sICH, and 29 ECH). Overall, there was no significant difference in the composite endpoint between the 3 groups (0–3 days: 10.3%, 64/617; 4–14 days: 9.7%, 52/535; &gt;14 days: 10.2%, 14/137; <i>p</i> = 0.933). In adjusted models, patients started on anticoagulation between 4 and 14 days did not have a lower rate of sICH (vs 0–3 days; odds ratio [OR] = 1.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.50–4.43), nor did they have a lower rate of recurrent ischemic events (vs &gt;14 days; OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.36–1.62, <i>p</i> = 0.482).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this multicenter real‐world cohort, the recommended (4–14 days) time frame to start oral anticoagulation was not associated with reduced ischemic and hemorrhagic outcomes. Randomized trials are required to determine the optimal timing of anticoagulation initiation. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;88:807–816</b></p>

<p>“Stem cell tourism,” the practice of offering unproven cellular preparations to patients as approved therapy, is rising in neurology. Currently, the experiences of patients and reported complications from these procedures are unknown in the United States. We evaluate academic neurologists' experiences with stem cell tourism and assess perceived competency on discussing this topic with patients. We found a lack of neurologist preparedness to discuss stem cell therapies with patients and an alarming list of unreported complications from these unregulated procedures. We also identified an urgent need for neurologist education and the creation of a national registry for reporting patient complications resulting from experimental stem cell interventions. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;88:661–668</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The rs12608932 single nucleotide polymorphism in <i>UNC13A</i> is associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) susceptibility, and may underlie differences in treatment response. We aimed to characterize the clinical, cognitive, behavioral, and neuroimaging phenotype of <i>UNC13A</i> in patients with ALS.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 2,216 patients with ALS without a <i>C9orf72</i> mutation to identify clinical characteristics associated with the <i>UNC13A</i> polymorphism. A subcohort of 428 patients with ALS was used to study cognitive and behavioral profiles, and 375 patients to study neuroimaging characteristics. Associations were analyzed under an additive genetic model.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Genotyping rs12608932 resulted in 854 A/A, 988 A/C, and 374 C/C genotypes. The C allele was associated with a higher age at symptom onset (median years A/A 63.5, A/C 65.6, and C/C 65.5; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), more frequent bulbar onset (A/A 29.6%, A/C 31.8%, and C/C 43.1%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), higher incidences of ALS‐FTD (A/A 4.3%, A/C 5.2%, and C/C 9.5%; <i>p</i> = 0.003), lower forced vital capacity at diagnosis (median percentage A/A 92.0, A/C 90.0, and C/C 86.5; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and a shorter survival (median in months A/A 33.3, A.C 30.7, and C/C 26.6; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). <i>UNC13A</i> was associated with lower scores on ALS‐specific cognition tests (means A/A 79.5, A/C 78.1, and C/C 76.6; <i>p</i> = 0.037), and more frequent behavioral disturbances (A/A 16.7%, A/C 24.4%, and C/C 27.7%; <i>p</i> = 0.045). Thinner left inferior temporal and right fusiform cortex were associated with the <i>UNC13A</i> single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; <i>p</i> = 0.045 and <i>p</i> = 0.036).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Phenotypical distinctions associated with <i>UNC13A</i> make it an important factor to take into account in clinical trial design, studies on cognition and behavior, and prognostic counseling. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;88:796–806</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To compare the diagnostic performance of an artificial intelligence deep learning system with that of expert neuro‐ophthalmologists in classifying optic disc appearance.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The deep learning system was previously trained and validated on 14,341 ocular fundus photographs from 19 international centers. The performance of the system was evaluated on 800 new fundus photographs (400 normal optic discs, 201 papilledema [disc edema from elevated intracranial pressure], 199 other optic disc abnormalities) and compared with that of 2 expert neuro‐ophthalmologists who independently reviewed the same randomly presented images without clinical information. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The system correctly classified 678 of 800 (84.7%) photographs, compared with 675 of 800 (84.4%) for Expert 1 and 641 of 800 (80.1%) for Expert 2. The system yielded areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.96–0.98), 0.96 (95% CI = 0.94–0.97), and 0.89 (95% CI = 0.87–0.92) for the detection of normal discs, papilledema, and other disc abnormalities, respectively. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the system's classification of optic discs were similar to or better than the 2 experts. Intergrader agreement at the eye level was 0.71 (95% CI = 0.67–0.76) between Expert 1 and Expert 2, 0.72 (95% CI = 0.68–0.76) between the system and Expert 1, and 0.65 (95% CI = 0.61–0.70) between the system and Expert 2.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The performance of this deep learning system at classifying optic disc abnormalities was at least as good as 2 expert neuro‐ophthalmologists. Future prospective studies are needed to validate this system as a diagnostic aid in relevant clinical settings. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;88:785–795</b></p>

<p>Many patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) remain unresponsive after surviving critical illness. Although several structural brain abnormalities have been described, their impact on brain function and implications for prognosis are unknown. Functional neuroimaging, which has prognostic significance, has yet to be explored in this population. Here we describe a patient with severe COVID‐19 who, despite prolonged unresponsiveness and structural brain abnormalities, demonstrated intact functional network connectivity, and weeks later recovered the ability to follow commands. When prognosticating for survivors of severe COVID‐19, clinicians should consider that brain networks may remain functionally intact despite structural injury and prolonged unresponsiveness. <b>ANN NEUROL 2020;88:851–854</b></p>

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08403">Evolutionary Selective Imitation: Interpretable Agents by Imitation Learning Without a Demonstrator. (arXiv:2009.08403v1 [cs.NE])</a></h4>

<p>We propose a new method for training an agent via an evolutionary strategy
(ES), in which we iteratively improve a set of samples to imitate: Starting
with a random set, in every iteration we replace a subset of the samples with
samples from the best trajectories discovered so far. The evaluation procedure
for this set is to train, via supervised learning, a randomly initialised
neural network (NN) to imitate the set and then execute the acquired policy
against the environment. Our method is thus an ES based on a fitness function
that expresses the effectiveness of imitating an evolving data subset. This is
in contrast to other ES techniques that iterate over the weights of the policy
directly. By observing the samples that the agent selects for learning, it is
possible to interpret and evaluate the evolving strategy of the agent more
explicitly than in NN learning. In our experiments, we trained an agent to
solve the OpenAI Gym environment Bipedalwalker-v3 by imitating an
evolutionarily selected set of only 25 samples with a NN with only a few
thousand parameters. We further test our method on the Procgen game Plunder and
show here as well that the proposed method is an interpretable, small, robust
and effective alternative to other ES or policy gradient methods.

<p>The TSC1 and TSC2 genes are connected to multiple syndromes from Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with uncertainty if genetic variants cause all or subsets of phenotypes based on the location and type of change. For TSC1, few have addressed if non-TSC associated genetic variants have direct contributions to changes in neurological genotype-to-phenotype impacts, including elevated rates of ASD and seizures. Dominant variants cause TSC, yet TSC1 has many heritable variants not dominant for TSC that are poorly understood in neurological function, with some associated with ASD. Herein, we examined how missense variants in TSC1, R336W, T360N, T393I, S403L, and H732Y, impacted the development of cortical inhibitory interneurons, cell-types whose molecular, cellular, and physiological properties are altered after the loss of mouse TSC1. We found these variants complemented a known phenotype caused by loss of TSC1, increased cell size. However, distinct variants, particularly S403L showed deficits in complementing an increase in parvalbumin levels and exhibited smaller amplitude after hyperpolarizations. Overall, these data show that subtle phenotypes can be induced by some TSC1 missense variants and provide an in vivo system to assess TSC1 variants’ neurological impact better.</p>

<p>Neurons are highly polarized cells with an elongated axon that extends far away from the cell body. To maintain their homeostasis, neurons rely extensively on axonal transport of membranous organelles and other molecular complexes. Axonal transport allows for spatio-temporal activation and modulation of numerous molecular cascades, thus playing a central role in the establishment of neuronal polarity, axonal growth and stabilization, and synapses formation. Anterograde and retrograde axonal transport are supported by various molecular motors, such as kinesins and dynein, and a complex microtubule network. In this review article, we will primarily discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying anterograde axonal transport and its role in neuronal development and maturation, including the establishment of functional synaptic connections. We will then provide an overview of the molecular and cellular perturbations that affect axonal transport and are often associated with axonal degeneration. Lastly, we will relate our current understanding of the role of axonal trafficking concerning anterograde trafficking of mRNA and its involvement in the maintenance of the axonal compartment and disease.</p>

<p>Cell lineage in the adult hippocampus comprises multipotent and neuron-committed progenitors. In the present work, we fate-mapped neuronal progenitors using Dcx-CreERT2 and CAG-CAT-EGFP double-transgenic mice (cDCX/EGFP). We show that 3 days after tamoxifen-mediated recombination in cDCX/EGFP adult mice, GFP+ cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) co-expresses DCX and about 6% of these cells are proliferative neuronal progenitors. After 30 days, 20% of GFP+ generated from these progenitors differentiate into GFAP+ astrocytes. Unilateral intrahippocampal administration of the chemoconvulsants kainic acid (KA) or pilocarpine (PL) triggered epileptiform discharges and led to a significant increase in the number of GFP+ cells in both ipsi and contralateral DG. However, while PL favored the differentiation of neurons in both ipsi- and contralateral sides, KA stimulated neurogenesis only in the contralateral side. In the ipsilateral side, KA injection led to an unexpected increase of astrogliogenesis in the Dcx-lineage. We also observed a small number of GFP+/GFAP+ cells displaying radial-glia morphology ipsilaterally 3 days after KA administration, suggesting that some Dcx-progenitors could regress to a multipotent stage. The boosted neurogenesis and astrogliogenesis observed in the Dcx-lineage following chemoconvulsants administration correlated, respectively, with preservation or degeneration of the parvalbuminergic plexus in the DG. Increased inflammatory response, by contrast, was observed both in the DG showing increased neurogenesis or astrogliogenesis. Altogether, our data support the view that cell lineage progression in the adult hippocampus is not unidirectional and could be modulated by local network activity and GABA-mediated signaling.</p>

<p>In independent component analysis (ICA), the selection of model order (i.e., number of components to be extracted) has crucial effects on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain network analysis. Model order selection (MOS) algorithms have been used to determine the number of estimated components. However, simulations show that even when the model order equals the number of simulated signal sources, traditional ICA algorithms may misestimate the spatial maps of the signal sources. In principle, increasing model order will consider more potential information in the estimation, and should therefore produce more accurate results. However, this strategy may not work for fMRI because large-scale networks are widely spatially distributed and thus have increased mutual information with noise. As such, conventional ICA algorithms with high model orders may not extract these components at all. This conflict makes the selection of model order a problem. We present a new strategy for model order free ICA, called Snowball ICA, that obviates these issues. The algorithm collects all information for each network from fMRI data without the limitations of network scale. Using simulations and in vivo resting-state fMRI data, our results show that component estimation using Snowball ICA is more accurate than traditional ICA. The Snowball ICA software is available at https://github.com/GHu-DUT/Snowball-ICA.</p>

<p>There is a lack of multi-session P300 datasets for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). Publicly available datasets are usually limited by small number of participants with few BCI sessions. In this sense, the lack of large, comprehensive datasets with various individuals and multiple sessions has limited advances in the development of more effective data processing and analysis methods for BCI systems. This is particularly evident to explore the feasibility of deep learning methods that require large datasets. Here we present the BCIAUT-P300 dataset, containing 15 autism spectrum disorder individuals undergoing 7 sessions of P300-based BCI joint-attention training, for a total of 105 sessions. The dataset was used for the 2019 IFMBE Scientific Challenge organized during MEDICON 2019 where, in two phases, teams from all over the world tried to achieve the best possible object-detection accuracy based on the P300 signals. This paper presents the characteristics of the dataset and the approaches followed by the 9 finalist teams during the competition. The winner obtained an average accuracy of 92.3% with a convolutional neural network based on EEGNet. The dataset is now publicly released and stands as a benchmark for future P300-based BCI algorithms based on multiple session data.</p>

<p>The performance of electrode arrays insulated by low-temperature atomic layer deposited (ALD) titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) or hafnium dioxide (HfO<sub>2</sub>) for culture of electrogenic cells and for recording of extracellular action potentials is investigated. If successful, such insulation may be considered to increase the stability of future neural implants. Here, insulation of titanium nitride electrodes of microelectrode arrays (MEAs) was performed using ALD of nanometer-sized TiO<sub>2</sub> or hafnium oxide at low temperatures (100–200°C). The electrode properties, impedance, and leakage current were measured and compared. Although electrode insulation using ALD oxides increased the electrode impedance, it did not prevent stable, physiological recordings of electrical activity from electrogenic cells (cardiomyocytes and neurons). The insulation quality, estimated from leakage current measurements, was less than 100 nA/cm<sup>2</sup> in a range of 3 V. Cardiomyocytes were successfully cultured and recorded after 5 days on the insulated MEAs with signal shapes similar to the recordings obtained using uncoated electrodes. Light-induced electrical activity of retinal ganglion cells was recorded using a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor-based MEA insulated with HfO<sub>2</sub> without driving the recording electrode into saturation. The presented results demonstrate that low-temperature ALD-deposited TiO<sub>2</sub> and hafnium oxide are biocompatible and biostable and enable physiological recordings. Our results indicate that nanometer-sized ALD insulation can be used to protect electrodes for long-term biological applications.</p>

<p>Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Impairment of the neurovascular unit (NVU) has been hypothesized to play a critical role in early PD pathophysiology, and to precede neurodegenerative mechanisms. [C-11]-PE2I (N-(3-iodoprop-2E-enyl)-2b-carbomethoxy-3b-(4-methyl-phenyl)nortropane) (PE2I) is a PET radiotracer targeting neuronal dopamine transporters (DaT) with high specificity, allowing for highly accurate and specific DaT quantification. We investigated NVU integrity using arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI in a prospective cohort of 26 patients with PD, and correlated our findings with analysis of striatal DaT density using PE2I PET in a subcohort of 17 patients. Analysis was performed in FreeSurfer to obtain rCBF and mean standardized regional PET avidity. Pearson correlations and Mann–Whitney tests were performed. Significantly lower mean normalized striatal PE2I SUV values were seen in multiple regions in patients with greater disease duration (p &lt; 0.05). PET uptake in the putamen correlated with disease duration independent of patient age. Stratifying patients based on Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores (stratified into ≥ 27 vs. &lt; 27), there was statistically significantly lower PE2I PET avidity in the higher MoCA score group in both more and less affected sides of the caudate, putamen and pallidum (p &lt; 0.05). A moderate negative correlation between MDS-UPDRS part 3 (motor) “off” and rCBF values was also seen in the L and R cerebellum WM (r = −0.43 and −0.47, p &lt; 0.05). A statistically significant negative correlation was found between dominant hand pegboard test results and rCBF in the less affected pallidum (r = −0.41; p = 0.046). A statistically significant negative correlation of ASL MRI with [11C]-PE2I PET was also found (r = −0.53 to −0.58; p-value 0.017–0.033) between left cerebral WM rCBF and more and less affected striatal PET regions. Our ROI-based analyses suggest that longer disease duration is associated with lower rCBF and lower PE2I mean SUV, implying greater NVU dysfunction and dopaminergic neuronal loss, respectively. Combined ASL MRI and PE2I PET imaging could inform future prospective clinical trials providing an improved mechanistic understanding of the disease, laying the foundation for the development of early disease biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets.</p>

Then, pairwise comparisons of FCS and LI were obtained during the five visits, and the two-sample t test was used to examine between-group differences in FCS [family-wise error (FWE) corrected, P &lt; 0.05] and LI. Correlations between connectivity metrics (FCS and LI) and motor function were further assessed.</p>Results<p>Compared to HCs, decreased FCS in the patients localized in the calcarine and inferior occipital gyrus (IOG), while increased FCS gathered in the middle prefrontal cortex (MPFC), middle frontal gyrus, and insula (P &lt; 0.05). The LI and FCS of patients first decreased and then increased, which showed significant differences compared with HCs (P &lt; 0.05) and demonstrated a transition at the 30-day visit. Additionally, LI at the third visit was significantly different from those at the other visits (P &lt; 0.05). No significant longitudinal correlations were observed between motor function and FCS or LI (P &gt; 0.05).</p>Conclusion<p>Focal ischemic stroke in the left BG leads to extensive alterations in the FCS. Strong plasticity in the functional networks could be reorganized in different temporal dynamics to facilitate motor recovery after BG stroke, contribute to diagnosing the disease course, and estimate the intervention treatment.</p>

<p>Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. Yet, the molecular events involving dysregulated miRNAs that may be associated with protein degradation in the brain remains elusive. Quantitation of more than 800 miRNAs was conducted using rat ipsilateral coronal brain tissues collected 1, 3, or 7 days after penetrating ballistic-like brain injury (PBBI). As a control for each time-point, Sham-operated animals received craniotomy alone. Microarray and systems biology analysis indicated that the amplitude and complexity of miRNAs affected were greatest 7 day after PBBI. Arrays and Q-PCR inferred that dysregulation of miR-135a, miR-328, miR-29c, and miR-21 were associated with altered levels of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), PSEN1, PSEN2, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) genes. These events were followed by increased levels of mature BACE1 protein and concomitant loss of full length APP within 3–7 days, then elevation of amyloid beta (Aβ)-40 7 days after PBBI. This study indicates that miRNA arrays, coupled with systems biology, may be used to guide study design prior validation of miRNA dysregulation. Associative analysis of miRNAs, mRNAs, and proteins within a proposed pathway are poised for further validation as biomarkers and therapeutic targets relevant to TBI-induced APP loss and subsequent Aβ peptide generation during neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>Up to 40% of very preterm infants (≤32 weeks’ gestational age) were identified with a cognitive deficit at 2 years of age. Yet, accurate clinical diagnosis of cognitive deficit cannot be made until early childhood around 3–5 years of age. Recently, brain structural connectome that was constructed by advanced diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique has been playing an important role in understanding human cognitive functions. However, available annotated neuroimaging datasets with clinical and outcome information are usually limited and expensive to enlarge in the very preterm infants’ studies. These challenges hinder the development of neonatal prognostic tools for early prediction of cognitive deficit in very preterm infants. In this study, we considered the brain structural connectome as a 2D image and applied established deep convolutional neural networks to learn the spatial and topological information of the brain connectome. Furthermore, the transfer learning technique was utilized to mitigate the issue of insufficient training data. As such, we developed a transfer learning enhanced convolutional neural network (TL-CNN) model for early prediction of cognitive assessment at 2 years of age in very preterm infants using brain structural connectome. A total of 110 very preterm infants were enrolled in this work. Brain structural connectome was constructed using DTI images scanned at term-equivalent age. Bayley III cognitive assessments were conducted at 2 years of corrected age. We applied the proposed model to both cognitive deficit classification and continuous cognitive score prediction tasks. The results demonstrated that TL-CNN achieved improved performance compared to multiple peer models. Finally, we identified the brain regions most discriminative to the cognitive deficit. The results suggest that deep learning models may facilitate early prediction of later neurodevelopmental outcomes in very preterm infants at term-equivalent age.</p>

<p>Tension is one of the core principles of emotion evoked by music, linking objective musical events and subjective experience. The present study used continuous behavioral rating and electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the dynamic process of tension generation and its underlying neurocognitive mechanisms; specifically, tension induced by structural violations at different music hierarchical levels. In the experiment, twenty-four musicians were required to rate felt tension continuously in real-time, while listening to music sequences with either well-formed structure, phrase violations, or period violations. The behavioral data showed that structural violations gave rise to increasing and accumulating tension experience as the music unfolded; tension was increased dramatically by structural violations. Correspondingly, structural violations elicited N5 at GFP peaks, and induced decreasing neural oscillations power in the alpha frequency band (8–13 Hz). Furthermore, compared to phrase violations, period violations elicited larger N5 and induced a longer-lasting decrease of power in the alpha band, suggesting a hierarchical manner of musical processing. These results demonstrate the important role of musical structure in the generation of the experience of tension, providing support to the dynamic view of musical emotion and the hierarchical manner of tension processing.</p>

<p>Repetition priming is a form of implicit memory, whereby classification or identification of a stimulus is improved by prior presentation of the same stimulus. Repetition priming is accompanied with a deceased fMRI signal for primed vs. unprimed stimuli in various brain regions, often called “repetition suppression,” or RS. Previous studies proposed that RS in posterior regions is associated with priming of perceptual processes, whereas RS in more anterior (prefrontal) regions is associated with priming of conceptual processes. To clarify which regions exhibit reliable RS associated with perceptual and conceptual priming, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis using coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation. This analysis included 65 fMRI studies that (i) employed visual repetition priming during either perceptual or conceptual tasks, (ii) demonstrated behavioral priming, and (iii) reported the results from whole-brain analyses. Our results showed that repetition priming was mainly associated with RS in left inferior frontal gyrus and fusiform gyrus. Importantly, RS in these regions was found for both perceptual and conceptual tasks, and no regions show RS that was selective to one of these tasks. These results question the simple distinction between conceptual and perceptual priming, and suggest consideration of other factors such as stimulus-response bindings.</p>

<p>Recent statistics have shown that the main difficulty in detecting alcoholism is the unreliability of the information presented by patients with alcoholism; this factor confusing the early diagnosis and it can reduce the effectiveness of treatment. However, electroencephalogram (EEG) exams can provide more reliable data for analysis of this behavior. This paper proposes a new approach for the automatic diagnosis of patients with alcoholism and introduces an analysis of the EEG signals from a two-dimensional perspective according to changes in the neural activity, highlighting the influence of high and low-frequency signals. This approach uses a two-dimensional feature extraction method, as well as the application of recent Computer Vision (CV) techniques, such as Transfer Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The methodology to evaluate our proposal used 21 combinations of the traditional classification methods and 84 combinations of recent CNN architectures used as feature extractors combined with the following classical classifiers: Gaussian Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). CNN MobileNet combined with SVM achieved the best results in Accuracy (95.33%), Precision (95.68%), F1-Score (95.24%), and Recall (95.00%). This combination outperformed the traditional methods by up to 8%. Thus, this approach is applicable as a classification stage for computer-aided diagnoses, useful for the triage of patients, and clinical support for the early diagnosis of this disease.</p>

<p>Brain function depends on the flexible and dynamic coordination of functional subsystems within distributed neural networks operating on multiple scales. Recent progress has been made in the characterization of functional connectivity (FC) at the whole-brain scale from a dynamic, rather than static, perspective, but its validity for cognitive sciences remains under debate. Here, we analyzed brain activity recorded with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging from 71 healthy participants evaluated for depressive symptoms after a relationship breakup based on the conventional Major Depression Inventory (MDI). We compared both static and dynamic FC patterns between participants reporting high and low depressive symptoms. Between-group differences in static FC were estimated using a standard pipeline for network-based statistic (NBS). Additionally, FC was analyzed from a dynamic perspective by characterizing the occupancy, lifetime, and transition profiles of recurrent FC patterns. Recurrent FC patterns were defined by clustering the BOLD phase-locking patterns obtained using leading eigenvector dynamics analysis (LEiDA). NBS analysis revealed a brain subsystem exhibiting significantly lower within-subsystem correlation values in more depressed participants (high MDI). This subsystem predominantly comprised connections between regions of the default mode network (i.e., precuneus) and regions outside this network. On the other hand, LEiDA results showed that high MDI participants engaged more in a state connecting regions of the default mode, memory retrieval, and frontoparietal network (p-FDR = 0.012); and less in a state connecting mostly the visual and dorsal attention systems (p-FDR = 0.004). Although both our analyses on static and dynamic FC implicate the role of the precuneus in depressive symptoms, only including the temporal evolution of BOLD FC helped to disentangle over time the distinct configurations in which this region plays a role. This finding further indicates that a holistic understanding of brain function can only be gleaned if the temporal dynamics of FC is included.</p>

<p>Chemokines such as chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) play a role in several behaviors, including anxiety-like behavior, but whether neurons are an important source of CCL2 for behavior and how neuronal CCL2 may work to affect behavior are still debated. When a herpes simplex virus (HSV) vector was used to knockdown CCL2 mRNA in neurons of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) in rats experiencing multiple withdrawals from low dose ethanol, anxiety-like behavior appeared in the social interaction task. To examine this finding further Fractalkine (CX3CL1), a chemokine that is often found to have an opposing function to CCL2 was measured in these rats. Both alcohol withdrawal and CCL2 knockdown increased the levels of the anti-inflammatory protein CX3CL1. The combination of alcohol withdrawal and CCL2 knockdown decreased CX3CL1 and may alter pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory balance, and thus highlights the potential importance of CCL2 and CCL2/CX3CL1 balance in anxiety. To find a mechanism by which neuronal chemokines like CCL2 could affect behavior, retrograde tracing with fluorescent nanobeads was done in two brain regions associated with anxiety the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the ventral periaqueductal gray (VPAG). These studies identified CeA projection neurons to these brain regions that contain CCL2. To demonstrate that CCL2 can be transported via axons to downstream brain regions, the axonal transport blocker, colchicine, was given and 24 h later, the accumulation of CCL2 in CeA neuronal cell bodies was found. Finally, CCL2 in CeA neurons was localized to the synapse using confocal microscopy with enhanced resolution following deconvolution and electron microscopy, which along with the other evidence suggests that CCL2 may be transported down axons in CeA neurons and released from nerve terminals perhaps into brain regions like the BNST and VPAG to affect behaviors such as anxiety. These results suggest that neurons are an important target for chemokine research related to behavior.</p>

<p>Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the central energy carrier of all cells and knowledge on the dynamics of the concentration of ATP ([ATP]) provides important insights into the energetic state of a cell. Several genetically encoded fluorescent nanosensors for ATP were developed, which allow following the cytosolic [ATP] at high spatial and temporal resolution using fluorescence microscopy. However, to calibrate the fluorescent signal to [ATP] has remained challenging. To estimate basal cytosolic [ATP] ([ATP]<sub>0</sub>) in astrocytes, we here took advantage of two ATP nanosensors of the ATeam-family (ATeam1.03; ATeam1.03YEMK) with different affinities for ATP. Altering [ATP] by external stimuli resulted in characteristic pairs of signal changes of both nanosensors, which depend on [ATP]<sub>0</sub>. Using this dual nanosensor strategy and epifluorescence microscopy, [ATP]<sub>0</sub> was estimated to be around 1.5 mM in primary cultures of cortical astrocytes from mice. Furthermore, in astrocytes in acutely isolated cortical slices from mice expressing both nanosensors after stereotactic injection of AAV-vectors, 2-photon microscopy revealed [ATP]<sub>0</sub> of 0.7 mM to 1.3 mM. Finally, the change in [ATP] induced in the cytosol of cultured cortical astrocytes by application of azide, glutamate, and an increased extracellular concentration of K<sup>+</sup> were calculated as −0.50 mM, −0.16 mM, and 0.07 mM, respectively. In summary, the dual nanosensor approach adds another option for determining the concentration of [ATP] to the increasing toolbox of fluorescent nanosensors for metabolites. This approach can also be applied to other metabolites when two sensors with different binding properties are available.</p>

In response to Aβ and tau aggregates, microglia, the primary innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), facilitate Aβ and tau clearance and contribute to neuroinflammation that damages neurons. Microglia also perform a wide range of other functions, e.g., synaptic pruning, within the CNS that require a large amount of energy. Glucose appears to be the primary energy source, but microglia can utilize several other substrates for energy production including other sugars and ketone bodies. Recent studies have demonstrated that changes in the metabolic profiles of immune cells, including macrophages, are important in controlling their activation and effector functions. Additional studies have focused on the role of metabolism in neuron and astrocyte function while until recently microglia metabolism has been considerably less well understood. Considering many neurological disorders, such as neurodegeneration associated with AD, are associated with chronic inflammation and alterations in brain energy metabolism, it is hypothesized that microglial metabolism plays a significant role in the inflammatory responses of microglia during neurodegeneration. Here, we review the role of microglial immunometabolism in AD.</p>

Background<p>Gait deficits are associated with brain atrophy and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) – both markers of underlying cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). Given reduced subcortical cerebral blood flow (CBF) is prevalent in SVD, we tested the hypothesis that regional CBF is positively associated with gait performance among older adults.</p>Methods<p>Thirty-two older adults (55–80 years) with at least one vascular risk factor were recruited. We assessed gait during 2 consecutive walking sequences using a GAITRite system: (1) at a self-selected pace, and (2) while performing a serial subtraction dual-task challenge. We quantified CBF using pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling MRI within 4 regions of interest: putamen, pallidum, thalamus, and hippocampus. We investigated associations between gait characteristics and overall CBF adjusting for age, sex, and height in an omnibus approach using multivariate analysis of variance, followed by regression analysis with each individual region. We also conducted further regression analyses to investigate associations between gait characteristics and frontal lobe CBF. Sensitivity analyses examined how the observed associations were modified by WMH, executive function, and depressive symptoms. A change of 10% in the model’s adjusted r<sup>2</sup> and effect size was considered as a threshold for confounding.</p>Results<p>Overall subcortical CBF was not associated with self-paced gait. When examining individual ROI, gait velocity was directly related to thalamic CBF (p = 0.026), and across all gait variables the largest effect sizes were observed in relation to thalamic CBF. In the dual-task condition, gait variables were not related to CBF in either the omnibus approach or individual multiple regressions. Furthermore, no significant associations were observed between frontal CBF and gait variables in either the self-paced or dual-task condition. Sensitivity analyses which were restricted to examine the association of velocity and thalamic CBF identified a cofounding effect of depressive symptoms which increased the effect size of the CBF-gait association by 12%.</p>Conclusion<p>Subcortical hypoperfusion, particularly in regions that comprise central input/output tracts to the cortical tissue, may underlie the association between gait deficits and brain aging.</p>

<p>Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal, inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. While mutant HTT is present ubiquitously throughout life, HD onset typically occurs in mid-life. Oxidative damage accumulates in the aging brain and is a feature of HD. We sought to interrogate the roles and interaction of age and oxidative stress in HD using primary Hu97/18 mouse neurons, neurons differentiated from HD patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and the brains of HD mice. We find that primary neurons must be matured in culture for canonical stress responses to occur. Furthermore, when aging is accelerated in mature HD neurons, mutant HTT accumulates and sensitivity to oxidative stress is selectively enhanced. Furthermore, we observe HD-specific phenotypes in neurons and mouse brains that have undergone accelerated aging, including a selective increase in DNA damage. These findings suggest a role for aging in HD pathogenesis and an interaction between the biological age of HD neurons and sensitivity to exogenous stress.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58825">Cell-cycle-gated feedback control mediates desensitization to interferon stimulation</a></h4>

Cells use molecular circuits to interpret and respond to extracellular cues, such as hormones and cytokines, which are often released in a temporally varying fashion. In this study, we combine microfluidics, time-lapse microscopy, and computational modeling to investigate how the type I interferon (IFN)-responsive regulatory network operates in single human cells to process repetitive IFN stimulation. We found that IFN-α pretreatments lead to opposite effects, priming versus desensitization, depending on input durations. These effects are governed by a regulatory network composed of a fast-acting positive feedback loop and a delayed negative feedback loop, mediated by upregulation of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18). We further revealed that USP18 upregulation can only be initiated at the G1/early S phases of cell cycle upon the treatment onset, resulting in heterogeneous and delayed induction kinetics in single cells. This cell cycle gating provides a temporal compartmentalization of feedback loops, enabling duration-dependent desensitization to repetitive stimulations.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57804">External location of touch is constructed post-hoc based on limb choice</a></h4>

When humans indicate on which hand a tactile stimulus occurred, they often err when their hands are crossed. This finding seemingly supports the view that the automatically determined touch location in external space affects limb assignment: the crossed right hand is localized in left space, and this conflict presumably provokes hand assignment errors. Here, participants judged on which hand the first of two stimuli, presented during a bimanual movement, had occurred, and then indicated its external location by a reach-to-point movement. When participants incorrectly chose the hand stimulated second, they pointed to where that hand had been at the correct, first time point, though no stimulus had occurred at that location. This behavior suggests that stimulus localization depended on hand assignment, not vice versa. It is, thus, incompatible with the notion of automatic computation of external stimulus location upon occurrence. Instead, humans construct external touch location post-hoc and on demand.

The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is critical for associating initially neutral cues with appetitive and aversive stimuli and receives dense neuromodulatory acetylcholine (ACh) projections. We measured BLA ACh signaling and activity of neurons expressing CaMKIIα (a marker for glutamatergic principal cells) in mice during cue-reward learning using a fluorescent ACh sensor and calcium indicators. We found that ACh levels and nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) cholinergic terminal activity in the BLA (NBM-BLA) increased sharply in response to reward-related events and shifted as mice learned the cue-reward contingency. BLA CaMKIIα<sup> </sup>neuron activity followed reward retrieval and moved to the reward-predictive cue after task acquisition. Optical stimulation of cholinergic NBM-BLA terminal fibers led to quicker acquisition of the cue-reward contingency. These results indicate BLA ACh signaling carries important information about salient events in cue-reward learning and provides a framework for understanding how ACh signaling contributes to shaping BLA responses to emotional stimuli.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57205">WDR90 is a centriolar microtubule wall protein important for centriole architecture integrity</a></h4>

Centrioles are characterized by a nine-fold arrangement of microtubule triplets held together by an inner protein scaffold. These structurally robust organelles experience strenuous cellular processes such as cell division or ciliary beating while performing their function. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the stability of microtubule triplets, as well as centriole architectural integrity remain poorly understood. Here, using ultrastructure expansion microscopy for nanoscale protein mapping, we reveal that POC16 and its human homolog WDR90 are components of the microtubule wall along the central core region of the centriole. We further found that WDR90 is an evolutionary microtubule associated protein. Finally, we demonstrate that WDR90 depletion impairs the localization of inner scaffold components, leading to centriole structural abnormalities in human cells. Altogether, this work highlights that WDR90 is an evolutionary conserved molecular player participating in centriole architecture integrity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55478">A novel DNA primase-helicase pair encoded by SCC<i>mec</i> elements</a></h4>

Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are a rich source of new enzymes, and conversely, understanding the activities of MGE-encoded proteins can elucidate MGE function. Here we biochemically characterize 3 proteins encoded by a conserved operon carried by the Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome (SCC<i>mec</i>), an MGE that confers methicillin resistance to <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, creating MRSA strains. The first of these proteins, CCPol, is an active A-family DNA polymerase. The middle protein, MP, binds tightly to CCPol and confers upon it the ability to synthesize DNA primers <i>de novo</i>. The CCPol-MP complex is therefore a unique primase-polymerase enzyme unrelated to either known primase family. The third protein, Cch2, is a 3'-to-5' helicase. Cch2 additionally binds specifically to a dsDNA sequence downstream of its gene that is also a preferred initiation site for priming by CCPol-MP. Taken together, our results suggest that this is a functional replication module for SCC<i>mec</i>.

Our ability to discover effective drug combinations is limited, in part by insufficient understanding of how the transcriptional response of two monotherapies results in that of their combination. We analyzed matched time course RNAseq profiling of cells treated with single drugs and their combinations  and found that the transcriptional signature of the synergistic combination was unique relative to that of either constituent monotherapy. The sequential activation of transcription factors in time in the gene regulatory network was implicated. The nature of this transcriptional cascade suggests that drug synergy may ensue when the transcriptional responses elicited by two unrelated individual drugs are correlated. We used these results as the basis of a simple prediction algorithm attaining an AUROC of 0.77 in the prediction of synergistic drug combinations in an independent dataset.

Immune cells react to their environment by flexibly reprogramming intracellular metabolic pathways that subsequently alter immune function, in a process called immunometabolism. However, in the CNS, the impact of metabolic reprogramming on microglia, neuroinflammation, and subsequently on brain function is poorly understood. As brain-resident macrophages, microglia are the CNS immune effectors and share similarities with peripheral immune cells. New tools for studying immunometabolism now allow the analysis of bioenergetic regulation with cellular resolution and, as a result, have uncovered previously unappreciated roles for microglial immunometabolism in shaping neuroinflammation.

<p>by Zhengqiao Zhao, Bahrad A. Sokhansanj, Charvi Malhotra, Kitty Zheng, Gail L. Rosen</p>

We propose an efficient framework for genetic subtyping of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 pandemic. Efficient viral subtyping enables visualization and modeling of the geographic distribution and temporal dynamics of disease spread. Subtyping thereby advances the development of effective containment strategies and, potentially, therapeutic and vaccine strategies. However, identifying viral subtypes in real-time is challenging: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, and the pandemic is rapidly expanding. Viral subtypes may be difficult to detect due to rapid evolution; founder effects are more significant than selection pressure; and the clustering threshold for subtyping is not standardized. We propose to identify mutational signatures of available SARS-CoV-2 sequences using a population-based approach: an entropy measure followed by frequency analysis. These signatures, Informative Subtype Markers (ISMs), define a compact set of nucleotide sites that characterize the most variable (and thus most informative) positions in the viral genomes sequenced from different individuals. Through ISM compression, we find that certain distant nucleotide variants covary, including non-coding and ORF1ab sites covarying with the D614G spike protein mutation which has become increasingly prevalent as the pandemic has spread. ISMs are also useful for downstream analyses, such as spatiotemporal visualization of viral dynamics. By analyzing sequence data available in the GISAID database, we validate the utility of ISM-based subtyping by comparing spatiotemporal analyses using ISMs to epidemiological studies of viral transmission in Asia, Europe, and the United States. In addition, we show the relationship of ISMs to phylogenetic reconstructions of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and therefore, ISMs can play an important complementary role to phylogenetic tree-based analysis, such as is done in the Nextstrain project. The developed pipeline dynamically generates ISMs for newly added SARS-CoV-2 sequences and updates the visualization of pandemic spatiotemporal dynamics, and is available on Github at https://github.com/EESI/ISM (Jupyter notebook), https://github.com/EESI/ncov_ism (command line tool) and via an interactive website at https://covid19-ism.coe.drexel.edu/.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/S_-Eq8rIgfM" width="1" />

Identifying heterogeneous cognitive impairment markers at an early stage is vital for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis. However, due to complex and uncertain brain connectivity features in the cognitive domains, it remains challenging to quantify functional brain connectomic changes during non-pharmacological interventions for amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients. We present a <i>quantitative</i> method for functional brain network analysis of fMRI data based on the multi-graph unsupervised Gaussian embedding method (MG2G). This neural network-based model can effectively learn low-dimensional Gaussian distributions from the original high-dimensional sparse functional brain networks, quantify uncertainties in link prediction, and discover the <i>intrinsic</i> dimensionality of brain networks. Using the Wasserstein distance to measure probabilistic changes, we discovered that brain regions in the default mode network and somatosensory/somatomotor hand, fronto-parietal task control, memory retrieval, and visual and dorsal attention systems had relatively large variations during non-pharmacological training, which might provide distinct biomarkers for fine-grained monitoring of aMCI cognitive alteration. An important finding of our study is the ability of the new method to capture subtle changes for individual patients before and after short-term intervention. More broadly, the MG2G method can be used in studying multiple brain disorders and injuries, e.g., in Parkinson’s disease or traumatic brain injury (TBI), and hence it will be useful to the wider neuroscience community.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uL2tupfXrJ4" width="1" />

<p>by Alessandro Sanzeni, Mark H. Histed, Nicolas Brunel</p>

Combining information from multiple sources is a fundamental operation performed by networks of neurons in the brain, whose general principles are still largely unknown. Experimental evidence suggests that combination of inputs in cortex relies on nonlinear summation. Such nonlinearities are thought to be fundamental to perform complex computations. However, these non-linearities are inconsistent with the balanced-state model, one of the most popular models of cortical dynamics, which predicts networks have a linear response. This linearity is obtained in the limit of very large recurrent coupling strength. We investigate the stationary response of networks of spiking neurons as a function of coupling strength. We show that, while a linear transfer function emerges at strong coupling, nonlinearities are prominent at finite coupling, both at response onset and close to saturation. We derive a general framework to classify nonlinear responses in these networks and discuss which of them can be captured by rate models. This framework could help to understand the observed diversity of non-linearities observed in cortical networks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3nCuslgcd2w" width="1" />

<p>by Daniel J. Laydon, Vikram Sunkara, Lies Boelen, Charles R. M. Bangham, Becca Asquith</p>

Human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) persists within hosts via infectious spread (<i>de novo</i> infection) and mitotic spread (infected cell proliferation), creating a population structure of multiple clones (infected cell populations with identical genomic proviral integration sites). The relative contributions of infectious and mitotic spread to HTLV-1 persistence are unknown, and will determine the efficacy of different approaches to treatment. The prevailing view is that infectious spread is negligible in HTLV-1 persistence beyond early infection. However, in light of recent high-throughput data on the abundance of HTLV-1 clones, and recent estimates of HTLV-1 clonal diversity that are substantially higher than previously thought (typically between 10<sup>4</sup> and 10<sup>5</sup> HTLV-1<sup>+</sup> T cell clones in the body of an asymptomatic carrier or patient with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis), ongoing infectious spread during chronic infection remains possible. We estimate the ratio of infectious to mitotic spread using a hybrid model of deterministic and stochastic processes, fitted to previously published HTLV-1 clonal diversity estimates. We investigate the robustness of our estimates using three alternative estimators. We find that, contrary to previous belief, infectious spread persists during chronic infection, even after HTLV-1 proviral load has reached its set point, and we estimate that between 100 and 200 new HTLV-1 clones are created and killed every day. We find broad agreement between all estimators. The risk of HTLV-1-associated malignancy and inflammatory disease is strongly correlated with proviral load, which in turn is correlated with the number of HTLV-1-infected clones, which are created by de novo infection. Our results therefore imply that suppression of de novo infection may reduce the risk of malignant transformation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yor66mqm2kw" width="1" />

<p>by Nikos Fatsis-Kavalopoulos, Roderich Roemhild, Po-Cheng Tang, Johan Kreuger, Dan I. Andersson</p>

Antibiotic combination therapies are important for the efficient treatment of many types of infections, including those caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Combination treatment strategies are typically used under the assumption that synergies are conserved across species and strains, even though recent results show that the combined treatment effect is determined by specific drug–strain interactions that can vary extensively and unpredictably, both between and within bacterial species. To address this problem, we present a new method in which antibiotic synergy is rapidly quantified on a case-by-case basis, allowing for improved combination therapy. The novel CombiANT methodology consists of a 3D-printed agar plate insert that produces defined diffusion landscapes of 3 antibiotics, permitting synergy quantification between all 3 antibiotic pairs with a single test. Automated image analysis yields fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICis) with high accuracy and precision. A technical validation with 3 major pathogens, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, showed equivalent performance to checkerboard methodology, with the advantage of strongly reduced assay complexity and costs for CombiANT. A synergy screening of 10 antibiotic combinations for 12 <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> urinary tract infection (UTI) clinical isolates illustrates the need for refined combination treatment strategies. For example, combinations of trimethoprim (TMP) + nitrofurantoin (NIT) and TMP + mecillinam (MEC) showed synergy, but only for certain individual isolates, whereas MEC + NIT combinations showed antagonistic interactions across all tested strains. These data suggest that the CombiANT methodology could allow personalized clinical synergy testing and large-scale screening. We anticipate that CombiANT will greatly facilitate clinical and basic research of antibiotic synergy.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/UFL_NKCop0Y" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Place and grid cells in the hippocampal formation are commonly thought to support a unified and coherent cognitive map of space. This mapping mechanism faces a challenge when a navigator is placed in a familiar environment that has been deformed from its original shape. Under such circumstances, many transformations could plausibly serve to map a navigator's familiar cognitive map to the deformed space. Previous empirical results indicate that the firing fields of rodent place and grid cells stretch or compress in a manner that approximately matches the environmental deformation, and human spatial memory exhibits similar distortions. These effects have been interpreted as evidence that reshaping a familiar environment elicits an analogously reshaped cognitive map. However, recent work has suggested an alternative explanation, whereby deformation‐induced distortions of the grid code are attributable to a mechanism that dynamically anchors grid fields to the most recently experienced boundary, thus causing history‐dependent shifts in grid phase. This interpretation raises the possibility that human spatial memory will exhibit similar history‐dependent dynamics. To test this prediction, we taught participants the locations of objects in a virtual environment and then probed their memory for these locations in deformed versions of this environment. Across three experiments with variable access to visual and vestibular cues, we observed the predicted pattern, whereby the remembered locations of objects were shifted from trial to trial depending on the boundary of origin of the participant's movement trajectory. These results provide evidence for a dynamic anchoring mechanism that governs both neuronal firing and spatial memory.</p>

<p>In this study we show that both the number of primary cilia and the number of ciliated neurons declines with age in major retinorecipient targets. Our data suggests that the maturation timing of neuronal and non‐neural cilia differs with maturation of neuronal cilia occurring over a longer postnatal period.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The mammalian visual system is composed of circuitry connecting sensory input from the retina to the processing core of the visual cortex. The two main retinorecipient brain targets, the superior colliculus (SC) and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), bridge retinal input and visual output. The primary cilium is a conserved organelle increasingly viewed as a critical sensor for the regulation of developmental and homeostatic pathways in most mammalian cell types. Moreover, cilia have been described as crucial for neurogenesis, neuronal maturation, and survival in the cortex and retina. However, cilia in the visual relay center remain to be fully described. In this study, we characterized the ciliation profile of the SC and dLGN and found that the overall number of ciliated cells declined during development. Interestingly, shorter ciliated cells in both regions were identified as neurons, whose numbers remained stable over time, suggesting that cilia retention is a critical feature for optimal neuronal function in SC and dLGN. Our study suggests that primary cilia are important for neuronal maturation and function in cells of the SC and dLGN.</p>

<p>The P2X7 receptor (P2X7) is a cell surface ligand-gated ion channel, activated by its physiological nucleotide agonist ATP and a synthetic analog (BzATP). However, it has also been suggested that there may be structurally unrelated, non-nucleotide agonists such as the amyloidogenic β peptide. Here we aimed to reassess the effect of amyloid β peptides in various in vitro cell models, namely HEK293 overexpressing human P2X7, the microglial BV-2 cell line, and BV-2 cells lacking P2X7. We measured YO-PRO-1 dye uptake in response to full-length amyloid β peptide (1–42) or the shorter amyloid β peptide (25–35) and there was a concentration-dependent increase in YO-PRO-1 dye uptake in HEK-hP2X7 cells. However, these amyloid β peptide-induced increases in YO-PRO-1 dye uptake were also identical in non-transfected HEK-293 cells. We could observe small transient increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> induced by amyloid β peptides in BV-2 cells, however these were identical in BV-2 cells lacking P2X7. Furthermore, our metabolic viability and LDH release experiments suggest no significant change in viability or cell membrane damage in HEK-hP2X7 cells. In the BV-2 cells we found that high concentrations of amyloid β peptides (1–42) and (25–35) could reduce cell viability by up to 35% but this was also seen in BV-2 cells lacking P2X7. We found no evidence of LDH release by amyloid β peptides. In summary, we found no evidence that amyloid β peptides act as agonists of P2X7 in our in vitro models. Our study raises the possibility that amyloid β peptides simply mimic features of P2X7 activation.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.579867">Early Disruption of Cortical Sleep-Related Oscillations in a Mouse Model of Dementia With Lewy Bodies (DLB) Expressing Human Mutant (A30P) Alpha-Synuclein</a></h4>

<p>Changes in sleep behavior and sleep-related cortical activity have been reported in conditions associated with abnormal alpha-synuclein (α-syn) expression, in particular Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Notably, changes can occur in patients years before the onset of cognitive decline. Sleep-related network oscillations play a key role in memory function, but how abnormal α-syn impacts the generation of such activity is currently unclear. To determine whether early changes in sleep-related network activity could also be observed, prior to any previously reported cognitive dysfunction, we used mice that over-express human mutant α-syn (A30P). Recordings in vivo were performed under urethane anesthesia in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and CA1 region of the hippocampus in young male (2.5 – 4 months old) A30P and age-matched wild type (WT) mice. We found that the slow oscillation (SO) &lt; 1 Hz frequency was significantly faster in both the mPFC and hippocampus in A30P mice, and Up-state-associated fast oscillations at beta (20 – 30 Hz) and gamma (30 – 80 Hz) frequencies were delayed relative to the onset of the Up-state. Spindle (8 – 15 Hz) activity in the mPFC was also altered in A30P mice, as spindles were shorter in duration and had reduced density compared to WT. These changes demonstrate that dysregulation of sleep-related oscillations occurs in young A30P mice long before the onset of cognitive dysfunction. Our data suggest that, as seen in patients, changes in sleep-related oscillations are an early consequence of abnormal α-syn aggregation in A30P mice.</p>

Introduction<p>Cognitive impairment (CI) is a frequent non-motor symptom of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Caudate and Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) are biomarkers linked to CI in PD. There is little known about whether ApoE affects caudate in mild CI of PD (PD-MCI). We investigated the possible interactive effect of ApoE genotypes on caudate functional connectivity (FC) in PD-MCI.</p>Methods<p>A total of 95 PD-MCI patients and 99 matched healthy controls underwent extensive neuropsychological assessment and magnetic resonance imaging. The two groups were separated into three subgroups according to their genotyping. Functional data were analyzed with FC analysis.</p>Results<p>Decreased FC between the caudate and the bilateral inferior orbit frontal gyrus and bilateral middle occipital gyrus (MOG) was found between groups, along with poor performance in general, executive, episodic memory, language, and visual–spatial function. Decreased FC between the caudate and right MOG, right middle temporal gyrus, and right superior occipital gyrus was found as an interaction effect. The FC values of ε4 carriers with PD-MCI were much lower than the other carriers, and FC was positively correlated with the impairment of global and language function.</p>Conclusion<p>These results support the idea that altered FC between the bilateral caudate and posterior cortical regions was interactively influenced by ApoE genotype and PD-MCI status, and the ε4 subtype associated with underlying pathology of global cognitive decline and semantic fluency impairment in an interactive manner. Gene-based imaging approaches might strengthen the credibility in imaging genetic associations, which might provide new powerful insights into the neural mechanisms underlying PD-MCI.</p>

<p>Most diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) techniques use the mono-exponential model to describe the diffusion process of water in the brain. However, the observed dMRI signal decay curve deviates from the mono-exponential form. To solve this problem, the fractional motion (FM) model has been developed, which is regarded as a more appropriate model for describing the complex diffusion process in brain tissue. It is still unclear in the identification and classification of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients using the FM model. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential feasibility of FM model for differentiating AD patients from healthy controls and grading patients with AD. Twenty-four patients with AD and 11 healthy controls were included. The left and right hippocampus were selected as regions of interest (ROIs). The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and FM-related parameters, including the Noah exponent (α), the Hurst exponent (H), and the memory parameter (μ=H−1/α), were calculated and compared between AD patients and healthy controls and between mild AD and moderate AD patients using a two-sample t-test. The correlations between FM-related parameters α, H, μ, and ADC values and the cognitive functions assessed by mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) scales were investigated using Pearson partial correlation analysis in patients with AD. The receiver-operating characteristic analysis was used to assess the differential performance. We found that the FM-related parameter α could be used to distinguish AD patients from healthy controls (P &lt; 0.05) with greater sensitivity and specificity (left ROI, 0.917 and 0.636; right ROI, 0.917 and 0.727) and grade AD patients (P &lt; 0.05) showed higher sensitivity and specificity (right ROI, 0.917, 0.75). The α was found to be positively correlated with MMSE (P &lt; 0.05) and MoCA (P &lt; 0.05) scores in patients with AD, indicating that the α values in the bilateral hippocampus were a potential MRI-based biomarker of disease severity in AD patients. This novel diffusion model may be useful for further understanding neuropathologic changes in patients with AD.</p>

<p>Despite the popularity of the continuous performance test (CPT) in the diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), its specificity, sensitivity, and ecological validity are still debated. To address some of the known shortcomings of traditional analysis and interpretation of CPT data, the present study applied a machine learning-based model (ML) using CPT indices for the Prediction of ADHD.Using a retrospective factorial fitting, followed by a bootstrap technique, we trained, cross-validated, and tested learning models on CPT performance data of 458 children aged 6–12 years (213 children with ADHD and 245 typically developed children). We used the MOXO-CPT version that included visual and auditory stimuli distractors. Results showed that the ML proposed model performed better and had a higher accuracy than the benchmark approach that used clinical data only. Using the CPT total score (that included all four indices: Attention, Timeliness, Hyperactivity, and Impulsiveness), as well as four control variables [age, gender, day of the week (DoW), time of day (ToD)], provided the most salient information for discriminating children with ADHD from their typically developed peers. This model had an accuracy rate of 87%, a sensitivity rate of 89%, and a specificity rate of 84%. This performance was 34% higher than the best-achieved accuracy of the benchmark model. The ML detection model could classify children with ADHD with high accuracy based on CPT performance. ML model of ADHD holds the promise of enhancing, perhaps complementing, behavioral assessment and may be used as a supportive measure in the evaluation of ADHD.</p>

<p>Objective: Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a common condition that is encountered in clinical practice, and yet, little is known about its characteristics and manifestations in the brain. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to use resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to investigate the spatial patterns of spontaneous brain activity in the brain of ONFH patients.</p><p>Methods: The study included ONFH patients and healthy controls. The pattern of intrinsic brain activity was measured by examining the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of blood oxygen level-dependent signals using rs-fMRI. Meanwhile, we also used Harris hip scores to evaluate the functional performance of ONFH patients and healthy controls.</p><p>Result: Ten ONFH patients and 10 health controls were investigated. We found global ALFF differences between the two groups throughout the occipital, parietal, frontal, prefrontal, and temporal cortices. In the ONFH patients, altered brain activity was found in the brain regions in the sensorimotor network, pain-related network, and emotion and cognition network. The results of the correlation investigations also demonstrated that the regions with ALFF changes had significant correlations with the functional performance of the patients evaluated by Harris hip scores.</p><p>Conclusions: Our study has revealed the abnormal pattern of brain activity in ONFH patients, and our findings could be used to aid in understanding the mechanisms behind the gait abnormality and intractable pain associated with ONFH at the central level.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.566418">K+ Channels in Primary Afferents and Their Role in Nerve Injury-Induced Pain</a></h4>

<p>Sensory abnormalities generated by nerve injury, peripheral neuropathy or disease are often expressed as neuropathic pain. This type of pain is frequently resistant to therapeutic intervention and may be intractable. Numerous studies have revealed the importance of enduring increases in primary afferent excitability and persistent spontaneous activity in the onset and maintenance of peripherally induced neuropathic pain. Some of this activity results from modulation, increased activity and /or expression of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide–gated (HCN) channels. K<sup>+</sup> channels expressed in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) include delayed rectifiers (K<sub>v</sub>1.1, 1.2), A-channels (K<sub>v</sub>1.4, 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3), KCNQ or M-channels (K<sub>v</sub>7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5), ATP-sensitive channels (K<sub>IR</sub>6.2), Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels (K<sub>Ca</sub>1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 3.1), Na<sup>+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels (K<sub>Ca</sub>4.1 and 4.2) and two pore domain leak channels (K<sub>2p</sub>; TWIK related channels). Function of all K<sup>+</sup> channel types is reduced via a multiplicity of processes leading to altered expression and/or post-translational modification. This also increases excitability of DRG cell bodies and nociceptive free nerve endings, alters axonal conduction and increases neurotransmitter release from primary afferent terminals in the spinal dorsal horn. Correlation of these cellular changes with behavioral studies provides almost indisputable evidence for K<sup>+</sup> channel dysfunction in the onset and maintenance of neuropathic pain. This idea is underlined by the observation that selective impairment of just one subtype of DRG K<sup>+</sup> channel can produce signs of pain in vivo. Whilst it is established that various mediators, including cytokines and growth factors bring about injury-induced changes in DRG function and excitability, evidence presently available points to a seminal role for interleukin 1β (IL-1β) in control of K<sup>+</sup> channel function. Despite the current state of knowledge, attempts to target K<sup>+</sup> channels for therapeutic pain management have met with limited success. This situation may change with the advent of personalized medicine. Identification of specific sensory abnormalities and genetic profiling of individual patients may predict therapeutic benefit of K<sup>+</sup> channel activators.</p>

<p>Determining biophysical details of spatially extended neurons is a challenge that needs to be overcome if we are to understand the dynamics of brain function from cellular perspectives. Moreover, we now know that we should not average across recordings from many cells of a given cell type to obtain quantitative measures such as conductance since measures can vary multiple-fold for a given cell type. In this work we examine whether a tight combination of experimental and computational work can address this challenge. The oriens-lacunosum/moleculare (OLM) interneuron operates as a “gate” that controls incoming sensory and ongoing contextual information in the CA1 of the hippocampus, making it essential to understand how its biophysical properties contribute to memory function. OLM cells fire phase-locked to the prominent hippocampal theta rhythms, and we previously used computational models to show that OLM cells exhibit high or low theta spiking resonance frequencies that depend respectively on whether their dendrites have hyperpolarization-activated cation channels (h-channels) or not. However, whether OLM cells actually possess dendritic h-channels is unknown at present. We performed a set of whole-cell recordings of OLM cells from mouse hippocampus and constructed three multi-compartment models using morphological and electrophysiological parameters extracted from the same OLM cell, including per-cell pharmacologically isolated h-channel currents. We found that the models best matched experiments when h-channels were present in the dendrites of each of the three model cells created. This strongly suggests that h-channels must be present in OLM cell dendrites and are not localized to their somata. Importantly, this work shows that a tight integration of model and experiment can help tackle the challenge of characterizing biophysical details and distributions in spatially extended neurons. Full spiking models were built for two of the OLM cells, matching their current clamp cell-specific electrophysiological recordings. Overall, our work presents a technical advancement in modeling OLM cells. Our models are available to the community to use to gain insight into cellular dynamics underlying hippocampal function.</p>

Synapses are fundamental information processing units that rely on voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Ca<sub>v</sub>) channels to trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent neurotransmitter release. Ca<sub>v</sub> channels also play Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent roles in other biological contexts, but whether they do so in axon terminals is unknown. Here, we addressed this unknown with respect to the requirement for Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 L-type channels for the formation of rod photoreceptor synapses in the retina. Using a mouse strain expressing a non-conducting mutant form of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4, we report that the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein, but not its Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance, is required for the molecular assembly of rod synapses; however, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are needed for the appropriate recruitment of postsynaptic partners. Our results support a model in which presynaptic Ca<sub>v</sub> channels serve both as organizers of synaptic building blocks and as sources of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions in building the first synapse of the visual pathway and perhaps more broadly in the nervous system.

By recording in the striatum and premotor cortex during a two-interval timing task, Zhou et al. show that, while both areas encode time, the dynamics in the striatum is more sequential. These neural sequences provide an ideal code for downstream areas to read out time in a biologically plausible manner.

<p>by Xue Zhang, Wangxin Xiao, Weijia Xiao</p>

Accurately predicting essential genes using computational methods can greatly reduce the effort in finding them via wet experiments at both time and resource scales, and further accelerate the process of drug discovery. Several computational methods have been proposed for predicting essential genes in model organisms by integrating multiple biological data sources either via centrality measures or machine learning based methods. However, the methods aiming to predict human essential genes are still limited and the performance still need improve. In addition, most of the machine learning based essential gene prediction methods are lack of skills to handle the imbalanced learning issue inherent in the essential gene prediction problem, which might be one factor affecting their performance. We propose a deep learning based method, DeepHE, to predict human essential genes by integrating features derived from sequence data and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. A deep learning based network embedding method is utilized to automatically learn features from PPI network. In addition, 89 sequence features were derived from DNA sequence and protein sequence for each gene. These two types of features are integrated to train a multilayer neural network. A cost-sensitive technique is used to address the imbalanced learning problem when training the deep neural network. The experimental results for predicting human essential genes show that our proposed method, DeepHE, can accurately predict human gene essentiality with an average performance of AUC higher than 94%, the area under precision-recall curve (AP) higher than 90%, and the accuracy higher than 90%. We also compare DeepHE with several widely used traditional machine learning models (SVM, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and Adaboost) using the same features and utilizing the same cost-sensitive technique to against the imbalanced learning issue. The experimental results show that DeepHE significantly outperforms the compared machine learning models. We have demonstrated that human essential genes can be accurately predicted by designing effective machine learning algorithm and integrating representative features captured from available biological data. The proposed deep learning framework is effective for such task.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cdGfRU0auNQ" width="1" />

<p>by Patrick C. Fiaux, Hsiuyi V. Chen, Poshen B. Chen, Aaron R. Chen, Graham McVicker</p>

CRISPR screens are a powerful technology for the identification of genome sequences that affect cellular phenotypes such as gene expression, survival, and proliferation. By targeting non-coding sequences for perturbation, CRISPR screens have the potential to systematically discover novel functional sequences, however, a lack of purpose-built analysis tools limits the effectiveness of this approach. Here we describe RELICS, a Bayesian hierarchical model for the discovery of functional sequences from CRISPR screens. RELICS specifically addresses many of the challenges of non-coding CRISPR screens such as the unknown locations of functional sequences, overdispersion in the observed single guide RNA counts, and the need to combine information across multiple pools in an experiment. RELICS outperforms existing methods with higher precision, higher recall, and finer-resolution predictions on simulated datasets. We apply RELICS to published CRISPR interference and CRISPR activation screens to predict and experimentally validate novel regulatory sequences that are missed by other analysis methods. In summary, RELICS is a powerful new analysis method for CRISPR screens that enables the discovery of functional sequences with unprecedented resolution and accuracy.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gx9Jskj0jyA" width="1" />

<p>by Kana Tsuneto, Haruka Endo, Fumika Shii, Ken Sasaki, Shinji Nagata, Ryoichi Sato</p>

Many herbivorous insects are mono- or oligophagous, having evolved to select a limited range of host plants. They specifically identify host-plant leaves using their keen sense of taste. Plant secondary metabolites and sugars are thought to be key chemical cues that enable insects to identify host plants and evaluate their quality as food. However, the neuronal and behavioral mechanisms of host-plant recognition are poorly understood. Here, we report a two-factor host acceptance system in larvae of the silkworm <i>Bombyx mori</i>, a specialist on several mulberry species. The first step is controlled by a chemosensory organ, the maxillary palp (MP). During palpation at the leaf edge, the MP detects trace amounts of leaf-surface compounds, which enables host-plant recognition without biting. Chemosensory neurons in the MP are tuned with ultrahigh sensitivity (thresholds of attomolar to femtomolar) to chlorogenic acid (CGA), quercetin glycosides, and β-sitosterol (βsito). Only if these 3 compounds are detected does the larva make a test bite, which is evaluated in the second step. Low-sensitivity neurons in another chemosensory organ, the maxillary galea (MG), mainly detect sucrose in the leaf sap exuded by test biting, allowing larvae to accept the leaf and proceed to persistent biting (feeding). The two-factor host acceptance system reported here may commonly underlie stereotyped feeding behavior in many phytophagous insects and determine their feeding habits.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/cbLNpcTi0PE" width="1" />

<p>Primary mechanosensory afferents serve as the first level of signal processing at the somatosensory periphery and provide information about behaviorally relevant stimulus features. Here, we show that the mechanosensory Rohon‐Beard (RB) neurons in larval zebrafish are rapidly adapting cells that can signal stimulus onset and offset and encode stimulus intensity implementing rate and temporal coding mechanisms. We also revealed a rostrocaudal variation in both morphology and physiology within the RB neuron population, which offers insights on what signals RBs carry into central circuits and on their role in locomotor behaviors.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Primary mechanosensory neurons play an important role in converting mechanical forces into the sense of touch. In zebrafish, Rohon‐Beard (RB) neurons serve this role at embryonic and larval stages of development. Here we examine the morphology and physiology of RBs in larval zebrafish to better understand how mechanosensory stimuli are represented along the spinal cord. We report that the morphology of RB neurons differs along the rostrocaudal body axis. Rostral RB neurons arborize in the skin near the cell body whereas caudal cells arborize at a distance posterior to their cell body. Using a novel electrophysiological approach, we also found longitudinal differences in the mechanosensitivity and physiological properties of RB neurons. Rostral RB neurons respond to mechanical stimulations close to the soma and produce up to three spikes with increasing stimulus intensity, whereas caudal cells respond at more distal locations and can produce four or more spikes when the intensity of the mechanical stimulus increases. The mechanosensory properties of RB neurons are consistent with those of rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors and can signal the onset, offset and intensity of mechanical stimulation. This is the first report of the intensity encoding properties of RB neurons, where an increase in spike number and a decrease in spike latency are observed with increasing stimulation intensity. This study reveals an unappreciated complexity of the larval zebrafish mechanosensory system and demonstrates how differences in the morphological and physiological properties of RBs related to their rostrocaudal location, which can influence the signals that enter the spinal cord.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adipose tissue plays an important role in metabolic homeostasis and its prominent role as endocrine organ is now well‐recognized. Adipose tissue is controlled via the sympathetic nervous system. New viral, molecular‐genetic tools will soon allow a more detailed study of adipose tissue innervation in metabolic function, yet, the precise anatomical extent of pre‐and postganglionic inputs to the inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) is limited. Furthermore, several viral, molecular‐genetic tools will require the use of cre/loxP mouse models, while the available studies on sympathetic iWAT innervation were established in larger species. In this study, we generated a detailed map for the sympathetic innervation of iWAT in male and female mice. We adapted iDISCO tissue clearing to process large, whole‐body specimens for an unprecedented view of the natural abdominal sympathetic nervous system. Combined with pseudorabies virus retrograde tracing from the iWAT, we defined the pre‐and postganglionic sympathetic input to iWAT. We used fluorescence‐guided anatomical dissections of sympathetic nerves in reporter mice to further clarify that postganglionic axons connect to iWAT via lateral cutaneous rami (dorsolumbar iWAT portion) and the lumbar plexus (inguinal iWAT portion). Importantly, these rami carry axons that branch to iWAT, as well as axons that travel further to innervate the skin and vasculature, and their functional impact will require consideration in denervation studies. Our study may serve as a comprehensive map for future experiments that employ virally‐driven neuromodulation techniques to predict anatomy‐based viral labeling.</p>

<p>The forebrain song nuclei in adult songbirds exhibit distinct myelination patterns, yet little is known about myelin development. We demonstrate different developmental rates and final levels of myelination across five major song nuclei. This differential myelin development could contribute to different aspects of song acquisition and production.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Songbirds learn vocalizations by hearing and practicing songs. As song develops, the tempo becomes faster and more precise. In the songbird brain, discrete nuclei form interconnected myelinated circuits that control song acquisition and production. The myelin sheath increases the speed of action potential propagation by insulating the axons of neurons and by reducing membrane capacitance. As the brain develops, myelin increases in density, but the time course of myelin development across discrete song nuclei has not been systematically studied in a quantitative fashion. We tested the hypothesis that myelination develops differentially across time and song nuclei. We examined myelin development in the brains of the zebra finch (<i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>) from chick at posthatch day (d) 8 to adult (up to 147 d) in five major song nuclei: HVC (proper name), robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), Area X, lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium, and medial portion of the dorsolateral thalamic nucleus (DLM). All of these nuclei showed an increase in the density of myelination during development but at different rates and to different final degrees. Exponential curve fits revealed that DLM showed earlier myelination than other nuclei, and HVC showed the slowest myelination of song nuclei. Together, these data show differential maturation of myelination in different portions of the song system. Such differential maturation would be well placed to play a role in regulating the development of learned song.</p>

Background<p>Neuropathological studies have revealed copper and iron accumulation in the deep gray matter (DGM) nuclei of patients with Wilson’s disease (WD). However, the association between metal accumulation and neurodegeneration in WD has not been well studied in vivo. The study was aimed to investigate whether metal accumulation in the DGM was associated with the structural and functional changes of DGM in neurological WD patients.</p>Methods<p>Seventeen neurological WD patients and 20 healthy controls were recruited for the study. Mean bulk susceptibility values and volumes of DGM were obtained from quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). Regions of interest including the head of the caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, putamen, thalamus, substantia nigra, red nucleus, and dentate nucleus were manually segmented. The susceptibility values and volumes of DGM in different groups were compared using a linear regression model. Correlations between susceptibility values and volumes of DGM and Unified Wilson’s Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS) neurological subscores were investigated.</p>Results<p>The susceptibility values of all examined DGM in WD patients were higher than those in healthy controls (P &lt; 0.05). Volume reductions were observed in the head of the caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, putamen, thalamus, and substantia nigra of WD patients (P &lt; 0.001). Susceptibility values were negatively correlated with the volumes of the head of the caudate nucleus (r<sub>p</sub> = −0.657, P = 0.037), putamen (r<sub>p</sub> = −0.667, P = 0.037), and thalamus (r<sub>p</sub> = −0.613, P = 0.046) in WD patients. UWDRS neurological subscores were positively correlated with the susceptibility values of all examined DGM. The susceptibility values of putamen, head of the caudate nucleus, and dentate nucleus could well predict UWDRS neurological subscores.</p>Conclusion<p>Our study provided in vivo evidence that paramagnetic metal accumulation in the DGM was associated with DGM atrophy and neurological impairment. The susceptibility of DGM could be used as a biomarker to assess the severity of neurodegeneration in WD.</p>

<p>MRI-based oxygen extraction fraction imaging has a great potential benefit in the selection of clinical strategies for ischemic stroke patients. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of a challenge-free oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) mapping in a cohort of acute and subacute ischemic stroke patients. Consecutive ischemic stroke patients (a total of 30 with 5 in the acute stage, 19 in the early subacute stage, and 6 in the late subacute stage) were recruited. All subjects underwent MRI including multi-echo gradient echo (mGRE), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and 3D-arterial spin labeling (ASL). OEF maps were generated from mGRE phase + magnitude data, which were processed using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) + quantitative blood oxygen level-dependent (qBOLD) imaging with cluster analysis of time evolution. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were reconstructed from 3D-ASL and DWI, respectively. Further, cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO<sub>2</sub>) was calculated as the product of CBF and OEF. OEF, CMRO<sub>2</sub>, CBF, and ADC values in the ischemic cores (absolute values) and their contrasts to the contralateral regions (relative values) were evaluated. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare OEF, CMRO<sub>2</sub>, CBF, and ADC values and their relative values among different stroke stages. The OEF value of infarct core showed a trend of decrease from acute, to early subacute, and to late subacute stages of ischemic stroke. Significant differences among the three stroke stages were only observed in the absolute OEF (F = 6.046, p = 0.005) and relative OEF (F = 5.699, p = 0.009) values of the ischemic core, but not in other measurements (absolute and relative CMRO<sub>2</sub>, CBF, ADC values, all values of p &gt; 0.05). In conclusion, the challenge-free QSM + qBOLD-generated OEF mapping can be performed on stroke patients. It can provide more information on tissue viability that was not available with CBF and ADC and, thus, may help to better manage ischemic stroke patients.</p>

<p>Rapid aiming movements are typically used to study upper limb motor control and development. Despite the large corpus of work in this area, few studies have examined kinematic manual asymmetries in children who have just started formal schooling and until now, none have characterized how children coordinate their joints to complete these movements (i.e., interjoint coordination). In the present study, manual asymmetries in kinematics and interjoint coordination in strongly right-handed 6-year-old children were investigated when reaching for ipsilateral and contralateral targets with their dominant right arm and the non-dominant left arm. Overall, manual asymmetries in interjoint coordination are apparent for both 6-year-old children and young adults, although young children completed the task by adopting a different strategy than adults. Also, control strategies employed by 6-year-old children were influenced by both the location of the target as well as the arm used to perform the task. Specifically, compared to all other conditions, children’s trajectories were more curved when performing contralateral movements with the non-dominant left arm, which were driven by smaller shoulder excursions combined with larger elbow excursions for this condition. Based on these results, we argue that the differences in interjoint coordination reflect the stage of development of 6-year-old children, the origin of which derives from maturational (e.g., hand dominance) and environmental factors (e.g., school-based experience).</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00268">Sex Differences in Dendritic Spine Formation in the Hippocampus and Animal Behaviors in a Mouse Model of Hyperthyroidism</a></h4>

<p>Thyroid hormones are critical for the regulation of development and differentiation of neurons and glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS). We have previously reported the sex-dependent changes of glial morphology in the brain under the state of hyperthyroidism. Here, we examined sex-dependent changes in spine structure of granule neurons in the dentate gyrus of hippocampus in male and female mice with hyperthyroidism. Using FIB/SEM (focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy), three-dimensional reconstructed structures of dendritic spines in dentate granule cells were analyzed. Dendritic spine density in granule cells increased significantly in both male and female mice with hyperthyroidism. The decrease in spine volume was observed only in female mice. These findings suggest that hyperthyroidism induces the formation of spines with normal size in male mice but the formation of spines with small size in female mice. To evaluate an outcome of neuronal and previously observed glial changes, behavioral tests were performed. Male mice with hyperthyroidism showed increased locomotor activity in the open field test, while female mice showed elevated immobility time in the tail suspension test, reflecting depression-like behavior. Although direct link between changes in spine and behavioral modifications requires further analysis, our results may help to understand gender-dependent neurological and psychological symptoms observed in patients with hyperthyroidism.</p>

<p>The ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPM) is amandatory relay for orofacial sensory information targeting the primary somatosensory cortex. We characterized the morphology of VPM axons arising in the principal trigeminal sensory nucleus (pV) through injections of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) placed in pV of Macaca fascicularis and mulatta monkeys. Labeled terminals formed a patchy bilateral distribution. Within contralateral VPM, patches were found primarily, but not exclusively, within the laterally located, vertical segment, and in ipsilateral VPM, primarily, but not exclusively, in the medially located, horizontal segment. Two fiber types were labeled: thin and thick. Thin fibers were poorly branched and diffusely distributed. They were studded with small en passant boutons. Most labeled fibers were thick and they branched extensively to form distinctive terminal arbors decorated with numerous boutons that varied in size and shape. Quantitative analysis of thick fiber arbor features showed little difference between the sides, although contralateral boutons were significantly larger than ipsilateral ones. Bouton distribution with respect to counterstained somata suggests that proximal dendrites are their main target. Indeed, ultrastructural examination demonstrated that they provide large diameter dendrites with numerous contacts. Direct comparison of thick fiber terminal arbors to cytochrome oxidase (CO) staining revealed that these arbors are much smaller than individual CO-rich patches believed to designate rods containing discrete body area representations. Thus, each terminal arbor appears to heavily innervate a small number of VPM neurons within a rod. This relationship would serve to maintain relatively small receptive fields within the topographic representation of the face.</p>

<p>Previous studies have introduced the concept of “SuperAgers,” defined as older adults with youthful memory performance associated with the increased cortical thickness of the anterior cingulate cortex. Given that age-related structural brain changes are observed earlier in the white matter (WM) than in the cortical areas, we investigated whether WM integrity is different between the SuperAgers (SA) and typical agers (TA) and whether it is associated with superior memory performance as well as a healthy lifestyle. A total of 35 SA and 55 TA were recruited for this study. Further, 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), neuropsychological tests, and lifestyle factors related to cognitive function, such as physical activity and duration of sleep, were evaluated in all participants. SA was defined as individuals demonstrating the youthful performance of verbal and visual memory, as measured by the Seoul Verbal Learning Test (SVLT) and the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (RCFT), respectively. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis was used to compare the diffusion values such as fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD) between the SA and TA. SA exhibited better performance in memory, attention, visuospatial, and frontal executive functions than the TA did. SA also exhibited greater amounts of physical activity than the TA did. As compared to TA, SA demonstrated higher FA with lower MD, RD, and AD in the corpus callosum and higher FA and lower RD in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), which is significantly associated with memory function. Interestingly, FA values of the body of corpus callosum were correlated with the amount of physical activity. Our findings suggest that WM integrity of the corpus callosum is associated with superior memory function and a higher level of physical activities in SA compared to TA.</p>

Calcium imaging with fluorescent protein sensors is widely used to record activity in neuronal populations. The transform between neural activity and calcium-related fluorescence involves nonlinearities and low-pass filtering, but the effects of the transformation on analyses of neural populations are not well understood. We compared neuronal spikes and fluorescence in matched neural populations in behaving mice. We report multiple discrepancies between analyses performed on the two types of data, including changes in single-neuron selectivity and population decoding. These were only partially resolved by spike inference algorithms applied to fluorescence. To model the relation between spiking and fluorescence we simultaneously recorded spikes and fluorescence from individual neurons. Using these recordings we developed a model transforming spike trains to synthetic-imaging data. The model recapitulated the differences in analyses. Our analysis highlights challenges in relating electrophysiology and imaging data, and suggests forward modeling as an effective way to understand differences between these data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WfFiXxFx2eI" width="1" />

<p>by Nimrod Rappoport, Roy Safra, Ron Shamir</p>

Recent advances in experimental biology allow creation of datasets where several genome-wide data types (called omics) are measured per sample. Integrative analysis of multi-omic datasets in general, and clustering of samples in such datasets specifically, can improve our understanding of biological processes and discover different disease subtypes. In this work we present MONET (Multi Omic clustering by Non-Exhaustive Types), which presents a unique approach to multi-omic clustering. MONET discovers modules of similar samples, such that each module is allowed to have a clustering structure for only a subset of the omics. This approach differs from most existent multi-omic clustering algorithms, which assume a common structure across all omics, and from several recent algorithms that model distinct cluster structures. We tested MONET extensively on simulated data, on an image dataset, and on ten multi-omic cancer datasets from TCGA. Our analysis shows that MONET compares favorably with other multi-omic clustering methods. We demonstrate MONET's biological and clinical relevance by analyzing its results for Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma. We also show that MONET is robust to missing data, can cluster genes in multi-omic dataset, and reveal modules of cell types in single-cell multi-omic data. Our work shows that MONET is a valuable tool that can provide complementary results to those provided by existent algorithms for multi-omic analysis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ML7KYz11EQ0" width="1" />

<p>by Kaitlin Ching, Tim Stearns</p>

Olfaction in most animals is mediated by neurons bearing cilia that are accessible to the environment. Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in chordates usually have multiple cilia, each with a centriole at its base. OSNs differentiate from stem cells in the olfactory epithelium, and how the epithelium generates cells with many centrioles is not yet understood. We show that centrioles are amplified via centriole rosette formation in both embryonic development and turnover of the olfactory epithelium in adult mice, and rosette-bearing cells often have free centrioles in addition. Cells with amplified centrioles can go on to divide, with centrioles clustered at each pole. Additionally, we found that centrioles are amplified in immediate neuronal precursors (INPs) concomitant with elevation of mRNA for polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4) and SCL/Tal1-interrupting locus gene (Stil), key regulators of centriole duplication. These results support a model in which centriole amplification occurs during a transient state characterized by elevated Plk4 and Stil in early INP cells. These cells then go on to divide at least once to become OSNs, demonstrating that cell division with amplified centrioles, known to be tolerated in disease states, can occur as part of a normal developmental program.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3ahmJn3nuIU" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Ablation/segmental loss peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs) exhibit poor functional recovery due to slow and inaccurate outgrowth of regenerating axons. Viable peripheral nerve allografts (PNAs) as growth‐guide conduits are immunologically rejected and all anucleated donor/host axonal segments undergo Wallerian degeneration. In contrast, we report that ablation‐type sciatic PNIs repaired by neurorrhaphy of viable sciatic PNAs and a polyethylene glycol (PEG)‐fusion protocol using PEG immediately restored axonal continuity for many axons, reinnervated/maintained their neuromuscular junctions, and prevented much Wallerian degeneration. PEG‐fused PNAs permanently restored many sciatic‐mediated behaviors within 2–6 weeks. PEG‐fused PNAs were not rejected even though host/donors were neither immunosuppressed nor tissue‐matched in outbred female Sprague Dawley rats. Innate and adaptive immune responses to PEG‐fused sciatic PNAs were analyzed using electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for morphological features, T cell and macrophage infiltration, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression, apoptosis, expression of cytokines, chemokines, and cytotoxic effectors. PEG‐fused PNAs exhibited attenuated innate and adaptive immune responses by 14–21 days postoperatively, as evidenced by (a) many axons and cells remaining viable, (b) significantly reduced infiltration of cytotoxic and total T cells and macrophages, (c) significantly reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and MHC proteins, (d) consistently low apoptotic response. Morphologically and/or biochemically, PEG‐fused sciatic PNAs often resembled sciatic <i>autografts</i> or intact sciatic nerves. In brief, PEG‐fused PNAs are an unstudied, perhaps unique, example of immune tolerance of viable allograft tissue in a nonimmune‐privileged environment and could greatly improve the clinical outcomes for PNIs relative to current protocols.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Patterns of change in whole‐brain functional networks remain poorly understood in patients with end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing hemodialysis (HD). We conducted a prospective research to investigate the topological properties of whole‐brain functional networks in those patients using a graph‐based network analysis. Resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 51 ESRD patients (25 HD and 26 nondialysis patients) and 36 healthy controls (HCs). We compared the topological properties of brain functional networks among the three groups, and analyzed the relationships between those significant parameters and clinical variables in ESRD patients. Progressively disrupted global topological organizations were observed from nondialysis patients to HD patients compared with HCs (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05 after Bonferroni correction). HD patients, relative to HCs, showed significantly decreased nodal centralities in the left temporal pole: superior temporal gyrus, bilateral median cingulate and paracingulate gyri, bilateral hippocampus, bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, and bilateral amygdala, and showed increased nodal centralities in the orbital part of the bilateral middle frontal gyrus, left cuneus, and left superior occipital gyrus (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05 after Bonferroni correction). Furthermore, nodal centralities in the bilateral hippocampus were significantly decreased in HD patients compared with nondialysis patients (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05 after Bonferroni correction). Dialysis duration negatively correlated with global efficiency in ESRD patients undergoing HD (<i>r</i> = −0.676, FDR <i>q</i> = 0.004). This study indicates that ESRD patients exhibit disruptions in brain functional networks, which are more severe in HD patients, and these alterations are correlated with cognitive performance and clinical markers.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Depression is a mental disorder that affects millions of people around the world. However, depressive symptoms can be seen in other psychiatric and medical conditions. Here, we investigate the effect of DHEA treatment on depressive symptoms in individuals with depression and/or other clinical conditions in which depressive symptoms are present. An electronic search was performed until October 2019, with no restrictions on language or year of publication in the following databases: Medline, EMBASE, LILACS, and Cochrane Library. Randomized controlled trials comparing DHEA versus placebo were included if the depressive symptoms were assessed. Fifteen studies with 853 female and male individuals were included in this review. To conduct the meta‐analysis, data were extracted from 14 studies. In comparison with placebo, DHEA improved depressive symptoms (standardized mean difference [SMD] −0.28, 95% (CI) −0.45 to −0.11, <i>p</i> =.001, 12 studies, 742 individuals (375 in the experimental group and 367 in the placebo group), <i>I</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 24%), very low quality of evidence, 2 of 14 studies reporting this outcome were removed in a sensitivity analysis as they were strongly influencing heterogeneity between studies. No hormonal changes that indicated any risk to the participants' health were seen. Side effects observed were uncommon, mild, and transient, but commonly related to androgyny. In conclusion, DHEA was associated with a beneficial effect on depressive symptoms compared to placebo. However, these results should be viewed with caution, since the quality of evidence for this outcome was considered very low according to the GRADE criteria.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Co‐transmission of glutamate by brain dopaminergic (DA) neurons was recently proposed as a potential factor influencing cell survival in models of Parkinson's disease. Intriguingly, brain DA nuclei are differentially affected in Parkinson's disease. Whether this is associated with different patterns of co‐expression of the glutamatergic phenotype along the rostrocaudal brain axis is unknown in mammals. We hypothesized that, as in zebrafish, the glutamatergic phenotype is present preferentially in the caudal mesodiencephalic DA nuclei. Here, we used in mice a cell fate mapping strategy based on reporter protein expression (ZsGreen) consecutive to previous expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (<i>Vglut2</i>) gene, coupled with immunofluorescence experiments against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or dopamine transporter (DAT). We found three expression patterns in DA cells, organized along the rostrocaudal brain axis. The first pattern (TH‐positive, DAT‐positive, ZsGreen‐positive) was found in A8–A10. The second pattern (TH‐positive, DAT‐negative, ZsGreen‐positive) was found in A11. The third pattern (TH‐positive, DAT‐negative, ZsGreen‐negative) was found in A12–A13. These patterns should help to refine the establishment of the homology of DA nuclei between vertebrate species. Our results also uncover that <i>Vglut2</i> is expressed at some point during cell lifetime in DA nuclei known to degenerate in Parkinson's disease and largely absent from those that are preserved, suggesting that co‐expression of the glutamatergic phenotype in DA cells influences their survival in Parkinson's disease.</p>

<p>Axon terminal branches, originating from the ventral hippocampus and distributed in the prefrontal cortex, undergo more frequent bifurcation but bear less numerous varicosities, which are putative synaptic sites, in Alzheimer's than wild‐type mice. This projection appears to be more widely spread, with scantier synapses, and therefore diluted in Alzheimer's mice.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Emotional dysregulation often accompanies cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hippocampus, most notably damaged by AD pathology, is classified into the cognition‐bound posterior and emotion‐bound anterior hippocampi. Since the anterior hippocampus or its rodent counterpart, the ventral hippocampus (VH), sends dense afferents to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA), the two structures implicated in fear responses, we investigated whether these afferents are modified in 3xTg AD model mice. An anterograde dextrin tracer injected into VH revealed that axons in PFC were more ramified in 3xTg than wild‐type (WT) mice, with the synaptic density reduced. The VH projections to BLA were not affected. Intracellular accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) or Aβ‐like immunoreactivity was found in PFC and BLA neurons alike. Behaviorally, in the 2‐way active avoidance test, the frequency of chamber change was higher, with the test performance better, in 3xTg than WT mice, suggesting a distorted contextual fear in the 3xTg group. Given the essential involvement of parts of PFC in contextual fear responses and that of BLA in fear responses in general, the observed remodeling of VH‐to‐PFC afferents and the accumulation of intracellular Aβ in BLA and PFC pyramidal cells might exercise critical influences on enhanced avoidance behavior in 3xTg mice.</p>

<p>Over the last 20 years, it has been shown that complex signaling cascades are involved in zinc excitotoxicity. Free zinc rapidly induces PKC activation, which causes reactive oxygen species (ROS) production at least in part through NADPH oxidase. It also promotes neuronal nitric oxide synthase, thereby increasing nitric oxide (NO) production. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation and Egr-1 transcription factor activity were quickly induced by zinc, too. These concurrent actions of kinases consequently produce oxygen free radical, ROS, and NO, which may cause severe DNA damage. Following the excessive activity of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 depletes NAD<sup>+</sup>/ATP in the cells. Zinc excitotoxicity exhibits distinct characteristics of apoptosis, too. Activation of caspase-3 is induced by liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-AMP-activated kinase (AMPK)-Bim cascade signaling and induction of p75NTR receptors and p75NTR-associated Death Executor. Thus, zinc excitotoxicity is a mechanism of neuronal cell death showing various cell death patterns. In addition to the above signaling cascades, individual intracellular organelles also play a crucial role in zinc excitotoxicity. Mitochondria and lysosomes function as zinc reservoirs, and as such, are capable of regulating zinc concentration in the cytoplasm. However, when loaded with too much zinc, they may undergo mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, and lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), both of which are well-established mechanisms of cell death. Since zinc excitotoxicity has been reported to be associated with acute brain injuries, including stroke, trauma, and epilepsy, we performed to find the novel AMPK inhibitors as therapeutic agents for these diseases. Since we thought acute brain injury has complicated neuronal death pathways, we tried to see the neuroprotection against zinc excitotoxicity, calcium-overload excitotoxicity, oxidative damage, and apoptosis. We found that two chemicals showed significant neuroprotection against all cellular neurotoxic models we tested. Finally, we observed the reduction of infarct volume in a rat model of brain injury after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). In this review, we introduced the AMPK-mediated cell death mechanism and novel strategy for the development of stroke therapeutics. The hope is that this understanding would provide a rationale for acute brain injury and eventually find new therapeutics.</p>

<p>Manganese (Mn), an essential micronutrient, acts as a cofactor for multiple enzymes. Epidemiological investigations have shown that an excessive level of Mn is an important environmental factor involved in neurotoxicity. Frequent pollution of air and water by Mn is a serious threat to the health of the population. Overexposure to Mn is particularly detrimental to the central nervous system, leading to symptoms similar to several neurological disorders. Many different mechanisms have been implicated in Mn-induced neurotoxicity, including oxidative/nitrosative stress, toxic protein aggregation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, dysregulation of autophagy, and the apoptotic cascade, which together promote the progressive neurodegeneration of nerve cells. As a compensatory regulatory mechanism, autophagy plays dual roles in various biological activities under pathological stress conditions. Dysregulation of autophagy is involved in the development of neurodegenerative disorders, with recent emerging evidence indicating a strong, complex relationship between autophagy and Mn-induced neurotoxicity. This review discusses the connection between autophagy and Mn-induced neurotoxicity, especially alpha-synuclein oligomerization, ER stress, and aberrated protein S-nitrosylation, which will provide new insights to profoundly explore the precise mechanisms of Mn-induced neurotoxicity.</p>

<p>Moderate exercise and mild hypothermia have protective effects against brain injury and neurodegeneration. Running in a cold environment alters exercise-induced hyperthermia and outcomes; however, evaluations of post-exercise cold exposure related to exercise benefits for the brain are relatively rare. We investigated the effects of 4°C cold exposure after exercise on exercise-induced thermal responses and neuroprotection in an MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)-induced Parkinsonian mouse model. Male C57BL/6J mice were pretreated with MPTP for five consecutive days and follow-up treadmill exercise for 4 weeks. After 1-h running at a 22°C temperature, the mice were exposed to a 4°C environment for 2 h. An MPTP injection induced a transient drop in body and brain temperatures, while mild brain hypothermia was found to last for 4 weeks after MPTP treatment. Preventing brain hypothermia by exercise or 4°C exposure was associated with an improvement in MPTP-induced striatal uncoupling protein 4 (UCP4) downregulation and nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration. However, 4°C exposure after exercise abrogated the exercise-induced beneficial effects and thermal responses in MPTP-treated mice, including a low amplitude of exercise-induced brain hyperthermia and body temperature while at rest after exercise. Our findings elucidate that post-exercise thermoregulation and UCP4 expression are important in the neuroprotective effects of exercise against MPTP toxicity.</p>

Purpose<p>To investigate the baseline values and differences for susceptibility and volume of the mammillary bodies between mild cognitively impaired (MCI) patients and healthy controls (HCs), and further explore their differences in relation to gender, MCI subtypes and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes.</p>Methods<p>T1-weighted and multi-echo gradient echo imaging sequences were acquired on a 3T MR scanner to evaluate the T1W based volume and susceptibility differences in the mammillary body for 47 MCI and 47 HCs. T-tests were performed to compare volume and susceptibility between groups, and right and left hemispheres. Correlation analysis was used to relate the volume and mean susceptibility as a function of age in MCI and HC groups separately, and to investigate the relationship of susceptibility with the neuro-psychological scales in the MCI group.</p>Results<p>Susceptibility was found to be elevated within the right mammillary body in MCI patients compared to HCs (p &lt; 0.05). There were no differences for the mammillary body volumes between the MCI and HC groups, although there was a reduction in volume with age for the MCI group (p = 0.007). Women showed decreased mammillary body volume compared to men in the HC group (p = 0.004). No significant differences were found in relation to MCI subtypes and APOE genotypes. No significant correlations were observed between mammillary body susceptibility with neuro-psychological scales.</p>Conclusion<p>This work provides a quantitative baseline for both the volume and susceptibility of the mammillary body which can be used for future studies of cognitive impairment patients underlying the pathology of the Papez circuit.</p>

<p>Dyskinesia associated with chronic levodopa treatment in Parkinson’s disease is associated with maladaptive striatal plasticity. The objective of this study was to examine whether macroscale structural changes, as captured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) accompany this plasticity and to identify plausible cellular contributors in a rodent model of levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were rendered hemi-parkinsonian by stereotaxic injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the left medial forebrain bundle prior to chronic treatment with saline (control) or levodopa to induce abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs), reflective of dyskinesia. Perfusion-fixed brains underwent ex vivo structural MRI before sectioning and staining for cellular markers. Chronic treatment with levodopa induced significant AIMs (p &lt; 0.0001 versus saline). The absolute volume of the ipsilateral, lesioned striatum was increased in levodopa-treated rats resulting in a significant difference in percentage volume change when compared to saline-treated rats (p &lt; 0.01). Moreover, a significant positive correlation was found between this volume change and AIMs scores for individual levodopa-treated rats (r = 0.96; p &lt; 0.01). The density of Iba1+ cells was increased within the lesioned versus intact striatum (p &lt; 0.01) with no difference between treatment groups. Conversely, Iba1+ microglia soma size was significantly increased (p &lt; 0.01) in the lesioned striatum of levodopa-treated but not saline-treated rats. Soma size was not, however, significantly correlated with either AIMs or MRI volume change. Although GFAP+ astrocytes were elevated in the lesioned versus intact striatum (p &lt; 0.001), there was no difference between treatment groups. No statistically significant effects of either lesion or treatment on RECA1, a marker for blood vessels, were observed. Collectively, these data suggest chronic levodopa treatment in 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned rats is associated with increased striatal volume that correlates with the development of AIMs. The accompanying increase in number and size of microglia, however, cannot alone explain this volume expansion. Further multi-modal studies are warranted to establish the brain-wide effects of chronic levodopa treatment.</p>

Background and Purpose<p>Derangements in brain glutamate, glutathione, and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) are implicated in a range of neurological disorders. Reliable methods to measure these compounds non-invasively in vivo are needed. We evaluated the reproducibility of their measurements in brain regions involved in the default mode network using quantitative MRS at 7-Tesla in healthy individuals.</p>Methods<p>Ten right-handed healthy volunteers underwent 7-Tesla MRI scans on 2 separate days, not more than 2 weeks apart. On each day two scanning sessions took place, with a re-positioning break in between. High-resolution isotropic anatomical scans were acquired prior to each scan, followed by single-voxel <sup>1</sup>H-MRS using the STEAM pulse sequence on an 8 mL midline cubic voxel, positioned over the posterior cingulate and precuneus regions. Concentrations were corrected for partial-volume effects.</p>Results<p>Maximal Cramér-Rao lower bounds for glutamate, glutathione, and GABA were 2.0, 8.0, and 14.0%, respectively. Mean coefficients of variation within sessions were 5.9 ± 4.8%, 9.3 ± 7.6%, and 11.5 ± 8.8%, and between sessions were 4.6 ± 4.5%, 8.3 ± 5.7%, and 9.2 ± 8.7%, respectively. The mean (±SD) Dice’s coefficient for voxel overlap was 90 ± 4% within sessions and 86 ± 7% between sessions.</p>Conclusion<p>Glutamate, glutathione, and GABA can be reliably quantified using STEAM MRS at 7-Tesla from the posterior cingulate and precuneus cortices of healthy human subjects. STEAM MRS at 7-Tesla may be used to study the metabolic behavior of this important resting-state hub in various disease states.</p>

<p>A severe brain injury may lead to a disorder of consciousness (DOC) such as coma, vegetative state (VS), minimally conscious state (MCS) or locked-in syndrome (LIS). Till date, the diagnosis of DOC relies only on clinical evaluation or subjective scoring systems such as Glasgow coma scale, which fails to detect subtle changes and thereby results in diagnostic errors. The high rate of misdiagnosis and inability to predict the recovery of consciousness for DOC patients have created a huge research interest in the assessment of consciousness. Researchers have explored the use of various stimulation and neuroimaging techniques to improve the diagnosis. In this article, we present the important findings of resting-state as well as sensory stimulation methods and highlight the stimuli proven to be successful in the assessment of consciousness. Primarily, we review the literature based on (a) application/non-use of stimuli (i.e., sensory stimulation/resting state-based), (b) type of stimulation used (i.e., auditory, visual, tactile, olfactory, or mental-imagery), (c) electrophysiological signal used (EEG/ERP, fMRI, PET, EMG, SCL, or ECG). Among the sensory stimulation methods, auditory stimulation has been extensively used, since it is easier to conduct for these patients. Olfactory and tactile stimulation have been less explored and need further research. Emotionally charged stimuli such as subject’s own name or narratives in a familiar voice or subject’s own face/family pictures or music result in stronger responses than neutral stimuli. Studies based on resting state analysis have employed measures like complexity, power spectral features, entropy and functional connectivity patterns to distinguish between the VS and MCS patients. Resting-state EEG and fMRI are the state-of-the-art techniques and have a huge potential in predicting the recovery of coma patients. Further, EMG and mental-imagery based studies attempt to obtain volitional responses from the VS patients and thus could detect their command-following capability. This may provide an effective means to communicate with these patients. Recent studies have employed fMRI and PET to understand the brain-activation patterns corresponding to the mental imagery. This review promotes our knowledge about the techniques used for the diagnosis of patients with DOC and attempts to provide ideas for future research.</p>

<p>Resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) creates a rich four-dimensional data set that can be analyzed in a variety of ways. As more researchers come to view the brain as a complex dynamical system, tools are increasingly being drawn from other fields to characterize the complexity of the brain’s activity. However, given that the signal measured with rs-fMRI arises from the hemodynamic response to neural activity, the extent to which complexity metrics reflect neural complexity as compared to signal properties related to image quality remains unknown. To provide some insight into this question, correlation dimension, approximate entropy and Lyapunov exponent were calculated for different rs-fMRI scans from the same subject to examine their reliability. The metrics of complexity were then compared to several properties of the rs-fMRI signal from each brain area to determine if basic signal features could explain differences in the complexity metrics. Differences in complexity across brain areas were highly reliable and were closely linked to differences in the frequency profiles of the rs-fMRI signal. The spatial distributions of the complexity and frequency metrics suggest that they are both influenced by location-dependent signal properties that can obscure changes related to neural activity.</p>

<p>Increasingly, neuroimaging researchers are exploring the use of real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) as a way to access a participant’s ongoing brain function throughout a scan. This approach presents novel and exciting experimental applications ranging from monitoring data quality in real time, to delivering neurofeedback from a region of interest, to dynamically controlling experimental flow, or interfacing with remote devices. Yet, for those interested in adopting this method, the existing software options are few and limited in application. This presents a barrier for new users, as well as hinders existing users from refining techniques and methods. Here we introduce a free, open-source rt-fMRI package, the Pyneal toolkit, designed to address this limitation. The Pyneal toolkit is python-based software that offers a flexible and user friendly framework for rt-fMRI, is compatible with all three major scanner manufacturers (GE, Siemens, Phillips), and, critically, allows fully customized analysis pipelines. In this article, we provide a detailed overview of the architecture, describe how to set up and run the Pyneal toolkit during an experimental session, offer tutorials with scan data that demonstrate how data flows through the Pyneal toolkit with example analyses, and highlight the advantages that the Pyneal toolkit offers to the neuroimaging community.</p>

<p>The effects of musical practice on cognition are well established yet rarely compared with other kinds of artistic training or expertise. This study aims to compare the possible effect of musical and theater regular practice on cognition across the lifespan. Both of these artistic activities require many hours of individual or collective training in order to reach an advanced level. This process requires the interaction between higher-order cognitive functions and several sensory modalities (auditory, verbal, visual and motor), as well as regular learning of new pieces. This study included participants with musical or theater practice, and healthy controls matched for age (18–84 years old) and education. The objective was to determine whether specific practice in these activities had an effect on cognition across the lifespan, and a protective influence against undesirable cognitive outcomes associated with aging. All participants underwent a battery of cognitive tasks that evaluated processing speed, executive function, fluency, working memory, verbal and visual long-term memories, and non-verbal reasoning abilities. Results showed that music and theater artistic practices were strongly associated with cognitive enhancements. Participants with musical practice were better in executive functioning, working memory and non-verbal reasoning, whereas participants with regular acting practice had better long-term verbal memory and fluency performance. Thus, taken together, results suggest a differential effect of these artistic practices on cognition across the lifespan. Advanced age did not seem to reduce the benefit, so future studies should focus on the hypothetical protective effects of artistic practice against cognitive decline.</p>

<p>A brain-computer interface (BCI) based on electroencephalography (EEG) can provide independent information exchange and control channels for the brain and the outside world. However, EEG signals come from multiple electrodes, the data of which can generate multiple features. How to select electrodes and features to improve classification performance has become an urgent problem to be solved. This paper proposes a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) structure with separated temporal and spatial filters, which selects the raw EEG signals of the electrode pairs over the motor cortex region as hybrid samples without any preprocessing or artificial feature extraction operations. In the proposed structure, a 5-layer CNN has been applied to learn EEG features, a 4-layer max pooling has been used to reduce dimensionality, and a fully-connected (FC) layer has been utilized for classification. Dropout and batch normalization are also employed to reduce the risk of overfitting. In the experiment, the 4 s EEG data of 10, 20, 60, and 100 subjects from the Physionet database are used as the data source, and the motor imaginations (MI) tasks are divided into four types: left fist, right fist, both fists, and both feet. The results indicate that the global averaged accuracy on group-level classification can reach 97.28%, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve stands out at 0.997, and the electrode pair with the highest accuracy on 10 subjects dataset is FC3-FC4, with 98.61%. The research results also show that this CNN classification method with minimal (2) electrode can obtain high accuracy, which is an advantage over other methods on the same database. This proposed approach provides a new idea for simplifying the design of BCI systems, and accelerates the process of clinical application.</p>

<p>Even the simplest cognitive processes involve interactions between cortical regions. To study these processes, we usually rely on averaging across several repetitions of a task or across long segments of data to reach a statistically valid conclusion. Neuronal oscillations reflect synchronized excitability fluctuations in ensembles of neurons and can be observed in electrophysiological recordings in the presence or absence of an external stimulus. Oscillatory brain activity has been viewed as sustained increase in power at specific frequency bands. However, this perspective has been challenged in recent years by the notion that oscillations may occur as transient burst-like events that occur in individual trials and may only appear as sustained activity when multiple trials are averaged together. In this review, we examine the idea that oscillatory activity can manifest as a transient burst as well as a sustained increase in power. We discuss the technical challenges involved in the detection and characterization of transient events at the single trial level, the mechanisms that might generate them and the features that can be extracted from these events to study single-trial dynamics of neuronal ensemble activity.</p>

<p>The differentiation of neurons and formation of connections between cells is the basis of both the adult phenotype and behaviors tied to cognition, perception, reproduction, and survival. Such behaviors are associated with local (circuits) and global (connectome) brain networks. A solid understanding of how these networks emerge is critical. This opinion piece features a guided tour of early developmental events in the emerging connectome, which is crucial to a new view on the connectogenetic process. Connectogenesis includes associating cell identities with broader functional and developmental relationships. During this process, the transition from developmental cells to terminally differentiated cells is defined by an accumulation of traits that ultimately results in neuronal-driven behavior. The well-characterized developmental and cell biology of Caenorhabditis elegans will be used to build a synthesis of developmental events that result in a functioning connectome. Specifically, our view of connectogenesis enables a first-mover model of synaptic connectivity to be demonstrated using data representing larval synaptogenesis. In a first-mover model of Stackelberg competition, potential pre- and postsynaptic relationships are shown to yield various strategies for establishing various types of synaptic connections. By comparing these results to what is known regarding principles for establishing complex network connectivity, these strategies are generalizable to other species and developmental systems. In conclusion, we will discuss the broader implications of this approach, as what is presented here informs an understanding of behavioral emergence and the ability to simulate related biological phenomena.</p>

<p>Aging is associated with cognitive declines that originate in impairments of function in the neurons that make up the nervous system. The marine mollusk Aplysia californica (Aplysia) is a premier model for the nervous system uniquely suited to investigation of neuronal aging due to uniquely identifiable neurons and molecular techniques available in this model. This study describes the molecular processes associated with aging in two populations of sensory neurons in Aplysia by applying RNA sequencing technology across the aging process (age 6–12 months). Differentially expressed genes clustered into four to five coherent expression patterns across the aging time series in the two neuron populations. Enrichment analysis of functional annotations in these neuron clusters revealed decreased expression of pathways involved in energy metabolism and neuronal signaling, suggesting that metabolic and signaling pathways are intertwined. Furthermore, increased expression of pathways involved in protein processing and translation suggests that proteostatic stress also occurs in aging. Temporal overlap of enrichment for energy metabolism, proteostasis, and neuronal function suggests that cognitive impairments observed in advanced age result from the ramifications of broad declines in energy metabolism.</p>

A recent article by Gizowski and Bourque shows that vasopressinergic (VP) neurons within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) master circadian clock have the ability of encoding afferent input from osmosensors and generating appropriate homeostatic responses, suggesting that SCN neurons can integrate internal circadian time and acute changes in homeostatic markers.

Though computational models predict how sensory inputs converge in central neurons, it is technically challenging to test these ideas experimentally. With whole-cell recordings in larval zebrafish in vivo, Liu et al. demonstrate that the convergence of similarly or differently tuned vestibular afferents produces more simple or complex postsynaptic tuning, respectively.

Here, we find that translation attenuation following eIF2α phosphorylation is not uniform, with long-lived proteins, including cytosolic and mitochondrial ribosomal subunits, being prominently downregulated. Because protein stability buffers the cost of translational attenuation, there is no measurable decrease of the targeted proteins. This reveals an evolutionary principle of cellular robustness.

Viral encephalitis results in brain injury despite effective anti-viral therapy. Michael et al. find that neutrophil entry into the brain drives morbidity in a mouse model of HSV-1 encephalitis. Neutrophil recruitment required CXCR2 and its ligand CXCL1, which represent attractive therapeutic targets to limit brain injury associated with encephalitis.

Using a comparative proteomic analysis of endogenous SUMO2/3 substrates, Theurillat et al. find a shift in the repertoire of SUMOylated proteins during cell differentiation. SUMO2/3 targets pluripotency and heterochromatin transactions in ESCs but general cellular functions and fibroblastic enhancer activity in MEFs.

Integrative phages can have myriad effects on bacterial hosts. Campbell et al. find that integration of Bacteroides phage BV01 into Bacteroides vulgatus disrupts expression of TspO, reducing bile acid deconjugation. This is predicted to affect gut colonization and interactions with the human host. BV01 belongs to the Salyersviridae family.

Appropriate insulin secretion is governed through organ crosstalk. Drareni et al. show that GPS2 expression in adipose tissue is correlated with insulin secretion rate in humans. The causality of this relationship is confirmed using adipocyte-specific GPS2 knockout mice, in which inappropriate secretion of insulin promotes glucose intolerance in obese mice.

Wirianto et al. find that the circadian E3 ligase FBXL21 drives rhythmic degradation of the sarcomeric protein TCAP in skeletal muscle. GSK-3β co-phosphorylates FBXL21 and TCAP and promotes SCF complex formation and phosphodegron-dependent TCAP turnover. Psttm mice, expressing a hypomorphic Fbxl21 mutant, show dysregulated TCAP degradation and impaired muscle function.

Lozoya et al. provide in vivo evidence of the epigenetic effects of mitochondrial dysfunction. Developmental-only exposure to rotenone through the mother’s diet inhibits mitochondrial complex I in the dams and results in lifelong nuclear DNA methylation and gene expression changes in the offspring. Aged offspring also show functional outcomes.

Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) promotes a range of phenotypes depending on its intracellular concentration and dosing kinetics, including cell death. While this qualitative relationship has been well established, the quantitative and mechanistic aspects of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> signaling are still being elucidated. Mitochondria, a putative source of intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, have recently been demonstrated to be particularly vulnerable to localized H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> perturbations, eliciting a dramatic cell death response in comparison to similar cytosolic perturbations. We sought to improve our dynamic and mechanistic understanding of the mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> reaction network in HeLa cells by creating a kinetic model of this system and using it to explore basal and perturbed conditions. The model uses the most current quantitative proteomic and kinetic data available to predict reaction rates and steady-state concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and its reaction partners within individual mitochondria. Time scales ranging from milliseconds to one hour were simulated. We predict that basal, steady-state mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> will be in the low nM range (2–4 nM) and will be inversely dependent on the total pool of peroxiredoxin-3 (Prx3). Neglecting efflux of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to the cytosol, the mitochondrial reaction network is expected to control perturbations well up to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation rates ~50 μM/s (0.25 nmol/mg-protein/s), above which point the Prx3 system would be expected to collapse. Comparison of these results with redox Western blots of Prx3 and Prx2 oxidation states demonstrated reasonable trend agreement at short times (≤ 15 min) for a range of experimentally perturbed H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation rates. At longer times, substantial efflux of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> from the mitochondria to the cytosol was evidenced by peroxiredoxin-2 (Prx2) oxidation, and Prx3 collapse was not observed. A refined model using Monte Carlo parameter sampling was used to explore rates of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> efflux that could reconcile model predictions of Prx3 oxidation states with the experimental observations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qaOTtVEjQpE" width="1" />

Segmenting cell nuclei within microscopy images is a ubiquitous task in biological research and clinical applications. Unfortunately, segmenting low-contrast overlapping objects that may be tightly packed is a major bottleneck in standard deep learning-based models. We report a Nuclear Segmentation Tool (NuSeT) based on deep learning that accurately segments nuclei across multiple types of fluorescence imaging data. Using a hybrid network consisting of U-Net and Region Proposal Networks (RPN), followed by a watershed step, we have achieved superior performance in detecting and delineating nuclear boundaries in 2D and 3D images of varying complexities. By using foreground normalization and additional training on synthetic images containing non-cellular artifacts, NuSeT improves nuclear detection and reduces false positives. NuSeT addresses common challenges in nuclear segmentation such as variability in nuclear signal and shape, limited training sample size, and sample preparation artifacts. Compared to other segmentation models, NuSeT consistently fares better in generating accurate segmentation masks and assigning boundaries for touching nuclei.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6H1w9aq1dx0" width="1" />

<p>by Juan F. Poyatos</p>

Cells adjust their metabolism in response to mutations, but how this reprogramming depends on the genetic context is not well known. Specifically, the absence of individual enzymes can affect reprogramming, and thus the impact of mutations in cell growth. Here, we examine this issue with an <i>in silico</i> model of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae’s</i> metabolism. By quantifying the variability in the growth rate of 10000 different mutant metabolisms that accumulated changes in their reaction fluxes, in the presence, or absence, of a specific enzyme, we distinguish a subset of modifier genes serving as buffers or potentiators of variability. We notice that the most potent modifiers refer to the glycolysis pathway and that, more broadly, they show strong pleiotropy and epistasis. Moreover, the evidence that this subset depends on the specific growing condition strengthens its systemic underpinning, a feature only observed before in a toy model of a gene-regulatory network. Some of these enzymes also modulate the effect that biochemical noise and environmental fluctuations produce in growth. Thus, the reorganization of metabolism induced by mutations has not only direct physiological implications but also transforms the influence that other mutations have on growth. This is a general result with implications in the development of cancer therapies based on metabolic inhibitors.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/s2w3TaMvmvA" width="1" />

<p>by Carlos Barajas, Domitilla Del Vecchio</p>

Intracellular spatial heterogeneity is frequently observed in bacteria, where the chromosome occupies part of the cell’s volume and a circuit’s DNA often localizes within the cell. How this heterogeneity affects core processes and genetic circuits is still poorly understood. In fact, commonly used ordinary differential equation (ODE) models of genetic circuits assume a well-mixed ensemble of molecules and, as such, do not capture spatial aspects. Reaction-diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) models have been only occasionally used since they are difficult to integrate and do not provide mechanistic understanding of the effects of spatial heterogeneity. In this paper, we derive a reduced ODE model that captures spatial effects, yet has the same dimension as commonly used well-mixed models. In particular, the only difference with respect to a well-mixed ODE model is that the association rate constant of binding reactions is multiplied by a coefficient, which we refer to as the binding correction factor (BCF). The BCF depends on the size of interacting molecules and on their location when fixed in space and it is equal to unity in a well-mixed ODE model. The BCF can be used to investigate how spatial heterogeneity affects the behavior of core processes and genetic circuits. Specifically, our reduced model indicates that transcription and its regulation are more effective for genes located at the cell poles than for genes located on the chromosome. The extent of these effects depends on the value of the BCF, which we found to be close to unity. For translation, the value of the BCF is always greater than unity, it increases with mRNA size, and, with biologically relevant parameters, is substantially larger than unity. Our model has broad validity, has the same dimension as a well-mixed model, yet it incorporates spatial heterogeneity. This simple-to-use model can be used to both analyze and design genetic circuits while accounting for spatial intracellular effects.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iHe1xFAT38w" width="1" />

<p>by Gabriella J. Gerlach, Rachel Carrock, Robyn Stix, Elliott J. Stollar, K. Aurelia Ball</p>

Protein-protein interactions are involved in a wide range of cellular processes. These interactions often involve intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and protein binding domains. However, the details of IDP binding pathways are hard to characterize using experimental approaches, which can rarely capture intermediate states present at low populations. SH3 domains are common protein interaction domains that typically bind proline-rich disordered segments and are involved in cell signaling, regulation, and assembly. We hypothesized, given the flexibility of SH3 binding peptides, that their binding pathways include multiple steps important for function. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to characterize the steps of binding between the yeast Abp1p SH3 domain (AbpSH3) and a proline-rich IDP, ArkA. Before binding, the N-terminal segment 1 of ArkA is pre-structured and adopts a polyproline II helix, while segment 2 of ArkA (C-terminal) adopts a 3<sub>10</sub> helix, but is far less structured than segment 1. As segment 2 interacts with AbpSH3, it becomes more structured, but retains flexibility even in the fully engaged state. Binding simulations reveal that ArkA enters a flexible encounter complex before forming the fully engaged bound complex. In the encounter complex, transient nonspecific hydrophobic and long-range electrostatic contacts form between ArkA and the binding surface of SH3. The encounter complex ensemble includes conformations with segment 1 in both the forward and reverse orientation, suggesting that segment 2 may play a role in stabilizing the correct binding orientation. While the encounter complex forms quickly, the slow step of binding is the transition from the disordered encounter ensemble to the fully engaged state. In this transition, ArkA makes specific contacts with AbpSH3 and buries more hydrophobic surface. Simulating the binding between ApbSH3 and ArkA provides insight into the role of encounter complex intermediates and nonnative hydrophobic interactions for other SH3 domains and IDPs in general.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/b4C6QlnTZ6E" width="1" />

In this study we analyze the growth-phase dependent metabolic states of <i>Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus</i> by constructing a fully compartmented, mass and charge-balanced genome-scale metabolic model of this predatory bacterium (<i>i</i>CH457). Considering the differences between life cycle phases driving the growth of this predator, growth-phase condition-specific models have been generated allowing the systematic study of its metabolic capabilities. Using these computational tools, we have been able to analyze, from a system level, the dynamic metabolism of the predatory bacteria as the life cycle progresses. We provide computational evidences supporting potential axenic growth of <i>B</i>. <i>bacteriovorus</i>’s in a rich medium based on its encoded metabolic capabilities. Our systems-level analysis confirms the presence of “energy-saving” mechanisms in this predator as well as an abrupt metabolic shift between the attack and intraperiplasmic growth phases. Our results strongly suggest that predatory bacteria’s metabolic networks have low robustness, likely hampering their ability to tackle drastic environmental fluctuations, thus being confined to stable and predictable habitats. Overall, we present here a valuable computational testbed based on predatory bacteria activity for rational design of novel and controlled biocatalysts in biotechnological/clinical applications.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a0JK3GT3FqQ" width="1" />

Global change causes widespread decline of coral reefs. In order to counter the anticipated disappearance of coral reefs by the end of this century, many initiatives are emerging, including creation of marine protected areas (MPAs), reef restoration projects, and assisted evolution initiatives. Such efforts, although critically important, are locally constrained. We propose to build a “Noah's Ark” biological repository for corals that taps into the network of the world’s public aquaria and coral reef scientists. Public aquaria will serve not only as a reservoir for the purpose of conservation, restoration, and research of reef-building corals but also as a laboratory for the implementation of operations for the selection of stress-resilient and resistant genotypes. The proposed project will provide a global dimension to coral reef education and protection as a result of the involvement of a network of public and private aquaria.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/GT4HInMaQ5E" width="1" />

Plant nucleotide-binding (NB) leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor (NLR) proteins function as intracellular immune receptors that perceive the presence of pathogen-derived virulence proteins (effectors) to induce immune responses. The 2 major types of plant NLRs that “sense” pathogen effectors differ in their N-terminal domains: these are Toll/interleukin-1 receptor resistance (TIR) domain-containing NLRs (TNLs) and coiled-coil (CC) domain-containing NLRs (CNLs). In many angiosperms, the RESISTANCE TO POWDERY MILDEW 8 (RPW8)-CC domain containing NLR (RNL) subclass of CNLs is encoded by 2 gene families, <i>ACTIVATED DISEASE RESISTANCE 1</i> (<i>ADR1</i>) and <i>N REQUIREMENT GENE 1</i> (<i>NRG1</i>), that act as “helper” NLRs during multiple sensor NLR-mediated immune responses. Despite their important role in sensor NLR-mediated immunity, knowledge of the specific, redundant, and synergistic functions of helper RNLs is limited. We demonstrate that the ADR1 and NRG1 families act in an unequally redundant manner in basal resistance, effector-triggered immunity (ETI) and regulation of defense gene expression. We define RNL redundancy in ETI conferred by some TNLs and in basal resistance against virulent pathogens. We demonstrate that, in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, the 2 RNL families contribute specific functions in ETI initiated by specific CNLs and TNLs. Time-resolved whole genome expression profiling revealed that RNLs and “classical” CNLs trigger similar transcriptome changes, suggesting that RNLs act like other CNLs to mediate ETI downstream of sensor NLR activation. Together, our genetic data confirm that RNLs contribute to basal resistance, are fully required for TNL signaling, and can also support defense activation during CNL-mediated ETI.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/S08uZX3utkc" width="1" />

<p>We reconstructed the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> adult hermaphrodite pharyngeal nervous system from serial section electron micrographs to generate a weighted pharyngeal connectome. We subjected the pharyngeal wiring diagram to a set of visual, graph theoretic, statistical, and fluorescent‐reporter analyses, revealing a shallow neural structure. Together, our study shows that most pharyngeal neurons exhibit sensory‐motor characteristics, similar to primitive nervous systems comprised of “ur‐neurons.”

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Detailed anatomical maps of individual organs and entire animals have served as invaluable entry points for ensuing dissection of their evolution, development, and function. The pharynx of the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> is a simple neuromuscular organ with a self‐contained, autonomously acting nervous system, composed of 20 neurons that fall into 14 anatomically distinct types. Using serial electron micrograph (EM) reconstruction, we re‐evaluate here the connectome of the pharyngeal nervous system, providing a novel and more detailed view of its structure and predicted function. Contrasting the previous classification of pharyngeal neurons into distinct inter‐ and motor neuron classes, we provide evidence that most pharyngeal neurons are also likely sensory neurons and most, if not all, pharyngeal neurons also classify as motor neurons. Together with the extensive cross‐connectivity among pharyngeal neurons, which is more widespread than previously realized, the sensory‐motor characteristics of most neurons define a shallow network architecture of the pharyngeal connectome. Network analysis reveals that the patterns of neuronal connections are organized into putative computational modules that reflect the known functional domains of the pharynx. Compared with the somatic nervous system, pharyngeal neurons both physically associate with a larger fraction of their neighbors and create synapses with a greater proportion of their neighbors. We speculate that the overall architecture of the pharyngeal nervous system may be reminiscent of the architecture of ancestral, primitive nervous systems.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The precuneus (PreC; Brodmann area 7), a key hub within the default mode network (DMN) displays amyloid and tau‐containing neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology during the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). PreC layer III projection neurons contain lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D (CatD), a marker of neurons vulnerable to NFT pathology. Here we applied single population laser capture microdissection coupled with custom‐designed microarray profiling to determine the genetic signature of PreC CatD‐positive‐layer III neurons accrued from postmortem tissue obtained from the Rush Religious Orders Study (RROS) cases with a premortem clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Expression profiling revealed significant differential expression of key transcripts in MCI and AD compared to NCI that underlie signaling defects, including dysregulation of genes within the endosomal‐lysosomal and autophagy pathways, cytoskeletal elements, AD‐related genes, ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, cholinergic enzymes and receptors, markers of monoamine neurotransmission as well as steroid‐related transcripts. Pervasive defects in both MCI and AD were found in select transcripts within these key gene ontology categories, underscoring the vulnerability of these corticocortical projection neurons during the onset and progression of dementia. Select PreC dysregulated genes detected via custom‐designed microarray analysis were validated using qPCR. In summary, expression profiling of PreC CatD ‐positive layer III neurons revealed significant dysregulation of a mosaic of genes in MCI and AD that were not previously appreciated in terms of their indication of systems‐wide signaling defects in a key hub of the DMN.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Our prior studies showed bilateral gustatory cortex (GC) lesions significantly impair taste sensitivity to salts (NaCl and KCl) and quinine (“bitter”) but not to sucrose (“sweet”). The range of qualitative tastants tested here has been extended in a theoretically relevant way to include the maltodextrin, Maltrin, a preferred stimulus by rats thought to represent a unique taste quality, and the “sour” stimulus citric acid; NaCl was also included as a positive control. Male rats (Sprague–Dawley) with histologically confirmed neurotoxin‐induced bilateral (BGCX, <i>n</i> = 13), or right (RGCX, <i>n</i> = 13) or left (LGCX, <i>n</i> = 9) unilateral GC lesions and sham‐operated controls (SHAM, <i>n</i> = 16) were trained to discriminate a tastant from water in an operant two‐response detection task. A mapping system was used to determine placement, size, and symmetry (when bilateral) of the lesion. BGCX significantly impaired taste sensitivity to NaCl, as expected, but not to Maltrin or citric acid, emulating our prior results with sucrose. However, in the case of citric acid, there was some disruption in performance at higher concentrations. Interestingly, RGCX, but not LGCX, also significantly impaired taste sensitivity, but only to NaCl, suggesting some degree of lateralized function. Taken together with our prior findings, extensive bilateral lesions in GC do not disrupt basic taste signal detection to all taste stimuli uniformly. Moreover, GC lesions do not preclude the ability of rats to learn and perform the task, clearly demonstrating that, in its absence, other brain regions are able to maintain sensory‐discriminative taste processing, albeit with attenuated sensitivity for select stimuli.</p>

Rats and mice have similar patterns of retrogradely labeled neurons that project axons to the NTS.
Afferent neurons in the hypothalamus are glutamatergic, while those in the amygdala are GABAergic.
In the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, NTS afferent neurons are distinct from neuroendocrine neurons.
Injecting retrograde tracers into the medial and lateral NTS subdivisions produce similar patterns of retrograde labeling.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) regulates life‐sustaining functions ranging from appetite and digestion to heart rate and breathing. It is also the brain's primary sensory nucleus for visceral sensations relevant to symptoms in medical and psychiatric disorders. To better understand which neurons may exert top‐down control over the NTS, here we provide a brain‐wide map of all neurons that project axons directly to the caudal, viscerosensory NTS, focusing on a medial subregion with aldosterone‐sensitive HSD2 neurons. Injecting an axonal tracer (cholera toxin b) into the NTS produces a similar pattern of retrograde labeling in rats and mice. The paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), lateral hypothalamic area, and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) contain the densest concentrations of NTS‐projecting neurons. PVH afferents are glutamatergic (express <i>Slc17a6</i>/Vglut2) and are distinct from neuroendocrine PVH neurons. CeA afferents are GABAergic (express <i>Slc32a1</i>/Vgat) and are distributed largely in the medial CeA subdivision. Other retrogradely labeled neurons are located in a variety of brain regions, including the cerebral cortex (insular and infralimbic areas), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, periaqueductal gray, Barrington's nucleus, Kölliker‐Fuse nucleus, hindbrain reticular formation, and rostral NTS. Similar patterns of retrograde labeling result from tracer injections into different NTS subdivisions, with dual retrograde tracing revealing that many afferent neurons project axon collaterals to both the lateral and medial NTS subdivisions. This information provides a roadmap for studying descending axonal projections that may influence visceromotor systems and visceral “mind–body” symptoms.</p>

Here, we found that staining for GABAergic cells and perineuronal nets differentiates these intercollicular nuclei in guinea pigs. Further, we found that the proportions of four subtypes of GABAergic cells differentiate intercollicular nuclei from each other and from adjacent inferior collicular subdivisions. Our results support earlier studies that suggest distinct morphology and functions for intercollicular nuclei, and provide staining methods that differentiate intercollicular nuclei and are compatible with most modern techniques. We hope that this will help future studies to further characterize the intercollicular region.</p>

The perinatal asphyxia (PA) group showed a significant decrease in calbindin neurons and a paradoxical increase in neurons estimated by NeuN staining.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>GABAergic medium spiny neurons are the main neuronal population in the striatum. Calbindin is preferentially expressed in medium spiny neurons involved in the indirect pathway. The aim of the present work is to analyze the effect of perinatal asphyxia on different subpopulations of GABAergic neurons in the striatum and to assess the outcome of deep therapeutic hypothermia. The uterus of pregnant rats was removed by cesarean section and the fetuses were exposed to hypoxia by immersion in water (19 min) at 37°C (perinatal asphyxia). The hypothermic group was exposed to 10°C during 30 min after perinatal asphyxia. The rats were euthanized at the age of one month (adolescent/adult rats), their brains were dissected out and coronal sections were immunolabeled for calbindin, calretinin, NeuN, and reelin. Reelin+ cells showed no staining in the striatum besides subventricular zone. The perinatal asphyxia (PA) group showed a significant decrease in calbindin neurons and a paradoxical increase in neurons estimated by NeuN staining. Moreover, calretinin+ cells, a specific subpopulation of GABAergic neurons, showed an increase caused by PA. Deep hypothermia reversed most of these alterations probably by protecting calbindin neurons. Similarly, there was a reduction of the diameter of the anterior commissure produced by the asphyxia that was prevented by hypothermic treatment.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Na,K‐ATPase is a ubiquitous molecule contributing to the asymmetrical distribution of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions across the plasma membrane and maintenance of the membrane potential, a prerequisite of neuronal activity. Na,K‐ATPase comprises three subunits (α, β, and FXYD). The α subunit has four isoforms in mice, with three of them (α1, α2, and α3) expressed in the brain. However, the functional and biological significances of the different brain isoforms remain to be fully elucidated. Recent studies have revealed the association of <i>Atp1a3</i>, a gene encoding α3 subunit, with neurological disorders. To map the cellular distributions of the α subunit isoforms and their coexpression patterns, we evaluated the mRNA expression of <i>Atp1a1</i>, <i>Atp1a2</i>, and <i>Atp1a3</i> by in situ hybridization in the mouse brain. <i>Atp1a1</i> and <i>Atp1a3</i> were expressed in neurons, whereas <i>Atp1a2</i> was almost exclusively expressed in glial cells. Most neurons coexpressed <i>Atp1a1</i> and <i>Atp1a3</i>, with highly heterogeneous expression levels across the brain regions and neuronal subtypes. We identified parvalbumin (PV)‐expressing GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus, somatosensory cortex, and retrosplenial cortex as an example of a neuronal subtype expressing low <i>Atp1a1</i> and high <i>Atp1a3</i>. The expression of <i>Atp1b</i> isoforms was also heterogeneous across brain regions and cellular subtypes. The PV‐expressing neurons expressed a high level of <i>Atp1b1</i> and a low level of <i>Atp1b2</i> and <i>Atp1b3</i>. These findings provide basic information on the region‐ and neuronal‐subtype‐dependent expression of Na,K‐ATPase α and β subunit isoforms, as well as a rationale for the selective involvement of neurons expressing high levels of <i>Atp1a3</i> in neurological disorders.</p>

<p>The teleost fish <i>Astyanax mexicanus</i> is extant in an ancestral surface form (right) and derived cave forms (left). Adaptation to life in nutrient poor caves without predation increased exploratory foraging behaviors and decreased aversion to potential predatory cues in the cavefishes. Tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry revealed larger catecholaminergic neurons in regions of the cave <i>Astyanax</i> brain that may mediate these changes in behavior.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Astyanax mexicanus</i> is a teleost fish that is in the process of allopatric speciation. Ancestral <i>Astyanax</i> are found in surface rivers and derived blind forms are found in cave systems. Adaptation to life in nutrient poor caves without predation includes the evolution of enhanced food seeking behaviors and loss of defensive responses. These behavioral adaptations may be mediated by changes in catecholaminergic control systems in the brain. We examined the distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase, a conserved precursor for the synthesis of the catecholamines dopamine and noradrenaline, in the brains of surface and cave <i>Astyanax</i> using immunohistochemistry. We found differences in tyrosine hydroxylase staining in regions that are associated with nonvisual sensory perception, motor control, endocrine release, and attention. These differences included significant increases in the diameters of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive soma in cave <i>Astyanax</i> in the olfactory bulb, basal telencephalon, preoptic nuclei, ventral thalamus, posterior tuberculum, and locus coeruleus. These increases in modulation by dopamine and noradrenaline likely indicate changes in behavioral control that underlie adaptations to the cave environment.</p>

<p>Background: Neuromodulation through translingual neurostimulation (TLNS) has been shown to initiate long-lasting processes of neuronal reorganization with a variety of outcomes (i.e., neuroplasticity). Non-invasive TLNS is increasingly accessible through the Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator (PoNS<sup>®</sup>), a medical device that delivers electrical stimulation to the tongue to activate the trigeminal (V) and facial (VII) cranial nerves. Anecdotal reports from previous clinical studies have suggested incidental improvements in cognitive function. To objectively explore this observation, we examined TLNS-related effects on the semantic N400 brain vital sign cognitive response during cognitive skills training in healthy individuals.</p><p>Methods: Thirty-seven healthy volunteers were randomized to receive simultaneous TLNS (treatment) or no TLNS (control) while undergoing cognitive skills training. Cognitive training was conducted for two 20-min sessions (morning and afternoon/evening) over 3 consecutive days. Brain vital signs were evaluated at baseline, Day 1, and Day 3. Analyses focused on cognitive processing as measured by N400 changes in amplitude and latency.</p><p>Results: Over the 3-day course of cognitive training, the N400 amplitude decreased significantly in the control group due to habituation (p = 0.028). In contrast, there was no significant change in the TLNS treatment group.</p><p>Conclusion: TLNS led to a sustained N400 response during cognitive skills training, as measured by the brain’s vital signs framework. The study findings suggest differential learning effects due to neuromodulation, consistent with increased attention and cognitive vigilance.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00273">Dropout in Neural Networks Simulates the Paradoxical Effects of Deep Brain Stimulation on Memory</a></h4>

<p>Neuromodulation techniques such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) are a promising treatment for memory-related disorders including anxiety, addiction, and dementia. However, the outcomes of such treatments appear to be somewhat paradoxical, in that these techniques can both disrupt and enhance memory even when applied to the same brain target. In this article, we hypothesize that disruption and enhancement of memory through neuromodulation can be explained by the dropout of engram nodes. We used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits and letters and applied dropout at different stages to simulate DBS effects on engrams. We showed that dropout applied during training improved the accuracy of prediction, whereas dropout applied during testing dramatically decreased the accuracy of prediction, which mimics enhancement and disruption of memory, respectively. We further showed that transfer learning of neural networks with dropout had increased the accuracy and rate of learning. Dropout during training provided a more robust “skeleton” network and, together with transfer learning, mimicked the effects of chronic DBS on memory. Overall, we showed that the dropout of engram nodes is a possible mechanism by which neuromodulation techniques such as DBS can both disrupt and enhance memory, providing a unique perspective on this paradox.</p>

Sensory experience induces Fn14 expression in relay neurons and TWEAK expression in microglia to drive refinement of retinogeniculate connectivity. Microglial TWEAK signals through neuronal Fn14 to eliminate a subset of synapses proximal to TWEAK-expressing microglia, whereas Fn14 acts alone at other synapses to strengthen connectivity.

<p>Based on physiological data, biophysical modeling allows the optimization of tDCS montages for stimulation of brain networks. The efficacy of network‐targeted electrical stimulation is shown by the increase of spontaneous activity in the targeted network, as well as the modulation of its interplay with negatively correlated brain networks.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Dynamics within and between functional resting‐state networks have a crucial role in determining both healthy and pathological brain functioning in humans. The possibility to noninvasively interact and selectively modulate the activity of networks would open to relevant applications in neuroscience. Here we tested a novel approach for multichannel, network‐targeted transcranial direct current stimulation (net‐tDCS), optimized to increase excitability of the sensorimotor network (SMN) while inducing cathodal inhibitory modulation over prefrontal and parietal brain regions negatively correlated with the SMN. Using an MRI‐compatible multichannel transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) device, 20 healthy participants underwent real and sham tDCS while at rest in the MRI scanner. Changes in functional connectivity (FC) during and after stimulation were evaluated, looking at the intrinsic FC of the SMN and the strength of the negative connectivity between SMN and the rest of the brain. Standard, bifocal tDCS targeting left motor cortex (electrode ~C3) and right frontopolar (~Fp2) regions was tested as a control condition in a separate sample of healthy subjects to investigate network specificity of multichannel stimulation effects. Net‐tDCS induced greater FC increase over the SMN compared to bifocal tDCS, during and after stimulation. Moreover, exploratory analysis of the impact of net‐tDCS on negatively correlated networks showed an increase in the negative connectivity between SMN and prefrontal/parietal areas targeted by cathodal stimulation both during and after real net‐tDCS. Results suggest preliminary evidence of the possibility of manipulating distributed network connectivity patterns through net‐tDCS, with potential relevance for the development of cognitive enhancement and therapeutic tES solutions.</p>

<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Microglial cells (resident macrophages) feature rapid activation in CNS disease and can acquire multiple phenotypes exerting neuroprotection or neurotoxicity. The functional impact of surveying (“resting”) microglia on neural excitability and neurotransmission in physiology is widely unknown, however. We addressed this issue in male rat hippocampal slice cultures (in situ) by pharmacological microglial ablation within days and by characterizing neuronal gamma‐band oscillations (30–70 Hz) that are highly sensitive to neuromodulators and disturbances in ion and energy regulation. Gamma oscillations support action potential timing and synaptic plasticity, associate with higher brain functions like perception and memory, and require precise communication between excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory (GABAergic) interneurons. The slice cultures featured well‐preserved hippocampal cytoarchitecture and parvalbumin‐positive interneuron networks, microglia with ramified morphology, and low basal levels of IL‐6, TNF‐α, and nitric oxide (NO). Stimulation of slice cultures with the pro‐inflammatory cytokine IFN‐γ or bacterial LPS serving as positive controls for microglial reactivity induced MHC‐II expression and increased cytokine and NO release. Chronic exposure of slice cultures to liposome‐encapsulated clodronate reduced the microglial cell population by about 96%, whereas neuronal structures, astrocyte GFAP expression, and basal levels of cytokines and NO were unchanged. Notably, the properties of gamma oscillations reflecting frequency, number and synchronization of synapse activity were regular after microglial depletion. Also, electrical stimulus‐induced transients of the extracellular potassium concentration ([K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>) reflecting cellular K<sup>+</sup> efflux, clearance and buffering were unchanged. This suggests that nonreactive microglia are dispensable for neuronal homeostasis and neuromodulation underlying network signaling and rhythm generation in cortical tissue.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mutations in leucine‐rich repeat kinase 2 (<i>lrrk2</i>) are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease. Difficulty in elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms resulting from disease‐associated Lrrk2 variants stems from the complexity of Lrrk2 function and activities. Lrrk2 contains multiple protein–protein interacting domains, a GTPase domain, and a kinase domain. Lrrk2 is implicated in many cellular processes including vesicular trafficking, autophagy, cytoskeleton dynamics, and Wnt signaling. Here, we generated a zebrafish <i>lrrk2</i> allelic series to study the requirements for Lrrk2 during development and to dissect the importance of its various domains. The alleles are predicted to encode proteins that either lack all functional domains (<i>lrrk2<sup>sbu304</sup>)</i>, the GTPase, and kinase domains (<i>lrrk2<sup>sbu71</sup>
</i>) or the kinase domain (<i>lrrk2<sup>sbu96</sup>
</i>). All three <i>lrrk2</i> mutants are viable, morphologically normal, and display wild‐type‐like locomotion. Because Lrrk2 modulates Wnt signaling in some contexts, we assessed Wnt signaling in all three mutant lines. Analysis of Wnt signaling by studying the expression of target genes using whole mount RNA <i>in situ</i> hybridization and a transgenic Wnt reporter revealed wild‐type domains of Wnt activity in each of the mutants. However, we found that Wnt pathway activation is attenuated in <i>lrrk2<sup>sbu304/sbu304</sup>
</i>, which lacks both scaffolding and catalytic domains, but not in the other alleles during late embryogenesis. This supports a model in which Lrrk2 scaffolding functions are key to a context‐dependent role in promoting canonical Wnt signaling.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Iron is essential for normal cellular function, however, excessive accumulation of iron in neural tissue has been implicated in both cortical and retinal diseases. The exact role of iron in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders remains incompletely understood. However, iron‐induced damage to the brain and retina is often attributed to the redox ability of iron to generate dangerous free radicals, which exacerbates local oxidative stress and neuronal damage. Iron chelators are compounds designed to scavenge labile iron, aiding to regulate iron bioavailability. Recently there has been growing interest in the application of chelating agents for treatment of diseases including neurodegenerative conditions, characterized by increased oxidative stress. This article reviews both clinical and preclinical evidence relating to the effectiveness of iron chelation therapy in conditions of iron dyshomeostasis linked to neurodegeneration in the brain and retina. The limitations as well as future opportunities iron chelation therapy are discussed.</p>

<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Ataxin‐3 is a deubiquitinase and polyglutamine disease protein whose cellular properties and functions are not entirely understood. Mutations in ataxin‐3 cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), a neurodegenerative disorder that is a member of the polyglutamine family of diseases. Two major isoforms arise from alternative splicing of <i>ATXN3</i> and are differently toxic <i>in vivo</i> as a result of faster proteasomal degradation of one isoform compared to the other. The isoforms vary only at their C‐termini, suggesting that the hydrophobic C‐terminus of the more quickly degraded form of ataxin‐3 (here referred to as isoform 2) functions as a degron—that is, a peptide sequence that expedites the degradation of its host protein. We explored this notion in this study and present evidence that: (a) the C‐terminus of ataxin‐3 isoform 2 signals its degradation in a proteasome‐dependent manner, (b) this effect from the C‐terminus of isoform 2 does not require the ubiquitination of ataxin‐3, and (c) the isolated C‐terminus of isoform 2 can enhance the degradation of an unrelated protein. According to our data, the C‐terminus of ataxin‐3 isoform 2 is a degron, increasing overall understanding of the cellular properties of the SCA3 protein.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease 1 A (CMT1A) is caused by an intrachromosomal duplication of the gene encoding for <i>PMP22</i> leading to peripheral nerve dysmyelination, axonal loss, and progressive muscle weakness. No therapy is available. PXT3003 is a low‐dose combination of baclofen, naltrexone, and sorbitol which has been shown to improve disease symptoms in <i>Pmp22</i> transgenic rats, a bona fide model of CMT1A disease. However, the superiority of PXT3003 over its single components or dual combinations have not been tested. Here, we show that in a dorsal root ganglion (DRG) co‐culture system derived from transgenic rats, PXT3003 induced myelination when compared to its single and dual components. Applying a clinically relevant (“translational”) study design in adult male CMT1A rats for 3 months, PXT3003, but not its dual components, resulted in improved performance in behavioral motor and sensory endpoints when compared to placebo. Unexpectedly, we observed only a marginally increased number of myelinated axons in nerves from PXT3003‐treated CMT1A rats. However, in electrophysiology, motor latencies correlated with increased grip strength indicating a possible effect of PXT3003 on neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) and muscle fiber pathology. Indeed, PXT3003‐treated CMT1A rats displayed an increased perimeter of individual NMJs and a larger number of functional NMJs. Moreover, muscles of PXT3003 CMT1A rats displayed less neurogenic atrophy and a shift toward fast contracting muscle fibers. We suggest that ameliorated motor function in PXT3003‐treated CMT1A rats result from restored NMJ function and muscle innervation, independent from myelination.</p>

<p>Electrical microstimulation can treat neurological disorders; however, the mechanisms defining therapeutic efficacy are poorly characterized. In the mouse cortex, increasing the stimulation waveform asymmetry differentially modulates the spatial distribution and level of sustained neuronal activation, depending on leading polarity, under mesoscale (top) and two‐photon (bottom) imaging.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Electrical stimulation has been critical in the development of an understanding of brain function and disease. Despite its widespread use and obvious clinical potential, the mechanisms governing stimulation in the cortex remain largely unexplored in the context of pulse parameters. Modeling studies have suggested that modulation of stimulation pulse waveform may be able to control the probability of neuronal activation to selectively stimulate either cell bodies or passing fibers depending on the leading polarity. Thus, asymmetric waveforms with equal charge per phase (i.e., increasing the leading phase duration and proportionately decreasing the amplitude) may be able to activate a more spatially localized or distributed population of neurons if the leading phase is cathodic or anodic, respectively. Here, we use two‐photon and mesoscale calcium imaging of GCaMP6s expressed in excitatory pyramidal neurons of male mice to investigate the role of pulse polarity and waveform asymmetry on the spatiotemporal properties of direct neuronal activation with 10‐Hz electrical stimulation. We demonstrate that increasing cathodic asymmetry effectively reduces neuronal activation and results in a more spatially localized subpopulation of activated neurons without sacrificing the density of activated neurons around the electrode. Conversely, increasing anodic asymmetry increases the spatial spread of activation and highly resembles spatiotemporal calcium activity induced by conventional symmetric cathodic stimulation. These results suggest that stimulation polarity and asymmetry can be used to modulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of neuronal activity thus increasing the effective parameter space of electrical stimulation to restore sensation and study circuit dynamics.</p>

<p>Alcohol‐dependent individuals present a differential pattern of resting‐state EEG‐MEG connectivity, as well as local communication alterations in brain network. Results point toward difficulties in information flow efficiency and cost, and a possible compensatory effort.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>There is supporting evidence of alcohol negative effects on the brain: neuroimaging and psychophysiological studies finding anatomical and functional connectivity (FC) changes associated with the dependence process. Thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate brain FC and network characteristics of alcohol‐dependent individuals in resting state. For this study, we included males diagnosed with alcohol dependence (<i>N</i> = 25) and a group of healthy individuals (<i>N</i> = 23). Simultaneous EEG‐MEG (electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic) activity was recorded in 5 min of eyes‐closed resting state. EEG‐MEG activity was preprocessed and FC was computed through the leakage‐corrected version of phase locking value (ciPLV). Additionally, local (degree, efficiency, clustering) and global (efficiency, characteristic path length) network parameters were computed. Connectivity analysis showed an increase in phase‐lagged synchronization, mainly between frontal and frontotemporal regions, in high beta band, and a decrease in interhemispheric gamma, for alcohol‐dependent individuals. Network analysis revealed intergroup differences at the local level for high beta, indicating higher degree, clustering, and efficiency, mostly at frontal nodes, together with a decrease in these measures at more posterior sites for patients’ group. The hyper‐synchronization in beta, next to the hypo‐synchronization in gamma, could indicate an alteration in communication between hemispheres, but also a possible functional compensation mechanism in neural circuits. This could be also supported by network characteristic data, where local alterations in communication are observed.</p>

<p>Myelin structure is altered in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing a pathological variant of the human amyloid precursor protein (PDGFB‐APP<sup>Sw.Ind</sup>; <i>APP mice</i>). <i>APP</i> mice have longer paranodes, thicker myelin, and shorter nodes of Ranvier than wildtype mice by 3 months of age, however, total axon density and the proportion of axons that were myelinated was normal.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In Alzheimer's disease, amyloid plaque formation is associated with the focal death of oligodendrocytes and soluble amyloid β impairs the survival of oligodendrocytes in vitro. However, the response of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to early amyloid pathology remains unclear. To explore this, we performed a histological, electrophysiological, and behavioral characterization of transgenic mice expressing a pathological form of human <i>amyloid precursor protein</i> (<i>APP</i>), containing three single point mutations associated with the development of familial Alzheimer's disease (<i>PDGFB‐APP<sup>Sw.Ind</sup>
</i>, also known as J20 mice). <i>PDGFB‐APP<sup>Sw.Ind</sup>
</i> transgenic mice had impaired survival from weaning, were hyperactive by 2 months of age, and developed amyloid plaques by 6 months of age, however, their spatial memory remained intact over this time course. Hippocampal OPC density was normal in P60‐P180 <i>PDGFB‐APP<sup>Sw.Ind</sup>
</i> transgenic mice and, by performing whole‐cell patch‐clamp electrophysiology, we found that their membrane properties, including their response to kainate (100 µM), were largely normal. However, by P100, the response of hippocampal OPCs to GABA was elevated in <i>PDGFB‐APP<sup>Sw.Ind</sup>
</i> transgenic mice. We also found that the nodes of Ranvier were shorter, the paranodes longer, and the myelin thicker for hippocampal axons in young adult <i>PDGFB‐APP<sup>Sw.Ind</sup>
</i> transgenic mice compared with wildtype littermates. Additionally, oligodendrogenesis was normal in young adulthood, but increased in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and fimbria of <i>PDGFB‐APP<sup>Sw.Ind</sup>
</i> transgenic mice as pathology developed. As the new oligodendrocytes were not associated with a change in total oligodendrocyte number, these cells are likely required for cell replacement.</p>

<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is a standard treatment for acute ischemic stroke that could cause hemorrhagic complications. We aimed to evaluate the pathology of MT‐induced arterial damage and neurovascular unit (NVU) disruption in relation to tissue‐type plasminogen activator (tPA) injection for acute ischemic stroke. We induced transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in male SHR/Izm rats for 2 hr. This was followed by reperfusion with/without tPA (3 mg/kg) and “rough suture” insertion that mimicked MT once or thrice (MT1 or MT3). Compared with the control group, the tPA + MT3 group presented with an increase in the cerebral infarct and hemorrhage with severer IgG leakage. Moreover, structural damage reaching the tunica media was detected in the MT3 and tPA + MT3 groups. The tPA + MT3 group presented with increased matrix metalloproteinase‐9 (MMP‐9) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression with some MMP9‐positive cells expressing a neutrophil marker myeloperoxidase. Furthermore, basal lamina detachment from astrocyte foot processes was observed in the tPA + MT1 and tPA + MT3 groups. These findings suggest that MT causes direct arterial damage, as well as VEGF and MMP9 upregulation, which results in NVU disruption and hemorrhagic complications in acute ischemic stroke, especially when combined with tPA.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Millions suffer a traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year wherein the outcomes associated with injury can vary greatly between individuals. This study postulates that variations in each biomechanical parameter of a head trauma lead to differences in histological and behavioral outcome measures that should be considered collectively in assessing injury. While trauma severity typically scales with the magnitude of injury, much less is known about the effects of rate and duration of the mechanical insult. In this study, a newly developed voice‐coil fluid percussion injury system was used to investigate the effects of injury rate and fluid percussion impulse on a collection of post‐injury outcomes in male rats. Collectively the data suggest a potential shift in the specificity and progression of neuronal injury and function rather than a general scaling of injury severity. While a faster, shorter fluid percussion first presents as a mild TBI, neuronal loss and some behavioral tasks were similar among the slower and faster fluid percussion injuries. This study concludes that the sequelae of neuronal degeneration and behavioral outcomes are related to the complete temporal profile of the fluid percussion and do not scale only with peak pressure.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adolescents with single ventricle heart disease (SVHD) exhibit mood and cognitive deficits, which may result from injury to the basal ganglia structures, including the caudate nuclei. However, the integrity of the caudate in SVHD adolescents is unclear. Our aim was to examine the global and regional caudate volumes, and evaluate the relationships between caudate volumes and cognitive and mood scores in SVHD and healthy adolescents. We acquired two high‐resolution T1‐weighted images from 23 SVHD and 37 controls using a 3.0‐Tesla MRI scanner, as well as assessed mood (Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 [PHQ‐9]; Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI]) and cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]; Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning–2; General Memory Index [GMI]) functions. Both left and right caudate nuclei were outlined, which were then used to calculate and compare volumes between groups using ANCOVA (covariates: age, gender, and head‐size), as well as perform 3D surface morphometry. Partial correlations (covariates: age, gender, and head‐size) were used to examine associations between caudate volumes, cognition, and mood scores in SVHD and controls. SVHD subjects showed significantly higher PHQ‐9 and BAI scores, indicating more depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as reduced GMI scores, suggesting impaired cognition, compared to controls. SVHD patients showed significantly reduced caudate volumes (left, 3,198.8 ± 490.1 vs. 3,605.0 ± 480.4 mm<sup>3</sup>, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.004; right, 3,162.1 ± 475.4 vs. 3,504.8 ± 465.9 mm<sup>3</sup>, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.011) over controls, and changes were localized in the rostral, mid‐dorsolateral, and caudal areas. Significant negative correlations emerged between caudate volumes with PHQ‐9 and BAI scores and positive correlations with GMI and MoCA scores in SVHD and controls. SVHD adolescents show significantly reduced caudate volumes, especially in sites that have projections to regulate mood and cognition, which may result from developmental and/or hypoxia‐/ischemia‐induced processes.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) is required for maintaining peripheral sensory neuron survival and function; however, the underlying cellular mechanism remains unclear. The general view is that expression of p75<sup>NTR</sup> by the neuron itself is required for maintaining sensory neuron survival and myelination in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Adopting a neuronal‐specific conditional knockout strategy, we demonstrate the partial depletion of p75<sup>NTR</sup> in neurons exerts little influence upon maintaining sensory neuron survival and peripheral nerve myelination in health and after demyelinating neuropathy. Our data show that the density and total number of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in 2‐month‐old mice is not affected following the deletion of p75<sup>NTR</sup> in large‐diameter myelinating neurons, as assessed by stereology. Adopting experimental autoimmune neuritis induced in adult male mice, an animal model of demyelinating peripheral neuropathy, we identify that deleting p75<sup>NTR</sup> in myelinating neurons exerts no influence upon the disease progression, the total number of DRG neurons, and the extent of myelin damage in the sciatic nerve, indicating that the expression of neuronal p75<sup>NTR</sup> is not essential for maintaining peripheral neuron survival and myelination after a demyelinating insult <i>in vivo</i>. Together, results of this study suggest that the survival and myelination of peripheral sensory neurons is independent of p75<sup>NTR</sup> expressed by a subtype of neurons <i>in vivo</i>. Thus, our findings provide new insights into the mechanism underpinning p75<sup>NTR</sup>‐mediated neuronal survival in the PNS.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Melanin‐concentrating hormone (MCH) is a ubiquitous vertebrate neuropeptide predominantly synthesized by neurons of the diencephalon that can act through two G protein‐coupled receptors, called MCHR1 and MCHR2. The expression of <i>Mchr1</i> has been investigated in both rats and mice, but its synthesis remains poorly described. After identifying an antibody that detects MCHR1 with high specificity, we employed immunohistochemistry to map the distribution of MCHR1 in the CNS of rats and mice. Multiple neurochemical markers were also employed to characterize some of the neuronal populations that synthesize MCHR1. Our results show that MCHR1 is abundantly found in a subcellular structure called the primary <i>cilium</i>, which has been associated, among other functions, with the detection of free neurochemical messengers present in the extracellular space. Ciliary MCHR1 was found in a wide range of areas, including the olfactory bulb, cortical mantle, <i>striatum</i>, hippocampal formation, amygdala, midline thalamic nuclei, periventricular hypothalamic nuclei, midbrain areas, and in the spinal cord. No differences were observed between male and female mice, and interspecies differences were found in the caudate‐putamen nucleus and the subgranular zone. Ciliary MCHR1 was found in close association with several neurochemical markers, including tyrosine hydroxylase, calretinin, kisspeptin, estrogen receptor, oxytocin, vasopressin, and corticotropin‐releasing factor. Given the role of neuronal primary <i>cilia</i> in sensing free neurochemical messengers in the extracellular fluid, the widespread distribution of ciliary MCHR1, and the diverse neurochemical populations who synthesize MCHR1, our data indicate that nonsynaptic communication plays a prominent role in the normal function of the MCH system.</p>

Depletion of microglia during cortical critical period profoundly alters glutamatergic synapse developmental trajectory

Microglia is critical for visual cortex spine pruning, circuit refinement, intracortical connectivity, and critical period plasticity




</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Microglia populate the early developing brain and mediate pruning of the central synapses. Yet, little is known on their functional significance in shaping the developing cortical circuits. We hypothesize that the developing cortical circuits require microglia for proper circuit maturation and connectivity, and as such, ablation of microglia during the cortical critical period may result in a long‐lasting circuit abnormality. We administered PLX3397, a colony‐stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor, to mice starting at postnatal day 14 and through P28, which depletes &gt;75% of microglia in the visual cortex (VC). This treatment largely covers the critical period (P19‐32) of VC maturation and plasticity. Patch clamp recording in VC layer 2/3 (L2/3) and L5 neurons revealed increased mEPSC frequency and reduced amplitude, and decreased AMPA/NMDA current ratio, indicative of altered synapse maturation. Increased spine density was observed in these neurons, potentially reflecting impaired synapse pruning. In addition, VC intracortical circuit functional connectivity, assessed by laser scanning photostimulation combined with glutamate uncaging, was dramatically altered. Using two photon longitudinal dendritic spine imaging, we confirmed that spine elimination/pruning was diminished during VC critical period when microglia were depleted. Reduced spine pruning thus may account for increased spine density and disrupted connectivity of VC circuits. Lastly, using single‐unit recording combined with monocular deprivation, we found that ocular dominance plasticity in the VC was obliterated during the critical period as a result of microglia depletion. These data establish a critical role of microglia in developmental cortical synapse pruning, maturation, functional connectivity, and critical period plasticity.</p>

<p>Serotonin (5‐hydroxytryptamine, 5‐HT) released by platelets, mast cells, and immunocytes is a potent inflammatory mediator which modulates pain and itch sensing in the peripheral nervous system. We focused on the identification of the signaling pathways involved in the activation of rat primary afferent neurons by 5‐HT and their involvement in itch and pain sensing. Transient responses evoked by 5‐HT are mediated by ionotropic 5‐HT3 receptors. Sustained responses to 5‐HT require activation of 5‐HT1A receptors coupled to Gi/o, leading to a decrease in membrane conductance, membrane depolarization, opening of voltage‐gated calcium channels and calcium entry. Both responses appear to be involved in triggering serotonergic itch in both male and female Wistar rats.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Serotonin (5‐hydroxytryptamine, 5‐HT) released by platelets, mast cells, and immunocytes is a potent inflammatory mediator which modulates pain and itch sensing in the peripheral nervous system. The serotonergic receptors expressed by primary afferent neurons involved in these sensory functions are not fully identified and appear to be to a large extent species dependent. Moreover, the mechanisms through which 5‐HT receptor activation is coupled to changes in neuronal excitability have not been completely revealed. Using a combination of <i>in vitro</i> (calcium and voltage imaging and patch‐clamp) and <i>in vivo</i> behavioral methods, we used both male and female Wistar rats to provide evidence for the involvement of two 5‐HT receptor subtypes, 5‐HT1A and 5‐HT3, in mediating the sustained and transient effects, respectively, of 5‐HT on rat primary afferent neurons involved in pain and itch processing. In addition, our results are consistent with a model in which sustained serotonergic responses triggered via the 5‐HT1A receptor are due to closure of background potassium channels, followed by membrane depolarization and action potentials, during which the activation of voltage‐gated calcium channels leads to calcium entry. Our results may provide a better understanding of mammalian serotonergic itch signaling.</p>

<p>Immunohistochemical staining for vesicular glutamate transporter 2 reveals the glomeruli in the main olfactory bulb of the brain of the African wild dog. Stereological estimates of the numbers of glomeruli reveal that the African wild dog has up to 1700 glomeruli. Scale bar = 250 μm.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Employing a range of neuroanatomical stains, we detail the organization of the main and accessory olfactory systems of the African wild dog. The organization of both these systems follows that typically observed in mammals, but variations of interest were noted. Within the main olfactory bulb, the size of the glomeruli, at approximately 350 μm in diameter, are on the larger end of the range observed across mammals. In addition, we estimate that approximately 3,500 glomeruli are present in each main olfactory bulb. This larger main olfactory bulb glomerular size and number of glomeruli indicates that enhanced peripheral processing of a broad range of odorants is occurring in the main olfactory bulb of the African wild dog. Within the accessory olfactory bulb, the glomeruli did not appear distinct, rather forming a homogenous syncytia‐like arrangement as seen in the domestic dog. In addition, the laminar organization of the deeper layers of the accessory olfactory bulb was indistinct, perhaps as a consequence of the altered architecture of the glomeruli. This arrangement of glomeruli indicates that rather than parcellating the processing of semiochemicals peripherally, these odorants may be processed in a more nuanced and combinatorial manner in the periphery, allowing for more rapid and precise behavioral responses as required in the highly social group structure observed in the African wild dog. While having a similar organization to that of other mammals, the olfactory system of the African wild dog has certain features that appear to correlate to their environmental niche.</p>

<p>Schwann cells (SCs) were found to have sensory and motor phenotypes and associated with the modality specific promotion of sensory and motor nerve regeneration. To explore the differences between them, we established a workflow to obtain highly purified SCs derived from sensory nerve (SNdSCs) and motor nerve (MNdSCs) from B6; D2‐Tg(s100B‐EGFP)1Wjt/J mice. The SNdSCs and MNdSCs were isolated from dorsal and ventral roots by FACS sorting. The proteome of SNdSCs and MNdSCs was compared by a quantitative proteomic analysis based on iTRAQ labeling and the mouse Schwann proteome was obtained. Several differentially expressed proteins between SNdSCs and MNdSCs were verified.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Schwann cells (SCs) are myelin‐forming glial cells of the peripheral nervous system. Recent studies suggested that SCs comprise two phenotypes: sensory SCs and motor SCs, which are associated with the modality‐specific promotion of sensory and motor axon growth during peripheral neuronal regeneration. However, the molecular basis of the two phenotypic SCs is unclear. We established a workflow to obtain highly purified SCs derived from sensory nerve (SNdSCs) and motor nerve (MNdSCs) from B6; D2‐Tg(s100B‐EGFP)1Wjt/J mice. Subsequently, a quantitative proteomic analysis based on iTRAQ labeling was performed to compare the proteome of SNdSCs and MNdSCs. A total of 6,567 proteins were identified, of which 63 and 11 proteins were overexpressed in SNdSCs and MNdSCs, respectively. Three of the overexpressed proteins were further validated by western blot and immunocytochemistry: GMFB and CNPase, which were overexpressed in sensory SNdSCs, and histone H4, which was overexpressed in MNdSCs. The expression pattern of the three proteins was also validated in the dorsal roots and ventral roots. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that proteins highly expressed in SNdSCs are mainly involved in RNA processing and protein synthesis, while those overexpressed in MNdSCs are related to cell proliferation. Real‐time cell analysis confirmed that the proliferation activity of MNdSCs is higher than that of SNdSCs. This study is the first to provide a proteomic view of the differential phenotype of mouse SNdSCs and MNdSCs. The data may serve as a valuable source for the study of the biological characteristics of these two SC phenotypes and their roles in nerve‐specific regeneration.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hippocampal circuit alterations that differentially affect hippocampal subfields are associated with age‐related memory decline. Additionally, functional organization along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus has revealed distinctions between anterior and posterior (A‐P) connectivity. Here, we examined the functional connectivity (FC) differences between young and older adults at high‐resolution within the medial temporal lobe network (entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices), allowing us to explore how hippocampal subfield connectivity across the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus changes with age. Overall, we found reliably greater connectivity for younger adults than older adults between the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and perirhinal cortex (PRC). This drop in functional connectivity was more pronounced in the anterior regions of the hippocampus than the posterior ones, consistent for each of the hippocampal subfields. Further, intra‐hippocampal connectivity also reflected an age‐related decrease in functional connectivity within the anterior hippocampus in older adults that was offset by an increase in posterior hippocampal functional connectivity. Interestingly, the anterior–posterior dysfunction in older adults between hippocampus and PHC was predictive of lure discrimination performance on the Mnemonic similarity task (MST), suggesting a role in memory performance. While age‐related dysfunction within the hippocampal subfields has been well‐documented, these results suggest that the age‐related dysfunction in hippocampal connectivity across the longitudinal axis may also contribute significantly to memory decline in older adults.</p>

<p>Sequencing analysis for the lesion site of the rat SCI model revealed that the injury significantly stimulated the expression of circRNA‐2960, which acted as a miRNA‐124 sponge to regulate the downstream pathways. Increased circRNA‐2960 expression in SCI decreased the activity of miRNA‐124, which further promoted neuroinflammation and apoptosis

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent studies have shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in many human diseases, but their roles in secondary damage after spinal cord injury (SCI) remain unclear. In the current study circRNA sequencing was performed in the damaged tissues of SCI rats on the seventh day after injury, and related molecular mechanisms were investigated. Quantitative PCR validations of molecules that exhibited significantly altered expression in SCI mice were performed. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses were conducted to assess differentially expressed circRNAs. A novel circRNA‐2960 was the most significantly upregulated in the SCI group. It could downregulate its target molecule miRNA‐124, then exacerbate the inflammatory response and induce apoptosis at the lesion site. Disrupting circRNA‐2960 expression promoted recovery of tissues affected by secondary SCI damage. The results of the present study may provide new insight into the mechanisms of secondary injury in SCI, and a new molecular marker for the diagnosis and treatment of SCI.</p>

<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Major depressive disorder affects ~20% of the world population and is characterized by strong sexual dimorphism with females being two to three times more likely to develop this disorder. Previously, we demonstrated that a combination therapy with dihydrocaffeic acid and malvidin‐glucoside to synergistically target peripheral inflammation and stress‐induced synaptic maladaptation in the brain was effective in alleviating chronic social defeat stress (CSDS)‐induced depression‐like phenotype in male mice. Here, we test the combination therapy in a female CSDS model for depression and compared sex‐specific responses to stress in the periphery and the central nervous system. Similar to male mice, the combination treatment is also effective in promoting resilience against the CSDS‐induced depression‐like behavior in female mice. However, there are sex‐specific differences in peripheral immune responses and differential gene regulation in the prefrontal cortex to chronic stress and to the treatment. These data indicate that while therapeutic approaches to combat stress‐related disorders may be effective in both sexes, the mechanisms underlying these effects differ, emphasizing the need for inclusion of both sexes in preclinical studies using animal models.</p>

<p>In this study, we provide an overview of rhombencephalic octavolateral efferent neuron (OEN) development in the zebrafish. OENs are born in two groups: the rostral (REN) group is born in r4 with the facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs), while the caudal (CEN) group is born in r5. From there, the OENs migrate alongside the FBMNs to r6 and r7, where they cluster into bilateral nuclei. However, we identify several key differences between the mechanisms OENs and FBMNs use to migrate.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In vertebrate animals, motor and sensory efferent neurons carry information from the central nervous system (CNS) to peripheral targets. These two types of efferent systems sometimes bear a close resemblance, sharing common segmental organization, axon pathways, and chemical messengers. Here, we focus on the development of the octavolateral efferent neurons (OENs) and their interactions with the closely‐related facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs) in zebrafish. Using live‐imaging approaches, we investigate the birth, migration, and projection patterns of OENs. We find that OENs are born in two distinct groups: a group of rostral efferent neurons (RENs) that arises in the fourth segment, or rhombomere (r4), of the hindbrain and a group of caudal efferent neurons (CENs) that arises in r5. Both RENs and CENs then migrate posteriorly through the hindbrain between 18 and 48 hrs postfertilization, alongside the r4‐derived FBMNs. Like the FBMNs, migration of the r4‐derived RENs depends on function of the segmental identity gene <i>hoxb1a</i>; unlike the FBMNs, however, both OEN populations move independently of <i>prickle1b</i>. Further, we investigate whether the previously described “pioneer” neuron that leads FBMN migration through the hindbrain is an r4‐derived FBMN/REN or an r5‐derived CEN. Our experiments verify that the pioneer is an r4‐derived neuron and reaffirm its role in leading FBMN migration across the r4/5 border. In contrast, the r5‐derived CENs migrate independently of the pioneer. Together, these results indicate that the mechanisms OENs use to navigate the hindbrain differ significantly from those employed by FBMNs.</p>

<p>The abnormal accumulation of α-Synuclein (α-Syn) is a prominent pathological feature in a group of diseases called α-Synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). The formation of Lewy bodies (LBs) and glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) in neurons and oligodendrocytes, respectively, is highly investigated. However, the molecular mechanisms behind α-Syn improper folding and aggregation remain unclear. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is a Class II deacetylase, containing two active catalytic domains and a ubiquitin-binding domain. The properties of HDAC6 and its exclusive cytoplasmic localization allow HDAC6 to modulate the microtubule dynamics, acting as a specific α-tubulin deacetylase. Also, HDAC6 can bind ubiquitinated proteins, facilitating the formation of the aggresome, a cellular defense mechanism to cope with higher levels of misfolded proteins. Several studies report that the aggresome shares similarities in size and composition with LBs and GCIs. HDAC6 is found to co-localize with α-Syn in neurons and in oligodendrocytes, together with other aggresome-related proteins. The involvement of HDAC6 in several neurodegenerative diseases is already under discussion, however, the results obtained by modulating HDAC6 activity are not entirely conclusive. The main goal of this review is to summarize and critically discuss previous in vitro and in vivo data regarding the specific role of HDAC6 in the context of α-Syn accumulation and protein aggregation in α-Synucleinopathies.</p>

<p>A number of studies implicate biogenic amines in regulating circadian rhythms. In particular, dopamine and serotonin influence the entrainment of circadian rhythms to daily food availability. To study circadian entrainment to feeding, food availability is typically restricted to a short period within the light cycle daily. This results in a notable increase in pre-meal activity, termed “food anticipatory activity” (FAA), which typically develops within about 1 week of scheduled feeding. Several studies have implicated serotonin as a negative regulator of FAA: (1) aged rats treated with serotonin 5-HT2 and 3 receptor antagonists showed enhanced FAA, (2) mice lacking for the 2C serotonin receptor demonstrate enhanced FAA, and (3) pharmacologically increased serotonin levels suppressed FAA while decreased serotonin levels enhanced FAA in mice. We sought to confirm and extend these findings using genetic models with impairments in central serotonin production or re-uptake, but were surprised to find that both serotonin transporter (Slc6a4) and tryptophan hydroxylase-2 knockout mice demonstrated a normal behavioral response to timed, calorie restricted feeding. Our data suggest that FAA is largely independent of central serotonin and/or serotonin reuptake and that serotonin may not be a robust negative regulator of FAA.</p>

<p>The Neurodata Without Borders (abbreviation NWB) format is a current technology for storing neurophysiology data along with the associated metadata. Data stored in the format is organized into separate HDF5 files, each file usually storing the data associated with a single recording session. While the NWB format provides a structured method for storing data, so far there have not been tools which enable searching a collection of NWB files in order to find data of interest for a particular purpose. We describe here three tools to enable searching NWB files. The tools have different features making each of them most useful for a particular task. The first tool, called the NWB Query Engine, is written in Java. It allows searching the complete content of NWB files. It was designed for the first version of NWB (NWB 1) and supports most (but not all) features of the most recent version (NWB 2). For some searches, it is the fastest tool. The second tool, called “search_nwb” is written in Python and also allow searching the complete contents of NWB files. It works with both NWB 1 and NWB 2, as does the third tool. The third tool, called “nwbindexer” enables searching a collection of NWB files using a two-step process. In the first step, a utility is run which creates an SQLite database containing the metadata in a collection of NWB files. This database is then searched in the second step, using another utility. Once the index is built, this two-step processes allows faster searches than are done by the other tools, but does not enable as complete of searches. All three tools use a simple query language which was developed for this project. Software integrating the three tools into a web-interface is provided which enables searching NWB files by submitting a web form.</p>

<p>In this article, we review recent advances in research on rhythm and musical beat perception, focusing on the role of predictive processes in auditory motor interactions. We suggest that experimental evidence of the motor system’s role in beat perception, including in passive listening, may be explained by the generation and maintenance of internal predictive models, concordant with the Active Inference framework of sensory processing. We highlight two complementary hypotheses for the neural underpinnings of rhythm perception: The Action Simulation for Auditory Prediction hypothesis (Patel and Iversen, 2014) and the Gradual Audiomotor Evolution hypothesis (Merchant and Honing, 2014) and review recent experimental progress supporting each of these hypotheses. While initial formulations of ASAP and GAE explain different aspects of beat-based timing–the involvement of motor structures in the absence of movement, and physical entrainment to an auditory beat respectively–we suggest that work under both hypotheses provide converging evidence toward understanding the predictive role of the motor system in the perception of rhythm, and the specific neural mechanisms involved. We discuss future experimental work necessary to further evaluate the causal neural mechanisms underlying beat and rhythm perception.</p>

<p>We aimed to enhance the performance of naming and sentence production in chronic post-stroke aphasia by tablet-based language training combined with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) conducted on non-consecutive days. We applied a deblocking method involved in stimulation–facilitation therapy to six participants with chronic aphasia who performed naming and sentence production tasks for impaired modalities, immediately after a spoken-word picture-matching task for an intact modality. The participants took part in two conditional sessions: a tDCS condition in which they performed a spoken word-picture matching task while we delivered an anodal tDCS over the left inferior frontal cortex; and a sham condition in which sham stimulation was delivered. We hypothesized that, compared with the sham stimulation, the application of anodal tDCS over the left inferior frontal cortex during the performance of tasks requiring access to semantic representations would enhance the deblocking effect, thereby improving the performances for subsequent naming and sentence production. Our results showed greater improvements 2 weeks after training with tDCS than those after training with sham stimulation. The accuracy rate of naming was significantly higher in the tDCS condition than in the sham condition, regardless of whether the words were trained or not. Also, we found a significant improvement in the production of related words and sentences for the untrained words in the tDCS condition, compared with that found pre-training, while in the sham condition we found no significant improvement compared with that found pre-training. These results support our hypothesis and suggest the effectiveness of the use of tDCS during language training on non-consecutive days.</p>

<p>Social interaction is critical to emotional well-being. Previous studies have suggested sex differences in the perception of social interaction. However, the findings depend on the nature of interactions and whether it involves facial emotions. Here, we explored sex differences in neural responses to the perception of social interaction using the Human Connectome Project data. Participants (n = 969, 505 women) were engaged in a social cognition task with geometric objects moving and colliding to simulate social interaction. Behaviorally, men relative to women demonstrated higher accuracy in perceiving social vs. random interactions. Men vs. women showed higher activation in the right superior temporal gyrus, bilateral occipital and posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, and women vs. men showed higher activation in the right inferior frontal cortex, during exposure to social vs. random interactions. In whole-brain regressions, the differences in accuracy rate in identifying social vs. random interactions (AR<sub>SOC</sub> – AR<sub>RAN</sub>) were associated with higher activation in the paracentral lobule (PCL) and lower activation in bilateral anterior insula (AI), pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA), and left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) in men and women combined, lower activation in bilateral AI, preSMA and left MFG in men alone, and higher activation in the PCL and the medial orbitofrontal cortex in women alone. The latter sex differences were confirmed by slope tests. Further, the PCL activity mediated the correlation between an internalizing syndromal score, as assessed by the Achenbach Self-Report, and (AR<sub>SOC</sub> – AR<sub>RAN</sub>) across all subjects. These findings highlighted sex differences in the behavioral and neural processes underlying the perception of social interaction, as well as the influence of internalizing traits on these processes.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00345">A Theoretical Framework for How We Learn Aesthetic Values</a></h4>

<p>How do we come to like the things that we do? Each one of us starts from a relatively similar state at birth, yet we end up with vastly different sets of aesthetic preferences. These preferences go on to define us both as individuals and as members of our cultures. Therefore, it is important to understand how aesthetic preferences form over our lifetimes. This poses a challenging problem: to understand this process, one must account for the many factors at play in the formation of aesthetic values and how these factors influence each other over time. A general framework based on basic neuroscientific principles that can also account for this process is needed. Here, we present such a framework and illustrate it through a model that accounts for the trajectories of aesthetic values over time. Our framework is inspired by meta-analytic data of neuroimaging studies of aesthetic appraisal. This framework incorporates effects of sensory inputs, rewards, and motivational states. Crucially, each one of these effects is probabilistic. We model their interactions under a reinforcement-learning circuitry. Simulations of this model and mathematical analysis of the framework lead to three main findings. First, different people may develop distinct weighing of aesthetic variables because of individual variability in motivation. Second, individuals from different cultures and environments may develop different aesthetic values because of unique sensory inputs and social rewards. Third, because learning is stochastic, stemming from probabilistic sensory inputs, motivations, and rewards, aesthetic values vary in time. These three theoretical findings account for different lines of empirical research. Through our study, we hope to provide a general and unifying framework for understanding the various aspects involved in the formation of aesthetic values over time.</p>

<p>Humans organize sequences of events into a single overall experience, and evaluate the aggregated experience as a whole, such as a generally pleasant dinner, movie, or trip. However, such evaluations are potentially computationally taxing, and so our brains must employ heuristics (i.e., approximations). For example, the peak-end rule hypothesis suggests that we average the peaks and end of a sequential event vs. integrating every moment. However, there is no general model to test viable hypotheses quantitatively. Here, we propose a general model and test among multiple specific ones, while also examining the role of working memory. The models were tested with a novel picture-rating task. We first compared averaging across entire sequences vs. the peak-end heuristic. Correlation tests indicated that averaging prevailed, with peak and end both still having significant prediction power. Given this, we developed generalized order-dependent and relative-preference-dependent models to subsume averaging, peak and end. The combined model improved the prediction power. However, based on limitations of relative-preference—including imposing a potentially arbitrary ranking among preferences—we introduced an absolute-preference-dependent model, which successfully explained the remembered utilities. Yet, because using all experiences in a sequence requires too much memory as real-world settings scale, we then tested “windowed” models, i.e., evaluation within a specified window. The windowed (absolute) preference-dependent (WP) model explained the empirical data with long sequences better than without windowing. However, because fixed-windowed models harbor their own limitations—including an inability to capture peak-event influences beyond a fixed window—we then developed discounting models. With (absolute) preference-dependence added to the discounting rate, the results showed that the discounting model reflected the actual working memory of the participants, and that the preference-dependent discounting (PD) model described different features from the WP model. Taken together, we propose a combined WP-PD model as a means by which people evaluate experiences, suggesting preference-dependent working-memory as a significant factor underlying our evaluations.</p>

<p>Aging is the time-dependent functional decline that increases the vulnerability to different forms of stress, constituting the major risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Dysfunctional mitochondria significantly contribute to aging phenotypes, accumulating particularly in post-mitotic cells, including neurons. To cope with deleterious effects, mitochondria feature different mechanisms for quality control. One such mechanism is the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>MT</sup>), which corresponds to the transcriptional activation of mitochondrial chaperones, proteases, and antioxidant enzymes to repair defective mitochondria. Transcription of target UPR<sup>MT</sup> genes is epigenetically regulated by Histone 3-specific methylation. Age-dependency of this regulation could explain a differential UPR<sup>MT</sup> activity in early developmental stages or aged organisms. At the same time, precise tuning of mitochondrial stress responses is crucial for maintaining neuronal homeostasis. However, compared to other mitochondrial and stress response programs, the role of UPR<sup>MT</sup> in neurodegenerative disease is barely understood and studies in this topic are just emerging. In this review, we document the reported evidence characterizing the evolutionarily conserved regulation of the UPR<sup>MT</sup> and summarize the recent advances in understanding the role of the pathway in neurodegenerative diseases and aging.</p>

<p>Accumulating evidence has indicated that embryonic inflammation could accelerate age-associated cognitive impairment, which can be attributed to dysregulation of synaptic plasticity-associated proteins, such as RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Staufen is a double-stranded RBP that plays a critical role in the modulation of synaptic plasticity and memory. However, relatively few studies have investigated how embryonic inflammation affects cognition and neurobiology during aging, or how the adolescent psychosocial environment affects inflammation-induced remote cognitive impairment. Consequently, the aim of this study was to investigate whether these adverse factors can induce changes in Staufen expression, and whether these changes are correlated with cognitive impairment. In our study, CD-1 mice were administered lipopolysaccharides (LPS, 50 μg/kg) or an equal amount of saline (control) intraperitoneally during days 15–17 of gestation. At 2 months of age, male offspring were randomly exposed to stress (S), an enriched environment (E), or not treated (CON) and then assigned to five groups: LPS, LPS+S, LPS+E, CON, and CON+S. Mice were evaluated at 3-month-old (young) and 15-month-old (middle-aged). Cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze test, while Staufen expression was examined at both the protein and mRNA level using immunohistochemistry/western blotting and RNAscope technology, respectively. The results showed that the middle-aged mice had worse cognitive performance and higher Staufen expression than young mice. Embryonic inflammation induced cognitive impairment and increased Staufen expression in the middle-aged mice, whereas adolescent stress/an enriched environment would accelerated/mitigated these effects. Meanwhile, Staufen expression was closely correlated with cognitive performance. Our findings suggested embryonic inflammation can accelerate age-associated learning and memory impairments, and these effects may be related to the Staufen expression.</p>

<p>Vision, which requires extensive neural involvement, is often impaired in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Over the last few decades, accumulating evidence has shown that various visual functions and structures are compromised in Alzheimer’s dementia and when measured can detect those with dementia from those with normal aging. These visual changes involve both the afferent and efferent parts of the visual system, which correspond to the sensory and eye movement aspects of vision, respectively. There are fewer, but a growing number of studies, that focus on the detection of predementia stages. Visual biomarkers that detect these stages are paramount in the development of successful disease-modifying therapies by identifying appropriate research participants and in identifying those who would receive future therapies. This review provides a summary and update on common afferent and efferent visual markers of AD with a focus on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and preclinical disease detection. We further propose future directions in this area. Given the ease of performing visual tests, the accessibility of the eye, and advances in ocular technology, visual measures have the potential to be effective, practical, and non-invasive biomarkers of AD.</p>

<p>The loss of cognitive function in Alzheimer’s disease is pathologically linked with neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid deposition, and loss of neuronal communication. Cerebral insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction have emerged as important contributors to pathogenesis supporting our hypothesis that cerebral fructose metabolism is a key initiating pathway for Alzheimer’s disease. Fructose is unique among nutrients because it activates a survival pathway to protect animals from starvation by lowering energy in cells in association with adenosine monophosphate degradation to uric acid. The fall in energy from fructose metabolism stimulates foraging and food intake while reducing energy and oxygen needs by decreasing mitochondrial function, stimulating glycolysis, and inducing insulin resistance. When fructose metabolism is overactivated systemically, such as from excessive fructose intake, this can lead to obesity and diabetes. Herein, we present evidence that Alzheimer’s disease may be driven by overactivation of cerebral fructose metabolism, in which the source of fructose is largely from endogenous production in the brain. Thus, the reduction in mitochondrial energy production is hampered by neuronal glycolysis that is inadequate, resulting in progressive loss of cerebral energy levels required for neurons to remain functional and viable. In essence, we propose that Alzheimer’s disease is a modern disease driven by changes in dietary lifestyle in which fructose can disrupt cerebral metabolism and neuronal function. Inhibition of intracerebral fructose metabolism could provide a novel way to prevent and treat this disease.</p>

The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to assess cognitive function at baseline and 2 years later. Restricted cubic splines, multivariate logistic regression, and multivariate linear regression models were used to evaluate the type of relationship between cognitive decline during the 2-year follow-up period and plasma Aβ levels (Aβ<sub>40</sub>, Aβ<sub>42</sub>, and Aβ<sub>42</sub><sub>/</sub><sub>40</sub>).</p>Results<p>Participants with moderate Aβ<sub>40</sub> levels had the highest risk of cognitive decline during a 2-year follow-up relative to individuals with low Aβ<sub>40</sub> [odds ratio (OR): 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.45–0.81, p &lt; 0.001] or high Aβ<sub>40</sub> (OR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.49–0.87, p = 0.004) levels. The association between Aβ<sub>40</sub> and cognitive decline did not depend on sex, education level, or APOE ε4 status. There was an interaction found between age (≤ 65 and &gt; 65 years) and Aβ<sub>40</sub> (p for interaction = 0.021). In individuals older than 65 years, there was a positive linear relationship between plasma Aβ<sub>40</sub> and cognitive decline (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.00–1.04, p = 0.027). For participants ≤ 65 years old, the lower Aβ<sub>40</sub> and higher Aβ<sub>40</sub> groups had a lower risk of cognitive decline than the medium Aβ<sub>40</sub> group (OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.50–0.94, p = 0.02; OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.45–0.86, p = 0.004). None of relationship between plasma Aβ<sub>42</sub>, Aβ<sub>42</sub><sub>/</sub><sub>40</sub> and cognitive decline was found during a 2-year follow-up.</p>Conclusion<p>The relationship between plasma Aβ<sub>40</sub> and cognitive decline was not linear, but an inverted-U shape in a cognitively normal population.

<p>Background: Braking force is a gait marker associated with gait stability. This study aimed to determine the alteration of braking force and its correlation with gait stability in Alzheimer disease (AD).</p><p>Methods: A total of 32 AD patients and 32 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. Gait parameters (braking force, gait variability, and fall risk) in the walking tests of Free walk, Barrier, and Count backward were measured by JiBuEn<sup>®</sup> gait analysis system. Gait variability was calculated by the coefficient of variation (COV) of stride time, stance time, and swing time.</p><p>Results: The braking force of AD was significantly weaker than HCs in three walking tests (P &lt; 0.001, P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.007). Gait variability of AD showed significant elevation than HCs in the walking of Count backward (COV<sub>stride</sub>: P = 0.013; COV<sub>swing</sub>: P = 0.006). Fall risk of AD was significantly higher than HCs in three walking tests (P = 0.001, P = 0.001, P = 0.001). Braking force was negatively associated with fall risks in three walking tests (P &lt; 0.001, P &lt; 0.001, P &lt; 0.001). There were significant negative correlations between braking force and gait variability in the walking of Free walk (COV<sub>stride</sub>: P = 0.018; COV<sub>swing</sub>: P = 0.013) and Barrier (COV<sub>stride</sub>: P = 0.002; COV<sub>swing</sub>: P = 0.001), but not Count backward (COV<sub>stride</sub>: P = 0.888; COV<sub>swing</sub>: P = 0.555).</p><p>Conclusion: Braking force was weaker in AD compared to HCs, reflecting the worse gait stability of AD.

<p>Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) including donepezil (DNP) are considered to be the most promising therapeutic possibilities of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The response to DNP in AD patients varies and it is valuable to identify the potential markers that can predict the efficacy. Moreover, DNP has been found to affect bone function, but the exact mechanism is still unclear. Lipids and adipokine may link to AD and DNP directly or indirectly and might be potential biomarkers or therapeutic drug targets. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationships among adiponectin (APN), lipids levels, and the response to DNP, and to identify whether the effect of DNP in AD treatment is related to its effect on the level of APN in systemic circulation. The study recruited 85 AD patients with DNP treatment, of whom 47 were DNP responders and 38 were DNP nonresponders. The Mini-Mental State Examination was performed to evaluate the memory impairment. Plasma APN was measured with ELISA. The genotypes of single nucleotide polymorphisms rs1501299 and rs22417661 in APN for each patient were identified. Plasma lipids were quantified with gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Correlations among APN, lipid metabolomics, and DNP responded were evaluated. APN was significantly decreased in DNP responders. Methyl stearate and glycerol-3-phosphate, used for characterizing adipogenic differentiation, were significantly decreased in DNP responders compared to DNP nonresponders. APN and small-molecule lipids can be used as potential biomarkers to evaluate the efficacy of DNP. The results of metabolomics indicated that there was no change in the metabolic pathway of fatty acid metabolism and glucose metabolism in DNP responders, suggesting that APN-related biological function did not decrease in DNP responders. Our result suggests that more attention should be pay to the sources and biological functions of APN in AD with DNP treatment.</p>

<p>Background: Recently, considerable research has been conducted to study the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on balance control in older adults. We completed a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of tDCS on balance control in this population.</p><p>Methods: A search strategy based on the PICOS principle was used to find the literatures in the databases of PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO, Web of Science. The quality and risk of bias in the studies were independently assessed by two researchers.</p><p>Results: Ten studies were included in the systematic review. A meta-analysis was completed on six of these ten, with a total of 280 participants. As compared to sham (i.e., control), tDCS induced significant improvement with low heterogeneity in balance control in older adults. Specifically, tDCS induced large effects on the performance of the timed-up-and-go test, the Berg balance scale, and standing postural sway (e.g., sway area) and gait (e.g., walking speed) in dual task conditions (standardized mean differences (SMDs) = −0.99~3.41 95% confidence limits (CL): −1.52~4.50, p &lt; 0.006, I<sup>2</sup> &lt; 52%). Moderate-to-large effects of tDCS were also observed in the standing posture on a static or movable platform (SMDs = 0.37~1.12 95%CL: −0.09~1.62, p &lt; 0.03, I<sup>2</sup> &lt; 62%).</p><p>Conclusion: Our analysis indicates that tDCS holds promise to promote balance in older adults. These results warrant future studies of larger sample size and rigorous study design and results report, as well as specific research to establish the relationship between the parameter of tDCS and the extent of tDCS-induced improvement in balance control in older adults.</p>

<p>Background and Purpose: Previous studies found inconsistent results regarding the relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and catecholamines, such as dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine (EPI). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the results of previous studies on this relationship.</p><p>Method: Literature retrieval of eligible studies was performed in four databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and PsycARTICLES). Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated to assess differences in catecholamine concentrations between the AD groups and controls.</p><p>Results: Thirteen studies met the eligibility criteria. Compared with the controls, significant lower concentrations of NE (SMD = −1.10, 95% CI: −2.01 to −0.18, p = 0.019) and DA (SMD = −1.12, 95% CI: −1.88 to −0.37, p = 0.003) were observed in patients with AD. No difference was found in the concentrations of EPI between the two groups (SMD = −0.74, 95% CI: −1.85 to 0.37, p = 0.189).</p><p>Conclusion: Overall, these findings are in line with the hypothesis that reduced NE and DA may be an important indicator for AD (Registration number CRD42018112816).</p>
