Abstract
<p>Src is highly expressed in CNS neurons and contributes not only to developmental proliferation and differentiation but also to high-order brain functions, such as those contributing to alcohol consumption. Src knock-out mice exhibit no CNS abnormalities, presumably due to compensation by other Src family kinases (SFKs), but have a shortened lifespan and osteopetrosis-associated defects, impeding investigations of the role of Src on behavior in adult mice. However, the Unique domain of Src differs from those in other SFKs and is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) and Cdk5 at Ser75, which influences its postmitotic function in neurons. Therefore, ethanol consumption in mice harboring nonphosphorylatable (Ser75Ala) or phosphomimetic (Ser75Asp) Src mutants was investigated. Mice harboring the Ser75Ala Src mutant, but not the Ser75Asp mutant, had a higher preference for and consumption of solutions containing 5% and 10% ethanol than wild-type mice. However, plasma ethanol concentrations and sensitivities to the sedative effects of ethanol were not different among the groups. In mice harboring the Ser75Ala Src mutant, the activity of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) in the striatum was significantly lower and Akt Ser473 phosphorylation was significantly higher than in wild-type mice. These results suggest that Src regulates voluntary ethanol drinking in a manner that depends on Ser75 phosphorylation.</p>

Abstract
<p>The auditory system relies on binaural differences and spectral pinna cues to localize sounds in azimuth and elevation. However, the acoustic input can be unreliable, due to uncertainty about the environment, and neural noise. A possible strategy to reduce sound-location uncertainty is to integrate the sensory observations with sensorimotor information from previous experience, to infer where sounds are more likely to occur. We investigated whether and how human sound localization performance is affected by the spatial distribution of target sounds, and changes thereof. We tested three different open-loop paradigms, in which we varied the spatial range of sounds in different ways. For the narrowest ranges, target-response gains were highly idiosyncratic and deviated from an optimal gain predicted by error-minimization; in the horizontal plane the deviation typically consisted of a response overshoot. Moreover, participants adjusted their behavior by rapidly adapting their gain to the target range, both in elevation and in azimuth, yielding behavior closer to optimal for larger target ranges. Notably, gain changes occurred without any exogenous feedback about performance. We discuss how the findings can be explained by a sub-optimal model in which the motor-control system reduces its response error across trials to within an acceptable range, rather than strictly minimizing the error.</p>

<p>Despite the impressive success of quantum structures to model long-standing
human judgement and decision puzzles, the {\it quantum cognition research
programme} still faces challenges about its explanatory power. Indeed, quantum
models introduce new parameters, which may fit empirical data without
necessarily explaining them. Also, one wonders whether more general
non-classical structures are better equipped to model cognitive phenomena. In
this paper, we provide a {\it realistic-operational foundation of decision
processes} using a known decision-making puzzle, the {\it Ellsberg paradox}, as
a case study. Then, we elaborate a novel representation of the Ellsberg
decision situation applying standard quantum correspondence rules which map
realistic-operational entities into quantum mathematical terms. This result
opens the way towards an independent, foundational rather than
phenomenological, motivation for a general use of quantum Hilbert space
structures in human cognition.

<p>Any function can be constructed using a hierarchy of simpler functions
through compositions. Such a hierarchy can be characterized by a binary rooted
tree. Each node of this tree is associated with a function which takes as
inputs two numbers from its children and produces one output. Since thinking
about functions in terms of computation graphs is getting popular we may want
to know which functions can be implemented on a given tree. Here, we describe a
set of necessary constraints in the form of a system of non-linear partial
differential equations that must be satisfied. Moreover, we prove that these
conditions are sufficient in both contexts of analytic and bit-value functions.
In the latter case, we explicitly enumerate discrete functions and observe that
there are relatively few. Our point of view allows us to compare different
neural network architectures in regard to their function spaces. Our work
connects the structure of computation graphs with the functions they can
implement and has potential applications to neuroscience and computer science.

Immunology and philosophy have a rich history of dialogue. Immunologists have long been influenced by ideas from philosophy, notably the concept of 'self', and many philosophers have explored the conceptual, theoretical and methodological foundations of immunology. Here, I discuss two aspects of this dialogue: biological individuality and immunogenicity.

The availability of big data has the potential to transform many areas of the life sciences and usher in new ways of doing research. Here, I argue that big data biology also raises fundamental questions in the philosophy of science: for example, what is a good dataset, and how can reliable knowledge be extracted from big data? Collaborations between biologists, data scientists and philosophers of science will help us to answer these and other questions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45210">A bacterial riboswitch class for the thiamin precursor HMP-PP employs a terminator-embedded aptamer</a></h4>

We recently implemented a bioinformatics pipeline that can uncover novel, but rare, riboswitch candidates as well as other noncoding RNA structures in bacteria. A prominent candidate revealed by our initial search efforts was called the '<i>thiS</i> motif' because of its frequent association with a gene coding for the ThiS protein, which delivers sulfur to form the thiazole moiety of the thiamin precursor HET-P. In the current report, we describe biochemical and genetic data demonstrating that <i>thiS</i> motif RNAs function as sensors of the thiamin precursor HMP-PP, which is fused with HET-P ultimately to form the final active coenzyme thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP). HMP-PP riboswitches exhibit a distinctive architecture wherein an unusually small ligand-sensing aptamer is almost entirely embedded within an otherwise classic intrinsic transcription terminator stem. This arrangement yields remarkably compact genetic switches that bacteria use to tune the levels of thiamin precursors during the biosynthesis of this universally distributed coenzyme.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44558">Decoys provide a scalable platform for identification of plant E3 ubiquitin ligases that regulate circadian function</a></h4>

The circadian clock relies on regulated degradation of clock proteins to maintain rhythmicity. Despite this, we know few components that mediate protein degradation. This is due to high levels of functional redundancy within plant E3 ubiquitin ligase families. In order to overcome this issue and discover E3 ubiquitin ligases that control circadian function, we generated a library of transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing dominant-negative 'decoy' E3 ubiquitin ligases. We determined their effects on the circadian clock and identified dozens of new potential regulators of circadian function. To demonstrate the potency of the decoy screening methodology to overcome redundancy and identify <i>bona fide</i> clock regulators, we performed follow-up studies on <i>MAC3A</i> (<i>PUB59</i>) and <i>MAC3B </i>(<i>PUB60</i>). We show that they redundantly control circadian period by regulating splicing. This work demonstrates the viability of ubiquitin ligase decoys as a screening platform to overcome genetic challenges and discover E3 ubiquitin ligases that regulate plant development.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43962">Sensory prediction errors in the human midbrain signal identity violations independent of perceptual distance</a></h4>

The firing of dopaminergic midbrain neurons is thought to reflect prediction errors (PE) that depend on the difference between the value of expected and received rewards. However, recent work has demonstrated that unexpected changes in value-neutral outcome features, such as identity, can evoke similar responses. It remains unclear whether the magnitude of these identity PEs scales with the perceptual dissimilarity of expected and received rewards, or whether they are independent of perceptual similarity. We used a Pavlovian transreinforcer reversal task to elicit identity PEs for value-matched food odor rewards, drawn from two perceptual categories (sweet, savory). Replicating previous findings, identity PEs were correlated with fMRI activity in midbrain, OFC, piriform cortex, and amygdala. However, the magnitude of identity PE responses was independent of the perceptual distance between expected and received outcomes, suggesting that identity comparisons underlying sensory PEs may occur in an abstract state space independent of straightforward sensory percepts.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42571">Narrow equilibrium window for complex coacervation of tau and RNA under cellular conditions</a></h4>

The mechanism that leads to liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of the tau protein, whose pathological aggregation is implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, is not well understood. Establishing a phase diagram that delineates the boundaries of phase co-existence is key to understanding whether LLPS is an equilibrium or intermediate state. We demonstrate that tau and RNA reversibly form complex coacervates. While the equilibrium phase diagram can be fit to an analytical theory, a more advanced model is investigated through field theoretic simulations (FTS) that provided direct insight into the thermodynamic driving forces of tau LLPS. Together, experiment and simulation reveal that tau-RNA LLPS is stable within a narrow equilibrium window near physiological conditions over experimentally tunable parameters including temperature, salt and tau concentrations, and is entropy-driven. Guided by our phase diagram, we show that tau can be driven toward LLPS under live cell coculturing conditions with rationally chosen experimental parameters.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42498">Light-based tuning of ligand half-life supports kinetic proofreading model of T cell signaling</a></h4>

T cells are thought to discriminate self from foreign peptides by converting small differences in ligand binding half-life into large changes in cell signaling. Such a kinetic proofreading model has been difficult to test directly, as existing methods of altering ligand binding half-life also change other potentially important biophysical parameters, most notably the mechanical stability of the receptor-ligand interaction. Here we develop an optogenetic approach to specifically tune the binding half-life of a chimeric antigen receptor without changing other binding parameters and provide direct evidence of kinetic proofreading in T cell signaling. This half-life discrimination is executed in the proximal signaling pathway, downstream of ZAP70 recruitment and upstream of diacylglycerol accumulation. Our methods represent a general tool for temporal and spatial control of T cell signaling and extend the reach of optogenetics to probe pathways where the individual molecular kinetics, rather than the ensemble average, gates downstream signaling.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42475">Optogenetic control shows that kinetic proofreading regulates the activity of the T cell receptor</a></h4>

The immune system distinguishes between self and foreign antigens. The kinetic proofreading (KPR) model proposes that T cells discriminate self from foreign ligands by the different ligand binding half-lives to the T cell receptor (TCR). It is challenging to test KPR as the available experimental systems fall short of only altering the binding half-lives and keeping other parameters of the interaction unchanged. We engineered an optogenetic system using the plant photoreceptor phytochrome B (PhyB) as a ligand to selectively control the dynamics of ligand binding to the TCR by light. This opto-ligand-TCR system was combined with the unique property of PhyB to continuously cycle between the binding and non-binding states under red light, with the light intensity determining the cycling rate and thus the binding duration. Mathematical modeling of our experimental datasets showed that indeed the ligand-TCR interaction half-life is the decisive factor for activating downstream TCR signaling, substantiating KPR.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42434">Distinct mesoderm migration phenotypes in extra-embryonic and embryonic regions of the early mouse embryo</a></h4>

In mouse embryo gastrulation, epiblast cells delaminate at the primitive streak to form mesoderm and definitive endoderm, through an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Mosaic expression of a membrane reporter in nascent mesoderm enabled recording cell shape and trajectory through live imaging. Upon leaving the streak, cells changed shape and extended protrusions of distinct size and abundance depending on the neighboring germ layer, as well as the region of the embryo. Embryonic trajectories were meandrous but directional, while extra-embryonic mesoderm cells showed little net displacement. Embryonic and extra-embryonic mesoderm transcriptomes highlighted distinct guidance, cytoskeleton, adhesion, and extracellular matrix signatures. Specifically, intermediate filaments were highly expressed in extra-embryonic mesoderm, while live imaging for F-actin showed abundance of actin filaments in embryonic mesoderm only. Accordingly, <i>Rhoa</i> or <i>Rac1</i> conditional deletion in mesoderm inhibited embryonic, but not extra-embryonic mesoderm migration. Overall, this indicates separate cytoskeleton regulation coordinating the morphology and migration of mesoderm subpopulations.

Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has shown to have promising results in a pilot study with patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD). A recent study in aged monkeys shows a novel intermittent stimulation pattern to have superior cognitive benefits over continuous paradigms. Objective/Hypothesis: We aimed at comparing the cognitive effects elicited by intermittent and continuous NBM stimulation paradigms in an animal model for AD (TgF344-AD rat line; TG), i.e. rats expressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APPsw) and presenilin 1 (PS1{Delta}E9) genes, each independent causes of early-onset familial AD. Methods: In this exploratory study, aged APP/PS1 rats were tested pre-, and post implantation with several stimulation parameters, i.e. unilateral- or bilateral-intermittent, and bilateral-continuous, while performing various behavioral tasks (open field, novel object recognition, and modified Barnes maze). Results and Conclusion: Bilateral-intermittent NBM DBS allowed aged TG rats to perform better and maintain their performance longer in a spatial memory task, as compared to other conditions. These data support the notion that NBM DBS could be further refined in the clinic, thereby improving patient care.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/600239v1?rss=1">Decoding neuronal diversity by single-cell Convert-seq</a></h4>

The conversion of cell fates is controlled by hierarchical gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that induce remarkable alterations in cellular and transcriptome states. The identification of key regulators within these networks from myriad of candidate genes, however, poses a major research challenge. Here we present Convert-seq, combining single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and pooled ectopic gene expression with a new strategy to discriminate sequencing reads derived from exogenous and endogenous transcripts. We demonstrate Convert-seq by associating hundreds of single cells during reprogramming of human fibroblasts to induced neurons (iN) with exogenous and endogenous transcriptional signatures. Convert-seq identified GRNs modulating the emergence of developmental trajectories and predicted combinatorial activation of exogenous transcription factors controlling iN subtype specification. Functional validation of iN subtypes generated by novel combinations of exogenous transcription factors establish Convert-seq as a broadly applicable workflow to rapidly identify key transcription factors and GRNs orchestrating the reprogramming of virtually any cell type.

How do we learn to establish associations between arbitrary visual cues (like a red light) and movements (like braking the car)? We investigated the neural correlates of visuomotor association learning in the monkey mid-lateral cerebellum. Here we show that, during learning but not when the associations were overlearned, individual Purkinje cells reported the outcome of the monkey's most recent decision, an error signal, which was independent of changes in hand movement or reaction time. At the population level, Purkinje cells collectively maintained a memory of the most recent decision throughout the entire trial period, updating it after every decision. This error signal decreased as the performance improved. Our results suggest a role of mid-lateral cerebellum in visuomotor associative learning and provide evidence that cerebellum could be a generalized learning system, essential in non-motor learning as well as motor learning.

Divisive normalization has long been used to account for computations in various neural processes and behaviours. The model proposes that inputs into a neural system are divisively normalized by the total activity of the system. More recently, dynamical versions of divisive normalization have been shown to account for how neural activity evolves over time in value-based decision making. Despite its ubiquity, divisive normalization has not been studied in decisions that require evidence to be integrated over time. Such decisions are important when we do not have all the information available at once. A key feature of such decisions is how evidence is weighted over time, known as the integration 'kernel'. Here we provide a formal expression for the integration kernel in divisive normalization, and show that divisive normalization can quantitatively account for the perceptual decision making behaviour of 133 human participants, performing as well as the state-of-the-art Drift Diffusion Model, the predominant model for perceptual evidence accumulation.

Dendritic spines are specialized postsynaptic structures that detect and integrate presynaptic signals. The shape and number of dendritic spines are regulated by neural activity and correlated with learning and memory. Most studies of spine function have focused on the mammalian nervous system. However, spine-like protrusions have been previously reported in invertebrates, suggesting that the experimental advantages of smaller model organisms could be exploited to study the biology of dendritic spines. Here, we document the presence of dendritic spines in Caenorhabditis elegans motor neurons. We used super-resolution microscopy, electron microscopy, live-cell imaging and genetic manipulation to show that GABAergic motor neurons display functional dendritic spines. Our analysis revealed salient features of dendritic spines: (1) A key role for the actin cytoskeleton in spine morphogenesis; (2) Postsynaptic receptor complexes at the tips of spines in close proximity to presynaptic active zones; (3) Localized postsynaptic calcium transients evoked by presynaptic activity; (4) The presence of endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes; (5) The regulation of spine density by presynaptic activity. These studies provide a solid foundation for a new experimental paradigm that exploits the power of C. elegans genetics and live-cell imaging for fundamental studies of dendritic spine morphogenesis and function.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/598680v1?rss=1">Budgerigars adopt robust, but idiosyncratic flight paths</a></h4>

We have investigated the paths taken by Budgerigars while flying in a tunnel. The preferred flight trajectories of nine Budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) were reconstructed in 3D from high speed stereo videography of their flights in an obstacle-free tunnel. Individual birds displayed highly idiosyncratic flight trajectories that were consistent from flight to flight over the course of several months. We then investigated the robustness of each bird's trajectory by interposing a disk-shaped obstacle in its preferred flight path. We found that each bird continued to fly along its preferred trajectory up to a point very close to the obstacle before veering away rapidly, making a minimal deviation to avoid a collision, and subsequently returning to its original path. Thus, Budgerigars show a high propensity to stick to their individual, preferred flight paths even when confronted with a clearly visible obstacle, and do not adopt a substantially different, safer route. Detailed analysis of the last-minute avoidance manoeuvre suggests that a collision is avoided by restricting the magnitude of the optic flow generated by the obstacle to a maximum value of about 700 deg/sec. The robust preference for idiosyncratic flight paths, and the tendency to pass obstacles by flying above them, provide new insights into the strategies that underpin obstacle avoidance in birds. It could also have wide-ranging implications for conservation efforts to mitigate collisions of birds with man-made obstacles - especially obstacles that are poorly visible, such as wind turbines or buildings with glass facades. Our findings indicate that care needs to be exercised to ensure that newly planned structures are not located near major bird flyways, wherever possible, and to ensure that the positioning takes into consideration the cues and behaviours that birds use to avoid such obstacles.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/598615v1?rss=1">Modulation of adult-born neuron excitability by coupling to GABAergic networks</a></h4>

New granule cells (GCs) are generated in the hippocampus of adult mammals including humans. These neurons grow in a rather silent network governed by inhibition, but they are initially hyperexcitable because they are uncoupled from the dominant GABAergic tone. The precise timing and synaptic mechanisms that control the excitability of new GCs remain unclear. To build an accurate matrix of neurogenesis-mediated circuit remodeling, we studied afferent and efferent synaptogenesis between developing GCs and two major types of GABAergic interneurons; parvalbumin- (PV-INs) and somatostatin-expressing cells (SST-INs). Inputs from PV-INs targeted the soma and grew abruptly in &gt;4-week-old GCs, coincident with the termination of their highly excitable period. In contrast, inputs from SST-INs were dendritic and developed steadily until reaching maturity by 8 weeks. These step-wise vs. graded patterns of synaptic maturation were also revealed in output synaptogenesis from GCs onto PV-INs and SST-INs. When mature, activity of GCs becomes controlled by feedforward loops dominated by PV-INs, and feedback loops that include both IN types. Therefore, the delayed integration of new cohorts into inhibitory networks generates heterogeneous neuronal populations that contribute to enhance the dynamic range of responsiveness in the dentate gyrus.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/598599v1?rss=1">Pathological and non-pathological aging, SAMP8 and SAMR1. What do hippocampal neuronal populations tell us?</a></h4>

Alterations of cognitive processes and memory are one of the most important manifestations related to aging. However, not all memory types are affected in the same way. Learning and spatial memory are susceptible to these changes. The hippocampus represents the anatomical substrate of this type of memory, affected by structural and functional alterations along the normal aging and neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's, schizophrenia and epilepsy. Some of the alterations related to aging are associated with alterations in the hippocampal interneuron populations and with an increase in excitability in the hippocampal circuit. In order to understand better the underlying processes in normal and pathological aging mechanisms, a murine model (Senescence-Accelerated Mouse Prone, SAMP8) and its respective controls (Senescence-Accelerated Mouse Resistant, SAMR1) have been used. While SAMP8 is a naturally occurring mouse line that displays a phenotype of accelerated aging with learning and memory impairment and these changes of learning and memory might be linked to some alterations in neuronal populations of the hippocampus. Thus, we analyzed the distribution and density of PV, CR and STT interneurons in the hippocampus of young and old mice as well as possible morphological and cholinergic changes in hippocampal formation. Comparing SAMR1 and SAMP8 we did not find any neural population that was specifically affected by aging in both groups. Interestingly, CR immunoreactivity and STT immunoreactivity showed changes in SAMP8 mice when they were compared to their controls. In SAMP8 CR+ and STT+ neurons decreased significantly along aging which suggests that CR and STT interneurons play a more important role than PV neurons in the pathological aging of the brain. In the case of SAMP8 mice the neural changes might be related to changes of the cholinergic system that might be affecting the wiring into the hippocampus formation through the perforant pathway. Further studies of this local circuitry will help to comprehend better how different inputs into these neural populations of the hippocampus could be affecting the development of neurodegerative diseases.

Misfolding and aggregation of proteins is strongly linked to several neurodegenerative diseases but how such species bring about their cytotoxic actions remains poorly understood. Here we used specifically-designed optical reporter probes and live fluorescence imaging in primary hippocampal neurons to characterise the mechanism by which prefibrillar, oligomeric forms of the Alzheimers-associated peptide, A{beta}42, exert their detrimental effects. We used a pH-sensitive reporter, A{beta}42-CypHer, to track A{beta} internalisation in real time, demonstrating that oligomers are rapidly taken up into cells in a dynamin-dependent manner, and trafficked via the endo-lysosomal pathway resulting in accumulation in lysosomes. In contrast, a non-assembling variant of A{beta}42 (vA{beta}42) assayed in the same way is not internalised. Tracking ovalbumin uptake into cells using CypHer or Alexa Fluor tags, shows that preincubation with A{beta}42 significantly disrupts protein uptake. Our results identify a potential mechanism by which amyloidogenic aggregates directly impair cellular function through disruption of the endosomal-lysosomal pathway.

Sounds (e.g., barking) help us to visually identify objects (e.g., a dog) that are distant or ambiguous. While neuroimaging studies have revealed neuroanatomical sites of audiovisual interactions, little is known about the time-course by which sounds facilitate visual object processing. Here we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to reveal the time-course of the facilitatory influence of natural sounds (e.g., barking) on visual object processing, and compared this to the facilitatory influence of spoken words (e.g., "dog"). Participants viewed images of blurred objects preceded by a task-irrelevant natural sound, a spoken word, or uninformative noise. A classifier was trained to discriminate multivariate sensor patterns evoked by animate and inanimate intact objects with no sounds, presented in a separate experiment, and tested on sensor patterns evoked by the blurred objects in the three auditory conditions. Results revealed that both sounds and words, relative to uninformative noise, significantly facilitated visual object category decoding between 300-500 ms after visual onset. We found no evidence for earlier facilitation by sounds than by words. These findings provide evidence for a semantic route of facilitation by both natural sounds and spoken words, whereby the auditory input first activates semantic object representations, which then modulate the visual processing of objects.

To examine the behavioural and neural interactions between objective and subjective performance during competitive decision-making, participants completed a Matching Pennies game where win-rates were fixed within three conditions (win &gt; lose, win = lose, win &lt; lose) and outcomes were predicted at each trial. Using random behaviour as the hallmark of optimal performance, we observed item (heads), contingency (win-stay, lose-shift) and combinatorial (HH, HT, TH, TT) biases across all conditions. Higher-quality behaviour represented by a reduction in combinatorial bias was observed during high win-rate exposure. In contrast, over-optimism biases were observed only in conditions where win rates were equal to, or less than, loss rates. At a group level, a neural measure of outcome evaluation (feedback-related negativity; FRN) indexed the binary distinction between positive and negative outcome. At an individual level, increased belief in successful performance accentuated FRN amplitude differences between wins and losses. Taken together, the data suggest that objective experiences of, or, subjective beliefs in, the predominance of positive outcomes are mutual attempts to self-regulate performance during competition. In this way, increased exposure to positive outcomes (real or imagined) help to weight the output of the more diligent and analytic System 2, relative to the impulsive and intuitive System 1.

Joint relaxation-diffusion measurements can provide new insight about the tissue microstructural properties. Most recent methods have focused on inverting the Laplace transform to recover the joint distribution of relaxation-diffusion. However, as is well-known, this problem is notoriously ill-posed and numerically unstable. In this work, we address this issue by directly computing the joint moments of transverse relaxation rate and diffusivity, which can be robustly estimated. To zoom into different parts of the joint distribution, we further enhance our method by applying multiplicative filters to the joint probability density function of relaxation and diffusion and compute the corresponding moments. We propose an approach to use these moments to compute several novel scalar indices to characterize specific properties of the underlying tissue microstructure. Furthermore, for the first time, we propose an algorithm to estimate diffusion signals that are independent of echo time based on the moments of the marginal probability density function of diffusion. We demonstrate its utility in extracting tissue information not contaminated with multiple intra-voxel relaxation rates. We compare the performance of four types of filters that zoom into tissue components with different relaxation and diffusion properties and demonstrate it on an in-vivo human dataset. Experimental results show that these filters are able to characterize heterogeneous tissue microstructure. Moreover, the filtered diffusion signals are also able to distinguish fiber bundles with similar orientations but different relaxation rates. The proposed method thus allows to characterize the neural microstructure information in a robust and unique manner not possible using existing techniques.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/598276v1?rss=1">Initial neural representation of individual rules after first-time instruction</a></h4>

By following explicit instructions humans can instantaneously get the hang of tasks they have never performed before. Here, we used a specially calibrated multivariate analysis technique to uncover the elusive representational states following newly instructed arbitrary behavioural rules such as 'for coffee, press red button', while transitioning from 'knowing what to do' to 'actually doing it'. Subtle variation in distributed neural activity patterns reflected rule-specific representations within the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), confined to instructed stimulus-response learning in contrast to incidental learning involving the same stimuli and responses. VLPFC representations were established right after first-time instruction and remained stable across early implementation trials. More and more fluent application of novel rule representations was channelled through increasing cooperation between VLPFC and anterior striatum. These findings inform representational theories on how the prefrontal cortex supports behavioural flexibility by enabling ad-hoc coding of novel task rules without recourse to familiar sub-routines

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/598268v1?rss=1">The effect of acute stress on the balance between goal-directed and habit networks in obsessive-compulsive disorder.</a></h4>

Introduction: The classical cognitive-behavioral theory of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) holds that compulsions (repetitive behaviors) are performed to reduce distress that is evoked by obsessions (intrusive thoughts), whereas a recent neuroscience-inspired theory suggests that compulsivity results from a disbalance between goal-directed and habit-related neural networks. Stress exacerbates OCD symptoms in patients but also shifts goal-directed behavior towards habitual behavior in healthy volunteers. To bridge these theories, we investigated whether acute stress would influence the balance between goal-directed and habit networks in patients with OCD. Methods: Twenty-three OCD patients and twenty-three healthy controls participated in a controlled stress induction paradigm using the socially evaluated cold-pressor test in a crossover design. Stress responses were evaluated through cortisol, blood pressure and heart rate measurements and anxiety ratings, while brain activity was measured with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. A seed-to-voxel analysis was performed for the caudate nucleus and posterior putamen as hubs of the goal-directed and habit network, respectively. Results: Stress induction increased blood pressure and psychological stress measures across groups and resulted in blunted cortisol responses in patients. Furthermore, acute stress increased connectivity between the caudate nucleus and precuneus in patients compared to healthy controls, which was positively correlated with compulsivity but not obsession severity. The posterior putamen showed no significant group differences in stress-induced connectivity. Conclusion: Acute stress increases the interaction between the goal-directed and default mode network in OCD, which is associated with compulsivity severity. These findings suggest that stress-related compulsivity involves increased recruitment of the goal-directed network.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/598086v1?rss=1">Inferring the function performed by a recurrent neural network</a></h4>

A central goal in systems neuroscience is to understand the functions performed by neural circuits. Previous top-down models addressed this question by comparing the behaviour of an ideal model circuit, optimised to perform a given function, with neural recordings. However, this requires guessing in advance what function is being performed, which may not be possible for many neural systems. Here, we propose an alternative approach that uses recorded neural responses to directly infer the function performed by a neural network. We assume that the goal of the network can be expressed via a reward function, which describes how desirable each state of the network is for carrying out a given objective. This allows us to frame the problem of optimising each neuron's responses by viewing neurons as agents in a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm; likewise the problem of inferring the reward function from the observed dynamics can be treated using inverse RL. Our framework encompasses previous influential theories of neural coding, such as efficient coding and attractor network models, as special cases, given specific choices of reward function. Finally, we can use the reward function inferred from recorded neural responses to make testable predictions about how the network dynamics will adapt depending on contextual changes, such as cell death and/or varying input statistics, so as to carry out the same underlying function with different constraints.

Objective: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the neurobehavioral disorder with the largest prevalence rate in childhood. ADHD is generally assessed based on physical examination of the child and interviews, and therefore prone to subjectivity. This fact may lead to a high risk of mis- and over-diagnosis, a problem that can be addressed through the use of objective markers. Methods: Here we propose to use phase-amplitude coupling as a digital biomarker in ADHD. We investigated the hypothesis that coupling between the phase of slow brain rhythms and the amplitude of fast rhythms is altered in the ADHD population. We tested this hypothesis measuring phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) in the 4 to 200Hz range in electroencephalographic (EEG) signals recorded in the central-frontal area in children during eyes closed resting state. Results: Using automatic clustering, we observed statistically significant beta-gamma PAC deficits in the ADHD population in the frontal-left hemisphere. Conclusions: These findings suggests alterations in the beta-gamma coupling in the ADHD population. We discuss the hypothesis that these alterations may be indicators of working memory and attention deficits. Significance: The study of the coupling between the different brain rhythms can potentially contribute to the understanding and clinical diagnosis of ADHD.

Participant movement can deleteriously affect MR image quality. Further, for the visualization and segmentation of small anatomical structures, there is a need to improve image quality, specifically signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), by acquiring multiple anatomical scans consecutively. We aimed to ameliorate movement artefacts and increase SNR in a high-resolution turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequence acquired thrice using non-linear deformations in order to improve segmentation consistency of the hippocampus subfields. We assessed the method in young healthy participants, Motor Neurone Disease patients, and age matched healthy controls. Results show improved image segmentation of the hippocampus subfields when comparing template-based segmentations with individual segmentations N=51; ps &lt; 0.001 (Friedman's test) and higher sharpness ps &lt; 0.001 in non-linearly realigned scans as compared to linearly, and arithmetically averaged scans.

Abstract
<p>The transcription factor FosB has been proposed as a molecular switch for the transition from casual, volitional drug use into a chronically addicted state, but the upstream regulatory mechanisms governing FosB expression are incompletely understood. In this study, we find a novel regulatory role for the transcription factor E2F3, recently implicated in transcriptional regulation by cocaine, in controlling FosB induction in the mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc) following cocaine administration. We find that an E2F consensus sequence 500 bp upstream of the <i>Fosb</i> transcription start site is enriched for E2F3 specifically over other E2F isoforms. We further conclude that FosB expression is regulated specifically by E2F3a, not E2F3b, that <i>E2f3a</i> expression is specific to D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons, and that E2F3a overexpression in NAc recapitulates the induction of <i>Fosb</i> and <i>Fosb</i> mRNA expression observed after chronic cocaine exposure. E2F3a knockdown in NAc does not abolish <i>Fosb</i> induction by cocaine, a result consistent with previously published data showing that singular knockdown of upstream regulators of FosB is insufficient to block cocaine-induced expression. Finally, to elucidate potential combinatorial epigenetic mechanisms involved in E2F3a’s regulation of <i>Fosb</i>, we explore H3K4me3 enrichment at the <i>Fosb</i> promoter and find that it is not enhanced by E2F3a overexpression, suggesting that it may instead be a pre-existing permissive mark allowing for E2F3a to interact with <i>Fosb</i>. Together, these findings support a role for E2F3a as a novel, upstream regulator of the addiction-mediating transcription factor FosB in NAc.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease (CMT) is most commonly caused by duplication of a chromosomal segment surrounding <i>Peripheral Myelin Protein 22</i>, or <i>PMP22</i> gene, which is classified as CMT1A. Several candidate therapies reduce <i>Pmp22</i> mRNA levels in CMT1A rodent models, but development of biomarkers for clinical trials in CMT1A is a challenge given its slow progression and the difficulty in obtaining nerve samples. Quantitative PCR measurements of <i>PMP22</i> mRNA in dermal nerves were performed using skin biopsies in human clinical trials for CMT1A, but this approach did not show increased <i>PMP22</i> mRNA in CMT1A patients compared to controls. One complicating factor is the variable amounts of Schwann cells (SC) in skin. The objective of the study was to develop a novel method for precise evaluation of <i>PMP22</i> levels in skin biopsies that can discriminate CMT1A patients from controls.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We have developed methods to normalize <i>PMP22</i> transcript levels to SC‐specific genes that are not altered by CMT1A status. Several CMT1A‐associated genes were assembled into a custom Nanostring panel to enable precise transcript measurements that can be normalized to variable Schwann cell content.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The digital expression data from Nanostring analysis showed reproducible elevation of PMP22 levels in CMT1A vs. control skin biopsies, particularly after normalization to SC‐specific genes.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This platform should be useful in clinical trials for CMT1A as a biomarker of target engagement that can be used to optimize dosing, and the same normalization framework is applicable to other types of CMT.</p>

<p>Motion perception is a critical capability determining a variety of aspects
of insects' life, including avoiding predators, foraging and so forth. A good
number of motion detectors have been identified in the insects' visual
pathways. Computational modelling of these motion detectors has not only been
providing effective solutions to artificial intelligence, but also benefiting
the understanding of complicated biological visual systems. These biological
mechanisms through millions of years of evolutionary development will have
formed solid modules for constructing dynamic vision systems for future
intelligent machines. This article reviews the computational motion perception
models originating from biological research of insects' visual systems in the
literature. These motion perception models or neural networks comprise the
looming sensitive neuronal models of lobula giant movement detectors (LGMDs) in
locusts, the translation sensitive neural systems of direction selective
neurons (DSNs) in fruit flies, bees and locusts, as well as the small target
motion detectors (STMDs) in dragonflies and hover flies. We also review the
applications of these models to robots and vehicles. Through these modelling
studies, we summarise the methodologies that generate different direction and
size selectivity in motion perception. At last, we discuss about multiple
systems integration and hardware realisation of these bio-inspired motion
perception models.

<p>We first pose the Unsupervised Continual Learning (UCL) problem: learning
salient representations from a non-stationary stream of unlabeled data in which
the number of object classes varies with time. Given limited labeled data just
before inference, those representations can also be associated with specific
object types to perform classification. To solve the UCL problem, we propose an
architecture that involves a single module, called Self-Taught Associative
Memory (STAM), which loosely models the function of a cortical column in the
mammalian brain. Hierarchies of STAM modules learn based on a combination of
Hebbian learning, online clustering, detection of novel patterns, forgetting
outliers, and top-down predictions. We illustrate the operation of STAMs in the
context of learning handwritten digits in a continual manner with only 3-12
labeled examples per class. STAMs suggest a promising direction to solve the
UCL problem without catastrophic forgetting.

<p>Respiratory modulation of sympathetic nerve activity (respSNA) was studied in
a hypertensive rodent model of chronic kidney disease (CKD) using Lewis
Polycystic Kidney (LPK) rats and Lewis controls. In adult animals under in vivo
anaesthetised conditions (n=8-10/strain), respiratory modulation of splanchnic
and renal nerve activity was compared under control conditions, and during
peripheral (hypoxia), and central, chemoreceptor (hypercapnia) challenge.
RespSNA was increased in the LPK vs. Lewis (area under curve (AUC) splanchnic
and renal: 8.7$\pm$1.1 vs. 3.5$\pm$0.5 and 10.6$\pm$1.1 vs. 7.1$\pm$0.2
$\mu$V.s, respectively, P&lt;0.05). Hypoxia and hypercapnia increased respSNA in
both strains but the magnitude of the response was greater in LPK, particularly
in response to hypoxia. In juvenile animals studied using a working heart
brainstem preparation (n=7-10/strain), increased respSNA was evident in the LPK
(thoracic SNA, AUC: 0.86$\pm$0.1 vs. 0.42$\pm$0.1 $\mu$V.s, P&lt;0.05), and
activation of peripheral chemoreceptors (NaCN) again drove a larger increase in
respSNA in the LPK with no difference in the response to hypercapnia. Amplified
respSNA occurs in CKD and may contribute to the development of hypertension.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/46525">Bed nucleus of the stria terminalis regulates fear to unpredictable threat signals</a></h4>

The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) has been implicated in conditioned fear and anxiety, but the specific factors that engage the BNST in defensive behaviors are unclear. Here we examined whether the BNST mediates freezing to conditioned stimuli (CSs) that poorly predict the onset of aversive unconditioned stimuli (USs) in rats. Reversible inactivation of the BNST selectively reduced freezing to CSs that poorly signaled US onset (e.g., a backward CS that followed the US), but did not eliminate freezing to forward CSs even when they predicted USs of variable intensity. Additionally, backward (but not forward) CSs selectively increased Fos in the ventral BNST and in BNST-projecting neurons in the infralimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), but not in the hippocampus or amygdala. These data reveal that BNST circuits regulate fear to unpredictable threats, which may be critical to the etiology and expression of anxiety.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45345">The phage L capsid decoration protein has a novel OB-fold and an unusual capsid binding strategy</a></h4>

The major coat proteins of dsDNA tailed phages (order <i>Caudovirales</i>) and herpesviruses form capsids by a mechanism that includes active packaging of the dsDNA genome into a precursor procapsid, followed by expansion and stabilization of the capsid. These viruses have evolved diverse strategies to fortify their capsids, such as non-covalent binding of auxiliary ‘decoration’ (Dec) proteins. The Dec protein from the P22-like phage L has a highly unusual binding strategy that distinguishes between nearly identical three-fold and quasi-three-fold sites of the icosahedral capsid. Cryo-electron microscopy and three-dimensional image reconstruction were employed to determine the structure of native phage L particles. NMR was used to determine the structure/dynamics of Dec in solution. The NMR structure and the cryo-EM density envelope were combined to build a model of the capsid-bound Dec trimer. Key regions that modulate the binding interface were verified by site-directed mutagenesis.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44519">HIF-1α regulates IL-1β and IL-17 in sarcoidosis</a></h4>

Sarcoidosis is a complex systemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology characterized by the presence of activated macrophages and Th1/Th17 effector cells. Data mining of our RNA-Seq analysis of CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes showed enrichment for metabolic and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathways in sarcoidosis. Further investigation revealed that sarcoidosis macrophages and monocytes exhibit higher protein levels for HIF-α isoforms, HIF-1β, and their transcriptional co-activator p300 as well as glucose transporter 1 (Glut1). In situ hybridization of sarcoidosis granulomatous lung tissues showed abundance of HIF-1α in the center of granulomas. The abundance of HIF isoforms was mechanistically linked to elevated IL-1β and IL-17 since targeted down regulation of HIF-1α via short interfering RNA or a HIF-1α inhibitor decreased their production. Pharmacological intervention using chloroquine, a lysosomal inhibitor, decreased lysosomal associated protein 2 (LAMP2) and HIF-1α levels and modified cytokine production. These data suggest that increased activity of HIF-α isoforms regulate Th1/Th17 mediated inflammation in sarcoidosis.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43999">Genetic dissection of the different roles of hypothalamic kisspeptin neurons in regulating female reproduction</a></h4>

The brain regulates fertility through gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. Estradiol induces negative feedback on pulsatile GnRH/luteinizing hormone (LH) release and positive feedback generating preovulatory GnRH/LH surges. Negative and positive feedback are postulated to be mediated by kisspeptin neurons in arcuate and anteroventral periventricular (AVPV) nuclei, respectively. Kisspeptin-specific ERα knockout mice exhibit disrupted LH pulses and surges. This knockout approach is neither location-specific nor temporally-controlled. We utilized CRISPR-Cas9 to disrupt ERα in adulthood. Mice with ERα disruption in AVPV kisspeptin neurons have typical reproductive cycles but blunted LH surges, associated with decreased excitability of these neurons. Mice with ERα knocked down in arcuate kisspeptin neurons showed disrupted cyclicity, associated with increased glutamatergic transmission to these neurons. These observations suggest activational effects of estradiol regulate surge generation and maintain cyclicity through AVPV and arcuate kisspeptin neurons, respectively, independent from its role in the development of hypothalamic kisspeptin neurons or puberty onset.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43944">A regulatory module controlling stress-induced cell cycle arrest in <i>Arabidopsis</i></a></h4>

Cell cycle arrest is an active response to stresses that enables organisms to survive under fluctuating environmental conditions. While signalling pathways that inhibit cell cycle progression have been elucidated, the putative core module orchestrating cell cycle arrest in response to various stresses is still elusive. Here we report that in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, the NAC-type transcription factors ANAC044 and ANAC085 are required for DNA damage-induced G2 arrest. Under genotoxic stress conditions, ANAC044 and ANAC085 enhance protein accumulation of the R1R2R3-type Myb transcription factor (Rep-MYB), which represses G2/M-specific genes. ANAC044/ANAC085-dependent accumulation of Rep-MYB and cell cycle arrest are also observed in the response to heat stress that causes G2 arrest, but not to osmotic stress that retards G1 progression. These results suggest that plants deploy the ANAC044/ANAC085-mediated signalling module as a hub which perceives distinct stress signals and leads to G2 arrest.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43281">Associations between sounds and actions in early auditory cortex of nonhuman primates</a></h4>

An individual may need to take different actions to the same stimulus in different situations to achieve a given goal. The selection of the appropriate action hinges on the previously learned associations between stimuli, actions, and outcomes in the situations. Here, using a go/no-go paradigm and a symmetrical reward, we show that early auditory cortex of nonhuman primates represents such associations, in both the spiking activity and the local field potentials. Sound-evoked neuronal responses changed with sensorimotor associations shortly after sound onset, and the neuronal responses were largest when the sound signaled that a no-go response was required in a trial to obtain a reward. Our findings suggest that the association process takes place in the auditory system and does not necessarily rely on association cortex. Thus, auditory cortex may contribute to a rapid selection of the appropriate motor responses to sounds during goal-directed behavior.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42992">Reward prediction error does not explain movement selectivity in DMS-projecting dopamine neurons</a></h4>

Although midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons have been thought to primarily encode reward prediction error (RPE), recent studies have also found movement-related DAergic signals. For example, we recently reported that DA neurons in mice projecting to dorsomedial striatum are modulated by choices contralateral to the recording side. Here, we introduce, and ultimately reject, a candidate resolution for the puzzling RPE vs movement dichotomy, by showing how seemingly movement-related activity might be explained by an action-specific RPE. By considering both choice and RPE on a trial-by-trial basis, we find that DA signals are modulated by contralateral choice in a manner that is distinct from RPE, implying that choice encoding is better explained by movement direction. This fundamental separation between RPE and movement encoding may help shed light on the diversity of functions and dysfunctions of the DA system.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40316">Developmental NMDA receptor dysregulation in the infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis mouse model</a></h4>

Protein palmitoylation and depalmitoylation alter protein function. This post-translational modification is critical for synaptic transmission and plasticity. Mutation of the depalmitoylating enzyme palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) causes infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN1), a pediatric neurodegenerative disease. However, the role of protein depalmitoylation in synaptic maturation is unknown. Therefore, we studied synapse development in Ppt1-/- mouse visual cortex. We demonstrate that the developmental N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunit switch from GluN2B to GluN2A is stagnated in Ppt1-/- mice. Correspondingly, Ppt1-/- neurons exhibit immature evoked NMDAR currents and dendritic spine morphology in vivo. Further, dissociated Ppt1-/- cultured neurons show extrasynaptic, diffuse calcium influxes and enhanced vulnerability to NMDA-induced excitotoxicity, reflecting the predominance of GluN2B-containing receptors. Remarkably, Ppt1-/- neurons demonstrate hyperpalmitoylation of GluN2B as well as Fyn kinase, which regulates surface retention of GluN2B. Thus, PPT1 plays a critical role in postsynapse maturation by facilitating the GluN2 subunit switch and proteostasis of palmitoylated proteins.

Neurons in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) integrate negative emotions with the autonomic, neuroendocrine, and immune systems to facilitate responses to threat. Modern functional track tracing in animals and optogenetic and chemogenetic techniques show that the PAG is a rich substrate for the integration of active and passive responses to threat. In humans, the same regions of the PAG that give rise to adaptive anger/fight, fear/panic, depression/shutdown, pain, and predatory behaviors in response to challenging situations or overwhelming threats can become activated pathologically, resulting in symptoms that resemble those of psychiatric disorders.

Our understanding of the mechanisms of neural circuit assembly is far from complete. Identification of new wiring molecules with novel mechanisms of action will provide new insights into how complex and heterogeneous neural circuits assemble during development. Here, we performed an RNAi screen for cell-surface molecules and identified the leucine-rich-repeat containing transmembrane protein, Fish-lips (Fili), as a novel wiring molecule in the assembly of the Drosophila olfactory circuit. Fili contributes to the precise targeting of both olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) axons as well as projection neuron (PN) dendrites. Cell-type-specific expression and genetic analyses suggest that Fili sends a trans-synaptic repulsive signal to neurites of non-partner classes that prevent their targeting to inappropriate glomeruli in the antennal lobe.

Conditions governing somatostatin peptidergic release are not well-defined. Using a combination of optogenetic, transgenic, and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate an assay for the induction and inhibition of somatostatin in acute brain slices.

Inhibitory control deficits represent one of many core cognitive deficits in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Neuroimaging studies suggest that individuals with ADHD exhibit atypical engagement of neural systems during response inhibition, but the exact nature of this phenotype is obscured by mixed findings. We tested whether drug-free youths with ADHD (n=30, ages 7-14 years, 10 female) exhibited atypical neural correlates of response inhibition, as measured with a stop signal task and fMRI, compared to matched controls. We next investigated medication effects and whether there was a relationship between symptom severity and medication effects on the fMRI-evaluated signal. Finally, we tested for a significant difference between effects of monotherapy and combined pharmacological treatment. Patients showed significantly slower stop signal response time and lower percent inhibition, but no significant differences in the neural correlates of response inhibition relative to controls. However, patients showed significantly elevated signal in frontostriatal regions during responses. Prefrontal signal in patients was positively associated with reaction time variability in patients, and change (medicated minus drug free) in the prefrontal signal was significantly associated with symptom scores, such that patients with elevated symptoms had greater BOLD signal reduction following treatment. Medication significantly improved go response time median and variability as well as stop signal reaction time, but there were no significant effects of medication or treatment type on BOLD signal. These findings challenge the notion of frontostriatal hypoactivation during response inhibition as a biomarker for ADHD and suggest that symptom severity may be associated with response to medication.

High quality gene models are necessary to expand the molecular and genetic tools available for a target organism, but these are available for only a handful of model organisms that have undergone extensive curation and experimental validation over the course of many years. The majority of gene models present in biological databases today have been identified in draft genome assemblies using automated annotation pipelines that are frequently based on orthologs from distantly related model organisms and usually have minor or major errors. Manual curation is time consuming and often requires substantial expertise, but is instrumental in improving gene model structure and identification. Manual annotation may seem to be a daunting and cost-prohibitive task for small research communities but involving undergraduates in community genome annotation consortiums can be mutually beneficial for both education and improved genomic resources. We outline a workflow for efficient manual annotation driven by a team of primarily undergraduate annotators. This model can be scaled to large teams and includes quality control processes through incremental evaluation. Moreover, it gives students an opportunity to increase their understanding of genome biology and to participate in scientific research in collaboration with peers and senior researchers at multiple institutions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/swrtA_iOoWA" width="1" />

Familiar cancers represent a privileged point of view for studying the complex cellular events inducing tumor transformation. Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, a familiar predisposition to develop cancer is a clear example. Here, we present our efforts to decipher the role of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) in cancer insurgence. We collected high quality information about both pVHL mutations and interactors to investigate the association between patient phenotypes, mutated protein surface and impaired interactions. Our data suggest that different phenotypes correlate with localized perturbations of the pVHL structure, with specific cell functions associated to different protein surfaces. We propose five different pVHL interfaces to be selectively involved in modulating proteins regulating gene expression, protein homeostasis as well as to address extracellular matrix (ECM) and ciliogenesis associated functions. These data were used to drive molecular docking of pVHL with its interactors and guide Petri net simulations of the most promising alterations. We predict that disruption of pVHL association with certain interactors can trigger tumor transformation, inducing metabolism imbalance and ECM remodeling. Collectively taken, our findings provide novel insights into VHL-associated tumorigenesis. This highly integrated <i>in silico</i> approach may help elucidate novel treatment paradigms for VHL disease.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zhgLu-Gonbk" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>JIP3, encoded by <i>MAPK8IP3</i>, is an adaptor protein of the kinesin‐1 complex and essential for axonal transport in neurons. However, an association between <i>MAPK8IP3</i> variants and human disease has not been established. We identified five individuals from four families with recurrent <i>de novo</i> variants c.1732C&gt;T (p.Arg578Cys) and c.3436C&gt;T (p.Arg1146Cys) in <i>MAPK8IP3</i>. The core phenotype includes spastic diplegia, intellectual disability, cerebral atrophy, and corpus callosum hypoplasia. Zebrafish embryos overexpressing human mutant JIP3 showed axon varicosities of the posterior lateral line nerve, suggesting an adverse effect on the developing axons. Our results suggest that <i>MAPK8IP3</i> variants cause a neurodevelopmental disease.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/14/2762?rss=1">mTOR Hyperactivity Levels Influence the Severity of Epilepsy and Associated Neuropathology in an Experimental Model of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex and Focal Cortical Dysplasia</a></h4>

<p>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) are focal malformations of cortical development (FMCDs) that are highly associated with intractable epilepsy. TSC and FCD are mTORopathies caused by a spectrum of pathogenic variants in the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway genes leading to differential activation of mTOR signaling. However, whether the degree of mTOR hyperactivity influences disease severity remains unclear. Here, we examined the effects of differential mTOR hyperactivity levels on epilepsy and associated neuropathology in a mouse model of TSC and FCD. Constitutively active Rheb (Rheb<sup>CA</sup>), the canonical activator of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), was expressed in mouse embryos of either sex via <i>in utero</i> electroporation at low, intermediate, and high concentrations to induce different mTORC1 activity levels in developing cortical neurons. We found that Rheb<sup>CA</sup> expression induced mTORC1 hyperactivation and increased neuronal soma size and misplacement in a dose-dependent manner. No seizures were detected in the low Rheb<sup>CA</sup> mice, whereas the intermediate and high Rheb<sup>CA</sup> mice displayed spontaneous, recurrent seizures that significantly increased with higher Rheb<sup>CA</sup> concentrations. Seizures were associated with a global increase in microglial activation that was notably higher in the regions containing Rheb<sup>CA</sup>-expressing neurons. These data demonstrate that neuronal mTOR hyperactivity levels influence the severity of epilepsy and associated neuropathology in experimental TSC and FCD. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of evaluating the outcome of individual variants on mTOR activity levels and support personalized medicine strategies based on patient variants and mTOR activity level for TSC, FCD, and potentially other mTORopathies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) are epileptogenic cortical malformations caused by pathogenic variants in mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway genes leading to differential mTOR hyperactivation. Here, we present novel findings that neuronal mTOR hyperactivity levels correlate with the severity of epilepsy and associated neuropathology in a mouse model of TSC and FCD. Our findings suggest the need to evaluate the outcome of individual variants on mTOR activity levels in clinical assessments and support personalized medicine strategies based on patient variants and mTOR activity level. Additionally, we present useful modifications to a previously described mouse model of TSC and FCD that allows for titration of seizure frequency and generation of a mild to severe epilepsy phenotype as applicable for preclinical drug testing and mechanistic studies.</p>

<p>The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is part of the limbic-hypothalamic system important for behavioral responses to stress, and glutamate transmission within this region has been implicated in the neurobiology of alcoholism. Herein, we used a combination of immunoblotting, neuropharmacological and transgenic procedures to investigate the role for metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) signaling within the BNST in excessive drinking. We discovered that mGlu5 signaling in the BNST is linked to excessive alcohol consumption in a manner distinct from behavioral or neuropharmacological endophenotypes that have been previously implicated as triggers for heavy drinking. Our studies demonstrate that, in male mice, a history of chronic binge alcohol-drinking elevates BNST levels of the mGlu5-scaffolding protein Homer2 and activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in an adaptive response to limit alcohol consumption. Male and female transgenic mice expressing a point mutation of mGlu5 that cannot be phosphorylated by ERK exhibit excessive alcohol-drinking, despite greater behavioral signs of alcohol intoxication and reduced anxiety, and are insensitive to local manipulations of signaling in the BNST. These transgenic mice also show selective insensitivity to alcohol-aversion and increased novelty-seeking, which may be relevant to excessive drinking. Further, the insensitivity to alcohol-aversion exhibited by male mice can be mimicked by the local inhibition of ERK signaling within the BNST. Our findings elucidate a novel mGluR5-linked signaling state within BNST that plays a central and unanticipated role in excessive alcohol consumption.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is part of the limbic-hypothalamic system important for behavioral responses to stress and alcohol, and glutamate transmission within BNST is implicated in the neurobiology of alcoholism. The present study provides evidence that a history of excessive alcohol drinking increases signaling through the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) receptor within the BNST in an adaptive response to limit alcohol consumption. In particular, disruption of mGlu5 phosphorylation by extracellular signal-regulated kinase within this brain region induces excessive alcohol-drinking, which reflects a selective insensitivity to the aversive properties of alcohol intoxication. These data indicate that a specific signaling state of mGlu5 within BNST plays a central and unanticipated role in excessive alcohol consumption.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/14/2735?rss=1">Dopaminergic Mechanisms Underlying Normal Variation in Trait Anxiety</a></h4>

<p>Trait anxiety has been associated with altered activity within corticolimbic pathways connecting the amygdala and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), which receive rich dopaminergic input. Though the popular culture uses the term "chemical imbalance" to describe the pathophysiology of psychiatric conditions such as anxiety disorders, we know little about how individual differences in human dopamine neurochemistry are related to variation in anxiety and activity within corticolimbic circuits. We addressed this issue by examining interindividual variability in dopamine release at rest using [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride positron emission tomography (PET), functional connectivity between amygdala and rACC using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and trait anxiety measures in healthy adult male and female humans. To measure endogenous dopamine release, we collected two [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride PET scans per participant. We contrasted baseline [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride D2/3 receptor binding and D2/3 receptor binding following oral methylphenidate administration. Methylphenidate blocks the dopamine transporter, which increases extracellular dopamine and leads to reduced [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride D2/3 receptor binding via competitive displacement. We found that individuals with higher dopamine release in the amygdala and rACC self-reported lower trait anxiety. Lower trait anxiety was also associated with reduced rACC–amygdala functional connectivity at baseline. Further, functional connectivity showed a modest negative relationship with dopamine release such that reduced rACC–amygdala functional connectivity was accompanied by higher levels of dopamine release in these regions. Together, these findings contribute to hypodopaminergic models of anxiety and support the utility of combining fMRI and PET measures of neurochemical function to advance our understanding of basic affective processes in humans.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is common wisdom that individuals vary in their baseline levels of anxiety. We all have a friend or colleague we know to be more "tightly wound" than others, or, perhaps, we are the ones marveling at others' ability to "just go with the flow." Although such observations about individual differences within nonclinical populations are commonplace, the neural mechanisms underlying normal variation in trait anxiety have not been established. Using multimodal brain imaging in humans, this study takes initial steps in linking intrinsic measures of neuromodulator release and functional connectivity within regions implicated in anxiety disorders. Our findings suggest that in healthy adults, higher levels of trait anxiety may arise, at least in part, from reduced dopamine neurotransmission.</p>

<p>Noradrenergic (NE) α1-adrenoceptors (α1-ARs) contribute to arousal mechanisms and play an important role in therapeutic medications such as those for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, little is known about how α1-AR stimulation influences neuronal firing in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), a newly evolved region that is dysfunctional in PTSD and other mental illnesses. The current study examined the effects of α1-AR manipulation on neuronal firing in dlPFC of rhesus monkeys performing a visuospatial working memory task, focusing on the "delay cells" that maintain spatially tuned information across the delay period. Iontophoresis of the α1-AR antagonist HEAT (2-{[β-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]aminomethyl}-1-tetralone) had mixed effects, reducing firing in a majority of neurons but having nonsignificant excitatory effects or no effect in remaining delay cells. These data suggest that endogenous NE has excitatory effects in some delay cells under basal conditions. In contrast, the α1-AR agonists phenylephrine and cirazoline suppressed delay cell firing and this was blocked by coadministration of HEAT. These results indicate an inverted-U dose response for α1-AR actions, with mixed excitatory actions under basal conditions and suppressed firing with high levels of α1-AR stimulation such as with stress exposure. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed α1-AR expression presynaptically in axons and axon terminals and postsynaptically in spines, dendrites, and astrocytes. It is possible that α1-AR excitatory effects arise from presynaptic excitation of glutamate release, whereas postsynaptic actions suppress firing through calcium–protein kinase C opening of potassium channels on spines. The latter may predominate under stressful conditions, leading to loss of dlPFC regulation during uncontrollable stress.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Noradrenergic stimulation of α1-adrenoceptors (α1-ARs) is implicated in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental disorders that involve dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex, a brain region that provides top-down control. However, the location and contribution of α1-ARs to prefrontal cortical physiology in primates has received little attention. This study found that α1-ARs are located near prefrontal synapses and that α1-AR stimulation has mixed effects under basal conditions. However, high levels of α1-AR stimulation, as occur with stress, suppress neuronal firing. These findings help to explain why we lose top-down control under conditions of uncontrollable stress when there are high levels of noradrenergic release in brain and why blocking α1-AR, such as with prazosin, may be helpful in the treatment of PTSD.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/14/2709?rss=1">Eye Position Error Influence over "Open-Loop" Smooth Pursuit Initiation</a></h4>

<p>The oculomotor system integrates a variety of visual signals into appropriate motor plans, but such integration can have widely varying time scales. For example, smooth pursuit eye movements to follow a moving target are slower and longer lasting than saccadic eye movements and it has been suggested that initiating a smooth pursuit eye movement involves an obligatory "open-loop" interval in which new visual motion signals presumably cannot influence the ensuing motor plan for up to 100 ms after movement initiation. However, this view is contrary to the idea that the oculomotor periphery has privileged access to short-latency visual signals. Here, we show that smooth pursuit initiation is sensitive to visual inputs, even in open-loop intervals. We instructed male rhesus macaque monkeys to initiate saccade-free smooth pursuit eye movements and injected a transient, instantaneous eye position error signal at different times relative to movement initiation. We found robust short-latency modulations in eye velocity and acceleration, starting only ~50 ms after transient signal occurrence and even during open-loop pursuit initiation. Critically, the spatial direction of the injected position error signal had predictable effects on smooth pursuit initiation, with forward errors increasing eye acceleration and backward errors reducing it. Catch-up saccade frequencies and amplitudes were also similarly altered ~50 ms after transient signals, much like the well known effects on microsaccades during fixation. Our results demonstrate that smooth pursuit initiation is highly sensitive to visual signals and that catch-up saccade generation is reset after a visual transient.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Smooth pursuit eye movements allow us to track moving objects. The first ~100 ms of smooth pursuit initiation are characterized by smooth eye acceleration and are overwhelmingly described as being "open-loop"; that is, unmodifiable by new visual motion signals. We found that all phases of smooth pursuit, including the so-called open-loop intervals, are reliably modifiable by visual signals. We injected transient flashes resulting in very brief, spatially specific position error signals to smooth pursuit and observed very short-latency changes in smooth eye movements to minimize such errors. Our results highlight the flexibility of the oculomotor system in reacting to environmental events and suggest a functional role for the pervasiveness of visual sensitivity in oculomotor control brain regions.</p>

<p>The sensorimotor cortex is somatotopically organized to represent the vocal tract articulators such as lips, tongue, larynx, and jaw. How speech and articulatory features are encoded at the subcortical level, however, remains largely unknown. We analyzed LFP recordings from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and simultaneous electrocorticography recordings from the sensorimotor cortex of 11 human subjects (1 female) with Parkinson's disease during implantation of deep-brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes while they read aloud three-phoneme words. The initial phonemes involved either articulation primarily with the tongue (coronal consonants) or the lips (labial consonants). We observed significant increases in high-gamma (60–150 Hz) power in both the STN and the sensorimotor cortex that began before speech onset and persisted for the duration of speech articulation. As expected from previous reports, in the sensorimotor cortex, the primary articulators involved in the production of the initial consonants were topographically represented by high-gamma activity. We found that STN high-gamma activity also demonstrated specificity for the primary articulator, although no clear topography was observed. In general, subthalamic high-gamma activity varied along the ventral–dorsal trajectory of the electrodes, with greater high-gamma power recorded in the dorsal locations of the STN. Interestingly, the majority of significant articulator-discriminative activity in the STN occurred before that in sensorimotor cortex. These results demonstrate that articulator-specific speech information is contained within high-gamma activity of the STN, but with different spatial and temporal organization compared with similar information encoded in the sensorimotor cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Clinical and electrophysiological evidence suggest that the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is involved in speech; however, this important basal ganglia node is ignored in current models of speech production. We previously showed that STN neurons differentially encode early and late aspects of speech production, but no previous studies have examined subthalamic functional organization for speech articulators. Using simultaneous LFP recordings from the sensorimotor cortex and the STN in patients with Parkinson's disease undergoing deep-brain stimulation surgery, we discovered that STN high-gamma activity tracks speech production at the level of vocal tract articulators before the onset of vocalization and often before related cortical encoding.</p>

<p>Although the EEG slow wave of sleep is typically considered to be a hallmark of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, recent work in mice has shown that slow waves can also occur in REM sleep. Here, we investigated the presence and cortical distribution of negative delta (1–4 Hz) waves in human REM sleep by analyzing high-density EEG sleep recordings obtained in 28 healthy subjects. We identified two clusters of delta waves with distinctive properties: (1) a frontal-central cluster characterized by ~2.5–3.0 Hz, relatively large, notched delta waves (so-called "sawtooth waves") that tended to occur in bursts, were associated with increased gamma activity and rapid eye movements (EMs), and upon source modeling displayed an occipital-temporal and a frontal-central component and (2) a medial-occipital cluster characterized by more isolated, slower (&lt;2 Hz), and smaller waves that were not associated with rapid EMs, displayed a negative correlation with gamma activity, and were also found in NREM sleep. Therefore, delta waves are an integral part of REM sleep in humans and the two identified subtypes (sawtooth and medial-occipital slow waves) may reflect distinct generation mechanisms and functional roles. Sawtooth waves, which are exclusive to REM sleep, share many characteristics with ponto-geniculo-occipital waves described in animals and may represent the human equivalent or a closely related event, whereas medial-occipital slow waves appear similar to NREM sleep slow waves.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The EEG slow wave is typically considered a hallmark of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, but recent work in mice has shown that it can also occur in REM sleep. By analyzing high-density EEG recordings collected in healthy adult individuals, we show that REM sleep is characterized by prominent delta waves also in humans. In particular, we identified two distinctive clusters of delta waves with different properties: a frontal-central cluster characterized by faster, activating "sawtooth waves" that share many characteristics with ponto-geniculo-occipital waves described in animals and a medial-occipital cluster containing slow waves that are more similar to NREM sleep slow waves. These findings indicate that REM sleep is a spatially and temporally heterogeneous state and may contribute to explaining its known functional and phenomenological properties.</p>

<p>Studying the mismatch between perception and reality helps us better understand the constructive nature of the visual brain. The Pinna–Brelstaff motion illusion is a compelling example illustrating how a complex moving pattern can generate an illusory motion perception. When an observer moves toward (expansion) or away (contraction) from the Pinna–Brelstaff figure, the figure appears to rotate. The neural mechanisms underlying the illusory complex-flow motion of rotation, expansion, and contraction remain unknown. We studied this question at both perceptual and neuronal levels in behaving male macaques by using carefully parametrized Pinna–Brelstaff figures that induce the above motion illusions. We first demonstrate that macaques perceive illusory motion in a manner similar to that of human observers. Neurophysiological recordings were subsequently performed in the middle temporal area (MT) and the dorsal portion of the medial superior temporal area (MSTd). We find that subgroups of MSTd neurons encoding a particular global pattern of real complex-flow motion (rotation, expansion, contraction) also represent illusory motion patterns of the same class. They require an extra 15 ms to reliably discriminate the illusion. In contrast, MT neurons encode both real and illusory local motions with similar temporal delays. These findings reveal that illusory complex-flow motion is first represented in MSTd by the same neurons that normally encode real complex-flow motion. However, the extraction of global illusory motion in MSTd from other classes of real complex-flow motion requires extra processing time. Our study illustrates a cascaded integration mechanism from MT to MSTd underlying the transformation from external physical to internal nonveridical flow-motion perception.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The neural basis of the transformation from objective reality to illusory percepts of rotation, expansion, and contraction remains unknown. We demonstrate psychophysically that macaques perceive these illusory complex-flow motions in a manner similar to that of human observers. At the neural level, we show that medial superior temporal (MSTd) neurons represent illusory flow motions as if they were real by globally integrating middle temporal area (MT) local motion signals. Furthermore, while MT neurons reliably encode real and illusory local motions with similar temporal delays, MSTd neurons take a significantly longer time to process the signals associated with illusory percepts. Our work extends previous complex-flow motion studies by providing the first detailed analysis of the neuron-specific mechanisms underlying complex forms of illusory motion integration from MT to MSTd.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/14/2649?rss=1">Chronic Suppression of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor (GLP1R) mRNA Translation in the Rat Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis Reduces Anxiety-Like Behavior and Stress-Induced Hypophagia, But Prolongs Stress-Induced Elevation of Plasma Corticosterone</a></h4>

<p>The anterior lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (alBST) expresses glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors (GLP1Rs) and receives input from caudal brainstem GLP1 neurons. GLP1 administered centrally reduces food intake and increases anxiety-like behavior and plasma corticosterone (cort) levels in rats, whereas central GLP1R antagonism has opposite effects. Anxiogenic threats and other stressors robustly activate c<i>-fos</i> expression in both GLP1-producing neurons and also in neurons within alBST subregions expressing GLP1R. To examine the functional role of GLP1R signaling within the alBST, adult male Sprague Dawley rats received bilateral alBST-targeted injections of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to knock down the translation of GLP1R mRNA (GLP1R-KD rats), or similar injections of a control AAV (CTRL rats). <i>In situ</i> hybridization revealed that GLP1R mRNA is expressed in a subset of GABAergic alBST neurons, and quantitative real-time PCR confirmed that GLP1R-KD rats displayed a significant 60% reduction in translatable GLP1R mRNA. Compared with CTRL rats, GLP1R-KD rats gained more body weight over time and displayed less anxiety-like behavior, including a loss of light-enhanced acoustic startle and less stress-induced hypophagia. Conversely, while baseline plasma cort levels were similar in GLP1R-KD and CTRL rats, GLP1R-KD rats displayed a prolonged stress-induced elevation of plasma cort levels. GLP1R-KD and CTRL rats displayed similar home cage food intake and a similar hypophagic response to systemic Exendin-4, a GLP1R agonist that crosses the blood–brain barrier. We conclude that GLP1R expressed within the alBST contributes to multiple behavioral responses to anxiogenic threats, yet also serves to limit the plasma cort response to acute stress.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Anxiety is an affective and physiological state that supports threat avoidance. Identifying the neural bases of anxiety-like behaviors in animal models is essential for understanding mechanisms that contribute to normative and pathological anxiety in humans. In rats, anxiety/avoidance behaviors can be elicited or enhanced by visceral or cognitive threats that increase glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) signaling from the caudal brainstem to the hypothalamus and limbic forebrain. Data reported here support a role for limbic GLP1 receptor signaling to enhance anxiety-like behavior and to attenuate stress-induced elevations in plasma cort levels in rats. Improved understanding of central GLP1 neural pathways that impact emotional responses to stress could expand potential therapeutic options for anxiety and other stress-related disorders in humans.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/14/2635?rss=1">Vesicular GABA Transporter Is Necessary for Transplant-Induced Critical Period Plasticity in Mouse Visual Cortex</a></h4>

<p>The maturation of GABAergic inhibitory circuits is necessary for the onset of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) in the postnatal visual cortex (Hensch, 2005; Espinosa and Stryker, 2012). When it is deficient, the critical period does not start. When inhibitory maturation or signaling is precocious, it induces a precocious critical period. Heterochronic transplantation of GABAergic interneuron precursors derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) can induce a second period of functional plasticity in the visual cortex (Southwell et al., 2010). Although the timing of MGE transplantation-induced plasticity is dictated by the maturation of the transplanted cells, its mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we sought to test the effect of blocking vesicular GABA loading and subsequent release by transplanted interneurons on the ability to migrate, integrate, and induce plasticity in the host circuitry. We show that MGE cells taken from male and female donors that lack vesicular GABA transporter (<i>Vgat</i>) expression disperse and differentiate into somatostatin- and parvalbumin-expressing interneurons upon heterochronic transplantation in the postnatal mouse cortex. Although transplanted <i>Vgat</i> mutant interneurons come to express mature interneuron markers and display electrophysiological properties similar to those of control cells, their morphology is significantly more complex. Significantly, <i>Vgat</i> mutant MGE transplants fail to induce ODP, demonstrating the pivotal role of vesicular GABAergic transmission for MGE transplantation-induced plasticity in the postnatal mouse visual cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Embryonic inhibitory neurons thrive when transplanted into postnatal brains, migrating and differentiating in the host as they would have done if left in the donor. Once integrated into the host, these new neurons can have profound effects. For example, in the visual cortex, such neurons induce a second critical period of activity-dependent plasticity when they reach the appropriate stage of development. The cellular mechanism by which these transplanted GABAergic interneurons induce plasticity is unknown. Here, we show that transplanted interneurons that are unable to fill synaptic vesicles with GABA migrate and integrate into the host circuit, but they do not induce a second period of plasticity. These data suggest a role for the vesicular GABA transporter in transplantation-mediated plasticity.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/14/2620?rss=1">Heterogeneity of Activity-Induced Sodium Transients between Astrocytes of the Mouse Hippocampus and Neocortex: Mechanisms and Consequences</a></h4>

<p>Activity-related sodium transients induced by glutamate uptake represent a special form of astrocyte excitability. Astrocytes of the neocortex, as opposed to the hippocampus proper, also express ionotropic glutamate receptors, which might provide additional sodium influx. We compared glutamate-related sodium transients in astrocytes and neurons in slices of the neocortex and hippocampus of juvenile mice of both sexes, using widefield and multiphoton imaging. Stimulation of glutamatergic afferents or glutamate application induced sodium transients that were twice as large in neocortical as in hippocampal astrocytes, despite similar neuronal responses. Astrocyte sodium transients were reduced by ~50% upon blocking NMDA receptors in the neocortex, but not hippocampus. Neocortical, but not hippocampal, astrocytes exhibited marked sodium increases in response to NMDA. These key differences in sodium signaling were also observed in neonates and in adults. NMDA application evoked local calcium transients in processes of neocortical astrocytes, which were dampened upon blocking sodium/calcium exchange (NCX) with KB-R7943 or SEA0400. Mathematical computation based on our data predict that NMDA-induced sodium increases drive the NCX into reverse mode, resulting in calcium influx. Together, our study reveals a considerable regional heterogeneity in astrocyte sodium transients, which persists throughout postnatal development. Neocortical astrocytes respond with much larger sodium elevations to glutamatergic activity than hippocampal astrocytes. Moreover, neocortical astrocytes experience NMDA-receptor-mediated sodium influx, which hippocampal astrocytes lack, and which drives calcium import through reverse NCX. This pathway thereby links sodium to calcium signaling and represents a new mechanism for the generation of local calcium influx in neocortical astrocytes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Astrocyte calcium signals play a central role in neuron–glia interaction. Moreover, activity-related sodium transients may represent a new form of astrocyte excitability. Here we show that activation of NMDA receptors results in prominent sodium transients in neocortical, but not hippocampal, astrocytes in the mouse brain. NMDA receptor activation is accompanied by local calcium signaling in processes of neocortical astrocytes, which is augmented by sodium-driven reversal of the sodium/calcium exchanger. Our data demonstrate a significant regional heterogeneity in the magnitude and mechanisms of astrocyte sodium transients. They also suggest a close interrelation between NMDA-receptor-mediated sodium influx and calcium signaling through the reversal of sodium/calcium exchanger, thereby establishing a new pathway for the generation of local calcium signaling in astrocyte processes.</p>

<p>Active zones at chemical synapses are highly specialized sites for the regulated release of neurotransmitters. Despite a high degree of active zone protein conservation in vertebrates, every type of chemical synapse expresses a given set of protein isoforms and splice variants adapted to the demands on neurotransmitter release. So far, we know little about how specific active zone proteins contribute to the structural and functional diversity of active zones. In this study, we explored the nanodomain organization of ribbon-type active zones by addressing the significance of Piccolino, the ribbon synapse-specific splice variant of Piccolo, for shaping the ribbon structure. We followed up on previous results, which indicated that rod photoreceptor synaptic ribbons lose their structural integrity in a knockdown of Piccolino. Here, we demonstrate an interaction between Piccolino and the major ribbon component RIBEYE that supports plate-shaped synaptic ribbons in retinal neurons. In a detailed ultrastructural analysis of three different types of retinal ribbon synapses in Piccolo/Piccolino-deficient male and female rats, we show that the absence of Piccolino destabilizes the superstructure of plate-shaped synaptic ribbons, although with variable manifestation in the cell types examined. Our analysis illustrates how the expression of a specific active zone protein splice variant (e.g., Piccolino) contributes to structural diversity of vertebrate active zones.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Retinal ribbon synapses are a specialized type of chemical synapse adapted for the regulated fast and tonic release of neurotransmitter. The hallmark of retinal ribbon synapses is the plate-shaped synaptic ribbon, which extends from the release site into the terminals' cytoplasm and tethers hundreds of synaptic vesicles. Here, we show that Piccolino, the synaptic ribbon specific splice variant of Piccolo, interacts with RIBEYE, the main component of synaptic ribbons. This interaction occurs via several PxDLS-like motifs located at the C terminus of Piccolino, which can connect multiple RIBEYE molecules. Loss of Piccolino disrupts the characteristic plate-shaped structure of synaptic ribbons, indicating a role of Piccolino in synaptic ribbon assembly.</p>

<p>Presynaptic α<sub>2</sub> subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels regulate channel abundance and are involved in glutamatergic synapse formation. However, little is known about the specific functions of the individual α<sub>2</sub> isoforms and their role in GABAergic synapses. Using primary neuronal cultures of embryonic mice of both sexes, we here report that presynaptic overexpression of α<sub>2</sub>-2 in GABAergic synapses strongly increases clustering of postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. Strikingly, presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>-2 exerts the same effect in glutamatergic synapses, leading to a mismatched localization of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. This mismatching is caused by an aberrant wiring of glutamatergic presynaptic boutons with GABAergic postsynaptic positions. The trans-synaptic effect of α<sub>2</sub>-2 is independent of the prototypical cell-adhesion molecules α-neurexins (α-Nrxns); however, α-Nrxns together with α<sub>2</sub>-2 can modulate postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R abundance. Finally, exclusion of the alternatively spliced exon 23 of α<sub>2</sub>-2 is essential for the trans-synaptic mechanism. The novel function of α<sub>2</sub>-2 identified here may explain how abnormal α<sub>2</sub> subunit expression can cause excitatory–inhibitory imbalance often associated with neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Voltage-gated calcium channels regulate important neuronal functions such as synaptic transmission. α<sub>2</sub> subunits modulate calcium channels and are emerging as regulators of brain connectivity. However, little is known about how individual α<sub>2</sub> subunits contribute to synapse specificity. Here, we show that presynaptic expression of a single α<sub>2</sub> variant can modulate synaptic connectivity and the localization of inhibitory postsynaptic receptors. Our findings provide basic insights into the development of specific synaptic connections between nerve cells and contribute to our understanding of normal nerve cell functions. Furthermore, the identified mechanism may explain how an altered expression of calcium channel subunits can result in aberrant neuronal wiring often associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism or schizophrenia.</p>

Abstract
<p>Rodents use rhythmic whisker movements at frequencies between 4 and 12 Hz to sense the environment that will be disturbed when the animal touches an object. The aim of this work is to study the response adaptation to rhythmic whisker stimulation trains at 4 Hz in the barrel cortex and the sensitivity of cortical neurons to changes in the timing of the stimulation pattern. Longitudinal arrays of four iridium oxide electrodes were used to obtain single-unit recordings in supragranular, granular, and infragranular neurons in urethane anesthetized mice. The stimulation protocol consisted in a stimulation train of three air puffs (20 ms duration each) in which the time interval between the first and the third stimuli was fixed (500 ms) and the time interval between the first and the second stimuli changed (regular: 250 ms; "accelerando": 375 ms; or "decelerando" stimulation train: 125 ms interval). Cortical neurons adapted strongly their response to regular stimulation trains. Response adaptation was reduced when accelerando or decelerando stimulation trains were applied. This facilitation of the shifted stimulus was mediated by activation of NMDA receptors because the effect was blocked by AP5. The facilitation was not observed in thalamic nuclei. Facilitation increased during periods of EEG activation induced by systemic application of IGF-I, probably by activation of NMDA receptors, as well. We suggest that response adaptation is the outcome of an intrinsic cortical information processing aimed at contributing to improve the detection of "unexpected" stimuli that disturbed the rhythmic behavior of exploration.</p>

Abstract
<p>Hypothalamic POMC deficiency leads to obesity and metabolic deficiencies, largely due to the loss of melanocortin peptides. However, POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) are comprised of glutamatergic and GABAergic subpopulations. The developmental program, relative proportion and function of these two subpopulations are unresolved. To test whether glutamatergic POMC neurons serve a distinct role in maintaining energy homeostasis, we activated <i>Pomc</i> expression Cre- dependently in <i>Vglut2</i>-expressing neurons of mice with conditionally silenced <i>Pomc</i> alleles. The <i>Vglut2</i>-<i>Pomc</i> restored mice had normal ARC <i>Pomc</i> mRNA levels, POMC immunoreactivity, as well as body weight and body composition at age 12 weeks. Unexpectedly, the cumulative total of <i>Vglut2<sup>+</sup></i> glutamatergic- and <i>Gad67<sup>+</sup> GABAergic</i>-<i>Pomc</i> neurons detected by <i>in situ</i> hybridization (ISH) exceeded 100% in both <i>Vglut2</i>- <i>Pomc</i> restored and control mice, indicating that a subpopulation of <i>Pomc</i> neurons must express both neuronal markers. Consistent with this hypothesis, triple ISH of C57BL/6J hypothalami revealed that 35% of ARC <i>Pomc</i> neurons were selectively <i>Gad67</i>  <sup>+</sup>, 21% were selectively <i>Vglut2</i>  <sup>+</sup>, and 38% expressed both <i>Gad67</i> and <i>Vglut2</i>. The single <i>Gad67</i>  <sup>+</sup> and <i>Vglut2</i>  <sup>+</sup> <i>Pomc</i> neurons were most prevalent in the rostral ARC, while the <i>Vglut2/Gad67</i>  <sup>+</sup> dual-phenotype cells predominated in the caudal ARC. A lineage trace using Ai9-tdTomato reporter mice to label fluorescently all <i>Vglut2</i>-expressing neurons showed equal numbers of tdTomato<sup>+</sup> and tdTomato<sup>-</sup> POMC immunoreactive neurons. Together, these data suggest that POMC neurons exhibit developmental plasticity in their expression of glutamatergic and GABAergic markers, enabling re-establishment of normal energy homeostasis in the <i>Vglut2</i>-<i>Pomc</i> restored mice.</p>

Abstract
<p>Currently, there are no effective treatments for glioma or for neurodegenerative diseases because of, in part, our limited understanding of the pathophysiology and cellular heterogeneity of these diseases. Mounting evidence suggests that astrocytes play an active role in the pathogenesis of these diseases by contributing to a diverse range of pathophysiological states. In a previous study, five molecularly distinct astrocyte subpopulations from three different brain regions were identified. To further delineate the underlying diversity of these populations, we obtained mouse brain region-specific gene signatures for both protein-coding and long non-coding RNA and found that these astrocyte subpopulations are endowed with unique molecular signatures across diverse brain regions. Additional gene set and single-sample enrichment analyses revealed that gene signatures of different subpopulations are differentially correlated with glioma tumors that harbor distinct genomic alterations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that links transcriptional profiles of astrocyte subpopulations with glioma genomic mutations. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that subpopulations of astrocytes in select brain regions are associated with specific neurodegenerative diseases. Overall, the present study provides a new perspective for understanding the pathophysiology of glioma and neurodegenerative diseases and highlights the potential contributions of diverse astrocyte populations to normal, malignant, and degenerative brain functions.</p>

Abstract
<p>CA1 neurons in epileptic animals are vulnerable to selective changes in ion channel expression, called acquired channelopathies, which can increase the excitability of a neuron. Under normal conditions there is a gradient of ion channel expression and intrinsic excitability along the longitudinal, dorsoventral axis of hippocampal area CA1 of the rodent. Many of these channels, including M-channels, GIRK channels and HCN channels, all have dorsoventral expression gradients that might be altered in rodent models of epilepsy. Here, we show that the excitability of dorsal, but not ventral CA1 neurons, had an increased firing rate, reduced interspike interval (ISI) and increased input resistance in a status epilepticus (SE) model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). As a result, the excitability of CA1 neurons became uniform across the dorsoventral axis of the rat hippocampus post-SE. Using current clamp recordings with pharmacology and immunohistochemistry, we demonstrate that the expression of HCN channels was downregulated in the dorsal CA1 region post-SE, while the expression of M and GIRK channels were unchanged. We did not find this acquired channelopathy in ventral CA1 neurons post-SE. Our results suggest that the excitability of dorsal CA1 neurons post-SE increase to resemble the intrinsic properties of ventral CA1 neurons, which likely makes the hippocampal circuit more permissible to seizures, and contributes to the cognitive impairments associated with chronic epilepsy.</p>

Abstract
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Patients with MS typically present with visual, motor, and sensory deficits. However, an additional complication of MS in large subset of patients is neuropathic pain. To study the underlying immune-mediated pathophysiology of pain in MS we employed the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) model in mice. Since sensory neurons are crucial for nociceptive transduction, we investigated the effect of this disease on sensory neurons of the lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Here, we report the disease was associated with activation of the complement system and the NLRP3 inflammasome in the DRG. We further observe a transient increase in the number of complement component 5a receptor 1-positive (C5aR1+) immune cells, CD4+ T-cells, and Iba1+ macrophages in the DRG. The absence of any significant change in the levels of mRNA for myelin proteins in the DRG and the sciatic nerve suggests that demyelination in the PNS is not a trigger for the immune response in the DRG. However, we did observe an induction of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) at disease onset and chronic disruption of cytoskeletal proteins in the DRG demonstrating neuronal injury in the PNS in response to the disease. Electrophysiological analysis revealed the emergence of hyperexcitability in medium-to-large (≥26 µm) diameter neurons, especially at the onset of MOG-EAE signs. These results provide conclusive evidence of immune activation, neuronal injury, and peripheral sensitization in MOG-EAE, a model classically considered to be centrally mediated.</p>

<p>We investigated whether computed tomography (CT) perfusion can identify intracerebral hemorrhage patients at high risk of hematoma growth (HG). A total of 155 subjects underwent CT perfusion on admission. Variables associated with log‐transformed absolute HG were explored with multivariable linear regression. Perihematomal cerebral blood volume (CBV) was inversely associated with HG (B = –0.20; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), independently from blood pressure, hematoma volume, and other confounders. This association was not dose dependent, and only very low CBV (&lt;1.4 ml/100 g) was significantly associated with HG (B = 0.25; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, reduced perihematomal CBV is associated with HG, suggesting a potential role of the perihematomal region in the pathophysiology of hematoma enlargement. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To clinically and pathologically characterize a cohort of patients presenting with a novel form of distal myopathy and to identify the genetic cause of this new muscular dystrophy.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied 4 families (3 from Spain and 1 from Sweden) suffering from an autosomal dominant distal myopathy. Affected members showed adult onset asymmetric distal muscle weakness with initial involvement of ankle dorsiflexion later progressing also to proximal limb muscles.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In all 3 Spanish families, we identified a unique missense variant in the <i>ACTN2</i> gene cosegregating with the disease. The affected members of the Swedish family carry a different <i>ACTN2</i> missense variant.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>
<i>ACTN2</i> encodes for alpha actinin2, which is highly expressed in the sarcomeric Z‐disk with a major structural and functional role. Actininopathy is thus a new genetically determined distal myopathy. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate whether hemodynamic features of symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (sICAS) might correlate with the risk of stroke relapse, using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a cohort study, we recruited patients with acute ischemic stroke attributed to 50 to 99% ICAS confirmed by computed tomographic angiography (CTA). With CTA‐based CFD models, translesional pressure ratio (PR = <span>pressure<sub>poststenotic</sub>/pressure<sub>prestenotic</sub>
</span>) and translesional wall shear stress ratio (WSSR = <span>WSS<sub>stenotic − throat</sub>/WSS<sub>prestenotic</sub>
</span>) were obtained in each sICAS lesion. Translesional PR ≤ median was defined as low PR and WSSR ≥4th quartile as high WSSR. All patients received standard medical treatment. The primary outcome was recurrent ischemic stroke in the same territory (SIT) within 1 year.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Overall, 245 patients (median age = 61 years, 63.7% males) were analyzed. Median translesional PR was 0.94 (interquartile range [IQR] = 0.87–0.97); median translesional WSSR was 13.3 (IQR = 7.0–26.7). SIT occurred in 20 (8.2%) patients, mostly with multiple infarcts in the border zone and/or cortical regions. In multivariate Cox regression, low PR (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 3.16, <i>p</i> = 0.026) and high WSSR (adjusted HR = 3.05, <i>p</i> = 0.014) were independently associated with SIT. Patients with both low PR and high WSSR had significantly higher risk of SIT than those with normal PR and WSSR (risk = 17.5% vs 3.0%, adjusted HR = 7.52, <i>p</i> = 0.004).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This work represents a step forward in utilizing computational flow simulation techniques in studying intracranial atherosclerotic disease. It reveals a hemodynamic pattern of sICAS that is more prone to stroke relapse, and supports hypoperfusion and artery‐to‐artery embolism as common mechanisms of ischemic stroke in such patients.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01070">Multimodal Sparse Classifier for Adolescent Brain Age Prediction. (arXiv:1904.01070v1 [cs.LG])</a></h4>

<p>The study of healthy brain development helps to better understand the brain
transformation and brain connectivity patterns which happen during childhood to
adulthood. This study presents a sparse machine learning solution across
whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) measures of three sets of data,
derived from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and
task fMRI data, including a working memory n-back task (nb-fMRI) and an emotion
identification task (em-fMRI). These multi-modal image data are collected on a
sample of adolescents from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) for
the prediction of brain ages. Due to extremely large variable-to-instance ratio
of PNC data, a high dimensional matrix with several irrelevant and highly
correlated features is generated and hence a pattern learning approach is
necessary to extract significant features. We propose a sparse learner based on
the residual errors along the estimation of an inverse problem for the extreme
learning machine (ELM) neural network. The purpose of the approach is to
overcome the overlearning problem through pruning of several redundant features
and their corresponding output weights. The proposed multimodal sparse ELM
classifier based on residual errors (RES-ELM) is highly competitive in terms of
the classification accuracy compared to its counterparts such as conventional
ELM, and sparse Bayesian learning ELM.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45393">A type III-A CRISPR-Cas system employs degradosome nucleases to ensure robust immunity</a></h4>

CRISPR-Cas systems provide sequence-specific immunity against phages and mobile genetic elements using CRISPR-associated nucleases guided by short CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs). Type III systems exhibit a robust immune response that can lead to the extinction of a phage population, a feat coordinated by a multi-subunit effector complex that destroys invading DNA and RNA. Here, we demonstrate that a model type III system in <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i> relies upon the activities of two degradosome-associated nucleases, PNPase and RNase J2, to mount a successful defense. Genetic, molecular, and biochemical analyses reveal that PNPase promotes crRNA maturation, and both nucleases are required for efficient clearance of phage-derived nucleic acids. Furthermore, functional assays show that RNase J2 is essential for immunity against diverse mobile genetic elements originating from plasmid and phage. Altogether, our observations reveal the evolution of a critical collaboration between two nucleic acid degrading machines which ensures cell survival when faced with phage attack.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Brain field potentials (FPs) can reach far from their sources, making difficult to know which waves come from where. We show that modern algorithms efficiently segregate the local and remote contributions to cortical FPs by recovering the generator-specific spatial voltage profiles. We investigated experimentally and numerically the local and remote origin of FPs in different cortical areas in anesthetized rats. All cortices examined show significant state, layer, and region dependent contribution of remote activity, while the voltage profiles help identify their subcortical or remote cortical origin. Co-activation of different cortical modules can be discriminated by the distinctive spatial features of the corresponding profiles. All frequency bands contain remote activity, thus influencing the FP time course, in cases drastically. The reach of different FP patterns is boosted by spatial coherence and curved geometry of the sources. For instance, slow cortical oscillations reached the entire brain, while hippocampal theta reached only some portions of the cortex. In anterior cortices, most alpha oscillations have a remote origin, while in the visual cortex the remote theta and gamma even surpass the local contribution. The quantitative approach to local and distant FP contributions helps to refine functional connectivity among cortical regions, and their relation to behavior.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The reduced detectability of a target T2 following discrimination of a preceding target T1 in the attentional blink (AB) paradigm is classically interpreted as a consequence of reduced attention to T2 due to attentional allocation to T1. Here, we investigated whether AB was related to changes in microsaccade rate (MSR). We found a pronounced MSR signature following T1 onset, characterized by MSR suppression from 200 to 328 ms and enhancement from 380 to 568 ms. Across participants, the magnitude of the MSR suppression correlated with the AB effect such that low T2 detectability corresponded to <span style="font-style: italic;">reduced</span> MSR. However, in the same task, T1 error trials coincided with the <span style="font-style: italic;">presence</span> of microsaccades. We discuss this apparent paradox in terms of known neurophysiological correlates of MS whereby cortical excitability is suppressed both during the microsaccade and MSR suppression, in accordance to poor T1 performance with microsaccade <span style="font-style: italic;">occurrence</span> and poor T2 performance with microsaccade <span style="font-style: italic;">absence.</span> Our data suggest a novel low-level mechanism contributing to AB characterized by reduced MSR, thought to cause suppressed visual cortex excitability. This opens the question of whether attention mediates T2 performance suppression independently from MSR, and if not, how attention interacts with MSR to produce the T2 performance suppression.</span>

Disruption of this plasticity prevents learning about CS-US relationships when they are uncertain.

This third and final special issue in our series on disease focuses specifically on psychiatry. Despite psychiatry’s long history as a medical specialty, it has only been within recent decades that our understanding of the biological underpinnings of mental illness has delivered hope in influencing clinical practice in this particularly challenging field. The articles in the current issue review the many causes, symptoms, and neural correlates of psychiatric disease. In addition, they offer a variety of perspectives, from the benefits of working with different model systems, to circuits underlying phenotypic behaviors and cellular changes associated with disease, to genetic and epidemiological insights.

<p>by Yifan Gu, Yang Qi, Pulin Gong</p>

Experimental studies have begun revealing essential properties of the structural connectivity and the spatiotemporal activity dynamics of cortical circuits. To integrate these properties from anatomy and physiology, and to elucidate the links between them, we develop a novel cortical circuit model that captures a range of realistic features of synaptic connectivity. We show that the model accounts for the emergence of higher-order connectivity structures, including highly connected hub neurons that form an interconnected rich-club. The circuit model exhibits a rich repertoire of dynamical activity states, ranging from asynchronous to localized and global propagating wave states. We find that around the transition between asynchronous and localized propagating wave states, our model quantitatively reproduces a variety of major empirical findings regarding neural spatiotemporal dynamics, which otherwise remain disjointed in existing studies. These dynamics include diverse coupling (correlation) between spiking activity of individual neurons and the population, dynamical wave patterns with variable speeds and precise temporal structures of neural spikes. We further illustrate how these neural dynamics are related to the connectivity properties by analysing structural contributions to variable spiking dynamics and by showing that the rich-club structure is related to the diverse population coupling. These findings establish an integrated account of structural connectivity and activity dynamics of local cortical circuits, and provide new insights into understanding their working mechanisms.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sNFO3FQefOY" width="1" />

<p>by Hailong Meng, Gur Yaari, Christopher R. Bolen, Stefan Avey, Steven H. Kleinstein</p>

Small sample sizes combined with high person-to-person variability can make it difficult to detect significant gene expression changes from transcriptional profiling studies. Subtle, but coordinated, gene expression changes may be detected using gene set analysis approaches. Meta-analysis is another approach to increase the power to detect biologically relevant changes by integrating information from multiple studies. Here, we present a framework that combines both approaches and allows for meta-analysis of gene sets. QuSAGE meta-analysis extends our previously published QuSAGE framework, which offers several advantages for gene set analysis, including fully accounting for gene-gene correlations and quantifying gene set activity as a full probability density function. Application of QuSAGE meta-analysis to influenza vaccination response shows it can detect significant activity that is not apparent in individual studies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MmwvX-wJsmE" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine the longitudinal course of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in women with a history of migraine, in comparison to women without a history of migraine disease.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The study sample consisted of 467 women with a self‐reported prior migraine diagnosis and 2,466 women without prior migraine diagnosis who were assessed longitudinally during menopausal transition as part of the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. Linear mixed regression models with backward elimination were used to evaluate longitudinal associations between VMS and migraine while adjusting for baseline and time‐varying demographic, socioeconomic, psychological, and reproductive factors. Additional analyses were performed to further assess the specificity of the association between migraine with VMS that included evaluating the association between migraine and vaginal dryness, and between back pain and VMS.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A history of migraine predicted an increased frequency of VMS but not vaginal dryness during menopausal transition. Significant interaction between history of migraine and menopausal status for the prediction of VMS was also identified. Burden of VMS was found to be higher during late peri‐menopause stage in women with migraine. In contrast, the history of back pain did not predict the frequency of VMS.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This is the first study to delineate that a history of migraine predicts an increased frequency of VMS in women during menopausal transition. Hypothalamic abnormalities and thermoregulatory dysfunction against a milieu of decreasing estradiol concentrations during menopausal transition may explain the increased frequency of VMS in migraineurs during menopausal transition.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite decades of epilepsy research, 30% of focal epilepsies remain resistant to anti‐seizure drugs, with effective drug development impeded by lack of understanding on how seizures are initiated. Here we report the mechanism of seizure onset relevant to most seizures characteristic for focal epilepsies.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Electric and metabolic network parameters were measured using several seizure models in mouse hippocampal slices and acutely‐induced seizures in rats <i>in‐vivo</i> to determine metabolic events occuring at seizure onset.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We show that the seizure onset is associated with a rapid release of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> resulting from NMDA receptor‐mediated activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX). NOX blockade prevented the fast H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> release as well as the DC shift and seizure‐like event induction in slices. Similarly, intracerebroventricular injection of NOX antagonists prevented acutely induced seizures in rats.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results show that seizures are initiated by NMDA receptor‐mediated NOX‐induced oxidative stress and can be arrested by NOX inhibition. We introduce a novel use for blood‐brain barrier‐permeable NOX inhibitor with a significant potential to become the first seizure‐specific medication. Thus, targeting NOX may provide a breakthrough treatment for focal epilepsies.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The topical focus of women in dean's office‐level positions is heavily weighted towards education and community‐facing activities. Similarly, the research portfolios of schools with women research leadership are dominated (60% ± 10%) by funding for training and community‐based research. Those with men in that position are dominated (76% ± 8%) by funding for basic and clinical research (p &lt;&lt; 0.001, Student's t test). Similar findings characterize the neuroscience research portfolios of these institutions and the effects of a change in dean from a person of one gender to a person of another.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Children with aromatic <span class="smallCaps">l</span>‐amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency suffer from severe motor dysfunction. Restoration of dopamine levels in the putamen by gene therapy has led to significant improvement in motor function. This study explored brain structure changes in patients.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed before and 12 months after gene therapy. Whole‐brain tract‐specific analysis was performed to assess white matter microstructural integrity.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the 8 patients (aged 1.67–8.42 years) enrolled in the study, gene therapy did not affect macroscopic structure. DTI before gene therapy revealed lower total mean fractional anisotropy (FA) values in patients than in the age‐matched pretreatment controls (<i>p</i> = 0.017; median difference = −0.0136; 95% confidence interval [CI] [−0.0319, −0.0126]). After gene therapy, total mean FA increased (<i>p</i> = 0.012, median difference = 0.0211, 95% CI [0.0094, 0.0456]), and the values in the patients were not different from the age‐matched posttreatment controls. Increase in total mean FA after gene therapy in patients was correlated with their increase in motor score (r = 0.846; <i>p</i> = 0.008), but was inversely correlated with their ages at the time of gene therapy (r = −0.754; <i>p</i> = 0.031). Corticospinal tracts, and the thalamic radiation and callosal fibers involving motor function, improved after gene therapy.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Improvement in the microstructural integrity of white matter tracts is associated with the improvement in motor function following gene therapy. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

<p>Anti–N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is the most common autoimmune encephalitis related to autoantibody‐mediated synaptic dysfunction. Cerebrospinal fluid–derived human monoclonal NR1 autoantibodies showed low numbers of somatic hypermutations or were unmutated. These unexpected germline‐configured antibodies showed weaker binding to the NMDAR than matured antibodies from the same patient. In primary hippocampal neurons, germline NR1 autoantibodies strongly and specifically reduced total and synaptic NMDAR currents in a dose‐ and time‐dependent manner. The findings suggest that functional NMDAR antibodies are part of the human naïve B cell repertoire. Given their effects on synaptic function, they might contribute to a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric symptoms. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

<p>In dynamical systems theory, a fixed point of the dynamics is called
nonhyperbolic if the linearization of the system around the fixed point has at
least one eigenvalue with zero real part. The center manifold existence theorem
guarantees the local existence of an invariant subspace of the dynamics, known
as a center manifold, around such nonhyperbolic fixed points. A growing number
of theoretical and experimental studies suggest that some neural systems
utilize nonhyperbolic fixed points and corresponding center manifolds to
display complex, nonlinear dynamics and to flexibly adapt to wide-ranging
sensory input parameters. In this paper, we present a technique to study the
statistical properties of high-dimensional, nonhyperbolic dynamical systems
with random connectivity and examine which statistical properties determine
both the shape of the center manifold and the corresponding reduced dynamics on
it. This technique also gives us constraints on the family of center manifold
models that could arise from a large-scale random network. We demonstrate this
approach on an example network of randomly coupled damped oscillators.

<p>Visual scene understanding often requires the processing of human-object
interactions. Here we seek to explore if and how well Deep Neural Network (DNN)
models capture features similar to the brain's representation of humans,
objects, and their interactions. We investigate brain regions which process
human-, object-, or interaction-specific information, and establish
correspondences between them and DNN features. Our results suggest that we can
infer the selectivity of these regions to particular visual stimuli using DNN
representations. We also map features from the DNN to the regions, thus linking
the DNN representations to those found in specific parts of the visual cortex.
In particular, our results suggest that a typical DNN representation contains
encoding of compositional information for human-object interactions which goes
beyond a linear combination of the encodings for the two components, thus
suggesting that DNNs may be able to model this important property of biological
vision.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00353">Long-range temporal correlation in Auditory Brainstem Responses to Spoken Syllable /da/. (arXiv:1904.00353v1 [q-bio.QM])</a></h4>

<p>The speech auditory brainstem response (sABR) is an objective clinical tool
to diagnose particular impairments along the auditory brainstem pathways. We
explore the scaling behavior of the brainstem in response to synthetic /da/
stimuli using a proposed pipeline including Multifractal Detrended Moving
Average Analysis (MFDMA) modified by Singular Value Decomposition. The scaling
exponent confirms that all normal sABR are classified into the non-stationary
process. The average Hurst exponent is $H=0.77\pm0.12$ at 68\% confidence
interval indicating long-range correlation which shows the first universality
behavior of sABR. Our findings exhibit that fluctuations in the sABR series are
dictated by a mechanism associated with long-term memory of the dynamic of the
auditory system in the brainstem level. The $q-$dependency of $h(q)$
demonstrates that underlying data sets have multifractal nature revealing the
second universality behavior of the normal sABR samples. Comparing Hurst
exponent of original sABR with the results of the corresponding shuffled and
surrogate series, we conclude that its multifractality is almost due to the
long-range temporal correlations which are devoted to the third universality.
Finally, the presence of long-range correlation which is related to the slow
timescales in the subcortical level and integration of information in the
brainstem network is confirmed.

The broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) VRC01 is being evaluated for its efficacy to prevent HIV-1 infection in the Antibody Mediated Prevention (AMP) trials. A secondary objective of AMP utilizes sieve analysis to investigate how VRC01 prevention efficacy (PE) varies with HIV-1 envelope (Env) amino acid (AA) sequence features. An exhaustive analysis that tests how PE depends on every AA feature with sufficient variation would have low statistical power. To design an adequately powered primary sieve analysis for AMP, we modeled VRC01 neutralization as a function of Env AA sequence features of 611 HIV-1 gp160 pseudoviruses from the CATNAP database, with objectives: (1) to develop models that best predict the neutralization readouts; and (2) to rank AA features by their predictive importance with classification and regression methods. The dataset was split in half, and machine learning algorithms were applied to each half, each analyzed separately using cross-validation and hold-out validation. We selected Super Learner, a nonparametric ensemble-based cross-validated learning method, for advancement to the primary sieve analysis. This method predicted the dichotomous resistance outcome of whether the IC<sub>50</sub> neutralization titer of VRC01 for a given Env pseudovirus is right-censored (indicating resistance) with an average validated AUC of 0.868 across the two hold-out datasets. Quantitative log IC<sub>50</sub> was predicted with an average validated R<sup>2</sup> of 0.355. Features predicting neutralization sensitivity or resistance included 26 surface-accessible residues in the VRC01 and CD4 binding footprints, the length of gp120, the length of Env, the number of cysteines in gp120, the number of cysteines in Env, and 4 potential N-linked glycosylation sites; the top features will be advanced to the primary sieve analysis. This modeling framework may also inform the study of VRC01 in the treatment of HIV-infected persons.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UYUX5AKtENk" width="1" />

<p>by Qi Su, Lei Zhou, Long Wang</p>

Evolutionary game dynamics in structured populations has been extensively explored in past decades. However, most previous studies assume that payoffs of individuals are fully determined by the strategic behaviors of interacting parties, and social ties between them only serve as the indicator of the existence of interactions. This assumption neglects important information carried by inter-personal social ties such as genetic similarity, geographic proximity, and social closeness, which may crucially affect the outcome of interactions. To model these situations, we present a framework of evolutionary multiplayer games on graphs with edge diversity, where different types of edges describe diverse social ties. Strategic behaviors together with social ties determine the resulting payoffs of interactants. Under weak selection, we provide a general formula to predict the success of one behavior over the other. We apply this formula to various examples which cannot be dealt with using previous models, including the division of labor and relationship- or edge-dependent games. We find that labor division can promote collective cooperation markedly. The evolutionary process based on relationship-dependent games can be approximated by interactions under a transformed and unified game. Our work stresses the importance of social ties and provides effective methods to reduce the calculating complexity in analyzing the evolution of realistic systems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kIcI2fMWze8" width="1" />

<p>by Cheng Liang, Shengpeng Yu, Jiawei Luo</p>

Increasing evidence has indicated that microRNAs(miRNAs) play vital roles in various pathological processes and thus are closely related with many complex human diseases. The identification of potential disease-related miRNAs offers new opportunities to understand disease etiology and pathogenesis. Although there have been numerous computational methods proposed to predict reliable miRNA-disease associations, they suffer from various limitations that affect the prediction accuracy and their applicability. In this study, we develop a novel method to discover disease-related candidate miRNAs based on Adaptive Multi-View Multi-Label learning(AMVML). Specifically, considering the inherent noise existed in the current dataset, we propose to learn a new affinity graph adaptively for both diseases and miRNAs from multiple similarity profiles. We then simultaneously update the miRNA-disease association predicted from both spaces based on multi-label learning. In particular, we prove the convergence of AMVML theoretically and the corresponding analysis indicates that it has a fast convergence rate. To comprehensively illustrate the prediction performance of our method, we compared AMVML with four state-of-the-art methods under different validation frameworks. As a result, our method achieves comparable performance under various evaluation metrics, which suggests that our method is capable of discovering greater number of true miRNA-disease associations. The case study conducted on thyroid neoplasms further identified a potential diagnostic biomarker. Together, the experimental results confirms the utility of our method and we anticipate that our method could serve as a reliable and efficient tool for uncovering novel disease-related miRNAs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ozz2pT29Pu4" width="1" />

<p>by Philip Gerlee, Mia Johansson</p>

The formation of metastases is driven by the ability of cancer cells to disseminate from the site of the primary tumour to target organs. The process of dissemination is constrained by anatomical features such as the flow of blood and lymph in the circulatory system. We exploit this fact in a stochastic network model of metastasis formation, in which only anatomically feasible routes of dissemination are considered. By fitting this model to two different clinical datasets (tongue &amp; ovarian cancer) we show that incidence data can be modelled using a small number of biologically meaningful parameters. The fitted models reveal site specific relative rates of dissemination and also allow for patient-specific predictions of metastatic involvement based on primary tumour location and stage. Applied to other data sets this type of model could yield insight about seed-soil effects, and could also be used in a clinical setting to provide personalised predictions about the extent of metastatic spread.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PnGpm9IQT7I" width="1" />

<p>by Arumay Pal, Yaakov Levy</p>

Recognition of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) is important for many fundamental cellular functions. A variety of single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (ssDBPs) and single-stranded RNA-binding proteins (ssRBPs) have evolved that bind ssDNA and ssRNA, respectively, with varying degree of affinities and specificities to form complexes. Structural studies of these complexes provide key insights into their recognition mechanism. However, computational modeling of the specific recognition process and to predict the structure of the complex is challenging, primarily due to the heterogeneity of their binding energy landscape and the greater flexibility of ssDNA or ssRNA compared with double-stranded nucleic acids. Consequently, considerably fewer computational studies have explored interactions between proteins and single-stranded nucleic acids compared with protein interactions with double-stranded nucleic acids. Here, we report a newly developed energy-based coarse-grained model to predict the structure of ssDNA–ssDBP and ssRNA–ssRBP complexes and to assess their sequence-specific interactions and stabilities. We tuned two factors that can modulate specific recognition: base–aromatic stacking strength and the flexibility of the single-stranded nucleic acid. The model was successfully applied to predict the binding conformations of 12 distinct ssDBP and ssRBP structures with their cognate ssDNA and ssRNA partners having various sequences. Estimated binding energies agreed well with the corresponding experimental binding affinities. Bound conformations from the simulation showed a funnel-shaped binding energy distribution where the native-like conformations corresponded to the energy minima. The various ssDNA–protein and ssRNA–protein complexes differed in the balance of electrostatic and aromatic energies. The lower affinity of the ssRNA–ssRBP complexes compared with the ssDNA–ssDBP complexes stems from lower flexibility of ssRNA compared to ssDNA, which results in higher rate constants for the dissociation of the complex (<i>k</i><sub>off</sub>) for complexes involving the former.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xirNQFyHaWQ" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Accurate identification of the ischemic penumbra, the therapeutic target in acute clinical stroke, is of critical importance to identify patients who might benefit from reperfusion therapies (e.g. thrombectomy) beyond the established time windows. Therefore, we aimed to validate magnetic‐resonance‐imaging (MRI) mismatch based penumbra detection against full quantitative positron‐emission‐tomography (<sup>15</sup>O‐PET), the gold standard for penumbra detection in acute ischemic stroke.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ten patients (group A) with acute and subacute ischemic stroke underwent perfusion/diffusion weighted (PW/DW) MRI and consecutive full quantitative <sup>15</sup>O‐PET within 48 hours of stroke onset (mean, 17.4 hours). Penumbra as defined by <sup>15</sup>O‐PET cerebral‐blood‐flow (CBF), oxygen‐extraction‐fraction (OEF), and oxygen‐metabolism (CMRO<sub>2</sub>) was used to validate a wide range of established PWI measures (e.g. time‐to‐maximum [Tmax]) to optimize penumbral tissue detection. Validation was carried out using a voxel‐based receiver‐operating‐characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The same validation based on penumbra as defined by quantitative <sup>15</sup>O‐PET CBF was performed for comparative reasons in 23 patients measured within 48 hours of stroke onset (group B).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The PWI map Tmax (area under the curve [AUC] 0.88) performed best in detecting penumbral tissue up to 48 hours after stroke onset. The optimal threshold to discriminate penumbra from oligemia was Tmax &gt;5.6 seconds with a sensitivity and specificity of above 80%. Other PW measures performed significantly less well (p &lt;0.05).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The performance of the best PW‐measure Tmax to detect the upper penumbral flow threshold in ischemic stroke, as defined by full quantitative <sup>15</sup>O‐PET, is excellent. Tmax &gt;5.6 seconds based penumbra detection in ischemic stroke is reliable to guide treatment decisions up to 48 hours and might help to expand reperfusion treatment beyond the current time window.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>SLC1A2</i> is a trimeric transporter essential for clearing glutamate from neuronal synapses. Recurrent <i>de novo SLC1A2</i> missense variants cause a severe, early‐onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy via an unclear mechanism. We demonstrate that all three variants implicated in this condition localize to the trimerization domain of SLC1A2, and that the Leu85Pro variant acts via a dominant negative mechanism to reduce, but not eliminate, wild‐type SLC1A2 protein localization and function. Finally, we demonstrate that treatment of a 20‐month‐old <i>SLC1A2</i>‐related epilepsy patient with the SLC1A2 modulating agent ceftriaxone did not result in a significant change in daily spasm count.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Subthalamic deep brain stimulation may alleviate bradykinesia in Parkinson patients. Research suggests that this stimulation effect may be mediated by brain networks like the cortico‐cerebellar loop. This study investigated the connectivity between stimulation sites and cortical and subcortical structures to identify connections for effective stimulation.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We retrospectively investigated 21 patients with Parkinson's disease with bilateral subthalamic deep brain stimulation. Stimulation effectiveness in reducing bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity was evaluated for each electrode‐contact in brain hemispheres contralateral to the affected hemi‐body. Dysarthric side effects were also examined. Probabilistic tractography based on diffusion‐weighted imaging was performed in individual patient‐specific brains using electrode‐contacts as seeds. Connectivity profiles of contacts with effective and non‐effective stimulation were compared.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Connectivity profiles of effective and non‐effective contacts differed. Moreover, the connectivity profile for bradykinesia differed from that for rigidity, tremor or dysarthria. Regarding bradykinesia, effective contacts were significantly more often connected with the ipsilateral superior cerebellar peduncle and the ipsilateral dentate nucleus, which correspond to the ipsilateral portion of the cerebello‐thalamo‐cortical pathway. Rigidity was mitigated by stimulation of ascending brainstem and intralaminar thalamic connections. Tremor alleviation was related to connections with the internal capsule (anterior limb) and the pallidum. Dysarthric side effects were associated with connections to the supplementary motor area and the decussating cerebello‐thalamo‐cortical pathway.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Whereas bradykinesia seems to be mitigated by stimulation of the ascending, ipsilateral cerebello‐thalamo‐cortical pathway, stimulation of the descending cortico‐ponto‐cerebellar pathway may be ineffective. Rigidity, tremor, and dysarthric side effects seem to be influenced by different neural networks.</p>

Abstract<p>The importance of the dorsal hippocampus (DH) in mediating the memory-enhancing effects of the sex-steroid hormone 17β-estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) is well-established, however, estrogen receptors are highly expressed in other brain regions that support memory formation, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The mPFC and DH interact to mediate the formation of several types of memory, and behavioral tasks that recruit the mPFC are enhanced by systemic E<sub>2</sub> administration, making this region a prime candidate for investigating circuit-level questions regarding the estrogenic regulation of memory. Further, infusion of E<sub>2</sub> directly into the DH increases dendritic spine density in both the DH and mPFC, and this effect depends upon rapid activation of cell-signaling pathways in the DH, demonstrating a previously unexplored interaction between the DH and mPFC that led us to question the role of the mPFC in object memory consolidation and the necessity of DH-mPFC interactions in the memory-enhancing effects of E<sub>2</sub>. Here, we found that infusion of E<sub>2</sub> directly into the mPFC of ovariectomized mice increased mPFC apical spine density and facilitated object recognition and spatial memory consolidation, demonstrating that E<sub>2</sub> in the mPFC increases spinogenesis and enhances memory consolidation. Next, chemogenetic suppression of the mPFC blocked the memory-enhancing effects of DH-infused E<sub>2</sub>, indicating that systems-level DH-mPFC interactions are necessary for the memory-enhancing effects of E<sub>2</sub>. Together, these studies provide evidence that E<sub>2</sub> in the mPFC mediates memory formation, and reveal that the DH and mPFC act in concert to support the memory-enhancing effects of E<sub>2</sub> in female mice.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Estrogens influence the prevalence and severity of certain psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, many of which are characterized by impaired mPFC and DH function. Myriad findings demonstrate that E<sub>2</sub> regulates hippocampal plasticity and memory, however, far less is known about estrogenic regulation of other interconnected brain regions, like the mPFC. Here, we report that mPFC E<sub>2</sub> infusion in ovariectomized mice increases mPFC spine density and facilitates memory consolidation, and that chemogenetic inactivation of the mPFC blocks the memory-enhancing effects of DH-infused E<sub>2</sub>. These findings suggest an essential role for the mPFC, alone and in concert with the DH, in mediating the memory-enhancing effects of E<sub>2</sub>. Such circuit-level interactions may be critical to understanding how E<sub>2</sub> regulates memory.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>The Giant Fiber System (GFS) is a multi-component neuronal pathway mediating rapid escape response in the adult fruit-fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, usually in the face of a threatening visual stimulus. Two branches of the circuit promote the response by stimulating an escape jump followed by flight initiation. A recent work demonstrated an age-associated decline in the speed of signal propagation through the circuit, measured as the stimulus-to-muscle depolarization response latency. The decline is likely due to the diminishing number of inter-neuronal gap junctions in the GFS of ageing flies. In this work, we presented a realistic conductance-based, computational model of the GFS that recapitulates the experimental results and identifies some of the critical anatomical and physiological components governing the circuit’s response latency. According to our model, anatomical properties of the GFS neurons have a stronger impact on the transmission than neuronal membrane conductance densities. The model provides testable predictions for the effect of experimental interventions on the circuit’s performance in young and ageing flies.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Finding potential targets for preventing functional decline of neuronal circuits is important from both biological and clinical perspective. In the nervous system of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, the escape response system mediates quick propagation of signals from the brain to the muscles, instructing flight initiation following a threatening visual stimulus. It was previously shown that this circuit shows a marked decline in the speed of signal propagation with age, likely due to loss of synaptic gap junctions. Here, we generated a computational model of the system and uncovered novel anatomical and physiological parameters that govern the circuit's function in young and old animals. These predictions can be tested experimentally and have significance for other fast circuits in flies and other species.</p>

Abstract<p>Lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) neurons signal the allocation of voluntary attention; however, the neural computations underlying this function remain unknown. To investigate this, we recorded from neuronal ensembles in the LPFC of two <i>macaca fascicularis</i> performing a visuospatial attention task. LPFC neural responses to a single stimulus were normalized when additional stimuli/distracters appeared across the visual field and were well-characterized by an averaging computation. Deploying attention toward an individual stimulus surrounded by distracters shifted neural activity from an averaging regime toward a regime similar to that when the attended stimulus was presented in isolation (winner-take-all). However, attentional modulation is both qualitatively and quantitatively dependent on a neuron’s visuospatial tuning. Our results show that during attentive vision, LPFC neuronal ensemble activity can be robustly read out by downstream areas to generate motor commands, and/or fed back into sensory areas to filter out distracter signals in favor of target signals.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) neurons signal the allocation of voluntary attention. The neural computations underlying this phenomenon remain unknown. Here we show that neurons in the primate LPFC perform two types of normalization computations, <i>response averaging</i> that calibrates neural activity according to the number of stimuli in the visual field, and <i>winner-take-all</i> that biases neural activity to represent attended stimuli. These computations are global, across the entire visual field, and their strength vary across neurons depending on their visuospatial tuning. We show evidence in favor of a circuit mechanism that flexibly uses normalization computations in order to generate a signal profile in ensembles of LPFC neurons that carries sufficient information to guide the allocation of visuospatial attention.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0044-19.2019v1?rss=1">Chronic alcohol drinking slows brain development in adolescent and young adult non-human primates</a></h4>

Abstract<p>The transition from adolescence to adulthood is associated with brain remodeling in the final stages of developmental growth. It is also a period when a large proportion of this age group engages to binge (occasional consumption of 4-5 drinks leading to intoxication) and heavy (binge drinking on ≥5 days in a month) alcohol drinking. Here we report on magnetic resonance imaging of developmental changes in the brain occurring during late adolescence and early adulthood (3.5-7.5 years) in a rhesus macaque model of alcohol self-administration. Monkeys were imaged prior to alcohol exposure, and following ~6 and ~12 months of daily (22 hr/day) access to ethanol and water. The results revealed that the brain volume increases by 1 ml per 1.87 years throughout the late adolescence and early adulthood in controls. Heavy alcohol reduced the rate of brain growth by 0.25 ml/year per 1 g/kg of daily ethanol. Cortical volume increased throughout this period with no significant effect of alcohol drinking on the cortical growth rate. In subcortical regions, age-dependent increases in the volumes of globus pallidus, thalamus, brainstem and cerebellum were observed. Heavy drinking attenuated the growth rate of the thalamus. Thus, developmental brain volume changes in the span of late adolescence to young adulthood in macaques is altered by excessive alcohol, an insult that may be linked to the continuation of heavy drinking throughout later adult life.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Alcohol abuse during late adolescence and early adulthood is a risk factor for development of alcohol dependence. This longitudinal study used a macaque model of alcohol self-administration and <i>in vivo</i> MR-imaging to quantify the impact of chronic alcohol on developmental changes occurring within the brain during this period. Chronic alcohol self-intoxication reduced the growth rate of brain, cerebral white matter and subcortical thalamus. Thus, daily alcohol drinking during the critical transition to adulthood significantly impacts critical areas of sensory motor integration, concomitant with a decrease in cortical white matter, documenting in the primate brain neural circuitry implicating in the propagation of alcohol use disorder.</p>

<p>The "edge of chaos" phase transition in artificial neural networks is of
renewed interest in the light of recent evidence for criticality in brain
dynamics. Statistical mechanics traditionally studied this transition with
connectivity $k$ as control parameter and an exactly balanced
excitation/inhibition ratio. While critical connectivity has been found to be
low in these model systems, typically around $k=2$, which is unrealistic for
natural systems, a recent study utilizing the excitation/inhibition ratio as
control parameter found a new, nearly degree-independent critical point when
connectivity is large. However, the new phase transition is accompanied by an
unnaturally high level of activity in the network.
</p>
<p>Here we study random neural networks with the additional properties of (i) a
high clustering coefficient and (ii) neurons that are solely either excitatory
or inhibitory, a prominent property of natural neurons. As a result we observe
an additional critical point for networks with large connectivity, regardless
of degree distribution, which exhibits low activity levels that compare well
with neuronal brain networks.

Premature, sudden death is devastating. Certain patient populations are at greater risk to succumb to sudden death. For instance, infants under 1year of age are at risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and patients with epilepsy are at risk for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Deaths are attributed to these syndromic entities in these select populations when other diagnoses have been excluded. There are a number of similarities between these syndromes, and the commonalities suggest that the two syndromes may share certain etiological features.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Rates of worsening and evolution to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) may be substantially lower in actively treated patients compared to natural history studies from the pretreatment era. Nonetheless, in our recently reported prospective cohort, more than half of patients with relapsing MS accumulated significant new disability by the 10th year of follow‐up. Notably, “no evidence of disease activity” at 2 years did not predict long‐term stability. Here, we determined to what extent clinical relapses and radiographic evidence of disease activity contribute to long‐term disability accumulation.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Disability progression was defined as an increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 1.5, 1.0, or 0.5 (or greater) from baseline EDSS = 0, 1.0–5.0, and 5.5 or higher, respectively, assessed from baseline to year 5 (±1 year) and sustained to year 10 (±1 year). Longitudinal analysis of relative brain volume loss used a linear mixed model with sex, age, disease duration, and <i>HLA‐DRB1*15:01</i> as covariates.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Relapses were associated with a transient increase in disability over 1‐year intervals (<i>p</i> = 0.012) but not with confirmed disability progression (<i>p</i> = 0.551). Relative brain volume declined at a greater rate among individuals with disability progression compared to those who remained stable (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Long‐term worsening is common in relapsing MS patients, is largely independent of relapse activity, and is associated with accelerated brain atrophy. We propose the term <i>silent progression</i> to describe the insidious disability that accrues in many patients who satisfy traditional criteria for relapsing–remitting MS. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Plasminogen activator inhibitor‐1 (PAI‐1) is the key endogenous inhibitor of fibrinolysis, and enhances clot formation after injury. In traumatic brain injury, dysregulation of fibrinolysis may lead to sustained microthrombosis and accelerated lesion expansion. In the present study, we hypothesized that PAI‐1 mediates post‐traumatic malfunction of coagulation, with inhibition or genetic depletion of PAI‐1 attenuating clot formation and lesion expansion after brain trauma.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We evaluated PAI‐1 as a possible new target in a mouse controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of traumatic brain injury. We performed the pharmacological inhibition of PAI‐1 with PAI‐039 and stimulation by tranexamic acid, and we confirmed our results in PAI‐1–deficient animals.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>PAI‐1 mRNA was time‐dependently upregulated, with a 305‐fold peak 12 hours after CCI, which effectively counteracted the 2‐ to 3‐fold increase in cerebral tissue‐type/urokinase plasminogen activator expression. PAI‐039 reduced brain lesion volume by 26% at 24 hours and 43% at 5 days after insult. This treatment also attenuated neuronal apoptosis and improved neurofunctional outcome. Moreover, intravital microscopy demonstrated reduced post‐traumatic thrombus formation in the pericontusional cortical microvasculature. In PAI‐1–deficient mice, the therapeutic effect of PAI‐039 was absent. These mice also displayed 13% reduced brain damage compared with wild type. In contrast, inhibition of fibrinolysis with tranexamic acid increased lesion volume by 25% compared with vehicle.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study identifies impaired fibrinolysis as a critical process in post‐traumatic secondary brain damage and suggests that PAI‐1 may be a central endogenous inhibitor of the fibrinolytic pathway, promoting a procoagulatory state and clot formation in the cerebral microvasculature.

<p>Accumulating evidence corroborates the role of the “central vein sign” in the radiological diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we report human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and corresponding pathological data that inflammation‐dependent intracerebral remodeling of the vessel wall is directly associated with the prominence of intralesional veins on susceptibility‐based MRI. In adult marmosets with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, vessel‐wall fibrosis was detected early in the demyelinating process, even in lesions &lt;2 weeks old, though fibrosis was more evident after 6 weeks. Vascular remodeling consisted of both luminal enlargement and eccentric thickening of the perivascular space (fibrillar collagen type I deposition) and affected almost exclusively white matter, but not subpial cortical, lesions. The long‐term effect of vessel remodeling in MS lesions is currently unknown, but it might potentially affect tissue repair. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Memory encoding is a critical process for memory function, which is foundational for cognitive functioning including reading, and has been extensively studied using subsequent memory tasks. Research in adults using such tasks indicates the participation of visual and cognitive-control systems in remembered versus forgotten words. However, given the known developmental trajectories of these systems, the functional neuroanatomy of memory encoding in children may be different than in adults. We examined brain activation for silent word reading and checkerboard viewing during an event-related reading task in 8–12 year-old children. Results indicate greater activation for checkerboard viewing than lexical processing in early visual regions, as well as for lexical processing versus checkerboard viewing in regions in left sensorimotor mouth, cingulo-opercular and dorsal-attention networks. Greater activation for remembered than forgotten words was observed in bilateral visual system and left lateralized regions within the ventral- and dorsal-attention, cingulo-opercular and fronto-parietal networks. These findings suggest a relatively mature reliance on the cognitive-control system, but greater reliance on the visual system in children when viewing words subsequently remembered. The location of regions with greater activity for remembered words reinforces the involvement of the attention and cognitive-control systems in subsequent memory in reading.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Diffusion MR tractography permits investigating the 3D structure of cortical pathways as interwoven paths across the entire brain. We use high-resolution scans from diffusion spectrum imaging and high angular resolution diffusion imaging to investigate the evolution of cortical pathways within the euarchontoglire (i.e., primates, rodents) lineage. More specifically, we compare cortical fiber pathways between macaques (<span style="font-style: italic;">Macaca mulatta</span>), marmosets (<span style="font-style: italic;">Callithrix jachus</span>), and rodents (mice, <span style="font-style: italic;">Mus musculus</span>). We integrate these observations with comparative analyses of Neurofilament heavy polypeptide (<span style="font-style: italic;">NEFH</span>) expression across the cortex of mice and primates. We chose these species because their phylogenetic position serves to trace the early evolutionary history of the human brain. Our comparative analysis from diffusion MR tractography, cortical white matter scaling, and <span style="font-style: italic;">NEFH</span> expression demonstrates that the examined primates deviate from mice in possessing increased long-range cross-cortical projections, many of which course across the anterior to posterior axis of the cortex. Our study shows that integrating gene expression data with diffusion MR data is an effective approach in identifying variation in connectivity patterns between species. The expansion of corticocortical pathways and increased anterior to posterior cortical integration can be traced back to an extension of neurogenetic schedules during development in primates.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Developmental neuroimaging studies report the emergence of increasingly diverse cognitive functions as closely entangled with a rise-fall modulation of cortical thickness (CTh), structural cortical and white-matter connectivity, and a time-course for the experience-dependent selective elimination of the overproduced synapses. We examine which of two visual processing networks, the dorsal (DVN; prefrontal, parietal nodes) or ventral (VVN; frontal-temporal, fusiform nodes) matures first, thus leading the neuro-cognitive developmental trajectory. Three age-dependent measures are reported: (i) the CTh at network nodes; (ii) the matrix of intra-network structural connectivity (<span style="font-style: italic;">edges</span>); and (iii) the proficiency in network-related neuropsychological tests. Typically developing children (age ~6 years), adolescents (~11 years), and adults (~21 years) were tested using multiple-acquisition structural T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychology. MRI images reconstructed into a gray/white/pial matter boundary model were used for CTh evaluation. No significant group differences in CTh and in the matrix of edges were found for DVN (except for the left prefrontal), but a significantly thicker cortex in children for VVN with reduced prefrontal ventral-fusiform connectivity and with an abundance of connections in adolescents. The higher performance in children on tests related to DVN corroborates the age-dependent MRI structural connectivity findings. The current findings are consistent with an earlier maturational course of DVN.</span>

<p>by Finlay Campbell, Anne Cori, Neil Ferguson, Thibaut Jombart</p>

There exists significant interest in developing statistical and computational tools for inferring ‘who infected whom’ in an infectious disease outbreak from densely sampled case data, with most recent studies focusing on the analysis of whole genome sequence data. However, genomic data can be poorly informative of transmission events if mutations accumulate too slowly to resolve individual transmission pairs or if there exist multiple pathogens lineages within-host, and there has been little focus on incorporating other types of outbreak data. We present here a methodology that uses contact data for the inference of transmission trees in a statistically rigorous manner, alongside genomic data and temporal data. Contact data is frequently collected in outbreaks of pathogens spread by close contact, including Ebola virus (EBOV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (TB), and routinely used to reconstruct transmission chains. As an improvement over previous, ad-hoc approaches, we developed a probabilistic model that relates a set of contact data to an underlying transmission tree and integrated this in the <i>outbreaker2</i> inference framework. By analyzing simulated outbreaks under various contact tracing scenarios, we demonstrate that contact data significantly improves our ability to reconstruct transmission trees, even under realistic limitations on the coverage of the contact tracing effort and the amount of non-infectious mixing between cases. Indeed, contact data is equally or more informative than fully sampled whole genome sequence data in certain scenarios. We then use our method to analyze the early stages of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore and describe the range of transmission scenarios consistent with contact data and genetic sequence in a probabilistic manner for the first time. This simple yet flexible model can easily be incorporated into existing tools for outbreak reconstruction and should permit a better integration of genomic and epidemiological data for inferring transmission chains.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cewgawFrZu4" width="1" />

<p>by Daniel B. Larremore</p>

Measuring the overlap between two populations is, in principle, straightforward. Upon fully sampling both populations, the number of shared objects—species, taxonomical units, or gene variants, depending on the context—can be directly counted. In practice, however, only a fraction of each population’s objects are likely to be sampled due to stochastic data collection or sequencing techniques. Although methods exists for quantifying population overlap under subsampled conditions, their bias is well documented and the uncertainty of their estimates cannot be quantified. Here we derive and validate a method to rigorously estimate the population overlap from incomplete samples when the total number of objects, species, or genes in each population is known, a special case of the more general <i>β</i>-diversity problem that is particularly relevant in the ecology and genomic epidemiology of malaria. By solving a Bayesian inference problem, this method takes into account the rates of subsampling and produces unbiased and Bayes-optimal estimates of overlap. In addition, it provides a natural framework for computing the uncertainty of its estimates, and can be used prospectively in study planning by quantifying the tradeoff between sampling effort and uncertainty.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/f5tbvTBDGlg" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity is fundamental for working memory (WM), attention, and behavioral inhibition; however, a comprehensive understanding of the neural computations underlying these processes is still forthcoming. Toward this goal, neural recordings were obtained from the mPFC of awake, behaving rats performing an odor span task of WM capacity. Neural populations were observed to encode distinct task epochs and the transitions between epochs were accompanied by abrupt shifts in neural activity patterns. Putative pyramidal neuron activity increased earlier in the delay for sessions where rats achieved higher spans. Furthermore, increased putative interneuron activity was only observed at the termination of the delay thus indicating that local processing in inhibitory networks was a unique feature to initiate foraging. During foraging, changes in neural activity patterns associated with the approach to a novel odor, but not familiar odors, were robust. Collectively, these data suggest that distinct mPFC activity states underlie the delay, foraging, and reward epochs of the odor span task. Transitions between these states likely enables adaptive behavior in dynamic environments that place strong demands on the substrates of working memory.</p>

<p>Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) is thought to play an important role in
communication across distant brain regions. However, neither the mechanism of
its generation nor the influence on the underlying spiking dynamics is well
understood. Here, we investigate the dynamics of two interacting distant
neuronal modules coupled by inter-regional long-range connections. Each
neuronal module comprises an excitatory and inhibitory population of quadratic
integrate-and-fire neurons connected locally with conductance-based synapses.
The two modules are coupled reciprocally with delays that represent the
long-range conduction time. We applied the Ott-Antonsen ansatz to reduce the
spiking dynamics to the corresponding mean field equations as a small set of
delay differential equations. Bifurcation analysis on these mean field
equations shows inter-regional conduction delay is sufficient to produce CFC
via a torus bifurcation. Spike correlation analysis during the CFC revealed
that several local clusters exhibit synchronized firing in gamma-band
frequencies. These clusters exhibit locally decorrelated firings between the
cluster pairs within the same population. In contrast, the clusters exhibit
long-range gamma-band cross-covariance between the distant clusters that have
similar firing frequency. The interactions of the different gamma frequencies
produce a beat leading to population-level CFC. We analyzed spike counts in
relation to the phases of the macroscopic fast and slow oscillations and found
population spike counts vary with respect to macroscopic phases. Such firing
phase preference accompanies a phase window with high spike count and low Fano
factor, which is suitable for a population rate code. Our work suggests the
inter-regional conduction delay plays a significant role in the emergence of
CFC and the underlying spiking dynamics may support long-range communication
and neural coding.

<p>The pharynx of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a neuromuscular pump
that exhibits two typical motions: pumping and peristalsis. While the dynamics
of these motions are well characterized, the underlying mechanisms generating
most of them are not known. In this paper, we propose comprehensive and
detailed mechanisms that can explain the various observed dynamics of the
different pharyngeal areas: the dynamics of the pumping muscles - corpus,
anterior isthmus, and terminal bulb - and the peristalsis dynamics of the
posterior isthmus muscles. While the suggested mechanisms are consistent with
all available relevant data, the assumptions on which they are based and the
open questions they raise could point at additional interesting research
directions on the C. elegans pharynx. We are hoping that appropriate
experiments on the nematode will eventually corroborate our results, and
improve our understanding of the functioning of the C. elegans pharynx, and
possibly of the mammalian digestive system.

<p>A central problem of neuroscience involves uncovering the principles
governing the organization of nervous systems which ensure robustness in brain
development. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, where genetically identical
individuals possess the same complement of neurons located at invariant
positions, provides us with a model organism for studying this question. In
this paper, we focus on the connection structure and spatial arrangement of the
neurons comprising the somatic neuronal network of this organism to understand
the key developmental constraints underlying the design of a simple nervous
system. We observe that lineage distance between neurons, rather than the
physical distance between their cell bodies, strongly influences the
probability of a connection between them. In addition, the length of neuronal
processes, as well as, their birth times determine connectivity. Together,
these results help connect the physical location and morphology of neurons with
the topological organization of the network. Further, neurons coordinating
activity across distinct neuronal clusters are seen to appear early which
relates the temporal hierarchy imposed by development to the functional role of
neurons. By providing a framework for a mechanistic understanding of how
development shapes a nervous system, our results complement interpretive
analysis of how efficiency and optimality govern its design. Providing crucial
insights for understanding principles that may be common across many organisms,
our study shows how the trajectory in the developmental landscape constrains
the eventual spatial and network topological organization of a nervous system.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11915">Early deafness leads to re-shaping of global functional connectivity beyond the auditory cortex. (arXiv:1903.11915v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Early sensory deprivation such as blindness or deafness shapes brain
development in multiple ways. While it is established that deprived brain areas
start to be engaged in the processing of stimuli from the remaining modalities
and in high-level cognitive tasks, some reports have also suggested the
possibility of structural and functional changes in non-deprived brain areas.
We compared resting-state functional network organization of the brain in
early-deaf adults and hearing controls by examining global network segregation
and integration. Relative to hearing controls, deaf adults exhibited an altered
modular organization, with regions of the salience network coupled with the
fronto-parietal network. They showed weaker connections between auditory and
somatomotor regions, stronger coupling between the fronto-parietal network and
several other large-scale networks (visual, memory, cingulo-opercular and
somatomotor), and an enlargement of the default mode network. Their overall
functional segregation of brain networks was also lower. Our findings suggest
that brain plasticity in deaf adults is not limited to changes in auditory
cortex but additionally alters the coupling between other large-scale networks.
These widespread functional connectivity changes may provide a mechanism for
the superior behavioral performance of the deaf in visual and attentional
tasks.

<p>by Tomasz Miksa, Stephanie Simms, Daniel Mietchen, Sarah Jones</p>

Data management plans (DMPs) are documents accompanying research proposals and project outputs. DMPs are created as free-form text and describe the data and tools employed in scientific investigations. They are often seen as an administrative exercise and not as an integral part of research practice.
There is now widespread recognition that the DMP can have more thematic, machine-actionable richness with added value for all stakeholders: researchers, funders, repository managers, research administrators, data librarians, and others. The research community is moving toward a shared goal of making DMPs machine-actionable to improve the experience for all involved by exchanging information across research tools and systems and embedding DMPs in existing workflows. This will enable parts of the DMP to be automatically generated and shared, thus reducing administrative burdens and improving the quality of information within a DMP.
This paper presents 10 principles to put machine-actionable DMPs (maDMPs) into practice and realize their benefits. The principles contain specific actions that various stakeholders are already undertaking or should undertake in order to work together across research communities to achieve the larger aims of the principles themselves. We describe existing initiatives to highlight how much progress has already been made toward achieving the goals of maDMPs as well as a call to action for those who wish to get involved.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SAC1K08XnXo" width="1" />

<p>by Lawrence W. Sheppard, Emma J. Defriez, Philip C. Reid, Daniel C. Reuman</p>

Large-scale spatial synchrony is ubiquitous in ecology. We examined 56 years of data representing chlorophyll density in 26 areas in British seas monitored by the Continuous Plankton Recorder survey. We used wavelet methods to disaggregate synchronous fluctuations by timescale and determine that drivers of synchrony include both biotic and abiotic variables. We tested these drivers for statistical significance by comparison with spatially synchronous surrogate data. Identification of causes of synchrony is distinct from, and goes beyond, determining drivers of local population dynamics. We generated timescale-specific models, accounting for 61% of long-timescale (&gt; 4yrs) synchrony in a chlorophyll density index, but only 3% of observed short-timescale (&lt; 4yrs) synchrony. Thus synchrony and its causes are timescale-specific. The dominant source of long-timescale chlorophyll synchrony was closely related to sea surface temperature, through a climatic Moran effect, though likely via complex oceanographic mechanisms. The top-down action of <i>Calanus finmarchicus</i> predation enhances this environmental synchronising mechanism and interacts with it non-additively to produce more long-timescale synchrony than top-down and climatic drivers would produce independently. Our principal result is therefore a demonstration of interaction effects between Moran drivers of synchrony, a new mechanism for synchrony that may influence many ecosystems at large spatial scales.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Yd2a_ZVza5U" width="1" />

<p>by Ruth Nussinov, Hyunbum Jang, Chung-Jung Tsai, Feixiong Cheng</p>

At the root of the so-called precision medicine or precision oncology, which is our focus here, is the hypothesis that cancer treatment would be considerably better if therapies were guided by a tumor’s genomic alterations. This hypothesis has sparked major initiatives focusing on whole-genome and/or exome sequencing, creation of large databases, and developing tools for their statistical analyses—all aspiring to identify actionable alterations, and thus molecular targets, in a patient. At the center of the massive amount of collected sequence data is their interpretations that largely rest on statistical analysis and phenotypic observations. Statistics is vital, because it guides identification of cancer-driving alterations. However, statistics of mutations do not identify a change in protein conformation; therefore, it may not define sufficiently accurate actionable mutations, neglecting those that are rare. Among the many thematic overviews of precision oncology, this review innovates by further comprehensively including precision pharmacology, and within this framework, articulating its protein structural landscape and consequences to cellular signaling pathways. It provides the underlying physicochemical basis, thereby also opening the door to a broader community.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mS1vyPanHNg" width="1" />

<p>by Chad M. Glen, Melissa L. Kemp, Eberhard O. Voit</p>

The complexity of morphogenesis poses a fundamental challenge to understanding the mechanisms governing the formation of biological patterns and structures. Over the past century, numerous processes have been identified as critically contributing to morphogenetic events, but the interplay between the various components and aspects of pattern formation have been much harder to grasp. The combination of traditional biology with mathematical and computational methods has had a profound effect on our current understanding of morphogenesis and led to significant insights and advancements in the field. In particular, the theoretical concepts of reaction–diffusion systems and positional information, proposed by Alan Turing and Lewis Wolpert, respectively, dramatically influenced our general view of morphogenesis, although typically in isolation from one another. In recent years, agent-based modeling has been emerging as a consolidation and implementation of the two theories within a single framework. Agent-based models (ABMs) are unique in their ability to integrate combinations of heterogeneous processes and investigate their respective dynamics, especially in the context of spatial phenomena. In this review, we highlight the benefits and technical challenges associated with ABMs as tools for examining morphogenetic events. These models display unparalleled flexibility for studying various morphogenetic phenomena at multiple levels and have the important advantage of informing future experimental work, including the targeted engineering of tissues and organs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/K4dAt_Ajxt4" width="1" />

<p>by Weiling Li, Lin Lin, Raunaq Malhotra, Lei Yang, Raj Acharya, Mary Poss</p>

Human Endogenous Retrovirus type K (HERV-K) is the only HERV known to be insertionally polymorphic; not all individuals have a retrovirus at a specific genomic location. It is possible that HERV-Ks contribute to human disease because people differ in both number and genomic location of these retroviruses. Indeed viral transcripts, proteins, and antibody against HERV-K are detected in cancers, auto-immune, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, attempts to link a polymorphic HERV-K with any disease have been frustrated in part because population prevalence of HERV-K provirus at each polymorphic site is lacking and it is challenging to identify closely related elements such as HERV-K from short read sequence data. We present an integrated and computationally robust approach that uses whole genome short read data to determine the occupation status at all sites reported to contain a HERV-K provirus. Our method estimates the proportion of fixed length genomic sequence (<i>k-mers</i>) from whole genome sequence data matching a reference set of <i>k-mers</i> unique to each HERV-K locus and applies mixture model-based clustering of these values to account for low depth sequence data. Our analysis of 1000 Genomes Project Data (KGP) reveals numerous differences among the five KGP super-populations in the prevalence of individual and co-occurring HERV-K proviruses; we provide a visualization tool to easily depict the proportion of the KGP populations with any combination of polymorphic HERV-K provirus. Further, because HERV-K is insertionally polymorphic, the genome burden of known polymorphic HERV-K is variable in humans; this burden is lowest in East Asian (EAS) individuals. Our study identifies population-specific sequence variation for HERV-K proviruses at several loci. We expect these resources will advance research on HERV-K contributions to human diseases.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KvZEpjtiJuo" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Predictive coding is a theoretical framework that provides a functional interpretation of top-down and bottom up interactions in sensory processing. The theory suggests there are differences in message passing up vs. down the cortical hierarchy. These differences result from the linear feedforward of prediction errors, and the nonlinear feedback of predictions. This implies that cross-frequency interactions should predominate top-down. But it remains unknown whether these differences are expressed in cross-frequency interactions in the brain. Here we examined bi-directional cross-frequency coupling across four sectors of the auditory hierarchy in the macaque. We computed two measures of cross-frequency coupling, phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) and amplitude-amplitude coupling (AAC). Our findings revealed distinct patterns for bottom-up and top-down information processing among <i>cross</i> -frequency interactions. Both top-down and bottom-up made prominent use of low frequencies: low-to-low frequency (<i>, α, β</i>) and low frequency-to-<i>high </i> couplings were predominant <i>top-down</i>, while low frequency-to-<i>low </i> couplings were predominant <i>bottom-up</i>. These patterns were largely preserved across coupling types (PAC and AAC) and across stimulus types (natural and synthetic auditory stimuli), suggesting they are a general feature of information processing in auditory cortex. Our findings suggest the modulatory effect of low frequencies on <i></i>-rhythms in distant regions is important for bi-directional information transfer. The finding of low frequency-to-<i>low </i> interactions in the bottom-up direction suggest non-linearities may also play a role in feedforward message passing. Altogether, the patterns of cross-frequency interaction we observed across the auditory hierarchy are largely consistent with the predictive coding framework.</p><p><b>Significance</b> The brain consists of highly interconnected cortical areas, yet the patterns in directional cortical communication are not fully understood, in particular with regards to interactions between different signal components across frequencies. We employed a novel, convenient and computationally advantageous Granger-causal framework to examine bi-directional cross-frequency interactions across four sectors of the auditory cortical hierarchy in macaques. Our findings reveal cross-frequency interactions are predominant in the top-down direction, with important implications for theories of information processing in the brain such as predictive coding. Our findings thereby extend the view of cross-frequency interactions in auditory cortex, suggesting they also play a prominent role in top-down processing.</p>

Abstract<p>Src is highly expressed in CNS neurons and contributes not only to developmental proliferation and differentiation but also to high-order brain functions, such as those contributing to alcohol consumption. Src knockout mice exhibit no CNS abnormalities, presumably due to compensation by other Src family kinases (SFKs), but have a shortened lifespan and osteopetrosis-associated defects, impeding investigations of the role of Src on behavior in adult mice. However, the Unique domain of Src differs from those in other SFKs and is phosphorylated by Cdk1 and Cdk5 at Ser75, which influences its postmitotic function in neurons. Therefore, ethanol consumption in mice harboring nonphosphorylatable (Ser75Ala) or phosphomimetic (Ser75Asp) Src mutants was investigated. Mice harboring the Ser75Ala Src mutant, but not the Ser75Asp mutant, had a higher preference for and consumption of solutions containing 5% and 10% ethanol than wild-type mice. However, plasma ethanol concentrations and sensitivities to the sedative effects of ethanol were not different among the groups. In mice harboring the Ser75Ala Src mutant, the activity of Rho-associated kinase in the striatum was significantly lower and Akt Ser473 phosphorylation was significantly higher than in wild-type mice. These results suggest that Src regulates voluntary ethanol drinking in a manner that depends on Ser75 phosphorylation.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Although Src family kinases (SFKs) contribute to behavioral responses to alcohol, only the role of Fyn has been investigated to date. As Src knockout mice do not exhibit CNS abnormalities, presumably because the knockout is compensated by other SFKs, but have shortened lifespans and osteopetrosis-associated defects, the influence of Src activity on ethanol preference and consumption was investigated in mice harboring nonphosphorylatable (Ser75Ala) or phosphomimetic (Ser75Asp) Src mutants. Mice harboring the Ser75Ala mutant, but not the Ser75Asp mutant, consumed more ethanol than wild-type counterparts and showed lower Rho-associated kinase activity but greater Akt phosphorylation in the striatum. These findings implicate Src activity in the regulation of ethanol consumption.</p>

Abstract<p>Hierarchical predictive coding is an influential model of cortical organization, in which sequential hierarchical levels are connected by backward connections carrying predictions, as well as forward connections carrying prediction errors. To date, however, predictive coding models have largely neglected to take into account that neural transmission itself takes time. For a time-varying stimulus, such as a moving object, this means that backward predictions become misaligned with new sensory input. We present an extended model implementing both forward and backward extrapolation mechanisms that realigns backward predictions to minimize prediction error. This realignment has the consequence that neural representations across all hierarchical levels become aligned in real-time. Using visual motion as an example, we show that the model is neurally plausible, that it is consistent with evidence of extrapolation mechanisms throughout the visual hierarchy, that it predicts several known motion-position illusions in human observers, and that it provides a solution to the temporal binding problem.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Despite the enormous scientific interest in predictive coding as model of cortical processing, most models of predictive coding do not take into account that neural processing itself takes time. We show that when the framework is extended to allow for neural delays, a model emerges that provides a natural, parsimonious explanation for a wide range of experimental findings. It is consistent with neurophysiological data from animals, predicts a range of well-known visual illusions in humans, and provides a principled solution to the temporal binding problem. Altogether, it explains how predictive coding mechanisms cause different brain areas to align in time despite their different delays, and in so doing explains how cortical hierarchies functions in real-time.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>Genome editing techniques have facilitated significant advances in our understanding of fundamental biological processes, and the Cre-Lox system has been instrumental in these achievements. Driving Cre expression specifically in injured neurons has not been previously possible: we sought to address this limitation in mice using a Cre-ERT2 construct driven by a reliable indicator of axotomy, Activating Transcription Factor 3 (ATF3). When crossed with reporter mice, a significant amount of recombination was achieved (without tamoxifen treatment) in peripherally-projecting sensory, sympathetic, and motoneurons after peripheral nerve crush in hemizygotes (65-80% by 16 days) and was absent in uninjured neurons. Importantly, injury-induced recombination did not occur in Schwann cells distal to the injury, and with a knockout-validated antibody we verified an absence of ATF3 expression. Functional recovery following sciatic nerve crush in ATF3-deficient mice (both hemi- and homozygotes) was delayed, indicating previously unreported haploinsufficiency. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we crossed the ATF3-CreERT2 line with a floxed PTEN line and show significantly improved axonal regeneration, as well as more complete recovery of neuromuscular function. We also demonstrate the utility of the ATF3-CreERT2 hemizygous line by characterizing recombination after lateral spinal hemisection (C8/T1), which identified specific populations of ascending spinal cord neurons (including putative spinothalamic and spinocerebellar) and descending supraspinal neurons (rubrospinal, vestibulospinal, reticulospinal and hypothalamic). We anticipate these mice will be valuable in distinguishing axotomized from uninjured neurons of several different classes (e.g. <i>via</i> reporter expression), and in probing the function of any number of genes as they relate to neuronal injury and regeneration.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Understanding reactions to neurotrauma and overcoming obstacles to neural regeneration should benefit from the ability to genetically label or otherwise edit the genome of injured neurons. We sought to achieve this in mice by driving Cre recombinase expression under the control of Activating Transcription Factor (ATF3), which is robustly induced by axotomy in several populations of peripheral and central neurons. When crossed with reporter mice, recombination occurred only in injured neurons following sciatic nerve injury or spinal hemisection. Peripheral nerve injury-induced neuronal PTEN excision also resulted in improved regeneration and more complete functional recovery. These results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of axotomy-induced recombination and represent a new tool for investigating genetic control of injury responses and regeneration.</p>

Abstract
<p>Hilar mossy cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) shape the firing and function of the hippocampal circuit. However, the neural circuitry providing afferent input to mossy cells is incompletely understood, and little is known about the development of these inputs. Thus, we used whole-cell recording and laser scanning photostimulation (LSPS) to characterize the developmental trajectory of local excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to mossy cells in the mouse hippocampus. Hilar mossy cells were targeted by visualizing non-red fluorescent cells in the dentate hilus of GAD2-Cre; Ai9 mice that expressed tdTomato in GAD+ neurons, and were confirmed by post hoc morphological characterization. Our results show that at postnatal day (P)6–P7, mossy cells received more excitatory input from neurons in the proximal CA3 versus those in the DG. In contrast, at P13–P14 and P21–P28, the largest source of excitatory input originated in DG cells, while the strength of CA3 and hilar inputs declined. A developmental trend was also evident for inhibitory inputs. Overall inhibitory input at P6–P7 was weak, while inhibitory inputs from the DG cell layer and the hilus predominated at P13–P14 and P21–P28. The strength of local DG excitation and inhibition to mossy cells peaked at P13–P14 and decreased slightly in older P21–P28 mice. Together, these data provide new detailed information on the development of local synaptic connectivity of mossy cells, and suggests mechanisms through which developmental changes in local circuit inputs to hilar mossy cells shape their physiology and vulnerability to injury during postnatal periods.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25465?af=R">Divergent patterns of TDP‐43 and tau pathologies in primary progressive aphasia</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To measure postmortem burden of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TDP‐43 (FTLD‐TDP) or tau (FTLD‐Tau) proteinopathy across hemispheres in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) using digital histopathology and to identify clinicopathological correlates of these distinct proteinopathies.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In an autopsy cohort of PPA (FTLD‐TDP = 13, FTLD‐Tau = 14), we analyzed laterality and regional distribution of postmortem pathology, quantified using a validated digital histopathological approach, in available brain tissue from up to 8 cortical regions bilaterally. We related digital pathology to antemortem structural neuroimaging and specific clinical language features.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Postmortem cortical pathology was left‐lateralized in both FTLD‐TDP (beta = −0.15, standard error [SE] = 0.05, <i>p</i> = 0.007) and FTLD‐Tau (beta = −0.09, SE = 0.04, <i>p</i> = 0.015), but the degree of lateralization decreased with greater overall dementia severity before death (beta = −8.18, SE = 3.22, <i>p</i> = 0.015). Among 5 core pathology regions sampled, we found greatest pathology in left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in FTLD‐TDP, which was greater than in FTLD‐Tau (<i>F</i> = 47.07, <i>df</i> = 1,17, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and in left midfrontal cortex (MFC) in FTLD‐Tau, which was greater than in FTLD‐TDP (<i>F</i> = 19.34, <i>df</i> = 1,16, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Postmortem pathology was inversely associated with antemortem magnetic resonance imaging cortical thickness (beta = −0.04, SE = 0.01, <i>p</i> = 0.007) in regions matching autopsy sampling. Irrespective of PPA syndromic variant, single‐word comprehension impairment was associated with greater left OFC pathology (<i>t</i> = −3.72, <i>df</i> = 10.72, <i>p</i> = 0.004) and nonfluent speech with greater left MFC pathology (<i>t</i> = −3.62, <i>df</i> = 12.00, <i>p</i> = 0.004) among the 5 core pathology regions.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In PPA, FTLD‐TDP and FTLD‐Tau have divergent anatomic distributions of left‐lateralized postmortem pathology that relate to antemortem structural imaging and distinct language deficits. Although other brain regions may be implicated in neural networks supporting these complex language measures, our observations may eventually help to improve antemortem diagnosis of neuropathology in PPA.

<p>In this paper, we aimed at reviewing several different approaches present
today in the search for more accurate diagnostic and treatment management in
mental healthcare. Our focus is on mood disorders, and in particular on the
major depressive disorder (MDD). We are reviewing and discussing findings based
on neuroimaging studies (MRI and fMRI) first to get the impression of the body
of knowledge about the anatomical and functional differences in depression.
Then, we are focusing on less expensive data-driven approach, applicable for
everyday clinical practice, in particular, those based on
electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. Among those studies utilizing EEG, we
are discussing a group of applications used for detecting of depression based
on the resting state EEG (detection studies) and interventional studies (using
stimulus in their protocols or aiming to predict the outcome of therapy). We
conclude with a discussion and review of guidelines to improve the reliability
of developed models that could serve improvement of diagnostic of depression in
psychiatry.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Evidence suggests that age differences in associative memory are attenuated for associations that are consistent with prior knowledge. Such knowledge structures have traditionally been associated with the default network (DN), which also shows reduced modulation with age. In the present study, we investigated whether DN activity and connectivity patterns could account for this age-related effect. Younger and older adults underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging as they learned realistic and unrealistic prices of common grocery items. Both groups showed greater activity in the DN during the encoding of realistic, relative to unrealistic, prices. Moreover, DN activity at encoding and retrieval and its connectivity with an attention control network at encoding were associated with enhanced memory for realistic prices. Finally, older adults showed overactivation of control regions during retrieval of realistic prices relative to younger adults. Our findings suggest that DN activity and connectivity patterns (traditionally viewed as indicators of cognitive failure with age), and additional recruitment of control regions, might underlie older adults’ enhanced memory for meaningful associations.</span>

<p>by Lei Wang, Zhu-Hong You, Xing Chen, Yang-Ming Li, Ya-Nan Dong, Li-Ping Li, Kai Zheng</p>

Emerging evidence has shown microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in human disease research. Identifying potential association among them is significant for the development of pathology, diagnose and therapy. However, only a tiny portion of all miRNA-disease pairs in the current datasets are experimentally validated. This prompts the development of high-precision computational methods to predict real interaction pairs. In this paper, we propose a new model of Logistic Model Tree for predicting miRNA-Disease Association (LMTRDA) by fusing multi-source information including miRNA sequences, miRNA functional similarity, disease semantic similarity, and known miRNA-disease associations. In particular, we introduce miRNA sequence information and extract its features using natural language processing technique for the first time in the miRNA-disease prediction model. In the cross-validation experiment, LMTRDA obtained 90.51% prediction accuracy with 92.55% sensitivity at the AUC of 90.54% on the HMDD V3.0 dataset. To further evaluate the performance of LMTRDA, we compared it with different classifier and feature descriptor models. In addition, we also validate the predictive ability of LMTRDA in human diseases including Breast Neoplasms, Breast Neoplasms and Lymphoma. As a result, 28, 27 and 26 out of the top 30 miRNAs associated with these diseases were verified by experiments in different kinds of case studies. These experimental results demonstrate that LMTRDA is a reliable model for predicting the association among miRNAs and diseases.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uk6W5kII4WE" width="1" />

Combining structural proteomics experimental data with computational methods is a powerful tool for protein structure prediction. Here, we apply a recently-developed approach for <i>de novo</i> protein structure determination based on the incorporation of short-distance crosslinking data as constraints in discrete molecular dynamics simulations (CL-DMD) for the determination of conformational ensemble of the intrinsically disordered protein α-synuclein in the solution. The predicted structures were in agreement with hydrogen-deuterium exchange, circular dichroism, surface modification, and long-distance crosslinking data. We found that α-synuclein is present in solution as an ensemble of rather compact globular conformations with distinct topology and inter-residue contacts, which is well-represented by movements of the large loops and formation of few transient secondary structure elements. Non-amyloid component and C-terminal regions were consistently found to contain β-structure elements and hairpins.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jeUZw_xosck" width="1" />

Artificial Intelligence is exponentially increasing its impact on healthcare. As deep learning is mastering computer vision tasks, its application to digital pathology is natural, with the promise of aiding in routine reporting and standardizing results across trials. Deep learning features inferred from digital pathology scans can improve validity and robustness of current clinico-pathological features, up to identifying novel histological patterns, <i>e.g</i>., from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. In this study, we examine the issue of evaluating accuracy of predictive models from deep learning features in digital pathology, as an hallmark of reproducibility. We introduce the DAPPER framework for validation based on a rigorous Data Analysis Plan derived from the FDA’s MAQC project, designed to analyze causes of variability in predictive biomarkers. We apply the framework on models that identify tissue of origin on 787 Whole Slide Images from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We test three different deep learning architectures (VGG, ResNet, Inception) as feature extractors and three classifiers (a fully connected multilayer, Support Vector Machine and Random Forests) and work with four datasets (5, 10, 20 or 30 classes), for a total of 53, 000 tiles at 512 × 512 resolution. We analyze accuracy and feature stability of the machine learning classifiers, also demonstrating the need for diagnostic tests (<i>e.g</i>., random labels) to identify selection bias and risks for reproducibility. Further, we use the deep features from the VGG model from GTEx on the KIMIA24 dataset for identification of slide of origin (24 classes) to train a classifier on 1, 060 annotated tiles and validated on 265 unseen ones. The DAPPER software, including its deep learning pipeline and the Histological Imaging—Newsy Tiles (HINT) benchmark dataset derived from GTEx, is released as a basis for standardization and validation initiatives in AI for digital pathology.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cFNBmsecX-4" width="1" />

<p>Impulsive personality traits are complex heritable traits that are governed by frontal-subcortical circuits and are associated with numerous neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly drug abuse and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In collaboration with the genetics company 23andMe, we performed 10 genome-wide association studies on measures of impulsive personality traits [the short version of the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale, and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11)] and drug experimentation (the number of drug classes an individual had tried in their lifetime) in up to 22,861 male and female adult human research participants of European ancestry. Impulsive personality traits and drug experimentation showed single nucleotide polymorphism heritabilities that ranged from 5 to 11%. Genetic variants in the <i>CADM2</i> locus were significantly associated with UPPS-P Sensation Seeking (<i>p</i> = 8.3 <font face="arial,helvetica">x</font> 10<sup>–9</sup>, rs139528938) and showed a suggestive association with Drug Experimentation (<i>p</i> = 3.0 <font face="arial,helvetica">x</font> 10<sup>–7</sup>, rs2163971; <i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.68 with rs139528938). Furthermore, genetic variants in the <i>CACNA1I</i> locus were significantly associated with UPPS-P Negative Urgency (<i>p</i> = 3.8 <font face="arial,helvetica">x</font> 10<sup>–8</sup>; rs199694726). The role of these genes was supported by single variant, gene- and transcriptome-based analyses. Multiple subscales from both UPPS-P and BIS showed strong genetic correlations (&gt;0.5) with Drug Experimentation and other substance use traits measured in independent cohorts, including smoking initiation, and lifetime cannabis use. Several UPPS-P and BIS subscales were genetically correlated with ADHD (<i>r</i><sub>g</sub> = 0.30–0.51), supporting their validity as endophenotypes. Our findings demonstrate a role for common genetic contributions to individual differences in impulsivity. Furthermore, our study is the first to provide a genetic dissection of the relationship between different types of impulsive personality traits and various psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Impulsive personality traits (IPTs) are heritable traits that are governed by frontal-subcortical circuits and are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly substance use disorders. We have performed genome-wide association studies of IPTs to identify regions and genes that account for this heritable variation. IPTs and drug experimentation were modestly heritable (5–11%). We identified an association between single nucleotide polymorphisms in <i>CADM2</i> and both sensation seeking and drug experimentation; and between variants in <i>CACNA1I</i> and negative urgency. The role of these genes was supported by single variant, gene- and transcriptome-based analyses. This study provides evidence that impulsivity can be genetically separated into distinct components. We showed that IPT are genetically associated with substance use and ADHD, suggesting impulsivity is an endophenotype contributing to these psychiatric conditions.</p>

<p>Maternal immune activation (MIA) is a principal environmental risk factor contributing to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which compromises fetal brain development at critical periods of pregnancy and might be causally linked to ASD symptoms. We report that endogenous activation of the purinergic ion channel P2X7 (P2rx7) is necessary and sufficient to transduce MIA to autistic phenotype in male offspring. MIA induced by poly(I:C) injections to P2rx7 WT mouse dams elicited an autism-like phenotype in their offspring, and these alterations were not observed in P2rx7-deficient mice, or following maternal treatment with a specific P2rx7 antagonist, JNJ47965567. Genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of maternal P2rx7s also counteracted the induction of IL-6 in the maternal plasma and fetal brain, and disrupted brain development, whereas postnatal P2rx7 inhibition alleviated behavioral and morphological alterations in the offspring. Administration of ATP to P2rx7 WT dams also evoked autistic phenotype, but not in KO dams, implying that P2rx7 activation by ATP is sufficient to induce autism-like features in offspring. Our results point to maternal and offspring P2rx7s as potential therapeutic targets for the early prevention and treatment of ASD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorder caused by genetic and environmental factors. Recent studies highlighted the importance of perinatal risks, in particular, maternal immune activation (MIA), showing strong association with the later emergence of ASD in the affected children. MIA could be mimicked in animal models via injection of a nonpathogenic agent poly(I:C) during pregnancy. This is the first report showing the key role of a ligand gated ion channel, the purinergic P2X7 receptor in MIA-induced autism-like behavioral and biochemical features. We show that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of both maternal and offspring P2X7 receptors could reverse the compromised brain development and autistic phenotype pointing to new possibilities for prevention and treatment of ASD.</p>

<p>Hippocampal place cells show position-specific activity thought to reflect a self-localization signal. Several reports also point to some form of goal encoding by place cells. We investigated this by asking whether they also encode the value of spatial goals, which is crucial information for optimizing goal-directed navigation. We used a continuous place navigation task in which male rats navigate to one of two (freely chosen) unmarked locations and wait, triggering the release of reward, which is then located and consumed elsewhere. This allows sampling of place fields and dissociates spatial goal from reward consumption. The two goals varied in the amount of reward provided, allowing assessment of whether the rats factored goal value into their navigational choice and of possible neural correlates of this value. Rats successfully learned the task, indicating goal localization, and they preferred higher-value goals, indicating processing of goal value. Replicating previous findings, there was goal-related activity in the out-of-field firing of CA1 place cells, with a ramping-up of firing rate during the waiting period, but no general overrepresentation of goals by place fields, an observation that we extended to CA3 place cells. Importantly, place cells were not modulated by goal value. This suggests that dorsal hippocampal place cells encode space independently of its associated value despite the effect of that value on spatial behavior. Our findings are consistent with a model of place cells in which they provide a spontaneously constructed value-free spatial representation rather than encoding other navigationally relevant but nonspatial information.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We investigated whether hippocampal place cells, which compute a self-localization signal, also encode the relative value of places, which is essential information for optimal navigation. When choosing between two spatial goals of different value, rats preferred the higher-value goal. We saw out-of-field goal firing in place cells, replicating previous observations that the cells are influenced by the goal, but their activity was not modulated by the value of these goals. Our results suggest that place cells do not encode all of the navigationally relevant aspects of a place, but instead form a value-free "map" that links to such aspects in other parts of the brain.</p>

<p>The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) features close anatomical and functional relationships with the prefrontal cortex. However, the necessity of the PPC in executive functions has been questioned. The present study used the stop-signal task to examine response inhibition, an executive function that inhibits prepotent response tendency. The brain activity and resting-state functional connectivity were measured to analyze a parcellation-based network that was aimed at identifying a candidate PPC region essential for response inhibition in humans. The intraparietal sulcus (IPS) was activated during response inhibition and connected with the inferior frontal cortex and the presupplementary motor area, the two frontal regions known to be necessary for response inhibition. Next, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to test the essential role of the IPS region for response inhibition. TMS over the IPS region prolonged the stop-signal reaction time (SSRT), the standard behavioral index used to evaluate stopping performance, when stimulation was applied 30–0 ms before stopping. On the contrary, stimulation over the temporoparietal junction region, an area activated during response inhibition but lacking connectivity with the two frontal regions, did not show changes in SSRT. These results indicate that the IPS identified using the parcellation-based network plays an essential role in executive functions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Based on the previous neuropsychological studies reporting no impairment in executive functions after lesions in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), the necessity of PPC in executive functions has been questioned. Here, contrary to the long-lasting view, by using recently developed analysis in functional MRI ("parcellation-based network analysis"), we identified the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) region in the PPC as essential for response inhibition: one executive function to stop actions that are inaccurate in a given context. The necessity of IPS for response inhibition was further tested by an interventional technique of transcranial magnetic stimulation. Stimulation to the IPS disrupted the performance of stopping. Our findings suggest that the IPS plays essential roles in executive functions.</p>

<p>Growing evidence from Alzheimer disease supports a potentially beneficial role of slow‐wave sleep in neurodegeneration. However, the importance of slow‐wave sleep in Parkinson disease is unknown. In 129 patients with Parkinson disease, we retrospectively tested whether sleep slow waves, objectively quantified with polysomnography, relate to longitudinal changes in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores. We found that higher accumulated power of sleep slow waves was associated with slower motor progression, particularly of axial motor symptoms, over a mean time of 4.6 ± 2.3 years. This preliminary finding suggests that deeper sleep relates to slower motor progression in Parkinson disease. Ann Neurol 2019</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25455?af=R">Neuronal apolipoprotein E4 increases cell death and phosphorylated tau release in alzheimer disease</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The apolipoprotein E (<i>APOE</i>) E4 isoform is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD). Although <i>APOE</i> is predominantly expressed by astrocytes in the central nervous system, neuronal expression of <i>APOE</i> is of increasing interest in age‐related cognitive impairment, neurological injury, and neurodegeneration. Here, we show that endogenous expression of E4 in stem‐cell–derived neurons predisposes them to injury and promotes the release of phosphorylated tau.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Induced pluripotent stem cells from 2 unrelated AD patients carrying the E4 allele were corrected to the E3/E3 genotype with the CRISPR/Cas9 system and differentiated into pure cultures of forebrain excitatory neurons without contamination from other cells types.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to unedited E4 neurons, E3 neurons were less susceptible to ionomycin‐induced cytotoxicity. Biochemically, E4 cells exhibited increased tau phosphorylation and ERK1/2 phosphoactivation. Moreover, E4 neurons released increased amounts of phosphorylated tau extracellularly in an isoform‐dependent manner by a heparin sulfate proteoglycan–dependent mechanism.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results demonstrate that endogenous expression of E4 by stem‐cell–derived forebrain excitatory neurons predisposes neurons to calcium dysregulation and ultimately cell death. This change is associated with increased cellular tau phosphorylation and markedly enhanced release of phosphorylated tau. Importantly, these effects are independent of glial APOE. These findings suggest that E4 accelerates spreading of tau pathology and neuron death in part by neuron‐specific, glia‐independent mechanisms. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Currently, the exact reasons why different α‐synucleinopathies exhibit variable pathologies and phenotypes are still unknown. A potential explanation may be the existence of distinctive α‐synuclein conformers or strains. Here, we intend to analyze the seeding activity of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease (PD) brain‐derived α‐synuclein seeds by real‐time quaking‐induced conversion (RT‐QuIC) and to investigate the structure and morphology of the α‐synuclein aggregates generated by RT‐QuIC.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A misfolded α‐synuclein–enriched brain fraction from frontal cortex and substantia nigra pars compacta tissue, isolated by several filtration and centrifugation steps, was subjected to α‐synuclein/RT‐QuIC analysis. Our study included neuropathologically well‐characterized cases with DLB, PD, and controls (Ctrl). Biochemical and morphological analyses of RT‐QuIC products were conducted by western blot, dot blot analysis, Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Independently from the brain region, we observed different seeding kinetics of α‐synuclein in the RT‐QuIC in patients with DLB compared to PD and Ctrl. Biochemical characterization of the RT‐QuIC product indicated the generation of a proteinase K–resistant and fibrillary α‐synuclein species in DLB‐seeded reactions, whereas PD and control seeds failed in the conversion of wild‐type α‐synuclein substrate.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Structural variances of α‐synuclein seeding kinetics and products in DLB and PD indicated, for the first time, the existence of different α‐synuclein strains in these groups. Therefore, our study contributes to a better understanding of the clinical heterogeneity among α‐synucleinopathies, offers an opportunity for a specific diagnosis, and opens new avenues for the future development of strain‐specific therapies.

<p>The present literature about possible mechanisms behind the effectivity of
noninvasive electromagnetic stimulation in major depressive disorder (MDD) is
not very rich. Despite extensive research in applications for clinical
practice, the exact effects are yet not clear. We are comparing our previous
results about the complexity changes induced by repetitive Transcranial
Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
which are known to modulate neural dynamics. Also, we are reviewing different
biomarkers of complexity changes connected to depression, and how they change
with the stimulation. TDCS is low-intensity TES, known to have polarity
specific effects (neuromodulatory effects), and rTMS is inducing an electric
field in the tissue circumstantially via Faraday's law. Both nonlinear
modalities of electromagnetic stimulation may affect the levels of
physiological complexity in the brain. We also compare the changes of
complexity in electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG), as
potential future predictors of therapy outcome.

<p>I provide numerical evidence for the robustness of the Griffiths phase (GP)
reported previously in dynamical threshold model simulations on a large human
brain network with N=836733 connected nodes. The model, with equalized network
sensitivity, is extended in two ways: introduction of refractory states or by
randomized time dependent thresholds. The non-universal power-law dynamics in
an extended control parameter region survives these modifications for a short
refractory state and weak disorder. In case of temporal disorder the GP shrinks
and for stronger heterogeneity disappears, leaving behind a mean-field type of
critical transition. Activity avalanche size distributions below the critical
point decay faster than in the original model, but the addition of inhibitory
interactions sets it back to the range of experimental values.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10446">The functional role of cue-driven feature-based feedback in object recognition. (arXiv:1903.10446v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Visual object recognition is not a trivial task, especially when the objects
are degraded or surrounded by clutter or presented briefly. External cues (such
as verbal cues or visual context) can boost recognition performance in such
conditions. In this work, we build an artificial neural network to model the
interaction between the object processing stream (OPS) and the cue. We study
the effects of varying neural and representational capacities of the OPS on the
performance boost provided by cue-driven feature-based feedback in the OPS. We
observe that the feedback provides performance boosts only if the
category-specific features about the objects cannot be fully represented in the
OPS. This representational limit is more dependent on task demands than neural
capacity. We also observe that the feedback scheme trained to maximise
recognition performance boost is not the same as tuning-based feedback, and
actually performs better than tuning-based feedback.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10425">Comparative study of training intensity in neurofeedback. (arXiv:1903.10425v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Neurofeedback has proved to be useful in many instances. This technique is
often used to address both medical issues and performance improvement. Despite
the wide range of applications, no consensus has been reached about the optimal
training schedule.
</p>
<p>In this work, a practical experiment was conducted aiming to compare the
effects of intensive and sparse training modalities of enhancement of the
individual upper alpha band at Fz, for working memory improvement, in 19
healthy subjects. The INTENSIVE group was submitted to 4 sessions of 37.5
minutes each, during consecutive days, while the SPARSE group performed 15
sessions of 25 minutes along approximately 2 months.
</p>
<p>The intensive modality proved to be significantly more effective in
increasing the target frequency at Fz within session. However, no significant
differences were found across sessions neither regarding cognitive
improvements. The distinction between learners and non-learners led to
significant results for the two groups across sessions, but only the learners
of the INTENSIVE group show significant changes within session. Besides, for
this subsample the effects in the INTENSIVE group are significantly stronger
both within and across sessions.
</p>
<p>The results suggest that longer sessions with shorter trials and more breaks
could be advantageous when training healthy subjects. Although further
investigation is needed to establish if one modality outperforms the other,
better outcomes might be obtained if each session consists in many short trials
(in this case 30 seconds) and is performed on consecutive days.

<p>Human brains are arguably the most complex entities known. Composed of
billions of neurons, connected via a highly detailed structure where the
underlying method by which functionality occurs is still debated. Here we
consider one theory for neural coding, synchronization coding, which gives rise
to the highest possible number of discrete states that a brain could exist in.
A strict upper bound on the number of these states is determined. We conclude
that the theoretical upper limit on the capacity of one human brain is almost
inconceivably large and massively larger than the corresponding theoretical
limit that could be obtained using every transistor ever built.

The dynamics of CNS function rely upon omnidirectional communication among CNS cell types. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as key mediators of this communication and are actively involved in response to CNS injury, mediating inflammatory response and inflammation-related neuroprotection as they display dual beneficial and detrimental roles. Neuroimmune interactions include communication between neurons and microglia, the resident macrophages within the CNS, and these interactions are a critical mediator of healthy brain functions, mounting an inflammatory response, and disease pathogenesis.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Recent research indicates the hippocampus may code the distance to the goal during navigation of newly learned environments. It is unclear however, whether this also pertains to highly familiar environments where extensive systems-level consolidation is thought to have transformed mnemonic representations. Here we recorded fMRI while University College London and Imperial College London students navigated virtual simulations of their own familiar campus (&gt;2 years of exposure) and the other campus learned days before scanning. Posterior hippocampal activity tracked the distance to the goal in the newly learned campus, as well as in familiar environments when the future route contained many turns. By contrast retrosplenial cortex only tracked the distance to the goal in the familiar campus. All of these responses were abolished when participants were guided to their goal by external cues. These results open new avenues of research on navigation and consolidation of spatial information and underscore the notion that the hippocampus continues to play a role in navigation when detailed processing of the environment is needed for navigation.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is a central hub for the primate forebrain networks that control skilled manual behavior, including tool use. Here, we quantified and compared the sources of thalamic input to electrophysiologically-identified hand/forearm-related regions of several PPC areas, namely areas 5v, AIP, PFG, and PF, of the capuchin monkey (<span style="font-style: italic;">Sapajus</span> sp). We found that these areas receive most of their thalamic connections from the Anterior Pulvinar (PuA), Lateral Posterior (LP) and Medial Pulvinar (PuM) nuclei. Each PPC area receives a specific combination of projections from these nuclei, and fewer additional projections from other nuclei. Moreover, retrograde labeling of the cells innervating different PPC areas revealed substantial intermingling of these cells within the thalamus. Differences in thalamic input may contribute to the different functional properties displayed by the PPC areas. Furthermore, the observed innervation of functionally-related PPC domains from partly intermingled thalamic cell populations accords with the notion that higher-order thalamic inputs may dynamically regulate functional connectivity between cortical areas.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Fear extinction is generally considered a form of new learning that inhibits previously acquired fear memories. Here, by tracking immediate early gene expression in vivo, we found that contextual fear extinction training evoked distinct neural ensembles in mouse retrosplenial cortex (RSC). The optogenetic reactivation of these extinction-activated neurons in the RSC was sufficient to suppress a fear response, while the reactivation of conditioning-activated neurons in the same area promoted a fear response. The generation of such an extinction-memory-related neural ensemble was associated with adult neurogenesis, as abolishing newborn neurons in the adult hippocampus via X-ray irradiation eliminated both the extinction-activated neurons in the RSC and the optogenetic-reactivation-induced suppression of contextual fear memory. Therefore, switching from fear to no fear in response to the same context is modulated by the RSC through an extinction-activated neural ensemble, the generation of which might require adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>While it is established that humans use model-based (MB) and model-free (MF) reinforcement learning in a complementary fashion, much less is known about how the brain determines which of these systems should control behavior at any given moment. Here we provide causal evidence for a neural mechanism that acts as a context-dependent arbitrator between both systems. We applied excitatory and inhibitory transcranial direct current stimulation over a region of the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex previously found to encode the reliability of both learning systems. The opposing neural interventions resulted in a bidirectional shift of control between MB and MF learning. Stimulation also affected the sensitivity of the arbitration mechanism itself, as it changed how often subjects switched between the dominant system over time. Both of these effects depended on varying task contexts that either favored MB or MF control, indicating that this arbitration mechanism is not context-invariant but flexibly incorporates information about current environmental demands.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Maternal stress during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of psychiatric disorders in offspring, but embryonic brain mechanisms disrupted by prenatal stress are not fully understood. Our lab has shown that prenatal stress delays inhibitory neural progenitor migration. Here, we investigated redox dysregulation as a mechanism for embryonic cortical interneuron migration delay, utilizing direct manipulation of pro- and antioxidants and a mouse model of maternal repetitive restraint stress starting on embryonic day 12. Time-lapse, live-imaging of migrating GAD67GFP+ interneurons showed that normal tangential migration of inhibitory progenitor cells was disrupted by the pro-oxidant, hydrogen peroxide. Interneuron migration was also delayed by in utero intracerebroventricular rotenone. Prenatal stress altered glutathione levels and induced changes in activity of antioxidant enzymes and expression of redox-related genes in the embryonic forebrain. Assessment of dihydroethidium (DHE) fluorescence after prenatal stress in ganglionic eminence (GE), the source of migrating interneurons, showed increased levels of DHE oxidation. Maternal antioxidants (<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span>-acetylcysteine and astaxanthin) normalized DHE oxidation levels in GE and ameliorated the migration delay caused by prenatal stress. Through convergent redox manipula-tions, delayed interneuron migration after prenatal stress was found to critically involve redox dysregulation. Redox biology during prenatal periods may be a target for protecting brain development.</span>

                <h4><a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz047/5382209?rss=1">The Hyperpolarization-Activated HCN4 Channel is Important for Proper Maintenance of Oscillatory Activity in the Thalamocortical System</a></h4>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Hyperpolarization-activated cation channels are involved, among other functions, in learning and memory, control of synaptic transmission and epileptogenesis. The importance of the HCN1 and HCN2 isoforms for brain function has been demonstrated, while the role of HCN4, the third major neuronal HCN subunit, is not known. Here we show that HCN4 is essential for oscillatory activity in the thalamocortical (TC) network. HCN4 is selectively expressed in various thalamic nuclei, excluding the thalamic reticular nucleus. HCN4-deficient TC neurons revealed a massive reduction of <span style="font-style: italic;">Ih</span> and strongly reduced intrinsic burst firing, whereas the current was normal in cortical pyramidal neurons. In addition, evoked bursting in a thalamic slice preparation was strongly reduced in the mutant mice probes. HCN4-deficiency also significantly slowed down thalamic and cortical oscillations during active wakefulness. Taken together, these results establish that thalamic HCN4 channels are essential for the production of rhythmic intrathalamic oscillations and determine regular TC oscillatory activity during alert states.</span>
