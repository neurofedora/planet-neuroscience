              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-608/v2?src=rss">Assembly and quantification of transcripts from noisy long reads with NIFFLR [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Long-read RNA sequencing technologies can produce complete or near-complete transcript sequences. Recently introduced methods for direct RNA and cDNA sequencing can provide a high-throughput strategy for the discovery of novel and rare gene isoforms. However, the high error rates in ONT sequences limit the ability to exactly pinpoint splice site boundaries when aligning reads to the genome. Methods In this paper, we present a novel tool called NIFFLR (Novel IsoForm Finder using Long Reads) that identifies and quantifies both known and novel isoforms using long-read RNA sequencing data. NIFFLR recovers known transcripts and assembles novel transcripts present in the data by aligning exons from a reference annotation to the long reads. Results NIFFLR effectively recovers correct transcripts from simulated reads based on known transcript annotations, achieving higher sensitivity and precision compared to several previously published tools. On real data, NIFFLR shows high accuracy as measured by concordance of isoform counts to the counts computed from Illumina data for the same sample. We applied NIFFLR to a set of 92 GTEx long-read samples and produced transcript counts for both novel and known isoforms. In total, we identified and quantified 119,928 isoforms present in the RefSeq annotation of GRCh38 and 42,868 novel isoforms across 34,383 genes, more than previous studies identified in this dataset. Conclusions NIFFLR is an effective tool aimed at assembly and quantification of transcripts present in the long, high error transcriptome reads. NIFFLR is released under an open-source license (GPL 3.0) and is available on GitHub at https://github.com/alguoo314/NIFFLR/releases, and from BioConda as “nifflr”.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-912/v3?src=rss">Modernizing Commercial Agency Regulations in Saudi Arabia: Legal Reforms and Comparative Insights [version 3; peer review: 2 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study analyzes Saudi Arabia’s 2022–2023 reforms to the Commercial Agency Law through legal, economic, and comparative lenses. The pre-reform regime—marked by rigid nationality limits, procedural burdens, and litigation-prone termination rules—constrained market entry and investor confidence. Methods Using a doctrinal approach to statutes and implementing regulations, triangulated with Saudi judicial practice and policy instruments, we benchmark Saudi reforms against the UAE and UK. A Shariah lens clarifies how gharar (uncertainty), fasakh (rescission), and unjust enrichment (akl al-māl bil-bāṭil) shape agency disputes. Results Key changes include more flexible nationality rules, end-to-end digital registration and renewal, clearer termination/compensation standards, and formal recognition of arbitration (including SCCA). Together these measures enhance contractual predictability and lower compliance frictions, with early indications of improved market transparency and investor sentiment. Conclusions The reforms signal a hybrid model—liberalization aligned with global practice while preserving a Shariah-grounded identity. Remaining priorities include consistent judicial application, practitioner training, clearer guidance, and GCC coordination. We propose thematically grouped policy steps to consolidate gains and support Vision 2030’s diversification agenda.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02032">Characterizing Continuous and Discrete Hybrid Latent Spaces for Structural Connectomes</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.02032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural connectomes are detailed graphs that map how different brain regions are physically connected, offering critical insight into aging, cognition, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, these connectomes are high-dimensional and densely interconnected, which makes them difficult to interpret and analyze at scale. While low-dimensional spaces like PCA and autoencoders are often used to capture major sources of variation, their latent spaces are generally continuous and cannot fully reflect the mixed nature of variability in connectomes, which include both continuous (e.g., connectivity strength) and discrete factors (e.g., imaging site). Motivated by this, we propose a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a hybrid latent space that jointly models the discrete and continuous components. We analyze a large dataset of 5,761 connectomes from six Alzheimer's disease studies with ten acquisition protocols. Each connectome represents a single scan from a unique subject (3579 females, 2182 males), aged 22 to 102, with 4338 cognitively normal, 809 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 614 with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Each connectome contains 121 brain regions defined by the BrainCOLOR atlas. We train our hybrid VAE in an unsupervised way and characterize what each latent component captures. We find that the discrete space is particularly effective at capturing subtle site-related differences, achieving an Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) of 0.65 with site labels, significantly outperforming PCA and a standard VAE followed by clustering (p < 0.05). These results demonstrate that the hybrid latent space can disentangle distinct sources of variability in connectomes in an unsupervised manner, offering potential for large-scale connectome analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02503">Individual-specific precision neuroimaging of learning-related plasticity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.02503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying learning-related plasticity is central to understanding the acquisition of complex skills, for example learning to master a musical instrument. Over the past three decades, conventional group-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have advanced our understanding of how humans' neural representations change during skill acquisition. However, group-based fMRI studies average across heterogeneous learners and often rely on coarse pre- versus post-training comparisons, limiting the spatial and temporal precision with which neural changes can be estimated. Here, we outline an individual-specific precision approach that tracks neural changes within individuals by collecting high-quality neuroimaging data frequently over the course of training, mapping brain function in each person's own anatomical space, and gathering detailed behavioral measures of learning, allowing neural trajectories to be directly linked to individual learning progress. Complementing fMRI with mobile neuroimaging methods, such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), will enable researchers to track plasticity during naturalistic practice and across extended time scales. This multi-modal approach will enhance sensitivity to individual learning trajectories and will offer more nuanced insights into how neural representations change with training. We also discuss how findings can be generalized beyond individuals, including through statistical methods based on replication in additional individuals. Together, this approach allows researchers to design highly informative longitudinal training studies that advance a mechanistic, personalized account of skill learning in the human brain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02671">Translating Measures onto Mechanisms: The Cognitive Relevance of Higher-Order Information</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.02671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order information theory has become a rapidly growing toolkit in computational neuroscience, motivated by the idea that multivariate dependencies can reveal aspects of neural computation and communication that are invisible to pairwise analyses. Yet functional interpretations of synergy and redundancy often outpace principled arguments for how statistical quantities map onto mechanistic cognitive processes. Here we review the main families of higher-order measures with the explicit goal of translating mathematical properties into defensible mechanistic inferences. First, we systematize Shannon-based multivariate metrics and demonstrate that higher-order dependence is parsimoniously characterized by two largely independent axes: interaction strength and redundancy-synergy balance. We argue that balanced layering of synergistic integration and redundant broadcasting optimizes multiscale complexity, formalizing a computation-communication tradeoff. We then examine the partial information decomposition and outline pragmatic considerations for its deployment in neural data. Equipped with the relevant mathematical essentials, we connect redundancy-synergy balance to cognitive function by progressively embedding their mathematical properties in real-world constraints, starting with small synthetic systems before gradually building up to neuroimaging. We close by identifying key future directions for mechanistic insight: cross-scale bridging, intervention-based validation, and thermodynamically grounded unification of information dynamics.

                arXiv:2512.02978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust decoding and classification of brain patterns measured with electroencephalography (EEG) remains a major challenge for real-world (i.e. outside scientific lab and medical facilities) brain-computer interface (BCI) applications due to well documented inter- and intra-participant variability. Here, we present a large-scale benchmark evaluating over 340,000+ unique combinations of spatial and nonlinear EEG classification. Our methodological pipeline consists in combinations of Common Spatial Patterns (CSP), Riemannian geometry, functional connectivity, and fractal- or entropy-based features across three open-access EEG datasets. Unlike prior studies, our analysis operates at the per-participant level and across multiple frequency bands (8-15 Hz and 8-30 Hz), enabling direct assessment of both group-level performance and individual variability. Covariance tangent space projection (cov-tgsp) and CSP consistently achieved the highest average classification accuracies. However, their effectiveness was strongly dataset-dependent, and marked participant-level differences persisted, particularly in the most heterogeneous of the datasets. Importantly, nonlinear methods outperformed spatial approaches for specific individuals, underscoring the need for personalized pipeline selection. Our findings highlight that no universal 'one-size-fits-all' method can optimally decode EEG motor imagery patterns across all users or datasets. Future work will require adaptive, multimodal, and possibly novel approaches to fully address neurophysiological variability in practical BCI applications where the system can automatically adapt to what makes each user unique.

                arXiv:2512.02028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex spatial connectivity patterns, such as interictal suppression and ictal propagation, complicate accurate drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) seizure detection using stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) and traditional machine learning methods. Two critical challenges remain:(1)a low signal-to-noise ratio in functional connectivity estimates, making it difficult to learn seizure-related interactions; and (2)expert labels for spatial pathological connectivity patterns are difficult to obtain, meanwhile lacking the patterns' representation to improve seizure detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel node-graph dual contrastive learning framework, Seizure-NGCLNet, to learn SEEG interictal suppression and ictal propagation patterns for detecting DRE seizures with high precision. First, an adaptive graph augmentation strategy guided by centrality metrics is developed to generate seizure-related brain networks. Second, a dual-contrastive learning approach is integrated, combining global graph-level contrast with local node-graph contrast, to encode both spatial structural and semantic epileptogenic features. Third, the pretrained embeddings are fine-tuned via a top-k localized graph attention network to perform the final classification. Extensive experiments on a large-scale public SEEG dataset from 33 DRE patients demonstrate that Seizure-NGCLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average accuracy of 95.93%, sensitivity of 96.25%, and specificity of 94.12%. Visualizations confirm that the learned embeddings clearly separate ictal from interictal states, reflecting suppression and propagation patterns that correspond to the clinical mechanisms. These results highlight Seizure-NGCLNet's ability to learn interpretable spatial pathological patterns, enhancing both seizure detection and seizure onset zone localization.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02719">Emergent Bayesian Behaviour and Optimal Cue Combination in LLMs</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.02719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at explicit reasoning, but their implicit computational strategies remain underexplored. Decades of psychophysics research show that humans intuitively process and integrate noisy signals using near-optimal Bayesian strategies in perceptual tasks. We ask whether LLMs exhibit similar behaviour and perform optimal multimodal integration without explicit training or instruction. Adopting the psychophysics paradigm, we infer computational principles of LLMs from systematic behavioural studies. We introduce a behavioural benchmark - BayesBench: four magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, and duration) over text and image, inspired by classic psychophysics, and evaluate a diverse set of nine LLMs alongside human judgments for calibration. Through controlled ablations of noise, context, and instruction prompts, we measure performance, behaviour and efficiency in multimodal cue-combination. Beyond accuracy and efficiency metrics, we introduce a Bayesian Consistency Score that detects Bayes-consistent behavioural shifts even when accuracy saturates. Our results show that while capable models often adapt in Bayes-consistent ways, accuracy does not guarantee robustness. Notably, GPT-5 Mini achieves perfect text accuracy but fails to integrate visual cues efficiently. This reveals a critical dissociation between capability and strategy, suggesting accuracy-centric benchmarks may over-index on performance while missing brittle uncertainty handling. These findings reveal emergent principled handling of uncertainty and highlight the correlation between accuracy and Bayesian tendencies. We release our psychophysics benchmark and consistency metric (https://bayes-bench.github.io) as evaluation tools and to inform future multimodal architecture designs.

                arXiv:2403.15176v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of algorithms to accurately decode neural information has long been a research focus in the field of neuroscience. Brain decoding typically involves training machine learning models to map neural data onto a preestablished vector representation of stimulus features. These vectors are usually derived from image- and/or text-based feature spaces. Nonetheless, the intrinsic characteristics of these vectors might fundamentally differ from those that are encoded by the brain, limiting the ability of decoders to accurately learn this mapping. To address this issue, we propose a framework, called brain-aligning of semantic vectors, that fine-tunes pretrained feature vectors to better align with the structure of neural representations of visual stimuli in the brain. We trained this model with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and then performed zero-shot brain decoding on fMRI, magnetoencephalography (MEG), and electrocorticography (ECoG) data. fMRI-based brain-aligned vectors improved decoding performance across all three neuroimaging datasets when accuracy was determined by calculating the correlation coefficients between true and predicted vectors. Additionally, when decoding accuracy was determined via stimulus identification, this accuracy increased in specific category types; improvements varied depending on the original vector space that was used for brain-alignment, and consistent improvements were observed across all neuroimaging modalities.

                arXiv:2505.12653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How do different brains create unique visual experiences from identical sensory input? While neural representations vary across individuals, the fundamental architecture underlying these differences remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal that individual visual experience emerges from a high-dimensional neural geometry across the visual cortical hierarchy. Using spectral decomposition of fMRI responses during naturalistic movie viewing, we find that idiosyncratic neural patterns persist across multiple orders of magnitude of latent dimensions. Remarkably, each dimensional range encodes qualitatively distinct aspects of individual processing, and this multidimensional neural geometry predicts subsequent behavioral differences in memory recall. These fine-grained patterns of inter-individual variability cannot be reduced to those detected by conventional intersubject correlation measures. Our findings demonstrate that subjective visual experience arises from information integrated across an expansive multidimensional manifold. This geometric framework offers a powerful new lens for understanding how diverse brains construct unique perceptual worlds from shared experiences.

Abstract: The primary output of the nervous system is movement and behavior. While recent advances have democratized pose tracking during complex behavior, kinematic trajectories alone provide only indirect access to the underlying control processes. Here we present MIMIC-MJX, a framework for learning biologically-plausible neural control policies from kinematics. MIMIC-MJX models the generative process of motor control by training neural controllers that learn to actuate biomechanically-realistic body models in physics simulation to reproduce real kinematic trajectories. We demonstrate that our implementation is accurate, fast, data-efficient, and generalizable to diverse animal body models. Policies trained with MIMIC-MJX can be utilized to both analyze neural control strategies and simulate behavioral experiments, illustrating its potential as an integrative modeling framework for neuroscience.

Abstract: We investigate a conductance-based neuron model to explore how voltage-gated ion channel isoforms influence action-potential generation. The model combines a six-state Markov representation of NaV channels with a first-order KV3.1 model, allowing us to vary maximal sodium and potassium conductances and compare nine NaV isoforms. Using bifurcation theory and local stability analysis, we map regions of stable limit cycles and visualize excitability landscapes via heatmap-based diagrams. These analyses show that isoforms NaV1.3, NaV1.4 and NaV1.6 support broad excitable regimes, while isoforms NaV1.7 and NaV1.9 exhibit minimal oscillatory behavior. Our findings provide insights into the role of channel heterogeneity in neuronal dynamics and may help to guide the design of synthetic excitable systems by narrowing the parameter space needed for robust action-potential trains.

                arXiv:2412.06740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to image classification inspired by complex nonlinear biological visual processing, whereby classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are equipped with learnable higher-order convolutions. Our model incorporates a Volterra-like expansion of the convolution operator, capturing multiplicative interactions akin to those observed in early and advanced stages of biological visual processing. We evaluated this approach on synthetic datasets by measuring sensitivity to testing higher-order correlations and performance in standard benchmarks (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and Imagenette). Our architecture outperforms traditional CNN baselines, and achieves optimal performance with expansions up to 3rd/4th order, aligning remarkably well with the distribution of pixel intensities in natural images. Through systematic perturbation analysis, we validate this alignment by isolating the contributions of specific image statistics to model performance, demonstrating how different orders of convolution process distinct aspects of visual information. Furthermore, Representational Similarity Analysis reveals distinct geometries across network layers, indicating qualitatively different modes of visual information processing. Our work bridges neuroscience and deep learning, offering a path towards more effective, biologically inspired computer vision models. It provides insights into visual information processing and lays the groundwork for neural networks that better capture complex visual patterns, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios.

                arXiv:2505.22563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding whether large language models (LLMs) and the human brain converge on similar computational principles remains a fundamental and important question in cognitive neuroscience and AI. Do the brain-like patterns observed in LLMs emerge simply from scaling, or do they reflect deeper alignment with the architecture of human language processing? This study focuses on the sentence-level neural mechanisms of language models, systematically investigating how layer-wise representations in LLMs align with the dynamic neural responses during human sentence comprehension. By comparing hierarchical embeddings from 14 publicly available LLMs with fMRI data collected from participants, who were exposed to a naturalistic narrative story, we constructed sentence-level neural prediction models to identify the model layers most significantly correlated with brain region activations. Results show that improvements in model performance drive the evolution of representational architectures toward brain-like hierarchies, particularly achieving stronger functional and anatomical correspondence at higher semantic abstraction levels. These findings advance our understanding of the computational parallels between LLMs and the human brain, highlighting the potential of LLMs as models for human language processing.

Abstract: Recent advances in general-purpose AI systems with attention-based transformers offer a potential window into how the neocortex and cerebellum, despite their relatively uniform circuit architectures, give rise to diverse functions and, ultimately, to human intelligence. This Perspective provides a cross-domain comparison between the brain and AI that goes beyond the traditional focus on visual processing, adopting the emerging perspecive of world-model-based computation. Here, we identify shared computational mechanisms in the attention-based neocortex and the non-attentional cerebellum: both predict future world events from past inputs and construct internal world models through prediction-error learning. These predictive world models are repurposed for seemingly distinct functions--understanding in sensory processing and generation in motor processing-- enabling the brain to achieve multi-domain capabilities and human-like adaptive intelligence. Notably, attention-based AI has independently converged on a similar learning paradigm and world-model-based computation. We conclude that these shared mechanisms in both biological and artificial systems constitute a core computational foundation for realizing diverse functions including high-level intelligence, despite their relatively uniform circuit structures. Our theoretical insights bridge neuroscience and AI, advancing our understanding of the computational essence of intelligence.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a new neural network model based on attribute-specific representations (e.g., color, shape, size), a classic example of associative memory. The proposed model is based on a previous study on memory and recall of multiple images using the Cue Ball and Recall Net (referred to as the CB-RN system, or simply CB-RN) [1]. The system consists of three components, which are C.CB-RN for processing color, S.CB-RN for processing shape, and V.CB-RN for processing size. When an attribute data pattern is presented to the CB-RN system, the corresponding attribute pattern of the cue neurons within the Cue Balls is associatively recalled in the Recall Net. Each image pattern presented to these CB-RN systems is represented using a two-dimensional code, specifically a QR code [2].

                arXiv:2512.02459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eye-based emotion recognition enables eyewear devices to perceive users' emotional states and support emotion-aware interaction, yet deploying such functionality on their resource-limited embedded hardware remains challenging. Time-to-first-spike (TTFS)-coded spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising solution, as each neuron emits at most one binary spike, resulting in extremely sparse and energy-efficient computation. While prior works have primarily focused on improving TTFS SNN training algorithms, the impact of network architecture has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we propose TNAS-ER, the first neural architecture search (NAS) framework tailored to TTFS SNNs for eye-based emotion recognition. TNAS-ER presents a novel ANN-assisted search strategy that leverages a ReLU-based ANN counterpart sharing an identity mapping with the TTFS SNN to guide architecture optimization. TNAS-ER employs an evolutionary algorithm, with weighted and unweighted average recall jointly defined as fitness objectives for emotion recognition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TNAS-ER achieves high recognition performance with significantly improved efficiency. Furthermore, when deployed on neuromorphic hardware, TNAS-ER attains a low latency of 48 ms and an energy consumption of 0.05 J, confirming its superior energy efficiency and strong potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Abusive speech on social media poses a persistent and evolving challenge, driven by the continuous emergence of novel slang and obfuscated terms designed to circumvent detection systems. In this work, we present a data efficient strategy for fine tuning BERT on hate speech classification by significantly reducing training set size without compromising performance. Our approach employs a TF IDF-based sample selection mechanism to retain only the most informative 75 percent of examples, thereby minimizing training overhead. To address the limitations of BERT's native vocabulary in capturing evolving hate speech terminology, we augment the tokenizer with domain-specific slang and lexical variants commonly found in abusive contexts. Experimental results on a widely used hate speech dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while improving computational efficiency, highlighting its potential for scalable and adaptive abusive content moderation.

                arXiv:2512.02783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital sound synthesis presents the opportunity to explore vast parameter spaces containing millions of configurations. Quality diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithms offer a promising approach to harness this potential, yet their success hinges on appropriate sonic feature representations. Existing QD methods predominantly employ handcrafted descriptors or supervised classifiers, potentially introducing unintended exploration biases and constraining discovery to familiar sonic regions. This work investigates unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods for automatically defining and dynamically reconfiguring sonic behaviour spaces during QD search. We apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and autoencoders to project high-dimensional audio features onto structured grids for MAP-Elites, implementing dynamic reconfiguration through model retraining at regular intervals. Comparison across two experimental scenarios shows that automatic approaches achieve significantly greater diversity than handcrafted behaviour spaces while avoiding expert-imposed biases. Dynamic behaviour-space reconfiguration maintains evolutionary pressure and prevents stagnation, with PCA proving most effective among the dimensionality reduction techniques. These results contribute to automated sonic discovery systems capable of exploring vast parameter spaces without manual intervention or supervised training constraints.

Specifically, this paper uses gradient-based training to learn iterative update rules that transform input grids into their outputs from the training examples and apply them to the test inputs. Results suggest that gradient-trained NCA models are a promising and efficient approach to a range of abstract grid-based tasks from ARC. Along with discussing the impacts of various design modifications and training constraints, this work examines the behavior and properties of NCAs applied to ARC to give insights for broader applications of self-organizing systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14270">APTx Neuron: A Unified Trainable Neuron Architecture Integrating Activation and Computation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.14270v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the APTx Neuron, a novel, unified neural computation unit that integrates non-linear activation and linear transformation into a single trainable expression. The APTx Neuron is derived from the APTx activation function, thereby eliminating the need for separate activation layers and making the architecture both optimization-efficient and elegant. The proposed neuron follows the functional form $y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} ((\alpha_i + \tanh(\beta_i x_i)) \cdot \gamma_i x_i) + \delta$, where all parameters $\alpha_i$, $\beta_i$, $\gamma_i$, and $\delta$ are trainable. We validate our APTx Neuron-based architecture on the MNIST dataset, achieving up to $96.69\%$ test accuracy within 11 epochs using approximately 332K trainable parameters. The results highlight the superior expressiveness and training efficiency of the APTx Neuron compared to traditional neurons, pointing toward a new paradigm in unified neuron design and the architectures built upon it.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17498">Mechanisms of Symbol Processing for In-Context Learning in Transformer Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.17498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive abilities in symbol processing through in-context learning (ICL). This success flies in the face of decades of critiques asserting that artificial neural networks cannot master abstract symbol manipulation. We seek to understand the mechanisms that can enable robust symbol processing in transformer networks, illuminating both the unanticipated success, and the significant limitations, of transformers in symbol processing. Borrowing insights from symbolic AI and cognitive science on the power of Production System architectures, we develop a high-level Production System Language, PSL, that allows us to write symbolic programs to do complex, abstract symbol processing, and create compilers that precisely implement PSL programs in transformer networks which are, by construction, 100% mechanistically interpretable. The work is driven by study of a purely abstract (semantics-free) symbolic task that we develop, Templatic Generation (TGT). Although developed through study of TGT, PSL is, we demonstrate, highly general: it is Turing Universal. The new type of transformer architecture that we compile from PSL programs suggests a number of paths for enhancing transformers' capabilities at symbol processing. We note, however, that the work we report addresses computability, and not learnability, by transformer networks.
  Note: The first section provides an extended synopsis of the entire paper.

                Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is an emerging technology to support 5G and beyond wireless networks. It increases spectral efficiency, connectivity, and system throughput. At the core of NOMA is Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC), which separates superimposed signals in the power domain. However, SIC performance is highly susceptible to interference, channel estimation errors, and inefficient power allocation. This review summarizes optimization-based, heuristic, hybrid, and artificial intelligence-based power allocation methods. It also examines energy-efficient designs, massive connectivity support, cross-layer optimization, cooperative NOMA, and robust SIC for ultra-reliable low-latency communication. The insights presented can guide researchers in improving SIC and power allocation in dense network environments.

                Background University lecturers often face heavy workloads and emotional pressures that can undermine their well-being. Artistic engagement, such as singing and dancing, may offer valuable means of emotional renewal and personal growth. This study explores how artistic performance contributes to lecturers’ well-being in higher education through the lens of the PERMA framework, which comprises Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment. Methods A qualitative focus group discussion was conducted with six lecturers from a university in Southern Vietnam. The discussion, held in Vietnamese, was recorded with verbal consent, transcribed, translated into English, and analyzed thematically according to the PERMA dimensions. Results Engaging in artistic performance enhanced lecturers’ positive emotions, deepened engagement, strengthened collegial relationships, and fostered meaning and accomplishment. Participants viewed artistic activities as outlets for stress reduction and self-expression, helping them maintain motivation and emotional balance amid professional challenges. However, institutional recognition of such creative engagement remained limited. Conclusions Artistic participation supports lecturers’ holistic well-being and contributes to a more positive and connected academic environment. Universities should consider incorporating arts-based initiatives into well-being strategies to promote educators’ psychological resilience and sense of community. Future studies could extend this inquiry across disciplines and explore policy-level approaches to embedding creative practices in higher education.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013732">Do we advise as one likes? The alignment bias in social advice giving</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xitong Luo, Lei Zhang, Yafeng Pan</p>

We often give advice to influence others, but could our own advice also be shaped by the very individuals we aim to influence (i.e., advisees)? This reverse flow of social influence—from those typically seen as being influenced to those who provide the influence—has been largely neglected, limiting our understanding of the reciprocal nature of human communications. Here, we conducted a series of experiments and applied computational modelling to systematically investigate how advisees’ opinions shape the advice-giving process. In an investment game, participants (<i>n</i> = 346, across four studies) provided advice either independently or after observing advisees’ opinions (Studies 1 & 2), with feedback on their advice (acceptance or rejection) provided by advisees (Studies 3 & 4). Our findings reveal that advisors tend to adjust their advice to align with the advisees’ opinions (we refer to this as the <i>alignment bias</i>) (Study 1). This tendency, which reflects normative conformity, persists even when advisors were directly incentivized to provide accurate advice (Study 2). As feedback is introduced, advisors’ behavior shifts in ways best captured by a reinforcement learning model, suggesting that advisees’ feedback drives adaptations in advice giving that maximize acceptance and minimize rejection (Study 3). This adaptation persisted even when acceptance is rare, as bolstered by the model-based evidence (Study 4). Collectively, our findings highlight advisors’ susceptibility to the consequence of giving advice, which can lead to counterproductive impacts on decision-making processes and misinformation exacerbation in social encounters.

Membrane nanotubes serve as critical cytoskeletal structures that facilitate intercellular communication and signal transmission across distances in both plants and animals. Here, we report the role of microtubule (MT) nanotubes in rendering the <i>Drosophila</i> micropyle functional, a structure essential for sperm entry during fertilization. Our study highlights that MT-nanotubes emanate from the apical end of the specialized epithelial cells called the polar cells in late oogenesis, forming a narrow channel through the eggshell. Utilizing a combination of fly genetics, live cell imaging, and tissue immunochemistry, our research elucidates the structural and functional characteristics of the polar cell nanotube. We show that tubulin is vital for the formation of these nanotubes, which are enriched in the lateral membrane marker, Fasciclin III. Moreover, the overall polarity of the migrating cell cluster is critical for the successful development of the micropyle. Notably, both lysosomal function and lysosomal trafficking within the polar cells are essential for the opening of the vitelline layer, further facilitating the micropyle’s role in fertilization.

Neuronal activity and sensory experience regulate the subunit stoichiometry of synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype glutamate receptors (NMDARs), a critical determinant for brain development, synaptic plasticity, and a line of neurological disorders. Here we found that Ras and Rab interactor 1 (RIN1), a neuron-specific protein in the brain, played an important role in dictating synaptic NMDAR subunit composition in spinal cord somatostatin-positive (SOM<sup>+</sup>) neuron, a key component in the spinal circuit transmitting mechanical pain in mice. Our data showed that the protein level of RIN1 was low early after birth, which progressively increased with synapse maturation and promoted the switch from synaptic GluN2B- to GluN2A-containing NMDARs. In adult mice, the nerve injury-induced pathological pain paralleled a significant increase of RIN1 protein in spinal SOM<sup>+</sup> neurons, which drove a new round of GluN2B-to-GluN2A switching at mature synapses. Our data revealed the molecular mechanisms by which RIN1 differentially regulated the synaptic trafficking of GluN2B and GluN2A receptors, and implied that RIN1-mediated pathological switch of NMDAR subunit composition strikingly altered the analgesic efficacy of distinct NMDAR subunit antagonists with the development of neuropathic pain.

                <p>by Tzyy-Nan Huang, Ming-Hui Lin, Tsan-Ting Hsu, Chen-Hsin Yu, Yi-Ping Hsueh</p>

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of heterogeneous, behaviorally defined neurodevelopmental conditions influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Here, we show that supplementation of multiple low-dose nutrients—an important environmental factor contributing to ASD—can modulate synaptic proteomes, reconfigure neural ensembles, and improve social behaviors in mice. First, we used <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/−</sup> mice, a well-established model of ASD, to investigate the effect of nutrient cocktails containing zinc, branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), and serine, all of which are known to regulate synapse formation and activity. Supplementation of nutrient cocktails for 7 days altered total proteomes by increasing synapse-related proteins. Our results further reveal that <i>Tbr1</i> haploinsufficiency promotes hyperactivation and hyperconnectivity of basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons, enhancing the activity correlation between individual neurons and their corresponding ensembles. Nutrient supplementation normalized the activity and connectivity of the BLA neurons in <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/−</sup> mice during social interactions. We further show that although a low dose of individual nutrients did not alter social behaviors, treatment with supplement mixtures containing low-dose individual nutrients improved social behaviors and associative memory of <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/−</sup> mice, implying a synergistic effect of combining low-dose zinc, BCAA, and serine. Moreover, the supplement cocktails also improved social behaviors in <i>Nf1</i><sup>+/−</sup> and <i>Cttnbp2</i><sup>+/M120I</sup> mice, two additional ASD mouse models. Thus, our findings reveal aberrant neural connectivity in the BLA of <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/−</sup> mice and indicate that dietary supplementation with zinc, BCAA, and/or serine offers a safe and accessible approach to mitigate neural connectivity and social behaviors across multiple ASD models.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-771/v2?src=rss">Ameliorative Effects of Ethyl-Acetate Extract of Bidens pilosa on Oxidative Stress and Reproductive Impairment in Bisphenol A-Exposed Male Mice: Insight from In-silico, Invitro and In-vivo Studies [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reser</a></h4>

              
                Background Bisphenol A (BPA), a ubiquitous environmental pollutant, is known to induce oxidative stress and disrupt male reproductive function. This study evaluated the ameliorative effects of the ethyl-acetate extract of Bidens pilosa L., Asteraceae (EABP) on oxidative stress and reproductive impairment in BPA-exposed male mice. Method GC-MS phytocompounds from EABP were subjected to in-silico pharmacokinetic, drug-likeness, and toxicological screening using the SwissAdme and PkCSM web servers. Antioxidant capacity of EABP was determined using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay. Over a 28-day period, male mice were assigned to six groups. The control group (Group 1) received distilled water, while Group 2 administered BPA at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day. Groups 3, 4, and 5 were treated with BPA in combination with EABP at doses of 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day, respectively. Group 6 received BPA along with vitamin C at 100 mg/kg/day. Various parameters, including body weight, malondialdehyde, catalase, and superoxide dismutase level were assessed. Result Molecular docking analysis revealed that 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid, a key phytoconstituent of EABP, exhibited strong binding affinity for both the androgen receptor (AR) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2). Its interaction with AR was comparable to that of testosterone, suggesting potential androgenic activity, while its binding to NRF2 mirrored that of vitamin C. The extract’s antioxidant activity was further supported by the DPPH radical scavenging assay, where it demonstrated moderate potency with an IC₅₀ of 6.11μg/mL, compared to 1.25μg/mL for vitamin C. in vivo findings showed that treatment with EABP at 250 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg, and 1000 mg/kg restored SOD activity and significantly reduced MDA levels. Catalase (CAT) activity also improved, particularly at the higher dose. Conclusion Collectively, these results indicate that the EABP offers protective effects against BPA-induced oxidative stress, metabolic disturbance, and reproductive dysfunction, possibly through its combined antioxidant and hormone-like properties.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1018/v2?src=rss">Application of Modified Flanders Interaction Analysis During Mathematics Lessons in Lagos State Senior Secondary Schools [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Objective This study examined the application of Modified Flanders Interaction Analysis during mathematics lessons in senior secondary schools in the Festac area of Lagos State, Nigeria. Methods The study employed a descriptive survey design to observe and analyse classroom interactions between teachers and students, focusing on verbal and non-verbal communication. Researchers used a structured observation schedule to collect data from a purposively selected sample of 10 mathematics teachers and 725 students across five schools. The researchers designed the instrument to collect information on teachers’ and students’ interaction patterns in the classroom. They analysed the data using mean scores, standard deviation, percentages, and t-test statistics, applying a 0.05 significance level for hypothesis testing. Findings The results of the analysis revealed that teachers dominate all the activities in the classroom; that is, the teachers were the active people in the classes, while the students were just passive listeners and moderate engagement through non-verbal behaviours. Statistical analysis showed significant differences between teacher and student patterns, particularly verbal behaviours. The study underscores that mathematics classes in senior secondary schools in the Festac area of Lagos State were teachers-centered. Conclusion Based on the study findings, the researchers recommended that mathematics teachers adopt more student-centered teaching approaches to enhance active student participation and engagement during lessons. Also, they should not be too strict, but they should be approachable, friendly, and accommodating so that the students will not be afraid to ask questions during or after the lesson, enhancing their performance. Hence, the government should ensure that teacher training programs incorporate observation techniques to effectively equip teachers with the skills to assess and improve classroom interaction.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The amino acid neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) reportedly acts by unidentified ventromedial hypothalamic mechanisms to suppress hypoglycemia-associated counterregulatory endocrine function in male rats. Present studies addressed the premise that GABAergic transmission of ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN) origin may regulate dorsomedial VMN (VMNdm) growth hormone-releasing hormone (Ghrh)/steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) neuron counterregulatory signaling to control this hormone outflow. VMN glutamate decarboxylase-2 (GAD2/GAD<sub>65</sub>) gene knockdown increased basal but inhibited insulin-induced hypoglycemia (IIH)-associated augmentation of corticosterone and glucagon secretion, while suppressing growth hormone secretion regardless of glucose status. Multiplex qPCR analysis of laser-catapult-microdissected VMNdm Ghrh-immunoreactive neurons showed that GAD2 siRNA pretreatment intensified IIH-associated upregulation of mRNAs that encode the counterregulatory-enhancing neurochemicals nitric oxide and glutamate, and exacerbated hypoglycemic downregulation of GAD1, GAD2, and SF-1 transcription. VMN GAD2 gene silencing augmented hypoglycemic enhancement of Ghrh neuron 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase alpha-1 and alpha-2 gene expression. VMN GAD2 gene knockdown exacerbated both positive lactate receptor and negative estrogen receptor transcriptional reactivity to IIH. Study outcomes provide novel evidence for bidirectional, glucose status-specific VMN GABAergic control of corticosterone and glucagon secretion in male rats, which is not documented in the other sex. Data verify GABA regulation of VMN dorsomedial Ghrh neuron metabolic and hormonal signal reception, energy screening, and counterregulatory neurochemical release. Further effort is needed to characterize the impact of GABA-dependent neurotransmission by this discrete VMN neuron population on neural circuitries that govern glucose homeostasis.</p>

<p>Propofol alleviates depressive-like behaviors and hippocampal damage in a learned helplessness mouse model. It exerts its effect by upregulating the hippocampal Notch signaling pathway.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Propofol, an anesthetic known for its safety, efficacy and neuroprotective properties, has potential novel antidepressant effects. However, its specific mechanisms still require further elucidation. Presently, we established a learned helplessness (LH) depression model to investigate the effects of propofol treatment on depression-like impairment. Thirty adult male C57BL/6j mice were randomly divided into three groups: control group (CON), model group (LH), and propofol group (PRO), with 10 mice per group. Behavioral analyses were conducted using weight measurement, sucrose preference test (SPT), forced swim test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), and Morris water maze test (MWM). Subsequently, HE staining was performed to examine pathological changes in the hippocampal region. Western blotting was conducted to assess changes in Notch signaling pathway components, synaptic plasticity-related proteins, and proteins in the glutamate system. Immunofluorescence was used to detect expression changes of NICD, SYP, and DCX. Hippocampal glutamate concentration was determined using a glutamate assay kit. Consequently, stressed mice exhibited pronounced depressive behaviors and decreased spatial learning and memory, accompanied by significant neuronal death in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal region and reduced levels of neuronal regeneration as well as synaptic plasticity. Additionally, glutamate reuptake function was impaired in depression, manifested specifically as increased glutamate concentrations in the hippocampal region and neuronal glutamate transmission levels. Meaningfully, propofol upregulated Notch signaling pathway activity and improved glutamate reuptake function significantly resulting in enhanced adult hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. These findings demonstrated the effectiveness of propofol as a potential antidepressant and contributed to discovering novel antidepressant drugs.</p>

                Ralhan et al. show that ApoE2 and ApoE3 Christchurch on lipid particles efflux oxidized phospholipids from neurons via the ABCA7 transporter. This reduces the burden of oxidized lipids, which improves lysosomal function and protects neurons from ferroptosis.

                Morikis et al. highlight the importance of communication between breast tumor leader cells and follower cells during directional collective migration. Differential roles for cadherin-1 in followers, cadherin-11 in cancer-associated fibroblasts, and cadherin-3 in leaders point to unique properties between cell populations in maintaining a cohesive structure to effectively migrate collectively.

                Liu et al. show that upregulation of p38 within the MAPK pathway enhances phosphorylation of Eagle at Ser363, while downregulation of PKA_C1 in the PKA pathway reduces phosphorylation of Eagle at Y235 in insecticide resistant B. tabaci. These coordinated changes collectively elevate CYP306A1 transcription and conferring resistance.

                Kim et al. leverage natural variation in IL-1β affinity across species to show that while ligand affinity sets activation thresholds, each IL-1 receptor signaling complex outputs a fixed, quantized burst of signal. This mechanism provides robustness and specificity to cytokine responses and further defines mechanisms of cytokine signal encoding.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100159">Eed controls craniofacial osteoblast differentiation and mesenchymal proliferation from the neural crest</a></h4>

              
                 The histone methyltransferase Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is required for specification of the neural crest, and mis-regulation of neural crest development can cause severe congenital malformations. PRC2 is necessary for neural crest induction, but the embryonic, cellular, and molecular consequences of PRC2 activity after neural crest induction are incompletely understood. Here, we show that <i>Eed</i>, which encodes a protein that is a core subunit of PRC2, is required for craniofacial osteoblast differentiation and mesenchymal proliferation after induction of the neural crest. Integrating mouse genetics with single-cell RNA sequencing and epigenetic profiling, our results reveal that conditional knockout of <i>Eed</i> after neural crest cell induction causes severe craniofacial hypoplasia, impaired craniofacial osteogenesis, and attenuated craniofacial mesenchymal cell proliferation that is first evident in post-migratory neural crest cell populations. We show that <i>Eed</i> drives mesenchymal differentiation and proliferation in vivo and in primary craniofacial cell cultures by epigenetically regulating diverse transcription factor programs that are required for specification of post-migratory neural crest cells. These data enhance understanding of epigenetic mechanisms that underlie craniofacial development and shed light on the embryonic, cellular, and molecular drivers of rare congenital syndromes in humans.

                Thanks to recent promising advances in AI, automated segmentation of imaging datasets has made significant strides. However, the evaluation and curation of 3D and 3D+t datasets remain extremely challenging and highly resource-intensive. We present MorphoNet 2.0, a major conceptual and technical evolution designed to facilitate the segmentation, self-evaluation, and correction of 3D images. The application is accessible to non-programming biologists through user-friendly graphical interfaces and works on all major operating systems. We showcase its power in enhancing segmentation accuracy and boosting interpretability across five previously published segmented datasets. This new approach is crucial for producing ground-truth datasets of discovery-level scientific quality, critical for training and benchmarking advanced AI-driven segmentation tools, as well as for competitive challenges.

">Neuronal excitability is permanently altered by activity manipulation during an embryonic critical period in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal intrinsic excitability provides the baseline that homeostatic mechanisms act to preserve, yet the processes that establish a baseline remain poorly defined. Developmental critical periods (CPs) are thought to play a central role, but the link between early activity and long-term intrinsic properties is not well characterised. To address this, we used the genetic tractability of the Drosophila larval locomotor circuit to manipulate individual neurons during an embryonic CP. Following optogenetic excitation or inhibition, during the CP, we assessed intrinsic excitability of the same neurons in third-instar larvae (i.e. ~5 days thereafter). We compared an excitatory premotor interneuron (A27h), an inhibitory premotor interneuron (A31k), and a motor neuron (aCC). Both interneurons exhibited anti-homeostatic responses: excitatory perturbation increased intrinsic excitability, while inhibitory perturbation decreased it, effects that persisted throughout larval development. In contrast, motor neurons showed no significant changes under the same conditions, revealing cell type-specific sensitivity to early activity. These findings build on the general principles of the functional relationships between CP activity and neuronal excitability and how intrinsic excitability is not passively set but actively shaped during these windows, with long-lasting, neuron-specific consequences. More broadly, our results highlight how developmental perturbations can alter the excitatory:inhibitory balance of mature neural circuits that may contribute to the aetiology of neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Distinct functional roles across hippocampal subfields in anticipation to event boundaries during schema learning</a></h4>

              
                Continuous experiences are constantly segmented into separate events in memory, which is accompanied by increased hippocampal activity at the boundaries between these events. Extracting knowledge across all these experiences about what type of events to expect in a certain environment leads to event schemas being represented in the brain. These event schemas help to predict future events. What are the differences across the various distinct hippocampal subfields in peaks of activity around event boundaries? And what is the influence of event schema learning on these hippocampal subfield peaks? Here, this was investigated using data from an fMRI experiment in which participants learned two (related) event schemas by exposure to many similar animated videos of wedding ceremonies in a novel fictional culture. Results revealed that the hippocampus (CA1, CA2/3, dentate gyrus and subiculum) showed peaks in activity before event boundaries. Interestingly, the CA1, CA2/3 and dentate gyrus pre-boundary peaks attenuated due to event schema learning. This provides evidence for these subfields signaling uncertainty about upcoming events in the seconds prior to event boundaries. These results give a more precise understanding about the temporal dynamics around event boundaries in the distinct hippocampal subfields, and how these hippocampal subfields' responses interact with schema learning.

">Dissociating mechanisms of heart-voice coupling</a></h4>

              
                In a landmark paper in JASA, Orlikoff & Baken (1989a) demonstrated that the heartbeat echoes through acoustic features of the human voice. Heart-voice coupling questions how vocal control is functionally regulated under these perturbations. It has many potential engineering applications that extract heart rate from human voice and speech, with underutilized potential for cardiac monitoring from (wild) animal calls. However, laboratory phonology and bioacoustics seem to have forgotten about the phenomenon, such that the physiological underpinnings of heart-voice coupling have been left unexplained. In the current contribution, we show that vocal acoustics contain signatures of the heartbeat as originally reported by Orlikoff & Baken (1989a). More specifically, we analysed the steady-state vowel vocalizations of 17 participants and found a significant relationship between the vocal amplitude envelope and the cardiac activity (ECG). Furthermore, we conducted two empirical tests to dissociate between glottal (vocal fold vascularization) and subglottal (heart-lung interaction) mechanisms of heart-voice coupling. In addition to a stable heart-voice coupling, we also found a significant heart-expiration coupling during conditions of pure expiration. Since the vocal folds are abducted during expiration, this result demonstrates that subglottal mechanisms that modulate expiratory flow must be involved in heart-voice coupling. We argue that the heart rhythm needs to be considered as a weakly coupled pattern generator that possibly shaped the evolution of vocal and speech production.

">Modeling the Co-existence of NMDAR-Dependent and AMPAR-Regulated Long-Term Potentiation/Depression</a></h4>

              
                In this work, we develop a mathematical model that captures both the early and late phases of Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) and Long-Term Depression (LTD) within an NMDAR-dependent and AMPA-regulated framework. The model combines multiple essential properties. First, it emphasizes a detailed representation of biochemical processes within the postsynaptic neuron, thereby illustrating the interaction between LTD and distinct forms of LTP. Second, the dynamic modulation of postsynaptic AMPA receptor conductance is represented through nonlinear differential equations and algebraic relations. Third, the model incorporates input specificity, associativity, and cooperativity, allowing synaptic changes at one site to influence the strength of neighboring synapses. These features provide a comprehensive description of synaptic dynamics, allowing the simulation of plasticity at both the cellular and the network levels. Overall, the model offers a valuable framework for studying NMDAR-dependent LTP and LTD by explicitly incorporating AMPA currents. We believe that this model provides deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and paves the way for the construction of network-level models by linking multiple cells through AMPA receptor conductance.

">A linear regression model predicts human brain ageing and reveals differential neuronal biological ageing relevant for Parkinson's disease susceptibility</a></h4>

              
                Biological brain ageing is a major risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, which are characterized by selective degeneration of particular neuron types. We analyzed the impact of ageing on the transcriptome of neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and locus coeruleus (LC), that show differential vulnerabilities to Parkinson disease. Neurons were isolated from human post mortem brain tissues originating from 48 individuals ranging from 17 to 102 years of age and subjected to Smart-seq2 RNA sequencing. We identified 2,764 genes that were correlated with chronological ageing. This gene expression data was used to develop a feature selection-based Time Traversal algorithm, utilizing functionally grouped gene sets, GO terms, with high predictive accuracy of biological brain ageing. We identified 59 GO terms that can predict biological age using a linear regression model, where leave-one-out cross validation demonstrated a strong correlation between chronological age and predicted biological age (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.946; adjusted R2 = 0.771). The algorithm was validated on five independent datasets with high predictive performance, demonstrating shared ageing features across the human brain. Nonetheless, our analysis also highlights brain region and neuron type specificity in particular ageing features. Resilient neurons showed a weaker association with age-related transcriptional changes, indicating that they age slower than their vulnerable counterparts, thus revealing targets that may be used to slow down ageing and prevent disease development.

">Orthographic training finetunes a neuronal letter position code in primate visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Reading is an acquired skill that enhances brain activity in human visual cortex and is thought to repurpose preexisting ventral visual circuitry for the fast parallel processing of letter strings. However, the neuronal code underlying position-invariant written word recognition remains elusive. Here, we examined this issue in a macaque monkey model before and after orthographic training. Based on prior simulations of reading acquisition in a convolutional neural network model of the ventral visual pathway, we hypothesized the existence of neurons sensitive to both specific letters and their ordinal position within the word, which should be enhanced by orthographic training. By wirelessly recorded neural activity from the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of macaque monkeys trained on orthographic tasks over five successive days, we indeed discovered IT neurons tuned to letters and sensitive to either ordinal or retinotopic positions. Ordinal units existed prior to training, but their responses were enhanced after training, matching with behavioral improvements in word recognition. These findings support the neuronal recycling hypothesis and demonstrate, at the single-cell level, how reading refines pre-existing neural circuits to facilitate fluent word recognition.

">Miniscope Processing Suite (MPS): An Intuitive, No-Code, Scalable Pipeline for Long Duration Calcium Imaging</a></h4>

              
                Miniscope calcium imaging provides a unique window into the activity of neurons during behavior while enabling spatial localization of individual cells across time. Despite its potential to revolutionize in vivo imaging alongside the rise of optogenetic tools, miniscopes remain underutilized. This gap may stem from the lack of an easy-to-use preprocessing software tailored to miniscope data. To address this need, we developed the first no-code end-to-end scalable pipeline for preprocessing large miniscope recordings: the Miniscope Processing Suite (MPS). MPS is the first implementation of Constrained Non-negative Matrix Factorization (CNMF) with Nonnegative Double Singular Value Decomposition (NNDSVD) initialization, multi-lasso segmentation, and parallelized temporal and spatial updates, enabling analysis of recordings exceeding three hours on a standard hardware. We tested a large dataset consisting of 28 operant behavior sessions (77 hrs, 7.26 TB of video data) on a single workstation. MPS completed the analysis in 55.6 hrs, (averaging 0.72 minute of processing time per minute of recording), which is 10-20X faster than traditional pipelines. Packaged as an easy downloadable plug-and-play software with a graphical user interface and requiring no coding or Git experience, MPS lowers the barrier to miniscope analysis while improving on current methodologies.

">Peri-Head Distance Coding in the Mouse Brainstem</a></h4>

              
                Perceiving object distance in peri-personal space (PPS) is essential for guiding movement and avoiding danger, yet how early somatosensory circuits extract distance information from tactile inputs remains unclear. Here, we investigate how second-order neurons in the mouse whisker brainstem encode peri-head distance. Using in vivo extracellular recordings in awake mice in a naturalistic wall-passing paradigm, we find brainstem neurons employ two distance-coding schemes: a "proximity" code, where firing increases monotonically as objects approach the face; and a "map" code, where neurons exhibit peak tuning at specific distances to collectively tile peri-head space. The map code outperforms proximity code in population decoding of distance. Perturbation experiments revealed multi-whisker integration and intersubnuclear inhibition contribute to the generation of map-like tuning. These findings highlight the previously underappreciated brainstem circuit for sensory code transformation, suggesting inhibition acts as a neural comparator, subtracting peripheral inputs with differing sensitivity to transform proximity-based sensory inputs into a map-like representation of PPS.

">Transition from plasticity to dynamics-based value update for meta-learning</a></h4>

              
                Value computation is fundamental to the survival of animals. Classical models suggest value is stored in synaptic weight through plasticity whereas more recent theories propose that recurrent network dynamics can encode and update value independently of synaptic change. Although these two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, the condition under which each dominates remain unclear. Here we show that environmental stability determines the neural mechanism underlying value updating. In stable environments, mice rely on synaptic plasticity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), supporting value memory that persists for over a week. In contrast, in dynamic environments, mice gradually transition to a recurrent dynamics-based value update, with value memory degrading after ~2 minutes. A recurrent neural network (RNN) endowed with online weight updating recapitulates experimental data, exhibiting a transition from plasticity to dynamics-based value computation. Synaptic plasticity blockade in the BLA impaired initial value updating in the stable environment but not expert value updating in the dynamic environment, consistent with the RNN model. Furthermore, electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic inactivation reveal that BLA encodes both stable and dynamic value and is required for performing in both environments. Lastly, the transition from plasticity to dynamics-based value computation allowed both RNNs and mice to use task knowledge to infer value, allowing value update without direct experience. Overall, our work provides a new framework to understand value computation in the brain and suggests that meta-learning may emerge via a transition from plasticity to dynamics-based value computation.

                Imbalances in gut microbiota composition and microbiota-associated metabolites have been linked with several neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). However, a comprehensive multi-biofluid approach remains lacking. Most studies on MS include patients already receiving treatment and often neglect to account for sex-related differences, which could serve as potential confounding factors. Moreover, they mostly investigate only stools or plasma metabolomics. In this study, we recruited 18 treatment-naive neuroinflammatory patients at diagnosis and compared them with 20 healthy controls, matched for sex and age. We conducted multi-biofluids metabolomic analysis of urine, stool, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid, complemented by taxonomical and functional profiling of the gut microbiome using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Our results show that MS patients exhibit distinct microbiome composition and urinary metabolomic profiles compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, neuroinflammation is associated with dysregulation of microbially-produced short-chain fatty acids, their intestinal absorption and systemic bioavailability, as illustrated by the altered plasma levels.

">Disentangling Superpositions: Interpretable Brain Encoding Model with Sparse Concept Atoms</a></h4>

              
                Encoding models based on word embeddings or artificial neural network (ANN) features reliably predict brain responses to naturalistic stimuli but remain difficult to interpret. A central limitation is superposition - the entanglement of distinct semantic features along correlated directions in dense embeddings, which arises when latent features outnumber the embedding dimensions. This entanglement renders regression weights non-identifiable: different combinations of semantic directions can produce identical predicted brain activity, preventing principled interpretation of voxel selectivity. To overcome this, we introduce the Sparse Concept Encoding Model, which transforms dense embeddings into a higher-dimensional, sparse, and non-negative space of learned concept atoms. This transformation yields an axis-aligned semantic basis where each dimension corresponds to an interpretable concept, enabling direct readout of conceptual selectivity from voxel weights. When applied to fMRI data collected during story listening, our model matches the prediction performance of conventional dense models while substantially enhancing interpretability. It enables novel neuroscientific analyses such as disentangling overlapping cortical representations of time, space, and number, and revealing structured similarity among distributed conceptual maps. This framework offers a scalable and interpretable bridge between ANN-derived features and human conceptual representations in the brain.

                Background: Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are major risk factors for male hypogonadism, a disorder with multi-system impacts on health. However, the mechanisms underlying obesity-associated male secondary hypogonadism remain poorly understood. Here, we aimed to dissect dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis and elucidate the underlying epigenetic mechanisms using a high-fat diet mouse model. Methods: Male C57BL6 mice were fed standard chow or high-fat diet (HFD, 60% fat) for 16 weeks starting from 6-week of age. Plasma testosterone levels, sperm counts, and gonadotropin responses to senktide and kisspeptin peptide stimulation were assessed. HFD-induced transcription changes in the ARC were evaluted using bulk and single-cell RNA-seq. Genome-wide changes in 5hmC were analzyed by hydroxymethylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (hMeDIP-seq). Functional relevance of 5hmC changes was evaluated by ectopic TET expression in an immortalized ARC Kiss1 neuron cell line and qRT-PCR. Results: HFD-fed mice induced obesity, hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance, indicative of the development of type 2 diabetes-like metabolic disorder. This was accompanied by low testosterone, reduced sperm counts, and unchanged basal LH, consistent with obesity/T2D-associated male secondary hypogonadism observed clinically. Impaired LH responses to senktide, a Kisspeptin neuron activator, but not to kisspeptin peptide, identified suppressed Kiss1 neuron function as a key mechanism underlying secondary hypogonadism. RNA-seq revealed dysregulation of metabolic and neural pathways in Kiss1 neurons. hMeDIP-seq revealed widespread 5hmC alterations in the ARC of HFD-induced obese/diabetic mice correlated with the dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism, neuronal activity, and synapse function pathways. Ectopic TET expression ex vivo in Kiss1 neuronal cell lines restored 5hmC levels and upregulated key metabolic and neuronal genes that were repressed in the ARC of DIO mice. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that Kiss1 neurons are highly sensitive to diet and metabolic changes, and that obesity/diabetes-induced 5hmC modifications play a key role in dysregulating the metabolic and neuronal pathways in Kiss1 neurons. These findings reveal a novel mechanism linking metabolic disturbances to reproductive dysfunction through direct effects on Kiss1 neurons.

">The atypical antidepressant tianeptine causes opioid-receptor-dependent beta oscillations in the rat hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Tianeptine is an atypical antidepressant and cognitive enhancer. Previous research indicates that its antidepressant-like efficacy in animals depends on the phosphorylation of GluA1-subunit-containing AMPA receptors (AMPARs), and the activation of mu-opioid receptors on hippocampal interneurons. Both actions might alter synaptic strength and network activity; we therefore studied the effects of tianeptine on evoked synaptic responses and local-field-potential (LFP) oscillations in area CA1 of male urethane-anaesthetised rats. Electrodes were implanted to record CA1 LFP and field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) elicited by stimulation of CA3. A temperature probe was implanted in the contralateral hippocampus. Subcutaneous injection of tianeptine (10 & 30 mg/kg) caused a dose-dependent increase in hippocampal beta-frequency activity and a modest increase in fEPSP slope that were blocked by the opioid-receptor antagonist naloxone. Injection of the opioid buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg) had similar effects, but ketamine (10 mg/kg), another atypical antidepressant, caused a distinct pattern of LFP changes characterised by a naloxone-insensitive increase in slow-gamma activity. Injection of 30 mg/kg tianeptine and buprenorphine was associated with an increase in brain temperature of ~0.6 degrees C, sufficient to fully explain the increase in fEPSP slope, but not the increase in LFP activity. Injection of tianeptine also caused a reduction in the amplitude of the inhibitory tail of the fEPSP, consistent with a blockade of feedforward inhibition. These results indicate that tianeptine, like several other atypical antidepressant drugs, enhances hippocampal beta/gamma-frequency LFP activity. This action is dependent on opioid-receptor activation and may depend on the disinhibition of principal neurons, a possibility that we are exploring.

">Large Scale Functional and Effective Connectivity Alterations cross the Huntington's Disease Integrated Staging System</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with severe motor, cognitive and behavioral symptoms. There is a recent impetus to develop treatments that slow progression before clinical signs emerge. Such early interventions require biomarkers sensitive to the very earliest HD progression. Here we applied cutting-edge fMRI analysis on data collected in the Track-On HD study to evaluate whether functional and effective connectivity obtained from model-free and model-based approaches can produce useful biomarkers of HD progression. We analyzed data from 231 participants with up to three annual visits each and created five groups comprising normative controls and four HD groups according to the Huntington's Disease Integrated Staging System (HD-ISS). We found significant differences across the HD-ISS stages but not in their longitudinal change. Specifically, we found attenuated functional and effective connectivity in the caudate nucleus in HD-ISS-2, and this effect extended to other corticostriatal connections in HD-ISS-3. Overall, most of the alterations were only evident in advanced HD stages, and we did not observe widespread alterations in cortical connectivity and graph topography. Although HD-ISS groups did not differ in the amount of in-scanner motion, we did find measures of functional and effective connectivity to be sensitive to motion. We conclude that fMRI can indeed capture attenuation of cortico-striatal functional and effective connectivity across HD progression. This is the first study to investigate fMRI alterations across the recently created HD-ISS stages within a novel framework of signal flow across the whole brain.

">Therapeutic Potential of Neural Rosette Stem Cell-Derived Small Extracellular Vesicles in the Management of Brain Edema</a></h4>

              
                Neural stem cells (NSCs) represent an interesting option for developing in vitro disease models and drug screening assays due to their differentiation capacity into neurons and glial cells. Additionally, NSCs are under investigation in on-going clinical trials for treatment of various human neurological disorders. NSCs can be isolated from the central nervous system or derived in vitro from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). However, the current methods for generating NSCs typically include a phase of neural rosette formation and subsequent manual isolation of these tiny structures. As this is a laborious process characterized by operator-dependent variability and scalability challenges, there is a pressing need to develop optimized and scalable protocols to obtain pure NSC populations. In this study, we present a new method for generating highly pure and expandable dorsal forebrain FOXG1+OTX2+TLE4+SOX5+ neural rosette stem cell (NRSC) lines without the necessity for manual isolation of rosette structures. Our findings demonstrate the reproducibility of this protocol through the characterization of different NRSC lines over multiple passages, highlighting the robustness of the process. These NRSCs can be expanded for at least 12 passages without compromising their rosette-formation capacity or their initial dorsal forebrain identity. Furthermore, we show the differentiation capacity of these NRSCs to generate pure populations of TUBB3+ neurons, and under specific conditions, their ability to differentiate into early glial progenitor cells including GFAP+ astrocytes and O4+ oligodendrocytes. Collectively, these results show the capabilities of our protocol to generate an expandable NRSC population suitable for in vitro disease modeling and drug screening, while also suggesting a viable strategy for scalable NRSC production for clinical application.

">Behavioural and Physiological Signatures of Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress Models in Mice</a></h4>

              
                The chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) paradigm is one of the most widely used preclinical models to investigate the role of stress in the neurobiology of depression and to evaluate potential antidepressant therapies, owing to its strong translational relevance. However, despite its extensive use, substantial discrepancies and concerns regarding the reproducibility of CUMS outcomes persist in the literature, with many studies reporting inconsistent or unreliable results. In the present comparative study, we implemented several CUMS protocols in mice that differed in the intensity and duration of stress exposure, and systematically evaluated the resulting pathophysiological and behavioural alterations associated with depressive- and anxiety-like phenotypes. We found that progressive escalation in stress intensity and frequency, as well as prolonged exposure, induced increasingly robust disease-related behavioural and physiological changes, including depression- and anxiety-like behaviours, adrenal hypertrophy, and reduced body weight gain.. Moreover, social isolation emerged as a major contributing factor exacerbating stress-induced deficits. Altogether, data suggest that a multidimensional assessment of the behavioural impairments is critical to reinforce the physiological changes indicative of a hyperactive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA). Differences in individual stress susceptibility, stressor intensity, frequency, and housing conditions are key determinants of CUMS outcomes. Therefore, precise, detailed, and transparent reporting of protocol parameters is critical to enhance reproducibility and enable meaningful comparisons across studies.

">Micronuclear collapse under oxidative stress drives amphisome-mediated export of DNA in Parkinson disease</a></h4>

              
                The diversity of extracellular vesicle (EV) subpopulations and their impact on intercellular communication are increasingly recognized, but how organelle dysfunction shapes EV content in neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear. Mitochondrial and lysosomal functional defects are hallmarks of Parkinson disease (PD). Here we uncover a novel pathway linking this dysfunctional axis to EV remodeling and immune activation. We show that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce genomic instability and micronuclei formation in PD fibroblasts, with ruptured micronuclei being sequestered into amphisomes and exported through small EVs. These EVs are enriched in oxidized mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, which potently stimulate microglial inflammatory responses. Mechanistically, this work identifies micronuclei not as passive byproducts of genome instability but as active intermediates in EV cargo loading. Importantly, treatment with the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant AntiOxCIN4 elicited a mitohormetic response, enhancing ATM - mediated DNA damage repair, restoring mitochondrial dynamics, and improving lysosomal function. This reduced the incorporation of oxidized DNA into EVs and blunted their pro- inflammatory activity. Together, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which mitochondrial-lysosomal dysfunction drives the release of DNA-enriched EVs that fuel neuroinflammation in a neurodegenerative context. Targeting mitochondrial quality control to limit oxidized cargo in EVs emerges as a potential strategy to mitigate early inflammatory events in PD.

">Energy Landscape Analysis Reveals Thalamic Modulation of Brain State Transitions During Movie Watching</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how large-scale brain networks dynamically coordinate during complex, real-world experiences remains a crucial topic in contemporary neuroscience. Leveraging naturalistic paradigm, this study employed energy landscape modeling to characterize the temporal dynamics of brain state transitions and their functional significance. Using the Sherlock fMRI dataset, we identified two dominant brain states: a perception- and attention-oriented state, and an introspective, integrative state, each associated with distinct canonical brain networks. State transitions were differentially associated with the recruitment of these networks and manifested as either the "easy" or "hard" route, depending on the energy required for the transition. Notably, we demonstrated that the probability of specific state transitions robustly predicted inter-subject correlation within three clusters: subcortical-rich, salience/attention-rich, and DMN-rich regions. This indicates that flexible reorganization of cortical networks underlies shared neural engagement during ecologically valid experiences. Critically, the thalamus emerged as a central modulator, displaying activity changes and dynamic nucleus-specific thalamocortical connectivity changes tied to distinct transition profiles. Together, our findings shed light on the energetic and network mechanisms that orchestrate brain dynamics during naturalistic cognition and underscore the pivotal role of cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits in governing flexible, collective neural responses to richly structured real-life stimuli.

">Representation, Alignment, and Generation: A Comprehensive Survey of Foundation Models for Non-Invasive Brain Decoding</a></h4>

              
                The ability to decode human thoughts, intentions, and perceptions directly from non-invasive brain recordings holds transformative potential for healthcare, communication, and human-computer interaction. However, translating the safety and scalability of methods like fMRI, EEG, and MEG into real-world utility has traditionally been hindered by low signal-to-noise ratios, limited spatial-temporal resolution, and the difficulty to collect large-scale high-quality data from an individual user. Recently, the emergence of Foundation Models (FMs)-large-scale, pre-trained artificial intelligence architectures-has catalyzed a paradigm shift in overcoming these obstacles. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of how FMs are redefining the boundaries of non-invasive brain decoding. We propose a unified methodological framework that synthesizes recent advancements into a coherent process: extracting robust, transferable representations from noisy neural signals; aligning these signals with the rich semantic spaces of pre-trained vision and language models; and leveraging powerful conditional generative priors to reconstruct high-fidelity outputs. We systematically review state-of-the-art applications across three key domains: visual reconstruction, language and speech decoding, and auditory processing. Furthermore, we critically examine the persisting challenges of computational efficiency, cross-subject generalization, and privacy governance. By mapping the current landscape and identifying key gaps, this work outlines a strategic research agenda aimed at transitioning FM-driven neurotechnology from laboratory proofs-of-concept to reliable, real-world applications.

">Interplay of Spoonbill, Larp7 and survival motor neuron, in Drosophila model of Spinocerebellar Ataxia 8 non-coding RNA associated neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                A deeper understanding of neurodegenerative disorders at the level of genetic or environmental risk factors as well as contributing genes, pathways, and networks suggests the presence of shared molecular mechanisms. Previously, we have reported that the KH domain of the Spoonbill protein alone can suppress non-coding Spinocerebellar Ataxia 8 (SCA8) associated neurodegeneration. In the current study, we have identified dLarp7 as a novel interacting partner of Spoonbill in Drosophila. Mammalian Larp7 is associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder, Alazami Syndrome (AS). In this study, we report that dLarp7 protein is recruited into the pathogenic SCA8 RNA foci, which leads to depletion of its downstream target, 7SKsnRNA. Soaking away of Larp7 into toxic RNA foci results in its depletion from the physiological pool resulting in destabilization and depletion of 7SKsnRNP. Hence, increasing the dose of dLarp7 suppressed SCA8 associated neurodegeneration, by restoring the physiological levels of dLarp7 and 7SKsnRNP. In addition, it was observed that dLarp7 interacts with the somatic motor neuron (SMN) protein which is associated with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). This observation led us to explore the interaction of Drosophila SMN1 orthologue with pathogenic SCA8 associated neurodegeneration. Intriguingly, SMN protein modulated molecular neuropathogenesis associated with SCA8. The presence of orthologues of Drosophila RNA binding proteins, dLarp7 and SMN, with mammalian counterparts underlines the translational importance of our findings. Our study also hints at the shared molecular mechanisms that underlies multiple neurodegenerative diseases. A novel association of Drosophila homologs of AS-linked Larp7 and SMA-causing SMN1 with SCA8 associated neurodegeneration suggests an overlap of molecular threads underlying the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders.

">Flexible brain state engagement predicts cognitive control transdiagnostically</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive control supports adaptive responses in an ever-changing world. While alterations in cognitive control have been consistently observed in a range of psychiatric disorders, the neural mechanisms giving rise to this behavioral variation remain elusive. Here, we tested whether the ability to flexibly recruit recurring brain activation patterns (i.e., brain states) may serve as an intermediate phenotype supporting cognitive control in individuals with a spectrum of clinical symptoms. We leveraged machine learning and external validation to explore this question in three independent, transdiagnostic datasets (N>600), including participants with anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, mood disorder, substance use disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and neurodevelopmental disorder. To capture the multifaceted nature of cognitive control, we assessed two of its components, inhibition and shift, using both task-based and questionnaire data. Flexible brain state engagement predicted all cognitive control metrics in previously unseen individuals transdiagnostically, regardless of which dataset was used for model training. Connectome-based predictive modeling also revealed that shared brain networks underpinned flexible brain state engagement in a transdiagnostic manner. Leveraging brain network dynamics, we further observed that moments of more flexible brain state engagement aligned with moments of network connectivity related to better cognitive control within the same individual. This temporal alignment was replicated in all three datasets with heterogeneous samples. Altogether, this study provides robust evidence that flexible engagement of brain state may support both inter- and intra-individual differences in cognitive control across individuals with diverse mental health profiles.

">Novelty, category and orientation tuning for printed characters: a magnetoencephalography study with fast periodic visual stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Letter recognition is assumed to involve several levels of analysis, including coarse tuning for category and novelty and more fine tuning, related to letter orientation. We employed an oddball fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS) paradigm with magnetoencephalography (Elekta VectorView, 306 sensors) to study neural discrimination responses in the source space. Using contrasts between native letters and foreign letters, digits, or inverted native letters, we aimed to isolate the neural responses to visual novelty, category, and orientation during character analysis. The study was conducted with a cohort of 25 adults. The response topography demonstrated bilateral organization, including language-related brain regions as ventral occipitotemporal cortex, inferior parietal cortex and middle temporal areas. Comparing conditions, we revealed right lateralized parietal clusters, associated with novelty tuning, and left lateralized occipitotemporal clusters exhibiting higher activity for letters among digits discrimination, supporting the role of this area in letter processing. No distinct spatial patterns specific to orientation tuning were observed in comparison to novelty and category tuning. We proposed that expertise-dependent orientation-specific tuning mechanisms may operate within an embedded, spatially overlapping with coarse tuning neural framework, characterized by special spatiotemporal patterns.

">Dopamine D1 Receptors Modulate glycinergic Inhibitory Inputs to OFF cone bipolar cells elicited by Optogenetic Activation of Amacrine Cells</a></h4>

              
                Light evoked inhibition on OFF cone bipolar cells has been shown to be modulated by both background light levels and the Dopamine D1 Receptor. Since dopamine receptors are localized throughout the mouse retina, it is not known where in the light signaling cascade dopamine is modulating signals to OFF bipolar cells. The goal of this work was to develop a technique that allowed for the isolation of the amacrine to OFF bipolar cell circuit and determine if there are local changes in inhibition elicited by presynaptic amacrine cells onto OFF bipolar cells. To do this, we utilized the B6.Cg-Tg(Slc32al-COP4*H134R/EYFP) mouse line. These mice contain ChR2 in all the inhibitory cells in the retina. By optogenetically activating the amacrine cells, we were able to elicit inhibitory currents on bipolar cells independent of photoreceptor activation. Additionally, we were able to pharmacologically block inputs from photoreceptors while simultaneously isolating individual GABAergic and glycinergic inputs to OFF bipolar cells. While these optogenetically elicited currents were distinct from previously recorded light evoked currents, we found this as an effect way to measure changes in SKF38393 mediated reductions in glycinergic currents on OFF bipolar cells. However, we did not observe changes in GABAergic inhibition as we have previously seen in light evoked currents. Together, this gives a novel perspective on how dopamine differentially shapes inhibitory changes in the inner retina.

">D1R- and D4R-Dependent Regulation of Retinal Light Adaptation in Diabetes</a></h4>

              
                Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is considered a neurovascular disease, and key clinical features show impairments in visual acuity and electroretinogram (ERG) recordings. Dopamine, a critical regulator of light adaptation, is also reduced in diabetes and supplementation of dopamine or injection of dopamine agonists improve visual deficits in diabetic rodents and humans. We sought to examine how blocking D4Rs and D1Rs would affect ERG signaling in 6-week diabetic rodents. Blocking D4Rs with L745,870 significantly reduced dark-adapted A-wave amplitude in DM, but not non-DM retinas, with no change in a-wave implicit timing, suggesting diabetic alterations in D4R signaling in photoreceptors. Light-adapted (LA) recordings revealed blocking D4Rs significantly increased A-wave amplitude and delayed A-wave implicit timing in DM and non-DM retinas. B-wave amplitudes were elevated at the highest flash intensity, and rise time was significantly faster, indicating an inability to adjust to background light. D1R blockade with SCH-23390 had little effect on ERG recordings for both groups, aside from increased B-wave amplitude and delayed rise time in dark-adapted DM conditions towards the lower light intensities. While small, D4R blockade seems to have a bigger effect in DM conditions during light adaptation, suggesting that diabetes impairs the retinas ability to adjust to light adaptation. These studies show that dopamine signaling in diabetes is perturbed and an important avenue for future investigation.

">Calbindin-containing CA1 pyramidal cells support cognitive flexibility in spatial task in mice</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus, and particularly the dorsal CA1, is essential for spatial memory consolidation through sharp-wave ripple events (SWRs) that enable the transfer of information to cortical areas. Within the dorsal CA1, distinct pyramidal cell subpopulations of the deep and superficial layer may play distinct roles in the processing and updating of spatial information. Using a Cre-dependent mouseline, we were able to precisely target the superficial, Calbindin (CALB1+) PCs of the CA1. This allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the connectivity of CALB1+ CA1 PCs to their SWR-propagating excitatory output partners within the Subiculum (SUB), the burst-firing SUB PCs and their functional relevance in spatial memory consolidation and recall. Retrograde rabies tracing revealed heterogeneous innervation of the VGlut2+ bursting PCs by both CA1 PC sublayers, and showed that the majority of presynaptic inputs are located in the superficial CA1 PC layer. We were able to observe that this anatomically confirmed connection between CALB1+ CA1 PCs and both SUB PC subtypes is able to induce spiking more reliably in burst- than regular-firing SUB PCs. CNO-induced inhibition in a Barnes Maze task revealed that the experimental group showed reduced cognitive flexibility and were slower to adapt to re-location of the goal when CALB1+ CA1 PCs were inhibited during the recall (test), while both groups behaved similarly when consolidation was manipulated (training). Inhibition did not impact overall learning, strategy development or locomotor control. This suggests that CALB1+ CA1 PCs preferentially connect to bursting SUB PCs, and support cognitive flexibility needed to adapt to a changing environment, adding further proof to the functional relevance of laminar segregation of the CA1 and the hippocampus in spatial memory processes.

">An orthogonal TRAP enables intersectional genetic access to activated neurons in the mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                The study of neural circuits has been greatly enabled by methods for obtaining genetic access to activated neurons. However, these approaches typically tag neurons based on their response to only a single stimulus, which limits the ability to define precise subpopulations of cells. Here we describe an approach (X-TRAP) in which the activity-dependent expression of Flp recombinase is gated by branaplam, a small molecule that triggers splicing of the X-ON switch. We show that X-TRAP knock-in mice exhibit undetectable Flp recombination in the absence of drug and that branaplam treatment results in robust induction of recombination selectively in neurons that express FOS. Moreover, we show that X-TRAP is orthogonal to the widely-used TRAP system, such that these two approaches can be used in the same animal to label cells with Cre and Flp recombination in response to two different stimuli. We apply this strategy to map neural circuits that control food intake. This approach for intersectional, activity-dependent genetic labeling should enhance our ability to identify the neural correlates of behavior.

">Cellular coding of ingestion in the caudal brainstem</a></h4>

              
                The passage of food through the alimentary canal generates a series of feedback signals that are sensed by the brain and used to control behavior. Many of these signals converge on the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTS), a brainstem structure that is the direct target of the vagal sensory neurons that innervate the throat, stomach and intestines and detect ingested food. These vagal neurons are thought to transmit key gut-brain signals that trigger meal termination, but how this information is represented in the cNTS, and used to control behavior, is largely unknown. Here, we have used a preparation for single-cell imaging in the cNTS of behaving animals to characterize how food ingestion is encoded in the caudal brainstem. We find that when food is delivered directly to the stomach, thereby bypassing the oral cavity, cNTS neurons exhibit ramping activation that occurs over many minutes and depends on canonical gut-brain pathways. However, when the same food is consumed by mouth, most cNTS neurons exhibit phasic, seconds-timescale responses that are time-locked to oral contact of food or cues that predict food delivery. We show that this rapid feedback is due to a combination of mechanical, gustatory and nutritive signals signals from the mouth and throat and does not require canonical gut-brain pathways, including gut-innervating vagal afferents, although GI feedback modulates the duration of these pregastric responses. We show that one source of this rapid input is descending projections from the paraventricular hypothalamus, which track ingestion dynamics and are required for proper meal termination. These findings reveal that the caudal brainstem makes extensive use of pregastric signals that track the dynamics of ingestion for the rapid control of food consumption.

">Arsenic Trioxide Underpins Delayed Neuroinflammation and Impaired Synaptic Integrity involving Integrative Stress Response Signaling</a></h4>

              
                Arsenic trioxide (ATO), an industrial and environmental chemical with potential for accidental or intentional exposure, exerts profound neurotoxic effects. Its single acute exposure has been linked to delayed neurological and neurodegenerative outcomes. However, the molecular and cellular pathways driving these long-term manifestations remain poorly defined. In this study, combining human iPSC-derived neuronal and in vivo mouse model, we uncovered that the acute ATO exposure activates cellular stress pathway, which drives long-term neurotoxic and associated functional outcomes. We found that ATO induces integrated stress response (ISR) signaling in human iPSC-derived neurons. To model the impact of accidental ATO exposure in vivo, we administered a single high dose of ATO to C57BL/6J wild type mice. Four weeks post-treatment, ATO-exposed mice displayed neuropsychological symptoms and cognitive deficits. Brain analyses of ATO-challenged mice revealed elevated ISR activity marked by the increased phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2 and upregulation of the transcription factors, CHOP and ATF4. Transcriptomic profiling using bulk RNAseq revealed activation of pathways associated with stress and neuroinflammatory responses. Consistently, increased DNA damage and dysregulation of the STING-mediated innate immune response were also found in the brain of ATO-challenged mice. Pharmacological inhibition of the ISR with a small-molecule inhibitor, ISRIB mitigated ISR activation and preserved synaptic integrity in mouse hippocampal cells. In conclusion, our data identify ISR activation and DNA damage-driven immune dysregulation as key pathogenic drivers of ATO-induced delayed neurotoxicity and cognitive deficits and highlight ISR inhibitors as promising therapeutics to mitigate these effects.

">Sex-specific brain structural predictors and outcomes of adolescent depression trajectories</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Depressive symptoms often emerge and increase during adolescence, yet the neural predictors and long-term brain outcomes associated with depressive trajectories remain poorly understood. This study adopts a trajectory-based approach to explore the temporal relationship between brain structure and dynamic changes in depressive symptoms across adolescence. Methods: We used a large longitudinal adolescent neuroimaging sample across five annual waves (n = 11,862; mean age = 9.91 at baseline) from the ABCD study. First, growth mixture models were applied separately for males and females to identify distinct developmental trajectories of depressive symptoms. We then used linear mixed-effects models to identify which baseline brain structural features differentiated trajectory classes, and how these trajectories influenced subsequent brain structure. Results: We identified high-decreasing, stable-low, and low-increasing trajectories in females, and relatively stable high, moderate, and low trajectories in males. No baseline brain regions were found to be associated with female trajectories, whereas smaller global brain measures (total subcortical volume, cortical volume, and surface area) predicted the high trajectory in males. Regarding brain outcomes, a low-increasing trajectory in females was associated with smaller global subcortical and cortical volumes, while high and moderate trajectories in males predicted thinner global cortices. Additional trajectory-related regional brain alterations were observed in both sexes. Conclusions: These findings highlight distinct neurodevelopmental patterns linked to depressive symptom trajectories in males and females, underscoring the importance of a sex-specific and longitudinal approach to identifying neural risk and outcomes in adolescent depression.

">Multiple task-demands flexibly optimize neural geometry in human ventral temporal cortex</a></h4>

              
                A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to perform multiple tasks immediately upon instruction. Yet, the neural processes that implement such flexibility remain unclear. Using intracranial electrophysiology in epilepsy patients, we examined how representational geometries evolve as participants switched among three tasks - individuation, categorization, and conceptualization - on a trial-by-trial basis. Although tasks differed in the required representational geometries, neural representations across cortex were not immediately optimized following task cues. Instead, task-tailored geometries emerged gradually over successive stimulus repetitions within a trial. Ventral temporal cortex was the only region to exhibit task-specific adjustments for all three tasks, dynamically transforming within- and between-category distances in line with task demands. Importantly, these gradual representational changes were behaviorally relevant, predicting trial-level performance. Our results show that behavioral flexibility is supported by incremental, task-dependent refinement of representational geometry already within sensory cortex - far earlier in the processing hierarchy than previously thought.

                Background This research supports SDG 17, partnerships for goals, as it will focus on the relationship between the Cañariaco Project’s communication strategies and citizens’ environmental perceptions, promoting transparency, informed participation, and institutional trust at the local level. The study aims to determine the relationship between the communication strategies of the Cañariaco project and the environmental perception of citizens in a district of the province of Ferreñafe 2025, Peru. Methods The chosen methodology is quantitative, with a non-experimental, cross-sectional correlational design. The population consisted of 183 citizens, who were sampled using a representative sample of 125 participants using physical surveys composed of two previously validated instruments that assess the relevant constructs. Results The analysis revealed that, while people show a high level of environmental awareness, the outreach tactics of the Cañariaco project are generally not considered very impactful. We noted that a significant portion of the survey participants felt that these tactics are at a low or medium level, which highlights certain deficiencies in the clarity of the message, the dissemination channels, and the feedback received. However, it was also discovered that there is a group with strong environmental awareness, which indicates concern and understanding about environmental issues, beyond the communication initiatives of the project. Additionally, the collected data diverges from studies that propose a direct connection between outreach tactics and environmental awareness, suggesting that other aspects may be influencing how the community perceives things. Conclusions Consequently, it was concluded that the communication strategies of the Cañariaco project do not directly affect how the population perceives the environment. In reality, this perception is mainly built upon past experiences and the cultural values of the people. This shows us that simply improving external communication is not enough to foster trust and community participation.

                <p>The medial habenula (MHb) and its main projection target, the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), play an important role in mood/affect, anxiety, and the aversive experience associated with nicotine withdrawal. Given that MHb axons release glutamate onto IPN neurons, we investigated the expression and functional responses of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) in neurons of the rostral IPN (IPR) in male rats. After confirming mRNA expression of <I>Gria1</I> and <I>Grin1</I> iGluR subunits in IPR, we employed glutamate uncaging coupled with two-photon imaging and patch-clamp electrophysiology. IPR dendrites, which often contained spine-like protrusions suggestive of synaptic contacts, featured a variety of response profiles following localized glutamate uncaging. Pharmacology experiments confirmed functional &alpha;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid and <I>N</I>-methyl-<scp>d</scp>-aspartate iGluR responses in IPR neuronal somata. Rats were trained to self-administer nicotine or saline during 10 fixed ratio 1 sessions and seven intermittent access sessions. In rats with a history of nicotine self-administration, perisomatic IPR iGluR responses are reduced. Acute nicotine application to slices from drug-naive rats recapitulated the effect of nicotine self-administration. These results identify a mechanism, whereby nicotine, even acute nicotine, may reduce IPR neuron sensitivity to glutamate from MHb axons, which could play a role in the aversive response to nicotine withdrawal.</p>

                Background The study of the reproductive biology of pelagic fish species, such as Sarda chiliensis (Bonito), is essential for effective fisheries management and aquaculture development. Overfishing has significantly impacted the population of pelagic fish species, making it crucial to understand their reproductive cycles, including maturity stages and spawning periods, to ensure sustainable exploitation. Methods This study provides the first histological characterization of the early gonadal stages of Sarda chiliensis from northern Chile. A total of 444 specimens were collected from artisanal fisheries between December 2013 and June 2014. Gonadal maturity stages were identified using histological techniques, and a range of microscopic stains (Hematoxylin-Eosin, Van Gieson, and Periodic Acid–Schiff ) were employed to examine the cellular structure of the gonads. Results Two key gonadal stages—inactive and previtellogenic—were identified in females, while males exhibited both immature and mature stages. Histological observations revealed distinct characteristics of early gonadal development, including primary oocytes and spermatogonia, with evidence of early vitellogenesis in females. No mature females were observed, and the smallest mature female recorded was 48.5 cm in total length. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) exhibited temporal fluctuations, with a peak observed in February. Conclusions This study provides vital histological data on the early gonadal stages of Sarda chiliensis from northern Chile, offering a baseline for future reproductive studies and aquaculture initiatives. The absence of mature females in the sample highlights the need for broader temporal and spatial sampling to fully characterize the reproductive cycle. These findings are crucial for developing sustainable fisheries management strategies and improving broodstock conditioning for aquaculture.

                Narrative Curriculum Vitae (NCVs) are a type of CV focusing on written descriptions of researchers’ skills, experiences, collaborations, and achievements, which seek to promote more equitable and responsible research assessments. Despite an apparent shift by funding organizations towards the use of NCVs to reassess how researchers are evaluated, the extent of current NCV adoption is unclear. Therefore, we conducted a scoping review to answer the following: 1. Which research funding agencies currently provide NCVs templates for their applicants? and 2. What are the characteristics of said NCV templates? To this end, we employed grey literature searches to identify all existing NCV templates provided by research funding organizations. Our findings highlight several key insights. First, number of funders currently requiring NCVs remains low overall, although national granting agencies are among the early adopters. Second, some funders do not provide formal guidance on how to complete narrative CV’s—this may create barriers to uptake. Third, among the NCV templates identified, there are structural commonalities, although there is little insight into the evaluation of NCVs. As interest in NCVs grows, addressing these gaps will be essential to realizing their potential as a fairer and more holistic tool for research assessment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1344/v1?src=rss">Hybrid PSO-GA Metaheuristic Optimization for Comprehensive Student Performance Enhancement [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Students aim for well-rounded performance, and higher education institutions strive to support them. While written tests assess academic achievement, they do not fully capture skills like critical thinking, creativity, public speaking, and physical fitness. The proposed paper suggests a holistic optimization model involving a Hybrid PSO-GA (Particle Swarm Optimization - Genetic Algorithm) metaheuristic algorithm that would generate a more holistic student assessment platform that constitutes a fitness function that would evaluate students not only on exams but also on academic, co-curricular and extracurricular facets. The model formulates a constrained optimization problem where cognitive effort allocation is optimized under individual workload limits derived from factors such as cognitive capacity, time availability, fatigue, and task complexity. Proposed model evaluated in C++ and analyzed statistically in Python across three setups with population sizes of 25, 50, and 100, and up to 200 iterations. A previous survey-based study was considered in formulating datasets, and normalized cognitive workload scores were applied to five categories of tasks. The hybrid algorithm outperformed standalone Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization methods, achieving the highest mean fitness of 1.273 and the lowest standard deviation of 0.004. Statistical significance was confirmed using the Friedman and Nemenyi tests with p-values less than 0.0001, demonstrating the robustness and superior convergence of the hybrid model. The proposed approach provides a computationally intelligent and statistically robust framework for holistic student performance assessment, with implications for adaptive academic workload management and policy-driven educational enhancement.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1343/v1?src=rss">Validation of the diagnostic score for acute pancreatitis: a prospective study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a potentially life-threatening condition with a rising global incidence and mortality. Early diagnosis is critical for improving prognosis; however, in resource-limited settings such as Tunisia, access to lipase testing and imaging may be restricted, leading to delayed diagnosis. The PRE-PAN score was recently developed as a clinical diagnostic tool for AP, based on pain characteristics and other readily available clinical parameters. Methods We conducted a prospective monocentric study at the Rabta Hospital in Tunis, Tunisia, including patients who presented with epigastric pain between October 2024 and April 2025. The PRE-PAN scores were calculated for each patient. Lipase testing and/or CT scans were ordered based on the clinical suspicion. Statistical analyses included ROC curve evaluation to assess the diagnostic accuracy. Results A total of 200 patients were enrolled, with a median age of 56 years and female predominance (64%). Acute pancreatitis was diagnosed in 11.6% of the cases. Patients with AP experienced significantly more intense and radiating pain (p<0.001). The PRE-PAN score had an area under the ROC curve of 0.955 (p<0.001), indicating excellent diagnostic performance. A cutoff score >5.75 yielded a sensitivity of 87%, specificity of 85.5%, positive predictive value of 44.5%, and negative predictive value of 98%. Conclusion The PRE-PAN score is a highly sensitive and specific clinical tool for diagnosing acute pancreatitis. Its ease of use and strong diagnostic performance support its implementation as an early screening tool in emergency departments, particularly in settings with limited diagnostic resources.

Thermostability is an important property of proteins and a critical factor for their wide application. Accurate prediction of ΔΔG enables the estimation of the impact of mutations on thermostability in advance. A range of ΔΔG prediction methods based on machine learning has now emerged. However, their prediction performance remains limited due to insufficiently informative training features and little effort has been made to integrate feature calculation resources. Based on this, we integrated 12 computational resources to develop a pipeline capable of automatically calculating 1,547 features. In addition, a feature-enriched DDGWizard dataset was created, including 15,752 ΔΔG data. Furthermore, we performed feature selection and developed an accurate ΔΔG prediction model that achieved an <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> of 0.61 in cross-validation. It also outperformed several other representative prediction methods in comparisons with independent datasets. Together, the feature calculation pipeline, DDGWizard dataset, and prediction model constitute the DDGWizard system, freely available for ΔΔG analysis and prediction.

                <p>by Jimin Pei, R. Dustin Schaeffer, Qian Cong, Nick V. Grishin</p>

Recent advances in protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold2, have enabled identification of vast numbers of putative novel protein domains across the sequence space, many of which adopt structures dissimilar to known folds. Based on structural segmentation and classification, the Encyclopedia of Domains (TED) project recently cataloged more than 7400 low-symmetry, structure-based domains as candidate novel-fold (CNF) domains. To place these domains in their broader evolutionary and structural context, we applied DPAM (Domain Parser for AlphaFold Models), a complementary method that combines AlphaFold-derived confidence metrics with sensitive sequence and structure similarity searches, to parse domains for the AlphaFold models of proteins containing TED CNF domains. We identified 8044 DPAM domains with significant overlap with TED CNF domains, among which 2490 were confidently assigned to entries in the ECOD (Evolutionary Classification of protein Domains) structural classification hierarchy. Our results suggest that a substantial subset of TED candidate novel-fold domains are distant homologs of existing ECOD domains. Comparison of domain boundaries between TED and DPAM showed varied patterns: more than one-third of cases featured TED CNF domains largely embedded within DPAM domains—often representing insertions or extensions into enzymatic or repeat folds. A smaller fraction (17%) exhibited consistent domain boundaries between TED and DPAM. These consistently defined domains are often characterized by significant structural diversity, including long insertions and duplications. An even smaller subset showed the reverse relationship, with DPAM domains largely embedded within TED CNF domains. In these cases, DPAM effectively separated multiple structural units that TED grouped as single domains. Together, these findings highlight the complementarity of structural and evolutionary approaches for domain annotation and demonstrate the power of integrative methods, such as DPAM, in refining the classification of challenging protein folds and uncovering distant evolutionary relationships.

                <p>by Domenico Guarino, Ilaria Carannante, Alain Destexhe</p>

The activity of neurons in the central nervous system changes drastically across different states like asleep or awake, attentive or drowsy, behaving or resting. Neuromodulation supports these changes by altering neuronal excitability. Much work has been devoted to understanding the effects of neuromodulators on various neurons. However, we still lack a cohesive picture of how neuromodulation affects neuronal dynamics. Here, we provide an analytical framework to characterise neuromodulation.
First, we analyse electrophysiological data from published papers and extracte features for seven types of neurons from five areas of the human and rodent central nervous system, under the effect of five neuromodulators. Second, we describe this data using the widespread, simple, yet biologically accurate, Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire model (AdEx). Third, we use a dimensionality reduction technique to study the parameter space of the control and neuromodulated conditions. Fourth, we examine the dynamics of each neuromodulator through bifurcation and phase-plane analyses.
Our analyses revealed that: (i) different neuromodulators remap the parameters space of neurons into non-overlapping clusters, (ii) changes in electrophysiological properties induced by neuromodulators can be explained by transitions between dynamical regimes in the excitability landscape of neurons, and (iii) there are only two distinct neuromodulatory effects: “switching” – changing the spiking behaviour – and “scaling” – strengthening or weakening an existing behaviour. Leveraging this framework, we estimated the effect of neuromodulation in one species using data from another species.This study provides an integrative perspective on neuromodulation, offering experimenters and theoreticians a compact description of its impact on neuronal activity. The open-source Python-based workflow is modular and readily applicable to other datasets.

                <p>by Mackenzie M. Johnson, Kevin Sung, Hugh K. Haddox, Ashni A. Vora, Tatsuya Araki, Gabriel D. Victora, Yun S. Song, Julia Fukuyama, Frederick A. Matsen IV</p>

Antibodies play a crucial role in adaptive immunity. They develop as B cell receptors (BCRs): membrane-bound forms of antibodies that are expressed on the surfaces of B cells. BCRs are refined through affinity maturation, a process of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and natural selection, to improve binding to an antigen. Computational models of affinity maturation have developed from two main perspectives: molecular evolution and language modeling. The molecular evolution perspective focuses on nucleotide sequence context to describe mutation and selection; the language modeling perspective involves learning patterns from large data sets of protein sequences. In this paper, we compared models from both perspectives on their ability to predict the course of antibody affinity maturation along phylogenetic trees of BCR sequences. This included models of SHM, models of SHM combined with an estimate of selection, and protein language models. We evaluated these models for large human BCR repertoire data sets, as well as an antigen-specific mouse experiment with a pre-rearranged cognate naive antibody. We demonstrated that precise modeling of SHM, which requires the nucleotide context, provides a substantial amount of predictive power for predicting the course of affinity maturation. Notably, a simple nucleotide-based convolutional neural network modeling SHM outperformed state-of-the-art protein language models, including one trained exclusively on antibody sequences. Furthermore, incorporating estimates of selection based on a custom deep mutational scanning experiment brought only modest improvement in predictive power. To support further research, we introduce EPAM (Evaluating Predictions of Affinity Maturation), a benchmarking framework to integrate evolutionary principles with advances in language modeling, offering a road map for understanding antibody evolution and improving predictive models.

                <p>by Siyi Huang, Linfeng Jiang, Ming Yi, Yuan Zhu</p>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the study of cellular heterogeneity. A major challenge, however, lies in the prevalence of non-biological zeros—false measurements caused by technical limitations that mask a cell’s true transcriptome. This fundamental issue of distinguishing these artifacts from true biological zeros, where a gene is genuinely absent, remains a key hurdle for computational methods, as misclassification can distort biological signals during data recovery. To overcome this, we introduce D3Impute, a discriminative imputation framework built on three key innovations: (1) a distribution-aware normalization step that adapts to dataset-specific characteristics while preserving meaningful biological variation; (2) a dual-network discriminator that uses bulk RNA-seq data as a biological reference to accurately identify non-biological zeros while retaining the true biological zeros; and (3) a density-guided imputation engine that recovers expression values while maintaining local cellular neighborhood structures. Through comprehensive benchmarking against 12 state-of-the-art methods across six diverse datasets, D3Impute demonstrates consistent and significant improvements in essential downstream analyses, including cell clustering, trajectory inference, and differential expression detection. Furthermore, we provide an extensive practical evaluation of D3Impute, demonstrating its robustness across varying data qualities and providing clear guidelines for optimal application. By offering a robust, biologically informed, and user-oriented solution, D3Impute not only enhances scRNA-seq data analysis but also offers a generalizable framework for handling zero-inflated data in computational biology.

Long COVID, or Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), affects an estimated 10–20% of patients and presents persistent multisystemic symptoms. Although demographic and clinical factors, such as age, sex, and comorbidities, contribute to risk, the genetic mechanisms underlying this risk remain poorly defined. To address this gap, we developed a multi-omics framework that integrates Transcriptome-Wide Mendelian Randomization (TWMR), Control Theory (CT), Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL), Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network to identify putative causal genes and network drivers in Long COVID. Our approach prioritized 32 candidate genes, including 19 previously reported and 13 novel, with roles in the SARS-CoV-2 response, viral carcinogenesis, immune regulation, and cell cycle control. Enrichment analyses revealed a shared genetic architecture in syndromic, metabolic, autoimmune, and connective tissue disorders. Using causal gene expression profiles, we identified three distinct symptom-based subtypes of Long COVID, providing information on the heterogeneity of disease mechanisms and clinical presentation. Finally, we developed an open-source Shiny application for interactive exploration of these findings. Together, this integrative framework highlights novel causal mechanisms and therapeutic targets, advancing precision medicine strategies for Long COVID.

RNA abundance quantification has become routine and affordable thanks to high-throughput “short-read” technologies that provide accurate molecule counts at the gene level. Similarly accurate and affordable quantification of definitive full-length, transcript isoforms has remained a stubborn challenge, despite its obvious biological significance across a wide range of problems. “Long-read” sequencing platforms now produce data-types that can, in principle, drive routine definitive isoform quantification. However some particulars of contemporary long-read datatypes, together with isoform complexity and genetic variation, present bioinformatic challenges. We show here, using ONT data, that fast and accurate quantification of long-read data is possible and that it is improved by exome capture. To perform quantifications we developed lr-kallisto, which adapts the kallisto bulk and single-cell RNA-seq quantification methods for long-read technologies.

What seems obvious in one context can take on an entirely different meaning if that context shifts. While context-dependent inference has been widely studied, a fundamental question remains: how does the brain simultaneously infer both the meaning of sensory input and the underlying context itself, especially when the context is changing? Here, we study flexible perceptual inference—the ability to adapt rapidly to implicit contextual shifts without trial and error. We introduce a novel change-detection task in dynamic environments that requires tracking latent state and context. We find that mice exhibit first-trial behavioral adaptation to latent context shifts driven by inference rather than reward feedback. By deriving the Bayes-optimal policy under a partially observable Markov decision process, we show that rapid adaptation emerges from sequential updates of an internal belief state. In addition, we show that artificial neural networks trained via reinforcement learning achieve near-optimal performance, implementing Bayesian inference-like mechanisms within their recurrent dynamics. These networks develop flexible internal representations that enable adaptive inference in real-time. Our findings establish flexible perceptual inference as a core principle of cognitive flexibility, offering computational and neural-mechanistic insights into adaptive behavior in uncertain environments.

                <p>by Davide Chicco, Giuseppe Jurman</p>

A recent study by Faye Orcales and colleagues proposes a teaching curriculum on supervised machine learning applied to genomics data aimed at predicting antibiotic resistance. The article describes a traditional machine learning pipeline step-by-step in a way that is accessible to anyone, including novices. However, the authors provide a misleading piece of advice in the “Evaluating model performance” section, where they recommend that readers use accuracy and the F1 score for binary classification. We write this short formal comment on that article to reaffirm and explain why accuracy and the F1 score should be avoided in the evaluation of binary classification and why the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) should be employed instead. We also take this opportunity to warn readers about the dangers of <i>k</i>-fold cross-validation, which is suggested as a standard method for dividing data into training set and test set, but has several flaws and pitfalls.

                <p>by Creighton M. Lisowski, Gavin M. King, Ioan Kosztin</p>

Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) can create images of biomolecules under near-native conditions but suffers from limited lateral resolution due to the finite AFM tip size and recording frequency. The recently developed Localization Atomic Force Microscopy or LAFM (Heath et al., Nature 594, 385 (2021)) enhances lateral resolution by reconstructing peak positions in AFM image stacks, but it is less effective for flexible proteins with multiple conformations. Here we introduce an unsupervised deep learning algorithm that simultaneously registers and clusters images by protein conformation, thus making LAFM applicable to more flexible proteins. Using simulated AFM images from molecular dynamics simulations of the SecYEG translocon as a model membrane protein system, we demonstrate improved resolution for individual protein conformations. This work represents a step towards a more general LAFM algorithm that can handle biological macromolecules with multiple distinct conformational states such as SecYEG.

                <p>by Ana Paredes-Vázquez, Eva Balsa-Canto, Julio R. Banga</p>

Microbial communities, complex ecological networks crucial for human and planetary health, remain poorly understood in terms of the quantitative principles governing their composition, assembly, and function. Dynamic modeling using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is a powerful framework for understanding and predicting microbiome behaviors. However, developing reliable ODE models is severely hampered by their nonlinear nature and the presence of significant challenges, particularly critical issues related to identifiability.
Here, we address the identification problem in dynamic microbial community models by proposing an integrated methodology to tackle key challenges. Focusing on nonlinear ODE-based models, we examine four critical pitfalls: identifiability issues (structural and practical), unstable dynamics (potentially leading to numerical blow-up), underfitting (convergence to suboptimal solutions), and overfitting (fitting noise rather than signal). These pitfalls yield unreliable parameter estimates, unrealistic model behavior, and poor generalization. Our study presents a comprehensive workflow incorporating structural and practical identifiability analysis, robust global optimization for calibration, stability checks, and rigorous predictive power assessment. The methodology’s effectiveness and versatility in mitigating these pitfalls are demonstrated through case studies of increasing complexity, paving the way for more reliable and mechanistically insightful models of microbial communities.

                <p>by Harriet Longley, Christophe Fraser, Chris Wymant, Katrina Lythgoe</p>

HIV-1 is a well-studied example of a pathogen that has evolved an intermediate level of virulence that maximises transmission. For a trait to evolve it must be heritable, and although viral load—a proxy for disease severity—has been shown to be a heritable trait, it is surprising that specific heritable viral factors remain mostly elusive. Rapid within-host evolution is also expected to diminish heritability. We hypothesised that rather than a small number of mutations of large effect determining viral load, the number of slightly deleterious mutations could be key. As a proof of principle, we explored how viral load is expected to evolve within and between hosts using a nested modelling approach that links within-host evolution with epidemiological outcomes. For mutations of sufficiently small effect, a mutation-selection balance is gradually reached during infection, resulting in slow changes in viral load despite rapid rates of genomic evolution. In simulated epidemics, we generated realistic population distributions of viral loads and estimates of heritability. The existence of many slightly deleterious mutations provides a mechanism that can help to explain why viral loads change slowly during infection, broad distributions of viral loads among individuals, and why searches for viral factors that determine viral load have had limited success.

                <p>by Angus F. Chapman, Rachel N. Denison</p>

How does the visual system process dynamic inputs? Perception and neural activity are shaped by the spatial and temporal context of sensory input, which has been modeled by divisive normalization over space or time. However, theoretical work has largely treated normalization separately within these dimensions and has not explained how future stimuli can suppress past ones. Here, we introduce a dynamic spatiotemporal normalization model (DSTN) with a unified spatiotemporal receptive field structure that implements normalization across both space and time and ask whether this model captures the bidirectional effects of temporal context on neural responses and behavior. DSTN implements temporal normalization through excitatory and suppressive drives that depend on the recent history of stimulus input, controlled by separate temporal windows. We found that biphasic temporal receptive fields emerged from this normalization computation, consistent with empirical observations. The model also reproduced several neural response properties, including surround suppression, nonlinear response dynamics, subadditivity, response adaptation, and backwards masking. Further, spatiotemporal normalization captured bidirectional temporal suppression that depended on stimulus contrast, consistent with human behavior. Thus, DSTN captured a wide range of neural and behavioral effects, demonstrating that a unified spatiotemporal normalization computation could underlie dynamic stimulus processing and perception.

Why do we observe some plant phenotypes but not others? The multivariate phenotypic space occupied by individuals or species often reveals both limits and phenotypes strikingly deviating from main syndromes. These observations are usually thought to indicate, respectively, inviable trait combinations and unique phenotypes adapted to specific environments. However, the evolutionary drivers underlying trait covariations often remain unclear. Here, we characterized the phenotypic space of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> by comparing 713 wild accessions collected across the globe with 2,544 artificially-created recombinant individuals. This, combined with the detection of adaptive processes operating within species, allowed us to elucidate the roles of natural selection as a driver of phenotypic (co)variations within <i>A. thaliana</i>. We found that the phenotypic space of this species is constrained and driven by varying levels of divergent and stabilizing selection across different traits. Moreover, at the margins of the European geographic range, strong directional selection favored outlier phenotypes characterized by very late flowering and variation in a WRKY transcription factor gene. Genome analyses revealed that these extreme phenotypes may be explained by hybridization between ancestral and modern lineages of <i>A. thaliana</i>. Our findings demonstrate how interplays between population history and natural selection shape phenotypic diversity in a plant species.

                <p>by Vanessa Kay Miller, Kendal Broadie</p>

Synapse connectivity is optimized in response to environmental input in critical periods, characterized by experience-dependent, temporally-restricted, and transiently-reversible synapse pruning by glial phagocytes. This precise, targeted synaptic elimination process requires glial serotonergic intercellular signaling. We discover glia-to-glia communication between different glial classes is essential for experience-dependent synaptic pruning in a well-defined <i>Drosophila</i> juvenile brain olfactory critical period. We find ensheathing glia infiltrate specific target synaptic glomeruli in response to guiding odorant experience via 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R) signaling. Using cell-targeted tryptophan hydroxylase (Trhn) RNAi to block serotonin production, we discover serotonin signaling from ensheathing glia is required for experience-dependent synapse pruning. Using cell-targeted 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R RNAi, we find the serotonin receptor is required exclusively in astrocyte-like glia (ALG). Using cell-targeted 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R rescue in 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R null mutants, we discover the serotonin receptor mediates experience-dependent synapse pruning. Thus, glia-to-glia serotonin signaling between different glial classes mediated by 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors is necessary and sufficient for synapse elimination. We discover that ALG-targeted conditional 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R in mature adults induces experience-dependent synapse pruning indistinguishable from the critical period mechanism. Thus, astrocyte 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R signaling is sufficient to ‘re-open’ this characteristic critical period remodeling capability at maturity. We find astrocytic matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) induced by critical period odorant experience is required for experience-dependent synapse pruning downstream of 5HT<sub>2A</sub>R activation. We discover that ALG-targeted MMP-1 induction restores synapse pruning in the absence of 5HT<sub>2A</sub>R signaling. Taken together, we conclude that glia-to-glia serotonergic 5HT<sub>2A</sub>R signaling drives MMP-1 for experience-dependent infiltration phagocytosis synapse pruning, and can rekindle this remodeling capacity at adult maturity.

                <p>by Sabih Rashid, Richard Roy</p>

Developmental plasticity allows organisms to adapt to environmental stress and improve reproductive fitness. <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> adapts to starvation and other stressors by transiting through an alternate developmental stage called dauer, which allows them to remain quiescent for several months, and yet fully retain reproductive fitness when they resume development. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is essential for animals to passage through the dauer stage without reproductive consequence. The loss of AMPK leads to germline hyperplasia, dramatically reduced post-dauer fertility, and shortened dauer survival. We identified a putative RNA-binding helicase (HZL-1) that is targeted by AMPK. Disabling HZL-1 function rescues many dauer and post-dauer reproductive defects typical of the AMPK mutants. HZL-1 shares significant similarity with the conserved HELZ family of RNA helicases, possessing characteristic DEAH helicase motifs, a predicted ATP binding motif, and intrinsically disordered regions that are crucial for its localization and function. Curiously, HZL-1 is expressed and exerts its function in the intestine, yet its elimination suppresses the aberrant germ cell proliferation while restoring germline quiescence and subsequent post-dauer fertility in AMPK mutants. CLIP-seq data revealed that HZL-1 binds several mRNAs during the dauer stage, and thus when it is active in AMPK mutants, its regulation of these RNAs contributes to germline hyperplasia in the dauer germ line. The most enriched RNA bound and inhibited by HZL-1, <i>argk-1</i>, promotes fertility by suppressing TOR activity in the germ line of dauer larvae, thereby preserving germline quiescence. These findings underscore the intricate role of RNAs and RNA-binding helicases in the complex interplay of genetic signals that animals have acquired to ensure their effective transit through periods of environmental challenge.

                <p>by Athena L. Munden, Arjamand Mushtaq, Dominique S. Lui, Katherine M. Edwards, Daniel P. Higgins, Kasturi Biswas, Rachel M. Walker, Leah H. Crowley, Matthew J.

Promislow, Dana L. Miller, Amy K. Walker</p>

S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), produced by SAM synthases, is critical for various cellular regulatory pathways and the synthesis of diverse metabolites. Humans and many other organisms express multiple SAM synthases. However, loss of different synthase activity can have distinct phenotypic effects. For instance, in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> loss of <i>sams-1</i> leads to enhanced heat shock survival and increased life span, but loss of <i>sams-4</i> reduces heat stress survival. This provides a biological context to test the hypothesis that the enzymatic source of SAM impacts its function and to identify mechanistic connections. Here, we show that SAMS-1 contributes SAM to a variety of intermediary metabolic pathways, whereas SAMS-4 has a more limited role to support SAM-dependent protein transmethylation reactions. Mitochondria seem to be particularly impacted specifically by loss of <i>sams-1</i>; many mitochondrial metabolites are perturbed and there is an age-dependent decline of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene expression in these animals. We further demonstrate that reduced production of phosphatidylcholine in <i>sams-1</i>-deficient animals leads to mitochondrial fragmentation and subsequent loss of mitochondrial components. We propose that alterations in mitochondria are mechanistically linked to the increased survival in heat stress specific to <i>sams-1</i>-deficient animals.

                The increasing demand for ethically acceptable, economically viable, and translationally relevant animal models in biomedical research positions Danio rerio (zebrafish) as a prominent alternative to traditional rodent systems. This review provides an integrated analysis of zebrafish biology and delineates their expanding applications in pharmacological investigations and toxicological evaluations. Emphasis is placed on genetic homology with humans, optical transparency during embryogenesis, and suitability for high-throughput screening, which collectively support the model’s relevance in contemporary biomedical studies. The historical progression of zebrafish usage is outlined, and critical biological features, such as developmental kinetics, sexual dimorphism, and organogenesis are described to contextualize their utility in disease modeling. Zebrafish are examined for their capacity to assess acute, chronic, and specialized toxicity endpoints, including neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and endocrine disruption. Their roles in investigating inflammation, metabolic disorders, neurodegeneration, cancer, and infectious diseases are also reviewed. Technological advancements, including CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing and the development of transgenic lines, are discussed alongside innovations in imaging and screening methodologies. Regulatory frameworks, as well as compliance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), are addressed. The review concludes by evaluating the potential of zebrafish in precision medicine and their capacity to enhance early-phase drug discovery through scalable, cost-effective, and biologically relevant approaches.

                Background Myocardial ischemia is a dynamic, complex process characterized by hyperkalemia, acidosis, and ATP depletion. While these three conditions alter cardiomyocyte electrophysiology, it is difficult to discern how much each one individually contributes to the resulting changes in action potential (AP). In this study, we test whether machine learning can deconvolute these distinct ischemic patterns within a single AP. Methods We developed a multi-target regression model trained on data generated by the Luo-Rudy (1991) computational model of a ventricular cardiomyocyte, simulating a wide range of ischemic conditions. The model was designed to predict two continuous variables: extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]o) and intracellular pH (pHi). Results The model achieved high accuracy on a held-out test set, with mean squared errors (MSE) below 0.25 for [K+]o and below 0.01 for pHi. To further generalize this model, we applied this trained model to a structurally distinct model, the Ten Tusscher (2006) framework. We were able to accurately predict [K+]o and pHi from APs, demonstrating that the learned principles are robust. A feature importance analysis revealed that resting membrane potential (RMP) was the strongest predictor for [K+]o, while action potential duration (APD) is most important for predicting pHi, underscoring these distinct cardiomyocyte electrophysiological patterns Conclusions Our approach can distinguish distinct ischemic drivers and has potential for in silico drug screening and mechanistic analysis.

                The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has taken some measures to advance collective action to accelerate telehealth in the region. Still, it has encountered the problem of digital readiness and digital health preparedness disparities within the region. To maintain the consolidation of digital health utilization across ASEAN member states, this article offers policy recommendations to address the diverse approaches taken and compensate for capacity differences among members. Drawing on insights from published official policies, government health ministry websites of Southeast Asian nations, and ASEAN’s digital health policies, the article first reviews the diversities of digital technologies in a post-pandemic Southeast Asia and then assesses measures to enhance regional approaches. Several recommendations are presented: First, ASEAN can standardize regional frameworks for telehealth by sharing digital health transformation blueprints and leveraging ASEAN and ASEAN Plus forums to bridge divergent understandings and advance the region’s digital health initiatives. Second, ASEAN facilitates investment through a telehealth sandbox and fosters collaboration among stakeholders. Although the recommendations are consistent with the ‘ASEAN Way,’ lingering concerns in Southeast Asia’s telehealth landscape include different commitments and expectations, risks of privacy infringements, and the misuse of technology in the region’s authoritarian states.

                Molluscum contagiosum and human papillomavirus (HPV) are very common cutaneous infections with worldwide distribution, yet treatment options remain limited. Traditional therapies are invasive and have a high rate of recurrence, and newer topical agents available are costly. Here I discuss evidence supporting the hypothesis that the aluminum-based salts, utilized in the antiperspirant industry since the early 1900s, could have a therapeutic effect on skin lesions due to molluscum contagiosum, HPV and possibly other viruses. Clinical trials in this area are needed.

                Background The development of intercultural competences mediated by digital technologies has gained prominence in higher education, driven by academic internationalization and the advancement of virtual learning environments. However, questions remain regarding the most frequently studied competence dimensions, the geographic regions involved, and the methodologies employed. Methods A systematic literature mapping was conducted following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines to analyze scientific production from 2005 to 2024, sourced from Scopus, Web of Science, and SciELO. Inclusion criteria focused on peer-reviewed, open-access articles, in English or Spanish, addressing the integration of digital technologies in the teaching of intercultural competence. After screening 176 records, 23 studies were included for analysis. Results Scientific production was primarily concentrated in the Americas and Europe (78%), with Mexico (15%) and countries such as the United States, Spain, and Russia each accounting for 11%. The most frequent competence dimensions were adaptation and management (47.83%), intercultural knowledge (39.13%), communication skills (39.13%), and intercultural attitudes (39.13%). Competences such as cultural adaptability, intercultural awareness, and intercultural communication were the most frequently addressed, reflecting the need for flexibility and communication skills in multicultural contexts. Technologies like COIL (Collaborative Online International Learning) and immersive tools are emerging as effective strategies to promote intercultural learning, although areas such as innovative leadership (4.35%) and personal development (8.70%) remain underexplored. Temporally, there has been sustained growth in research since 2019, with peaks in 2021, 2022, and 2023. Conclusion Digital technologies show significant potential for the development of intercultural competences, but their implementation requires addressing structural, pedagogical, and equity-related gaps. This study lays the groundwork for future research and policies aimed at enhancing inclusive and sustainable intercultural education in digital environments.

                The human brain’s long-range axonal connections are the scaffolding for communication across functionally distinct areas. Yet knowledge of the human brain’s wiring diagram remains limited, largely due to longstanding technological challenges. Recent innovations in microscopy may now enable mapping human brain connectivity at the mesoscale (groups of neurons and their axons). In this review we describe the challenges of generating the wiring diagrams of the human brain, avenues forward, and reasons why such an effort is so important. We argue for building a human mesoscale connectome via a multimodal, multi-species, axon-centric approach, focusing on where axons begin and end to reconstruct connectivity across spatial resolutions. Finally, we consider the utility of a potential exemplar connectome for both clinical applications and research.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100366">Individual differences in tail risk sensitive exploration using Bayes-adaptive Markov decision processes</a></h4>

              
                Novelty is a double-edged sword for agents and animals alike: they might benefit from untapped resources or face unexpected costs or dangers such as predation. The conventional exploration/exploitation tradeoff is thus colored by risk sensitivity. A wealth of experiments has shown how animals solve this dilemma, for example, using intermittent approach. However, there are large individual differences in the nature of approach, and modeling has yet to elucidate how this might be based on animals’ differing prior expectations about reward and threat, and differing degrees of risk aversion. To capture these factors, we built a Bayes-adaptive Markov decision process model with three key components: an adaptive hazard function capturing potential predation, an intrinsic reward function providing the urge to explore, and a conditional value at risk (CVaR) objective, which is a contemporary measure of trait risk sensitivity. We fit this model to a coarse-grain abstraction of the behavior of 26 animals who freely explored a novel object in an open-field arena. We show that the model captures both quantitative (frequency, duration of exploratory bouts) and qualitative (with distinguished, cautious, tail-behind approach) features of behavior, including the substantial idiosyncrasies that were observed. Some animals begin with cautious exploration and quickly transition to a confident approach to maximize exploration for reward; we classify them as potentially more risk neutral and enjoying a flexible hazard prior. By contrast, other animals only ever approach in a cautious manner and display a form of self-censoring; they are characterized by potential risk aversion and high and inflexible hazard priors. Explaining risk-sensitive exploration using factorized parameters of reinforcement learning models could aid in the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric abnormalities such as anxiety disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106792">C. elegans food choice exhibits effort discounting-like behavior</a></h4>

              
                Cost–benefit decisions are ubiquitous in both human and animal behavior. Economists have developed formal models of cost–benefit decision-making by focusing on discounting behavior, the devaluation of a reward based on the costs associated with it. The phylogenetic limits of discounting behavior remain unknown. Here, we provide evidence that the nematode <i>C. elegans</i> exhibits behavior closely resembling effort discounting. Given a choice between food options that are easy or difficult to consume, worms devalue the latter in a manner predicted by economic models. We identified a plausible mechanism for this behavior based on differential rates of leaving food patches and demonstrated that this mechanism is disrupted by deficits in dopamine signaling, as in rodents. Together, these results establish <i>C. elegans</i> as a potential invertebrate model for discounting behavior and set new phylogenetic bounds on this type of cost–benefit decision-making.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107012">Cross-species standardised cortico-subcortical tractography</a></h4>

              
                Despite their importance for brain function, cortico-subcortical white matter tracts are under-represented in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging tractography studies. Their non-invasive mapping is more challenging and less explored compared to other major cortico-cortical bundles. We introduce a set of standardised tractography protocols for delineating tracts between the cortex and various deep subcortical structures, including the caudate, putamen, amygdala, thalamus, and hippocampus. To enable comparative studies, our protocols are designed for both human and macaque brains. We demonstrate how tractography reconstructions follow topographical principles obtained from tracers in the macaque and how these translate to humans. We show that the proposed protocols are robust against data quality and preserve aspects of individual variability stemming from family structure in humans. Lastly, we demonstrate the value of these species-matched protocols in mapping homologous grey matter regions in humans and macaques, both in cortex and subcortex.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106062">Complex opioid-driven modulation of glutamatergic and cholinergic neurotransmission in a GABAergic brain nucleus associated with emotion, reward, and addiction</a></h4>

              
                The medial habenula (mHb)/interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) circuitry is resident to divergent molecular, neurochemical, and cellular components which, in concert, perform computations to drive emotion, reward, and addiction behaviors. Although housing one of the most prominent mu-opioid receptor (mOR) expression levels in the brain, remarkably little is known as to how they impact mHb/IPN circuit function at the granular level. In this study, our systematic functional and pharmacogenetic analyses in mice demonstrate that mOR activation attenuates glutamatergic signaling while producing an opposing potentiation of glutamatergic/cholinergic co-transmission mediated by mHb substance P and cholinergic neurons, respectively. Intriguingly, this latter non-canonical augmentation is developmentally regulated only emerging during later postnatal stages. In addition, we reveal that specific potassium channels act as a molecular brake on nicotinic receptor signaling in the IPN with the opioid-mediated potentiation of this arm of neurotransmission being operational only following attenuation of Kv1 function. Thus, mORs play a complex role in shaping the salience of distinct afferent inputs and transmitter modalities that ultimately influence synaptic recruitment of downstream GABAergic IPN neurons. Together, these observations provide a framework for future investigations aimed at identifying the neural underpinnings of maladaptive behaviors that can emerge when opioids, including potent synthetic analogs such as fentanyl, modulate or hijack this circuitry during the vulnerable stages of adolescence and in adulthood.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106273">Cerebellar Purkinje cell stripe patterns reveal a differential vulnerability and resistance to cell loss during normal aging in mice</a></h4>

              
                Age-related neurodegenerative diseases involve reduced cell numbers and impaired behavioral capacity. Neurodegeneration and behavioral deficits also occur during aging, and notably in the absence of disease. The cerebellum, which modulates movement and cognition, is susceptible to cell loss in both aging and disease. Here, we demonstrate that cerebellar Purkinje cell loss in aged mice is not spatially random but rather occurs in a pattern of parasagittal stripes. We also find that aged mice exhibit impaired motor coordination and more severe tremor compared to younger mice. However, the relationship between patterned Purkinje cell loss and motor dysfunction is not straightforward. Examination of postmortem samples of human cerebella from neurologically typical individuals supports the presence of selective loss of Purkinje cells during aging. These data reveal a spatiotemporal cellular substrate for aging in the cerebellum that may inform how neuronal vulnerability leads to neurodegeneration and the ensuing deterioration of behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105875">Nanophysiology approach reveals diversity in calcium microdomains across</a></h4>

              
                Rapid and high local calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signals are essential for triggering neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals. In specialized bipolar ribbon synapses of the retina, these local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals control multiple processes, including the priming, docking, and translocation of vesicles on the ribbon before exocytosis, endocytosis, and the replenishment of release-ready vesicles to the fusion sites for sustained neurotransmission. However, our knowledge about Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals along the axis of the ribbon active zone is limited. Here, we used fast confocal quantitative dual-color ratiometric line-scan imaging of a fluorescently labeled ribbon binding peptide and Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators to monitor the spatial and temporal aspects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients of individual ribbon active zones in zebrafish retinal rod bipolar cells (RBCs). We observed that a Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient elicited a much greater fluorescence amplitude when the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator was conjugated to a ribeye-binding peptide than when using a soluble Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, and the estimated Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels at the ribbon active zone exceeded 26 μM in response to a 10 millisecond stimulus, as measured by a ribbon-bound low-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator. Our quantitative modeling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion and buffering is consistent with this estimate and provides a detailed view of the spatiotemporal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] dynamics near the ribbon. Importantly, our data demonstrates that the local Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels may vary between ribbons of different RBCs and within the same cells. The variation in local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals is found to correlate with ribbon size and active zone extent. Our serial electron microscopy results provide new information about the heterogeneity in ribbon size, shape, and area of the ribbon in contact with the plasma membrane.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102578">Joint profiling of cell morphology and gene expression during in vitro neurodevelopment</a></h4>

              
                Differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) toward neuronal lineages has enabled diverse cellular models of human neurodevelopment and related disorders. Here, we jointly profiled neuronal morphology and gene expression at single-cell resolution across 60,000 iPSC-derived cortical neurons at three developmental time points with Cell Painting (CP) and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). By modeling the relationship between morphological features and gene expression within our differentiation system, we annotated image-based features with biological functions and showed that while CP resolves broader neuronal classes than scRNA-seq, it complements transcriptomic data by quantifying the biological processes that drive neuronal differentiation over time, such as mitochondrial function and cell cycle. Further, we found that while over 60% of the cells resembled those seen in the fetal brain, 28% represented metabolically abnormal cell states and broader neuronal classes specific to <i>in vitro</i> cells. We show that iPSC-derived cortical neurons are nonetheless a relevant model for a range of brain-related complex traits, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and that disease heritability can also be captured in the morphological feature space. Finally, we applied CP to iPSC-derived neural progenitors from patients with Kabuki syndrome, revealing morphological signatures of precocious differentiation and altered cell cycling. These results highlight the potential of multi-modal single-cell characterization to reveal complementary and disease-relevant cellular and molecular phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108181">Acidocalcisome-like vacuoles constitute a feedback-controlled phosphate buffering system for the cytosol</a></h4>

              
                Cells experience strong variations in the consumption and availability of inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>). Since P<sub>i</sub> is an essential macronutrient but excess P<sub>i</sub> has negative impacts on nucleotide hydrolysis and metabolism, its concentration must be maintained in a suitable range. Conserved storage organelles, acidocalcisomes, provide this buffering function. We used acidocalcisome-like yeast vacuoles to study how such organelles are set up to perform this task. Our combined in vitro and in vivo analyses revealed that their ATP-driven polyphosphate polymerase VTC converts cytosolic P<sub>i</sub> into inorganic polyphosphates (polyP), which it transfers into the vacuole lumen. Luminal polyphosphatases immediately hydrolyse this polyP to establish a growing reservoir of vacuolar P<sub>i</sub>. Product inhibition by this P<sub>i</sub> pool silences the polyphosphatases, caps P<sub>i</sub> accumulation, and favours vacuolar polyP storage. Upon cytosolic P<sub>i</sub> scarcity, the declining inositol pyrophosphate levels activate the vacuolar P<sub>i</sub> exporter Pho91 to replenish cytosolic P<sub>i</sub>. In this way, acidocalcisome-like vacuoles constitute a feedback-regulated buffering system for cytosolic P<sub>i</sub>, which the cells can switch between P<sub>i</sub> accumulation, P<sub>i</sub> release, and high-capacity phosphate storage through polyP.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Successful learning often emerges through social interaction: what are the neural and behavioral systems that support this process? This ecological, multimodal study combines functional near-infrared spectroscopy hyperscanning with detailed behavioral and physiological measures in 27 unconstrained social learning interactions. Learning was supported by teacher–learner interbrain synchrony (interpersonal neural synchrony), over regions important for mutual understanding (temporoparietal junction) and communicative coordination (ventral premotor cortex). Joint attention and mutual gaze modulated the interpersonal neural synchrony–learning association in oppositive ways, motivating a dual-process model: during knowledge-building phases, learning is supported by informational uptake dynamic, with high joint attention, low interpersonal neural synchrony in regions for mutual understanding (temporoparietal junction) and coordination (right ventral premotor cortex), and high interpersonal neural synchrony in language-related areas (left ventral premotor cortex). In contrast, during moments of mutual grounding, learning is supported by high mutual gaze and high interpersonal neural synchrony over temporoparietal junction. Cross-brain general linear modeling revealed asymmetric neural dependencies linked to speaking and teaching roles in the left-hemisphere language network. These effects remained after controlling for nodding, gaze, and breathing, indicating that interpersonal neural synchrony reflects true social-cognitive alignment beyond sensorimotor coupling. Taken together, this study shows that successful learning arises from coordinated and nonlinear brain–body dynamics and positions interpersonal neural synchrony as a marker of mutual prediction during communicative social interaction.</span>

Five hundred fifty participants were grouped based on their accuracy rates in the 2-back task.

We used their functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the emotion processing task to investigate the differences in emotional distraction between two groups and the specificity of functional connectivity. We found that the H_WM performed faster, meaning they processed the target stimuli more quickly and were better at inhibiting distractions. The results of the psychophysiological interaction analysis further revealed that H_WM have stronger task-specific functional connections between the right amygdala and the emotion regulation network (ERN). Moreover, the ERN-right Amygdala connection was positively correlated with the accuracy of the task. These results suggest that individuals with high working memory are able to inhibit emotional distractions quickly and focus on the current task. This helps to understand the influence of cognition on emotions and promotes the further development of emotional intervention.</span>

Using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) during the Attention Network Test, we examined preresponse cortical activity in 47 adults to identify oscillatory markers of rapid responses. Faster responses were characterized by enhanced occipital theta power and reduced occipital alpha power, suggesting a functional interaction between cognitive control and sensory processing regions. A brief theta burst preceding fast responses, coinciding with an alpha plateau, indicates a cross-frequency interplay optimizing response execution. Increased theta/alpha ratio further supports a cortical state favoring efficient stimulus–response processing. These findings highlight cortical oscillatory mechanisms that govern response speed, supporting top–down attentional control models. By identifying EEG-based biomarkers of rapid decision-making, this study advances our understanding of cortical dynamics underlying sensorimotor integration.

No significant associations between inhibition-shifting and nodal centrality were observed in HCs.

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results from external mechanical forces causing brain dysfunction. Dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in TBI pathophysiology, but the role of miR-598-3p remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of miR-598-3p in TBI and explore its regulatory effects on inflammation in an LPS-induced microglial injury model. Serum miR-598-3p levels were measured via RT-qPCR in 137 TBI patients and 120 controls. ROC curves assessed its diagnostic and prognostic utility. TBI severity was classified by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, and outcomes were evaluated using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). In vitro, LPS-treated BV2 microglia were transfected with a miR-598-3p inhibitor to analyze inflammatory cytokine levels. miR-598-3p expression was significantly elevated in TBI patients versus controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and increased progressively with injury severity. ROC analysis demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing TBI severity (AUC = 0.892/0.905) and predicting poor prognosis (AUC = 0.891, sensitivity = 83.33%, specificity = 90.36%). High miR-598-3p expression correlated with elevated Marshall grades, neural injury markers (S100B, GFAP), and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-<i>α</i>). Multivariate analysis identified miR-598-3p as an independent risk factor for poor outcomes (OR = 5.03, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). miR-598-3p inhibition attenuated LPS-induced IL-6/TNF-<i>α</i> secretion (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Serum miR-598-3p demonstrates clinical utility as a biomarker for TBI diagnosis, severity grading, and prognostic evaluation. Its observed association with amplified microglial inflammatory responses suggests a potential mechanism involving regulation of neuroinflammation pathways.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is increasingly used for pediatric large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke, however, its role in isolated M2 occlusions remains underexplored. This study compared clinical outcomes in children with isolated M2 occlusion treated with EVT versus best medical therapy (BMT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This multicenter cohort study pooled data from 4 pediatric stroke registries (Save ChildS, KidClot, Pediatric LVO Study, and Save ChildS Pro). Children ages 28 days–17 years with isolated M2 occlusion presenting within 24 hours of last seen well were included. Primary outcome was the pediatric modified Rankin scale (ped-mRS) at 3 to 6 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in Pediatric National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (PedNIHSS), Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure (PSOM), and safety endpoints.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty patients were included, of whom 20 were treated with EVT (median age, 12 years; interquartile range [IQR], 6–15; 40% female) and 20 with BMT only (10 years; IQR, 5–14; 50% female). Baseline demographics were similar. EVT patients showed superior outcomes: median ped-mRS at 3 to 6 months was 1 versus 2 (<i>p</i> = 0.015). EVT resulted in greater PedNIHSS reduction from admission to day 7 (−9 vs −1, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and lower PSOM at 3 to 6 months (0.5 vs 2.5, <i>p</i> = 0.009). This benefit persisted at 24 months with a median ped-mRS of 1 (IQR, 0–2) in the EVT group and 2 (IQR, 1–3) in the BMT group (<i>p</i> = 0.012). One symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in the BMT group, and no deaths or access-site complications were reported.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In children with isolated M2 occlusion, EVT was associated with better functional outcomes and neurological recovery than medical therapy alone, with an acceptable safety profile. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>
