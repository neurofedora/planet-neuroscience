              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16096">BrainPrompt: Multi-Level Brain Prompt Enhancement for Neurological Condition Identification</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.16096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's Disease, are challenging to diagnose, particularly in the early stages where symptoms closely resemble healthy controls. Existing brain network analysis methods primarily focus on graph-based models that rely solely on imaging data, which may overlook important non-imaging factors and limit the model's predictive power and interpretability. In this paper, we present BrainPrompt, an innovative framework that enhances Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with knowledge-driven prompts, enabling more effective capture of complex, non-imaging information and external knowledge for neurological disease identification. BrainPrompt integrates three types of knowledge-driven prompts: (1) ROI-level prompts to encode the identity and function of each brain region, (2) subject-level prompts that incorporate demographic information, and (3) disease-level prompts to capture the temporal progression of disease. By leveraging these multi-level prompts, BrainPrompt effectively harnesses knowledge-enhanced multi-modal information from LLMs, enhancing the model's capability to predict neurological disease stages and meanwhile offers more interpretable results. We evaluate BrainPrompt on two resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) datasets from neurological disorders, showing its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, a biomarker study demonstrates the framework's ability to extract valuable and interpretable information aligned with domain knowledge in neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16504">Intelligent Depression Prevention via LLM-Based Dialogue Analysis: Overcoming the Limitations of Scale-Dependent Diagnosis through Precise Emotional Pattern Recognition</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.16504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing depression screening predominantly relies on standardized questionnaires (e.g., PHQ-9, BDI), which suffer from high misdiagnosis rates (18-34% in clinical studies) due to their static, symptom-counting nature and susceptibility to patient recall bias. This paper presents an AI-powered depression prevention system that leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze real-time conversational cues--including subtle emotional expressions (e.g., micro-sentiment shifts, self-referential language patterns)--for more accurate and dynamic mental state assessment. Our system achieves three key innovations: (1) Continuous monitoring through natural dialogue, detecting depression-indicative linguistic features (anhedonia markers, hopelessness semantics) with 89% precision (vs. 72% for PHQ-9); (2) Adaptive risk stratification that updates severity levels based on conversational context, reducing false positives by 41% compared to scale-based thresholds; and (3) Personalized intervention strategies tailored to users' emotional granularity, demonstrating 2.3x higher adherence rates than generic advice. Clinical validation with 450 participants shows the system identifies 92% of at-risk cases missed by traditional scales, while its explainable AI interface bridges the gap between automated analysis and clinician judgment. This work establishes conversational AI as a paradigm shift from episodic scale-dependent diagnosis to continuous, emotionally intelligent mental health monitoring.

                arXiv:2504.16869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model of the functional architecture of curvature sensible cells in the visual cortex that associates curvature with scale. The feature space of orientation and position is naturally enhanced via its oriented prolongation, yielding a 4-dimensional manifold endowed with a canonical Engel structure. This structure encodes position, orientation, signed curvature, and scale. We associate an open submanifold of the prolongation with the quasi-regular representation of the similitude group SIM (2), and find left-invariant generators for the Engel structure. Finally, we use the generators of the Engel structure to characterize curvature-sensitive receptive profiles .

                arXiv:2504.16917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding behavior, such as movement, from multiscale brain networks remains a central objective in neuroscience. Over the past decades, artificial intelligence and machine learning have played an increasingly significant role in elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying motor function. The advancement of brain-monitoring technologies, capable of capturing complex neuronal signals with high spatial and temporal resolution, necessitates the development and application of more sophisticated machine learning models for behavioral decoding. In this study, we employ a hybrid deep learning framework, an attention-based CNN-BiLSTM model, to decode skilled and complex forelimb movements using signals obtained from in vivo two-photon calcium imaging. Our findings demonstrate that the intricate movements of both ipsilateral and contralateral forelimbs can be accurately decoded from unilateral M1 neuronal ensembles. These results highlight the efficacy of advanced hybrid deep learning models in capturing the spatiotemporal dependencies of neuronal networks activity linked to complex movement execution.

Abstract: How can we make sense of large-scale recordings of neural activity across learning? Theories of neural network learning with their origins in statistical physics offer a potential answer: for a given task, there are often a small set of summary statistics that are sufficient to predict performance as the network learns. Here, we review recent advances in how summary statistics can be used to build theoretical understanding of neural network learning. We then argue for how this perspective can inform the analysis of neural data, enabling better understanding of learning in biological and artificial neural networks.

                arXiv:2504.16342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of excitation patterns in neural fields is an important topic in neuroscience. Neural field equations are mathematical models that describe the excitation dynamics of interacting neurons to perform the theoretical analysis. Although many analyses of neural field equations focus on the effect of neuronal interactions on the flat surface, the geometric constraint of the dynamics is also an attractive topic when modeling organs such as the brain. This paper reports pattern dynamics in a neural field equation defined on spheroids as model curved surfaces. We treat spot solutions as localized patterns and discuss how the geometric properties of the curved surface change their properties. To analyze spot patterns on spheroids with small flattening, we first construct exact stationary spot solutions on the spherical surface and reveal their stability. We then extend the analysis to show the existence and stability of stationary spot solutions in the spheroidal case. One of our theoretical results is the derivation of a stability criterion for stationary spot solutions localized at poles on oblate spheroids. The criterion determines whether a spot solution remains at a pole or moves away. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to discuss the dynamics of spot solutions with the insight of our theoretical predictions. Our results show that the dynamics of spot solutions depend on the curved surface and the coordination of neural interactions.

                arXiv:2504.16520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In neuroscience research, achieving single-neuron matching across different imaging modalities is critical for understanding the relationship between neuronal structure and function. However, modality gaps and limited annotations present significant challenges. We propose a few-shot metric learning method with a dual-channel attention mechanism and a pretrained vision transformer to enable robust cross-modal neuron identification. The local and global channels extract soma morphology and fiber context, respectively, and a gating mechanism fuses their outputs. To enhance the model's fine-grained discrimination capability, we introduce a hard sample mining strategy based on the MultiSimilarityMiner algorithm, along with the Circle Loss function. Experiments on two-photon and fMOST datasets demonstrate superior Top-K accuracy and recall compared to existing methods. Ablation studies and t-SNE visualizations validate the effectiveness of each module. The method also achieves a favorable trade-off between accuracy and training efficiency under different fine-tuning strategies. These results suggest that the proposed approach offers a promising technical solution for accurate single-cell level matching and multimodal neuroimaging integration.

                arXiv:2403.20239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate identification of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in the early neonatal period is essential for initiating therapeutic hypothermia (TH) within 6 hours of birth to optimize neurodevelopmental outcomes. We aimed to develop a simple decision-making tool for identifying term neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) based on features of conventional electroencephalograms (EEG) recorded within 6 hours of birth. EEG recordings from 100 full-term neonates with HIE were graded by pediatric neurologists for severity. Amplitude in slow frequency bands was analyzed, focusing on delta (0.5-4 Hz) spectral power. Temporal fluctuations of delta power characterized each HIE grade, with joint level and duration probability densities estimated for delta oscillation power. This study is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05114070). These 2D EEG representations effectively distinguish mild HIE cases from those requiring hypothermia, achieving 98% accuracy, 99% sensitivity, 99% positive predictive value, 94% negative predictive value, an F1 score of 99%, and a false alarm rate of only 6%. This system accurately discriminates mild from moderate or severe HIE, with only one mild case mistakenly identified as requiring hypothermia. Quantized probability densities of delta spectral features from early EEG (within 6 hours of birth) revealed significant differences between mild and moderate or severe HIE, enabling accurate discrimination of candidates for TH. Simple, interpretable biomarkers from early EEG can provide an efficient visual clinical decision support tool to identify full-term neonates with HIE eligible for therapeutic hypothermia.

                arXiv:2504.16155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces DATETIME, a new high-quality benchmark designed to evaluate the translation and reasoning abilities of a Large Language Model (LLM) on datetimes. A datetime is simply a date and a time, for example '11th.february.2023 ,1:12:31'. Datetimes are an interesting domain because they are intuitive and straightforward for humans to process but present significant challenges for LLMs. At the time of writing, no publicly available benchmark exists for systematically evaluating LLMs on datetime processing. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art models exhibit significant difficulty with tasks involving reasoning on datetimes, and that General Artificial Intelligence is still a distant aspiration. We hypothesize that working with datetimes necessitates translation and/or computation capabilities, and the tasks of the benchmark are organized accordingly. Significant dispersion in performance across models is observed with surprisingly poor performance even on apparently trivial tasks. Whilst frontier models such as ChatGPT, Claude and Llama3.1 have evidently been built and trained with datetime reasoning abilities, significant improvement is required for the open-source models.

Many efforts have been made towards the performance collapse issue caused by skip dominance with various regularization techniques towards operation weights, path weights, noise injection, and super-network redesign. It had become questionable at a certain point if there could exist a better and more elegant way to retract the search to its intended goal -- NAS is a selection problem. In this paper, we undertake a simple but effective approach, named Smooth Activation DARTS (SA-DARTS), to overcome skip dominance and discretization discrepancy challenges. By leveraging a smooth activation function on architecture weights as an auxiliary loss, our SA-DARTS mitigates the unfair advantage of weight-free operations, converging to fanned-out architecture weight values, and can recover the search process from skip-dominance initialization. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that the SA-DARTS can yield new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on NAS-Bench-201, classification, and super-resolution. Further, we show that SA-DARTS can help improve the performance of SOTA models with fewer parameters, such as Information Multi-distillation Network on the super-resolution task.

                arXiv:2504.16503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic regression is a technique that can automatically derive analytic models from data. Traditionally, symbolic regression has been implemented primarily through genetic programming that evolves populations of candidate solutions sampled by genetic operators, crossover and mutation. More recently, neural networks have been employed to learn the entire analytical model, i.e., its structure and coefficients, using regularized gradient-based optimization. Although this approach tunes the model's coefficients better, it is prone to premature convergence to suboptimal model structures. Here, we propose a neuro-evolutionary symbolic regression method that combines the strengths of evolutionary-based search for optimal neural network (NN) topologies with gradient-based tuning of the network's parameters. Due to the inherent high computational demand of evolutionary algorithms, it is not feasible to learn the parameters of every candidate NN topology to full convergence. Thus, our method employs a memory-based strategy and population perturbations to enhance exploitation and reduce the risk of being trapped in suboptimal NNs. In this way, each NN topology can be trained using only a short sequence of backpropagation iterations. The proposed method was experimentally evaluated on three real-world test problems and has been shown to outperform other NN-based approaches regarding the quality of the models obtained.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16227">Towards a Distributed Federated Learning Aggregation Placement using Particle Swarm Intelligence</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.16227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning has become a promising distributed learning concept with extra insurance on data privacy. Extensive studies on various models of Federated learning have been done since the coinage of its term. One of the important derivatives of federated learning is hierarchical semi-decentralized federated learning, which distributes the load of the aggregation task over multiple nodes and parallelizes the aggregation workload at the breadth of each level of the hierarchy. Various methods have also been proposed to perform inter-cluster and intra-cluster aggregation optimally. Most of the solutions, nonetheless, require monitoring the nodes' performance and resource consumption at each round, which necessitates frequently exchanging systematic data. To optimally perform distributed aggregation in SDFL with minimal reliance on systematic data, we propose Flag-Swap, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method that optimizes the aggregation placement according only to the processing delay. Our simulation results show that PSO-based placement can find the optimal placement relatively fast, even in scenarios with many clients as candidates for aggregation. Our real-world docker-based implementation of Flag-Swap over the recently emerged FL framework shows superior performance compared to black-box-based deterministic placement strategies, with about 43% minutes faster than random placement, and 32% minutes faster than uniform placement, in terms of total processing time.

Abstract: Compliant mechanisms achieve motion through elastic deformation. In this work, we address the synthesis of a compliant cross-hinge mechanism capable of large angular strokes while approximating the behavior of an ideal revolute joint. To capture the competing demands of kinematic fidelity, rotational stiffness, and resistance to parasitic motion, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem based on kinetostatic performance measures. A hybrid design strategy is employed: an efficient beam-based structural model enables extensive exploration of a high-dimensional design space using evolutionary algorithms, followed by fine-tuning with high-fidelity three-dimensional finite element analysis. The resulting Pareto-optimal designs reveal diverse geometric configurations and performance trade-offs.

                arXiv:2504.16763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many applications of computer vision require the ability to adapt to novel data distributions after deployment. Adaptation requires algorithms capable of continual learning (CL). Continual learners must be plastic to adapt to novel tasks while minimizing forgetting of previous tasks.However, CL opens up avenues for noise to enter the training pipeline and disrupt the CL. This work focuses on label noise and instance noise in the context of class-incremental learning (CIL), where new classes are added to a classifier over time, and there is no access to external data from past classes. We aim to understand the sensitivity of CL methods that work by replaying items from a memory constructed using the idea of Coresets. We derive a new bound for the robustness of such a method to uncorrelated instance noise under a general additive noise threat model, revealing several insights. Putting the theory into practice, we create two continual learning algorithms to construct noise-tolerant replay buffers. We empirically compare the effectiveness of prior memory-based continual learners and the proposed algorithms under label and uncorrelated instance noise on five diverse datasets. We show that existing memory-based CL are not robust whereas the proposed methods exhibit significant improvements in maximizing classification accuracy and minimizing forgetting in the noisy CIL setting.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03243">Evolutionary Optimization of Physics-Informed Neural Networks: Advancing Generalizability by the Baldwin Effect</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2312.03243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are at the forefront of scientific machine learning, making possible the creation of machine intelligence that is cognizant of physical laws and able to accurately simulate them. However, today's PINNs are often trained for a single physics task and require computationally expensive re-training for each new task, even for tasks from similar physics domains. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a pioneering approach to advance the generalizability of PINNs through the framework of Baldwinian evolution. Drawing inspiration from the neurodevelopment of precocial species that have evolved to learn, predict and react quickly to their environment, we envision PINNs that are pre-wired with connection strengths inducing strong biases towards efficient learning of physics. A novel two-stage stochastic programming formulation coupling evolutionary selection pressure (based on proficiency over a distribution of physics tasks) with lifetime learning (to specialize on a sampled subset of those tasks) is proposed to instantiate the Baldwin effect. The evolved Baldwinian-PINNs demonstrate fast and physics-compliant prediction capabilities across a range of empirically challenging problem instances with more than an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy at a fraction of the computation cost compared to state-of-the-art gradient-based meta-learning methods. For example, when solving the diffusion-reaction equation, a 70x improvement in accuracy was obtained while taking 700x less computational time. This paper thus marks a leap forward in the meta-learning of PINNs as generalizable physics solvers. Sample codes are available at https://github.com/chiuph/Baldwinian-PINN.

Abstract: We present the architecture of a fully autonomous, bio-inspired cognitive agent built around a spiking neural network (SNN) implementing the agent's semantic memory. This agent explores its universe and learns concepts of objects/situations and of its own actions in a one-shot manner. While object/situation concepts are unary, action concepts are triples made up of an initial situation, a motor activity, and an outcome. They embody the agent's knowledge of its universe's action laws. Both kinds of concepts have different degrees of generality. To make decisions the agent queries its semantic memory for the expected outcomes of envisaged actions and chooses the action to take on the basis of these predictions. Our experiments show that the agent handles new situations by appealing to previously learned general concepts and rapidly modifies its concepts to adapt to environment changes.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing is a relatively new discipline of computer science, where the principles of biological brain's computation and memory are used to create a new way of processing information, based on networks of spiking neurons. Those networks can be implemented as both analog and digital implementations, where for the latter, the Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are a frequent choice, due to their inherent flexibility, allowing the researchers to easily design hardware neuromorphic architecture (NMAs). Moreover, digital NMAs show good promise in simulating various spiking neural networks because of their inherent accuracy and resilience to noise, as opposed to analog implementations. This paper presents an overview of digital NMAs implemented on FPGAs, with a goal of providing useful references to various architectural design choices to the researchers interested in digital neuromorphic systems. We present a taxonomy of NMAs that highlights groups of distinct architectural features, their advantages and disadvantages and identify trends and predictions for the future of those architectures.

Abstract: Hashtag recommendation systems have emerged as a key tool for automatically suggesting relevant hashtags and enhancing content categorization and search. However, existing static models struggle to adapt to the highly dynamic nature of social media conversations, where new hashtags constantly emerge and existing ones undergo semantic shifts. To address these challenges, this paper introduces H-ADAPTS (Hashtag recommendAtion by Detecting and adAPting to Trend Shifts), a dynamic hashtag recommendation methodology that employs a trend-aware mechanism to detect shifts in hashtag usage-reflecting evolving trends and topics within social media conversations-and triggers efficient model adaptation based on a (small) set of recent posts. Additionally, the Apache Storm framework is leveraged to support scalable and fault-tolerant analysis of high-velocity social data, enabling the timely detection of trend shifts. Experimental results from two real-world case studies, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 US presidential election, demonstrate the effectiveness of H-ADAPTS in providing timely and relevant hashtag recommendations by adapting to emerging trends, significantly outperforming existing solutions.

                arXiv:2504.16005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by solving a wide range of tasks simply guided by a prompt. Yet their performance is highly sensitive to prompt formulation. While automated prompt optimization addresses this challenge by finding optimal prompts, current methods require a substantial number of LLM calls and input tokens, making prompt optimization expensive. We introduce CAPO (Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization), an algorithm that enhances prompt optimization efficiency by integrating AutoML techniques. CAPO is an evolutionary approach with LLMs as operators, incorporating racing to save evaluations and multi-objective optimization to balance performance with prompt length. It jointly optimizes instructions and few-shot examples while leveraging task descriptions for improved robustness. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets and LLMs demonstrate that CAPO outperforms state-of-the-art discrete prompt optimization methods in 11/15 cases with improvements up to 21%p. Our algorithm achieves better performances already with smaller budgets, saves evaluations through racing, and decreases average prompt length via a length penalty, making it both cost-efficient and cost-aware. Even without few-shot examples, CAPO outperforms its competitors and generally remains robust to initial prompts. CAPO represents an important step toward making prompt optimization more powerful and accessible by improving cost-efficiency.

                arXiv:2504.16020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce AlphaGrad, a memory-efficient, conditionally stateless optimizer addressing the memory overhead and hyperparameter complexity of adaptive methods like Adam. AlphaGrad enforces scale invariance via tensor-wise L2 gradient normalization followed by a smooth hyperbolic tangent transformation, $g' = \tanh(\alpha \cdot \tilde{g})$, controlled by a single steepness parameter $\alpha$. Our contributions include: (1) the AlphaGrad algorithm formulation; (2) a formal non-convex convergence analysis guaranteeing stationarity; (3) extensive empirical evaluation on diverse RL benchmarks (DQN, TD3, PPO). Compared to Adam, AlphaGrad demonstrates a highly context-dependent performance profile. While exhibiting instability in off-policy DQN, it provides enhanced training stability with competitive results in TD3 (requiring careful $\alpha$ tuning) and achieves substantially superior performance in on-policy PPO. These results underscore the critical importance of empirical $\alpha$ selection, revealing strong interactions between the optimizer's dynamics and the underlying RL algorithm. AlphaGrad presents a compelling alternative optimizer for memory-constrained scenarios and shows significant promise for on-policy learning regimes where its stability and efficiency advantages can be particularly impactful.

              <h4><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59094-6">Q&amp;A Europa Clipper mission</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 24 April 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59094-6">doi:10.1038/s41467-025-59094-6</a></p>NASA’s latest space probe Europa Clipper, was launched on October 14, 2024, and will study Jupiter’s moon Europa. Europa is covered by an icy crust and is thought to host a subsurface ocean of liquid water. Europa Clipper’s main mission objectives are to study the moon’s ice crust and its surface features, confirm the presence of a subsurface ocean, and determine its chemical composition. Ultimately, this mission will further our understanding of the potential habitability of icy moons in our solar system, such as Europa. In this Q&A we are talking with three scientists (Dr. Christopher Glein, Dr. Elodie Lesage and Dr. Annie Marinan) involved with Clipper, and what particular research questions they hope to answer during the mission.

                Background Co-infection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has an impact on high HBV replication and progression to liver cancer. These may lead to cross-resistance of drugs due to natural mutations or therapeutic pressure. These require continuous monitoring of HBV variants for better diagnosis and treatment strategies. Methods Convenience sampling was used to collect fifty archival sera from Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital. Sera were subjected to HBsAg screening using ELISA, DNA extraction, PCR amplification, Sanger sequencing, genotype prediction and mutation analysis. Results Of the 50 samples, 86% (N= 43/50) were HBsAg positive; 82% (N=41/50) PCR positive with 92% (N=38/41) sequenced and only 26 sequences were subjected to molecular characterization. The HBV sequences showed similarity to genotype A (73% [N=19/26]), genotypes G (5% [N=3/26]) and genotype c (15% [N=4/26]). Prevalence of the mutations in the surface region was (47% [N=18/38]); including diagnostic failure (K122R and T143S) and immune escape mutations (P127T, G145R, S207N, Y200T, E164D, Y206H and L209V). The mutations in the RT were at (36% [N=14/38]) with drug resistance mutations (DRM) at (50% [7/14]). Mutations showed resistance to lamivudine (LMV) at (35% [5/14]), telbivudine (LdT) at (29% [4/14]), (14% [2/14]) for entecavir (ETV) and (21% [3/14]) for adefovir (ADV). One sample had a combination of L180M, M204V, S202K, and M250I mutations. Conclusions Our findings highlight the prevalence of HBV genotype A in HIV-infected patients in South Africa. The study provides evidence of mutations linked to immune evasion and drug resistance; this infers that these mutations may have clinical implications for the diagnosis and treatment of HBV in HBV/HIV co-infected individuals. Further in vitro studies must be conducted to explore the impact of the identified mutation on the surface protein expression during diagnosis; phenotype impact of the mutant virus towards the antiviral drugs.

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/17/e0581242025?rss=1">Reducing Tinnitus via Inhibitory Influence of the Sensorimotor System on Auditory Cortical Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tinnitus is the subjective perception of a sound without corresponding external acoustic stimuli. Research highlights the influence of the sensorimotor system on tinnitus perception. Associated neuronal processes, however, are insufficiently understood, and it remains unclear how and at which hierarchical level the sensorimotor system interacts with the tinnitus-processing auditory system. We therefore asked 23 patients suffering from chronic tinnitus (11 males) to perform specific exercises, aimed at relaxing or tensing the jaw area, which temporarily modulated tinnitus perception. Associated neuronal processes were assessed using magnetencephalography. Results show that chronic tinnitus patients experienced their tinnitus as weaker and less annoying after completion of relaxing compared with tensing exercises. Furthermore, (1) sensorimotor alpha power and alpha-band connectivity directed from the somatosensory to the auditory cortex increased and (2) gamma power in the auditory cortex reduced, which (3) related to reduced tinnitus annoyance perception on a trial-by-trial basis in the relaxed state. No effects were revealed for 23 control participants without tinnitus (six males) performing the same experiment. We conclude that the increase in directed alpha-band connectivity from the somatosensory to the auditory cortex most likely reflects the transmission of inhibition from the somatosensory to the auditory cortex during relaxation, where concurrently tinnitus-related gamma power reduces. We suggest that revealed neuronal processes are transferable to other tinnitus-modulating systems beyond the sensorimotor one that is involved in attentional or emotional tinnitus modulation and provides deeper mechanistic insights into how and through which channels phantom sound perception might be modulated on a neuronal level.</p>

                <p>Perception, working memory, and long-term memory each evoke neural responses in the visual cortex. While previous neuroimaging research on the role of the visual cortex in memory has largely emphasized similarities between perception and memory, we hypothesized that responses in the visual cortex would differ depending on the origins of the inputs. Using fMRI, we quantified spatial tuning in the visual cortex while participants (both sexes) viewed, maintained in working memory, or retrieved from long-term memory a peripheral target. In each condition, BOLD responses were spatially tuned and aligned with the target's polar angle in all measured visual field maps including V1. As expected given the increasing sizes of receptive fields, polar angle tuning during perception increased in width up the visual hierarchy from V1 to V2, V3, hV4, and beyond. In stark contrast, the tuned responses were broad across the visual hierarchy during long-term memory (replicating a prior result) and during working memory. This pattern is consistent with the idea that mnemonic responses in V1 stem from top-down sources, even when the stimulus was recently viewed and is held in working memory. Moreover, in long-term memory, trial-to-trial biases in these tuned responses (clockwise or counterclockwise of target) predicted matched biases in memory, suggesting that the reinstated cortical responses influence memory-guided behavior. We conclude that feedback widens spatial tuning in the visual cortex during memory, where earlier visual maps inherit broader tuning from later maps thereby impacting the precision of memory.</p>

                <p>The brain comprises a complex network of interacting regions. To understand the roles and mechanisms of this intricate network, it is crucial to elucidate its structural features related to cognitive functions. Recent empirical evidence suggests that both feedforward and feedback signals are necessary for conscious perception, emphasizing the importance of subnetworks with bidirectional interactions. However, the link between such subnetworks and conscious perception remains unclear due to the complexity of brain networks. In this study, we propose a framework for extracting subnetworks with strong bidirectional interactions&mdash;termed the "cores" of a network&mdash;from brain activity. We applied this framework to resting-state and task-based human fMRI data from participants of both sexes to identify regions forming strongly bidirectional cores. We then explored the association of these cores with conscious perception and cognitive functions. We found that the extracted central cores predominantly included cerebral cortical regions rather than subcortical regions. Additionally, regarding their relation to conscious perception, we demonstrated that the cores tend to include regions previously reported to be affected by electrical stimulation that altered conscious perception, although the results are not statistically robust due to the small sample size. Furthermore, in relation to cognitive functions, based on a meta-analysis and comparison of the core structure with a cortical functional connectivity gradient, we found that the central cores were related to unimodal sensorimotor functions. The proposed framework provides novel insights into the roles of network cores with strong bidirectional interactions in conscious perception and unimodal sensorimotor functions.</p>

                <p>RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are important for posttranscriptional RNA processing, including pre-mRNA alternative splicing, mRNA stability, and translation. Several RBPs have been shown to play pivotal roles in the inner ear, whose dysfunction leads to auditory and/or balance impairments. Epithelial splicing-regulatory protein 1 (ESRP1) regulates alternative splicing and mRNA stability, and mutations in <I>ESRP1</I> gene have been associated with sensorineural hearing loss in humans. In <I>Esrp1</I> knock-out mouse embryos, alternative splicing of its target genes such as <I>Fgfr2</I> is impaired, which eventually result in cochlear development deficits. However, <I>Esrp1</I> knock-out mice die soon after birth because of complications from cleft-lip and palate defects, impeding further investigations at later postnatal ages. In the present study, we explored the role of ESRP1 in hearing using zebrafish as a model. We showed that <I>esrp1</I> and its paralog <I>esrp2</I> are expressed in the inner ear and certain anterior lateral line (ALL) neuromasts. Furthermore, our data suggested that Esrp1 and Esrp2 are required for the mechano-electrical transduction (MET) function of hair cells. RNA sequencing results indicated a significant decrease in the levels of several mRNAs in <I>esrp1/2</I> double knock-out larvae. Among the dysregulated genes are <I>tmc1</I> and <I>tmc2a</I>, which encode essential subunits of the MET complex. Further investigations demonstrated that Esrp1/2 could directly bind to <I>tmc1</I> and <I>tmc2a</I> mRNAs and affect their stability. Taken together, we showed here that Esrp1 and Esrp2 regulate the MET function of zebrafish sensory hair cells by modulating the stability of <I>tmc1</I> and <I>tmc2a</I> mRNAs.</p>

                <p>Mastering the associations between letters and their corresponding speech sounds (LSS) is pivotal in the early stages of reading development, requiring an effective reorganization of brain networks. Children with poor reading skills often show difficulties in LSS learning. To date, however, it remains unclear how the interaction of brain regions integral to the processing and integration of letters and speech sounds changes with LSS learning. Characterizing these changes and potential differences between children with typical (TR) or poor (PR) reading skills on both behavioral and neural levels is essential for a more comprehensive mechanistic understanding of reading impairments. In this study, we investigated brain network alterations underlying LSS learning and their association with reading skills using functional magnetic resonance imaging in 80 schoolchildren (6.9&ndash;10.8&nbsp;years, 36 females, 27 PR) with a wide range of reading skills. We applied a reinforcement learning drift-diffusion model to LSS learning data and analyzed the corresponding effective connectivity and activation measures in the brain. While both groups learned well, PR showed slower adaptation of responses than TR as trials progressed. This could be explained by a slower adjustment of the drift rate and decision boundary while learning and longer nondecision times. Alongside deviant connectivity in the network of visual, auditory, and associative brain regions, PR also showed reduced striatal modulation of connectivity from visual to audiovisual association areas throughout learning. These findings indicate impaired information transfer to integrative areas, which aids to explain the difficulties in achieving proficient reading skills from a neuroscientific perspective.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/17/e1551242025?rss=1">Striatal Dopamine Represents Valence on Dynamic Regional Scales</a></h4>

              
                <p>Adaptive decision-making relies on flexible updating of learned associations where environmental cues come to predict valenced stimuli, such as food or threat. Cue-guided behavior depends on a network of brain systems, including dopaminergic projections to the striatum. Critically, it remains unclear how dopamine signaling across the striatum encodes multivalent, dynamic learning contexts, where positive and negative associations must be rapidly disambiguated. To understand this, we used a pavlovian discrimination paradigm, where cues predicting food or threat were intermingled during conditioning sessions and their meaning was serially reversed across training. We found that male and female rats readily distinguished these cues and updated their behavior rapidly upon valence reversal. Using fiber photometry, we recorded dopamine signaling in three major striatal subregions&mdash;the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core, and the NAc medial shell&mdash;finding that valence was represented uniquely across all three regions, indicative of local signals biased for value and salience. Furthermore, ambiguity introduced by cue reversals reshaped striatal dopamine on different timelines: NAc signals updated more readily than those in the DLS. Together, these results indicate that striatal dopamine flexibly encodes stimulus valence according to region-specific rules, and these signals are dynamically modulated by changing contingencies in the resolution of ambiguity about the meaning of environmental cues.</p>

                <p>Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are gadolinium chelates and can leave gadolinium in brain regions after administration, causing damage to brain tissues. However, the exact effects of gadolinium on synaptic function and the underlying mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. Here, we report that gadolinium differentially modulates evoked and spontaneous synaptic transmission and induces bidirectional changes in the efficacy of evoked synaptic transmission in the mouse hippocampus in a concentration-dependent manner. Low-concentration gadolinium (100&nbsp;&mu;M) modestly potentiated evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs), while high-concentration gadolinium induced group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-, endocannabinoid (eCB)-, and purinergic P2Y1 receptor (P2Y1R)-dependent, presynaptically expressed long-term depression (LTD). Higher concentration of gadolinium (1,000&nbsp;&mu;M) also induced NMDAR- and mGluR-independent, partially P2Y13R-dependent, postsynaptically expressed LTD. Low-concentration gadolinium greatly increased miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency, while high-concentration gadolinium much more robustly increased its frequency and amplitude. Finally, we found that evoked EPSCs were not affected by a macrocyclic GBCA, gadoterate meglumine (Gd-GOTA, Magnescope). However, evoked EPSCs were enhanced by a linear GBCA, gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA, Magnevist), at 100&nbsp;&mu;M, a clinically relevant concentration in the human brain after repeated clinical GBCA administration and in the cerebrospinal fluid in the rodent brain during experimental GBCA administration. Thus, evoked and spontaneous synaptic transmissions are independently modulated by gadolinium. Furthermore, Gd-GOTA effectively chelated gadolinium; however, Gd-DTPA had side effects on the evoked synaptic transmission, presumably because it did not completely chelate gadolinium.</p>

                <p>Interval timing, the ability of animals to estimate the passage of time, is thought to involve diverse neural processes rather than a single central "clock" (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B33">Paton and Buonomano, 2018</cross-ref>). Each of the different processes engaged in interval timing follows a different dynamic path, according to its specific function. For example, attention tracks anticipated events, such as offsets of intervals (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B39">Rohenkohl and Nobre, 2011</cross-ref>), while motor processes control the timing of the behavioral output (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B14">De Lafuente et al., 2024</cross-ref>). However, which processes are involved and how they are orchestrated over time to produce a temporal decision remains unknown. Here, we study motor preparation in the temporal bisection task, in which human (female and male) participants categorized intervals as "long" or "short." In contrast to typical perceptual decisions, where motor plans for all response alternatives are prepared simultaneously (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B41">Shadlen and Kiani, 2013</cross-ref>), we find that temporal bisection decisions develop sequentially. While preparation for "long" responses was already underway before interval offset, no preparation was found for "short" responses. Furthermore, within intervals categorized as "long," motor preparation was stronger at interval offset for faster responses. Our findings support the two-stage model of temporal decisions, where "long" decisions are considered during the interval itself, while "short" decisions are only considered after the interval is over. Viewed from a wider perspective, our study offers methods to study the neural mechanisms of temporal decisions, by studying the multiple processes that produce them.</p>

                <p>Methylphenidate (MP) is a widely used stimulant medication for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder that enhances brain dopamine signaling and improves attention. However, how dopamine stimulation alters brain state dynamics to support improved attention during task performance is still unclear. To address this, we employed a multimodal neuroimaging approach combining positron emission tomography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and behavioral tasks, to discover associations between dopamine signaling, brain dynamics, and cognition. Multimodal images were collected from 37 healthy adults under a single-blind, counterbalanced, placebo-controlled crossover study. Dynamic functional analysis was used to compare the alterations in dynamic features of brain states before and after MP. Subsequently, we analyzed the correlation between these brain state changes and baseline striatal D<SUB>1</SUB> and D<SUB>2</SUB> dopamine receptor (D<SUB>1</SUB>R, D<SUB>2</SUB>R) availability. We also examined alterations in dynamic brain states and their effects on visuospatial tasks. The results showed that MP primarily affected frontoparietal-dominant activated (FPN+), somatomotor-dominant activated (SOM+), and visual-dominant suppressed (VIS&ndash;) brain states. Specifically, the dwell time and fractional occupancy exhibited significant increases within the FPN+ and VIS&ndash; and an opposite trend within the SOM+. Furthermore, the increase of dwell time in FPN+, which was positively correlated with baseline striatal D<SUB>1</SUB>R availability, was also associated with quicker response in the 2-ball-track task, but not significantly for the 3-ball-track task. The findings suggest that MP's enhancement of brain states with FPN+ and VIS&ndash; while decreasing SOM+, in part through D<SUB>1</SUB>R signaling might underlie MP's improvement of attention for low demanding tasks in healthy populations.</p>

                <p>Navigating space and forming memories based on spatial experience are crucial for survival, including storing memories in an allocentric (map-like) framework and conversion into egocentric (body-centered) action. The hippocampus and parietal cortex (PC) comprise a network for coordinating these reference frames, though the mechanism remains unclear. We used a task requiring remembering previous spatial locations to make correct future action and observed that hippocampus can encode the allocentric place, while PC encodes upcoming actions and relays this to hippocampus. Transformation from location to action unfolds gradually, with "Came From" signals diminishing and future action representations strengthening. PC sometimes encodes previous spatial locations in a route-based reference frame and conveys this to hippocampus. The signal for the future location appears first in PC, and then in hippocampus, in the form of an egocentric direction of future goal locations, suggesting egocentric encoding recently observed in hippocampus may originate in PC (or another "upstream" structure). Bidirectional signaling is apparent between PC and hippocampus and suggests a coordinated mechanism for integrating allocentric, route-centered, and egocentric spatial reference frames at the network level during navigation.</p>

                <p>The motor system adapts its output in response to experienced errors to maintain effective movement in a dynamic environment. This learning is thought to utilize sensory prediction errors, the discrepancy between predicted and observed sensory feedback, to update internal models that map motor outputs to sensory states. However, it remains unclear what sensory information is relevant (e.g., the extent to which sensory predictions depend on visual feedback features). We explored this topic by measuring the transfer of visuomotor adaptation across two contexts where input movements created visual motion in opposite directions by either (1) translating a cursor across a static environment or (2) causing the environment to move toward a static cursor (272 participants: 94 male, 175 female). We hypothesized that this difference in visual feedback should engage distinct internal models, resulting in poor transfer of learning between contexts. Instead, we found nearly complete transfer of learning across contexts, with evidence that the motor memory was bound to the planned displacement of the hand rather than visual features of the task space. Our results suggest that internal model adaptation is not tied to the exact nature of the sensory feedback that results from movement. Instead, adaptation relies on representations of planned movements, allowing a common internal model to be employed across different visual contexts.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/17/e1932242025?rss=1">Visual Statistical Learning Alters Low-Dimensional Cortical Architecture</a></h4>

              
                <p>Our brains are in a constant state of generating predictions, implicitly extracting environmental regularities to support later cognition and behavior, a process known as statistical learning (SL). While prior work investigating the neural basis of SL has focused on the activity of single brain regions in isolation, much less is known about how distributed brain areas coordinate their activity to support such learning. Using fMRI and a classic visual SL task, we investigated changes in whole-brain functional architecture as human female and male participants implicitly learned to associate pairs of images, and later, when predictions generated from learning were violated. By projecting individuals&rsquo; patterns of cortical and subcortical functional connectivity onto a low-dimensional manifold space, we found that SL was associated with changes along a single neural dimension describing covariance across the visual-parietal and perirhinal cortex (PRC). During learning, we found regions within the visual cortex expanded along this dimension, reflecting their decreased communication with other networks, whereas regions within the dorsal attention network (DAN) contracted, reflecting their increased connectivity with higher-order cortex. Notably, when SL was interrupted, we found the PRC and entorhinal cortex, which did not initially show learning-related effects, now contracted along this dimension, reflecting their increased connectivity with the default mode and DAN, and decreased covariance with visual cortex. While prior research has linked SL to either broad cortical or medial temporal lobe changes, our findings suggest an integrative view, whereby cortical regions reorganize during association formation, while medial temporal lobe regions respond to their violation.</p>

                <p>Human performance is endowed by neural representations of information that is relevant for behavior, some of which are also activated in a preparatory fashion to optimize later execution. Most studies to date have focused on highly practiced actions, leaving largely unaddressed the novel reconfiguration of information to generate unique whole task sets. Using electroencephalography, this study investigated the dynamics of the content and geometry reflected on the neural patterns of control representations during reconfiguration of information. We designed a verbal instruction paradigm where each trial involved novel combinations of multicomponent task information. By manipulating three task-relevant factors in a sample of 40 participants (26 females, 14 males), we observed complex coding schemes throughout the trial, during both preparation and implementation stages. The temporal profiles were consistent with a hierarchical structure: whereas task information was active in a sustained manner, the coding of more concrete stimulus features was more transient. Data showed both high dimensionality and abstraction, particularly during instruction encoding and target processing. Our results suggest that whenever task content could be recovered from neural patterns of activity, there was evidence of abstract coding, with an underlying geometry that favored generalization. During target processing, where potential interference across stimulus and response factors increased, orthogonal configurations also appeared. Overall, our findings uncover the dynamic manner with which control representations operate during novel recombination unique scenarios, with changes in dimensionality and abstraction adjusting along processing stages.</p>

                <p>The brain builds hierarchical phrases during language comprehension; however, the details and dynamics of the phrase-building process remain underspecified. This study directly probes whether the neural code of verb phrases involves reactivating the syntactic property of a key subcomponent (the "head" verb). To this end, we train a part-of-speech sliding&ndash;window verb/adverb decoder on EEG signals recorded while 30 participants read sentences in a controlled experiment. The decoder reaches above-chance performance that is spatiotemporally consistent and generalizes to unseen data across sentence positions. Applying the decoder to held-out data yields predicted activation levels for the verbal "head" of a verb phrase at a distant nonhead word (adverb); the critical adverb appeared either at the end of a verb phrase or at a sequentially and lexically matched position with no verb phrase boundary. There is stronger verb activation beginning at ~600&nbsp;milliseconds at the critical adverb when it appears at a verb phrase boundary; this effect is not modulated by the strength of conceptual association nor does it reflect word predictability. Time-locked analyses additionally reveal a negativity waveform component and increased beta-delta inter-trial phase coherence, both previously linked to linguistic composition, in a similar time window. With a novel application of neural decoding, our findings delineate the dynamics by which the brain encodes phrasal representations by, in part, reactivating the representation of key subcomponents. We thus establish a link between cognitive accounts of phrasal representations and electrophysiological dynamics.</p>

                <p>Compared to males, aggression is less frequently noticed in females. Fierce maternal-aggression to thwart the attack/threat of a male conspecific/intruder is transiently expressed as she defends her pups. The odor cues emanated by the intruder provoke aggressive behavior by robustly activating the ventral-premammillary nucleus (PMv) in the hypothalamic-attack area (HAA). But, how PMv activation triggers aggression is unclear. In view of neuropeptide cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART)'s potential to reconfigure neural circuits for behavioral demands, occurrence throughout aggression circuitry, and abundance particularly in PMv, we test the role of PMv<sup>CART</sup> in maternal and inter-male aggression in rats. Males/dams actively attacked the intruder; virgin females did not. The dams/males without intruder showed isolated c-Fos cells in PMv, but the intruder's presence triggered c-Fos-activation in different PMv-subdivisions in dams/males. Compared to dams without intruder, confrontation with intruder robustly activated PMv<sup>CART</sup>-neurons and augmented CART-ir in ventral-PMv and <I>cart</I>-mRNA in PMv-containing tissues in dams. Conversely, in males, the intruder's presence activated lateral-PMv<sup>CART</sup> neurons, but CART-levels remained unaltered. Intra-PMv CART-siRNA administration suppressed maternal-aggression, but male aggression was unaffected. Since PMv is strongly connected with the ventrolateral&ndash;ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) and medial preoptic nucleus (MPN), we test whether CART signaling to these nuclei triggers maternal aggression. While VMHvl showed stronger CARTergic-axonal input than MPN, immunoneutralization of CART in VMHvl, but not MPN, blocked maternal-aggression. CART may drive the circuit beyond HAA since VMHvl neurons contacted by CART-axons project to periaqueductal gray. We identify the engagement of vPMv and lPMv during maternal and inter-male aggression, respectively, and CART as a key mediator in the PMv&ndash;VMHvl pathway to express maternal-aggression in rats.  </p>

                <p>Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) will be key for effective personalized treatment plans (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B8">Cummings, 2023</cross-ref>). Significant difficulties in auditory processing have been frequently reported in many patients with mild cognitive impairment, the prodromal form of AD (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B59">Tarawneh et al., 2022</cross-ref>), making it an outstanding candidate as AD diagnostic biomarker. However, the efficiency of diagnosis with this parameter has not been explored. Here we show that when male mice with amyloidosis begin to show memory decline, changes in the auditory brainstem response (ABR) to clicks enable the reliable diagnosis of disease using a machine learning algorithm. Interpretation of the machine learning diagnosis revealed that the upper levels of the auditory pathway, including the inferior colliculus, were the probable sources of the defects. Histological analyses show that in these locations, neuroinflammation and plaque deposition temporally correlate with behavioral changes consistent with memory loss. While these findings are tempered by the caveat that they derive from amyloidosis mice, we propose that ABR measurements be evaluated as an additional rapid, low-cost, noninvasive biomarker to assist the diagnostic testing of early-stage AD.</p>

                <p>Synchronous activity of neuronal networks is found in many brain areas and correlates with cognition and behavior. Gamma synchrony is particularly strong in the dentate gyrus, which is thought to process contextual information in the hippocampus. Several network mechanisms for synchrony generation have been proposed and studied computationally. One such mechanism relies solely on recurrent inhibitory interneuron connectivity, but it requires a large enough number of synapses. Here, we incorporate previously published connectivity data of the dentate gyrus from mice of either sex into a biophysical computational model to test its ability to generate synchronous activity. We find that recurrent interneuron connectivity is insufficient to induce synchronous activity. This applies to an interneuron ring network and the broader dentate gyrus circuitry. Despite asynchronous input, recurrent interneuron connectivity can have small synchronizing effects but can also desynchronize the network for some types of synaptic input. Our results suggest that biologically plausible recurrent inhibitory connectivity alone is likely insufficient to synchronize the dentate gyrus.</p>

                Background Underwater gliders are widely used in marine applications for monitoring purposes. These gliders must withstand hydrodynamic forces and maintain its body stability. The underwater environments are highly unpredictable, and small changes in the environment can lead to significant instability in underwater vehicles. Methods This study uses different numerical techniques to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of a torpedo-shaped glider. A symmetric torpedo-shaped glider model was created and analyzed using a licensed version of ANSYS 20.1 Fluent tool. The behavior of the torpedo glider under various flow conditions was examined such as variation of grid test, change of turbulent models, the variation in the inflow boundary conditions involves varying the velocity from 10.16 m/s to 15.16 m/s in 1m/s increment and from 10.16 m/s to 7.66 m/s in 0.5 m/s, also six different models were analyzed. Results Research was also attempted with different turbulent models and the Spalart-Allmara model was producing least validation error of 1.28 % with a primary focus on nose optimization. By varying the nose length, the study aimed to identify the best-suited nose geometry to minimize drag force. The nose lengths were varied to 0.205 m and 0.19m, resulting in validation errors of 2.81% and 1.16%, respectively, the results are clearly explained in the sub sequent sections of this article. Conclusion In conclusion, this study has evaluated various modifications and their impact on drag force reduction. The application of Spallart-Allmara model resulted in an improvement of 1.28%. Decrease in velocity lead to a significant reduction in the drag force, with an improvement of 37.3%. The nose optimization also contributed to drag force; a nose length of 0.205m yielded a 3.37% improvement. While a 0.19m nose length resulted in a 1.67% reduction. This study helps researchers in hydrodynamics by optimizing geometry for drag reduction.

                Background In previous studies we have shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replicates in vitro in bacterial growth medium, that the viral replication follows bacterial growth, and it is influenced by the administration of specific antibiotics. These observations are compatible with a ‘bacteriophage-like’ behaviour of SARS-CoV-2. Methods We have further elaborated on these unusual findings and here we present the results of three different supplementary experiments: (1) an electron-microscope analysis of samples of bacteria obtained from a faecal sample of a subject positive to SARS-CoV-2; (2) mass spectrometric analysis of these cultures to assess the eventual de novo synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein; (3) sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 collected from plaques obtained from two different gut microbial bacteria inoculated with supernatant from faecal microbiota of an individual positive to SARS-CoV-2. Results Immuno-labelling with Anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein antibody confirmed presence of SARS-CoV-2 both outside and inside bacteria. De novo synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was observed, as evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNA is translated in the bacterial cultures. In addition, phage-like plaques were spotted on faecal bacteria cultures after inoculation with supernatant from faecal microbiota of an individual positive to SARS-CoV-2. Bioinformatic analyses on the reads obtained by sequencing RNA extracted from the plaques revealed nucleic acid polymorphisms, suggesting different replication environment in the two bacterial cultures. Conclusions Based on these results we conclude that, in addition to its well-documented interactions with eukaryotic cells, SARS-CoV-2 may act as a bacteriophage when interacting with at least two bacterial species known to be present in the human microbiota. If the hypothesis proposed, i.e., that under certain conditions SARS-CoV-2 may multiply at the expense of human gut bacteria, is further substantiated, it would drastically change the model of acting and infecting of SARS-CoV-2, and most likely that of other human pathogenic viruses.

                <p>by Yannick Jadoul, Taylor A. Hersh, Elias Fernández Domingos, Marco Gamba, Livio Favaro, Andrea Ravignani</p>

Animal acoustic communication contains many structural features. Among these, temporal structure, or rhythmicity, is increasingly tested empirically and modelled quantitatively. Accelerando is a rhythmic structure which consists of temporal intervals increasing in rate over a sequence. Why this particular vocal behaviour is widespread in many different animal lineages, and how it evolved, is so far unknown. Here, we use evolutionary game theory and computer simulations to link two rhythmic aspects of animal communication, synchronization and overlap: We test whether rhythmic accelerando could evolve under a pressure for acoustic overlap in time. Our models show that higher acceleration values result in a higher payoff, driven by the higher relative overlap between sequences. The addition of a cost to the payoff matrix models a physiological disadvantage to high acceleration rates and introduces a divergence between an individual’s incentive and the overall payoff of the population. Analysis of the invasion dynamics of acceleration strategies shows a stable, non-invadable range of strategies for moderate acceleration levels. Our computational simulations confirm these results: A simple selective pressure to maximise the expected overlap, while minimising the associated physiological cost, causes an initially isochronous population to evolve towards producing increasingly accelerating sequences until a population-wide equilibrium of rhythmic accelerando is reached. These results are robust to a broad range of parameter values. Overall, our analyses show that if overlap is beneficial, emergent evolutionary dynamics allow a population to gradually start producing accelerating sequences and reach a stable state of moderate acceleration. Finally, our modelling results closely match empirical data recorded from an avian species showing rhythmic accelerando, the African penguin. This shows the productive interplay between theoretical and empirical biology.

                <p>by Hanah Goetz, Rong Zhang, Xiao Wang, Xiao-Jun Tian</p>

Although the impact of resource competition on the deterministic behavior of synthetic gene circuits has been studied, its effects on gene expression noise remain obscure. In this work, we systematically analyze the role of resource competition in noise propagation within a genetic inhibition cascade circuit. We found that resource competition amplifies gene expression noise by introducing unexpected bistability and stochastic switching between the two stable states. This emergent bistability, driven by resource competition-mediated double negative feedback, allows one gene to dominate expression while suppressing the other in a “winner-takes-all” behavior. Our findings highlight the critical role of resource competition in shaping the noise dynamics and its propagation, underscoring the importance of considering these effects when designing and controlling synthetic circuits.

                <p>by Giulia Moreni, Rares A. Dorcioman, Cyriel M. A. Pennartz, Jorge F. Mejias</p>

Stimulation of specific cell groups under different network regimes (e.g., spontaneous activity or sensory-evoked activity) can provide insights into the neural dynamics of cortical columns. While these protocols are challenging to perform experimentally, modelling can serve as a powerful tool for such explorations. Using detailed electrophysiological and anatomical data from mouse V1, we built a novel spiking network model of a cortical column, which incorporates pyramidal cells and three distinct interneuron types (PV, SST, and VIP cells, specified per lamina), as well as the dynamic and voltage-dependent properties of AMPA, GABA, and NMDA receptors. We first demonstrate that thalamocortical feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) stimuli arriving in the column have opposite effects, leading to net columnar excitation and inhibition respectively and revealing translaminar gain control via full-column inhibition by layer 6. We then perturb one cell group (i.e., a cell type in a specific layer) at a time and observe the effects on other cell groups under distinct network states: spontaneous, feedforward-driven, feedback-driven, and a combination of feedforward and feedback. Our findings reveal that when a given group is perturbed, the columnar response varies significantly based on its state, with strong sensory feedforward input decreasing columnar sensitivity to all perturbations and feedback input serving as modulator of intra columnar interactions. Given that activity changes within specific neuronal populations are difficult to predict a priori in experiments, our model may constitute a useful tool to predict outcomes of perturbations and assist in experimental design.

Automatic shaping of perception by past experiences is common in many cognitive functions, reflecting the exploitation of temporal regularities in environments. A striking example is serial dependence, i.e., current perception is biased by previous trials. However, the neural implementation of its operational circle in human brains remains unclear. In two experiments with electroencephalography (EEG)/magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings and delayed-response tasks, we demonstrate a two-stage ‘repulsive-then-attractive’ past–present interaction mechanism underlying serial dependence. First, past-trial reports, instead of past stimuli, serve as a prior to be reactivated during both encoding and decision-making. Crucially, past reactivation interacts with current information processing in a two-stage manner: repelling and attracting the present during encoding and decision-making, and arising in the sensory cortex and prefrontal cortex, respectively. Finally, while the early stage occurs automatically, the late stage is modulated by task and predicts bias behavior. These findings might also illustrate general mechanisms of past–present influences in neural operations.

                <p>by Susanne S. Babl, Torfi Sigurdsson</p>

The hippocampus (HPC) supports spatial working memory (SWM) through its interactions with the prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, it is not clear whether and how the dorsal (dHPC) and ventral (vHPC) poles of the HPC make distinct contributions to SWM and whether they differentially influence the PFC. To address this question, we optogenetically silenced the dHPC or the vHPC while simultaneously recording from the PFC of mice performing a SWM task. We found that whereas both HPC subregions were necessary during the encoding phase of the task, only the dHPC was necessary during the choice phase. Unexpectedly, silencing of either subregion did not affect PFC neurons’ ability to represent the animal’s position, but did alter how it was represented. In contrast, only silencing of the vHPC affected their coding of spatial goals. These results thus reveal distinct contributions of the dorsal and ventral HPC poles to SWM and the coding of behaviorally relevant spatial information by PFC neurons.

                <p>by Benjamin Wetherall, David Bulmer, Alexandra Sarginson, Christopher Thomas, Suzanne Madgwick</p>

During meiosis I in oocytes, anaphase is triggered by deactivation of cyclin B1-CDK1 and activation of separase. Active separase plays an essential role in cleaving cohesin rings that hold homologous chromosomes together. Critically, separase must be inhibited until all chromosomes are aligned and the cell is prepared for anaphase I. Inhibition can be mediated through the binding of separase to either securin or cyclin B1-CDK1. The relative contribution of each inhibitory pathway varies depending on cell type. Recently, shugoshin-2 (SGO2) has also been shown to inhibit separase in mitotic cells. Here, we used a separase biosensor and perturbed the three inhibitory pathways during meiosis I in mouse oocytes. We show that inhibition mediated by either securin or cyclin B1-CDK1, but not SGO2, is independently sufficient to suppress separase activity. However, when both the securin and cyclin B1-CDK1 inhibitory pathways are perturbed together, separase activity begins prematurely, resulting in gross segregation defects. Furthermore, we characterized SGO2 destruction dynamics and concluded that it is not an essential separase inhibitor in mouse oocytes. The existence of multiple separase inhibitory pathways highlights the critical importance of tightly regulated separase activity during this unique and challenging cell division.

     alt="A Novel Mutation in CNTNAP1 Gene Causes Disorganization of Axonal Domains, Hypomyelination and Severe Neurological Deficits"/>
<p>Sell et al. report that a single amino acid change at glycine 350 to valine in mouse Cntnap1 disrupts protein function and compromises the paranodal domain organization and axo-glial junction formation, leading to neurological deficits, which are all rescued by neuronal expression of the wild-type <i>Cntnap1</i> gene. Our studies open opportunities for potential gene therapy for the <i>CNTNAP1</i>-associated neuropathologies.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p><i>CNTNAP1</i> encodes the contactin-associated protein 1 (Cntnap1) which localizes to the paranodal region in all myelinated axons and is essential for axonal domain organization and the propagation of action potentials. To date, close to 45 reported human <i>CNTNAP1</i> variants have been identified that are associated with dysregulation and disorganization of the axonal domains, resulting in various forms of congenital hypomyelinating neuropathies in children. Currently, no treatments are available for neuropathies caused by <i>CNTNAP1</i> variants, highlighting the importance of fully characterizing these mutations and their impact on Cntnap1 functions. To understand the importance of a novel human <i>CNTNAP1</i> likely pathogenic variant that changes glycine at position 349 to valine in a child who also carries a <i>CNTNAP1</i> truncation and displayed severe neurological deficits, we used <i>CRISPR/Cas9</i> methodology and introduced a single nucleotide substitution in the mouse <i>Cntnap1</i> gene, resulting in glycine at 350 to valine (<i>Cntnap1</i>
<sup>
   <i>G350V</i>
</sup>). Trans-allelic combination of <i>Cntnap1</i>
<sup>
   <i>G350V</i>
</sup> with a <i>Cntnap1</i> null allele (<i>Cntnap1</i>
<sup>
   <i>G350V/−</i>
</sup>) mimics human pathologies, recapitulating hypomyelination neuropathies <i>associated with CNTNAP1</i> mutations as well as loss of paranodal junctions and disorganization of axonal domains in myelinated axons. Expression of the wild type <i>Cntnap1</i> transgene in <i>Cntnap1</i>
<sup>
   <i>G350V/−</i>
</sup> mice rescued the mutant phenotypes and restored all neurological deficits. Our studies demonstrate that GGT (glycine) to GTT (valine) change in human <i>CNTNAP1</i> creates a recessive loss of function allele and lays the foundation for potential gene therapy studies aimed at treating <i>CNTNAP1</i>-associated hypomyelinating neuropathies in children.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Vascular NOTCH3 protein ectodomain aggregation is a pathological hallmark of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), a monogenic small vessel disease typically caused by cysteine-altering variants in <i>NOTCH3</i>. Given their high population frequency, these <i>NOTCH3</i> variants are an important genetic contributor to stroke and vascular dementia worldwide. Disease severity in CADASIL is highly variable and is mainly determined by the position of the pathogenic <i>NOTCH3</i> variant in the NOTCH3 ectodomain. Here, we aimed to investigate the association between NOTCH3 aggregation load in skin vessels, cysteine-altering <i>NOTCH3</i> variants, and disease severity in a prospective cohort study of 212 patients with CADASIL with 39 distinct cysteine-altering <i>NOTCH3</i> variants.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>NOTCH3 aggregation load in skin vessels was determined by calculating the NOTCH3 score; the fraction of skin vessel wall area positive for NOTCH3 staining. Variant-specific NOTCH3 scores were calculated for variants present in 10 or more participants, by averaging the NOTCH3 scores of individuals with that distinct variant. The associations between the NOTCH3 score, <i>NOTCH3</i> variants, and neuroimaging and clinical outcomes were investigated using multivariable linear mixed models, Cox regression, and mediation analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The NOTCH3 score was significantly associated with lifetime stroke probability and small vessel disease neuroimaging outcomes, but not with age. Variant-specific NOTCH3 scores reflected differences in disease severity associated with distinct <i>NOTCH3</i> variants.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest that differences in NOTCH3 aggregation propensity underlie the differences in disease severity associated with <i>NOTCH3</i> cysteine-altering variants, and show that <i>NOTCH3</i>-variant specific NOTCH3 scores can contribute to improved individualized disease prediction in CADASIL.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-455/v1?src=rss">Women and nature: Ecofeminist study in social media [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Social media has turned into an important way for ecofeminists to raise awareness, create supportive communities, and push for fairness in environmental matters. Women activists, influencers, and groups are using social media sites like Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube to bring attention to topics like climate change, sustainability, and the link between gender and environmental issues. Methods By taking Ecofeminism as a theory, the paper examines selected accounts from three different social media platforms viz, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube to explore how they reflect the theme of ecofeminism. Ecofeminism is a theory that highlights the connection between women and nature, advocating for their protection. Results Our findings establish that the principles of ecofeminist theory and the works of ecofeminists have moved beyond physical propagation and are now being actively disseminated on digital media platforms. Through various forms of media such as reels, videos, pictures, and animations, many social media accounts vividly demonstrate the close relationship between women and nature, the exploitation they face from patriarchal society and how they can be protected. Conclusion Since the people of the current age are highly engaged with social media, these platforms effectively communicate the concept of ecofeminism and its importance, motivating global audiences to treat, protect, and preserve both nature and women. This helps in creating an inclusive society and advancing a sustainable world, which is critical in today’s context of environmental degradation and social unrest. The paper contributes to the fields of ecofeminism, media studies, and the sustainable development goals established by the UN in 2015.

                Shah et al. show that the SLNCR-E2F1 complex drives melanoma progression by binding to the E2F1 DNA-binding domain. Blocking SLNCR-E2F1 complex formation without changing the levels of either SLNCR or E2F1 reduces melanoma invasion and extravasation, suggesting this RNA-protein interaction is a potential target for melanoma therapy.

                Lacroix et al. demonstrate that heat-induced activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade drives the formation of functional amyloid aggregates that protect cells from harsh environmental conditions. Here, activation of PI3K and AKT represses GSK3-mediated degradation of c-Myc, leading to upregulation of nucleating noncoding RNAs that mediate this physiological amyloidogenic event.

                Miller et al. demonstrate the m6A epitranscriptomic writer METTL3 and other components of the m6A-METTL-complex (MAC) is uniquely dysregulated in microglial cells during neuroinflammatory processes. Collectively, this work demonstrates the MAC may function as a major regulator of chronic neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative disease.

                <p>Nature, Published online: 23 April 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01173-1">doi:10.1038/d41586-025-01173-1</a></p>Quantum communication over long distances can be achieved by exploiting a property of light called coherence. The coherence-based exchange of a ‘quantum encryption key’ over an optical telecommunications network demonstrates the feasibility of implementing a large-scale quantum network in existing telecommunications infrastructure.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95964">Purging viral latency by a bifunctional HSV-vectored therapeutic vaccine in chronically SIV-infected macaques</a></h4>

              
                The persistence of latent viral reservoirs remains the major obstacle to eradicating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We herein found that ICP34.5 can act as an antagonistic factor for the reactivation of HIV latency by herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1), and thus recombinant HSV-1 with ICP34.5 deletion could more effectively reactivate HIV latency than its wild-type counterpart. Mechanistically, HSV-ΔICP34.5 promoted the phosphorylation of HSF1 by decreasing the recruitment of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1α), thus effectively binding to the HIV LTR to reactivate the latent reservoirs. In addition, HSV-ΔICP34.5 enhanced the phosphorylation of IKKα/β through the degradation of IκBα, leading to p65 accumulation in the nucleus to elicit NF-κB pathway-dependent reactivation of HIV latency. Then, we constructed the recombinant HSV-ΔICP34.5 expressing simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) env, gag, or the fusion antigen sPD1-SIVgag as a therapeutic vaccine, aiming to achieve a functional cure by simultaneously reactivating viral latency and eliciting antigen-specific immune responses. Results showed that these constructs effectively elicited SIV-specific immune responses, reactivated SIV latency, and delayed viral rebound after the interruption of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in chronically SIV-infected rhesus macaques. Collectively, these findings provide insights into the rational design of HSV-vectored therapeutic strategies for pursuing an HIV functional cure.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105132">Teichoic acids in the periplasm and cell envelope of Streptococcus pneumoniae</a></h4>

              
                Teichoic acids (TA) are linear phospho-saccharidic polymers and important constituents of the cell envelope of Gram-positive bacteria, either bound to the peptidoglycan as wall teichoic acids (WTA) or to the membrane as lipoteichoic acids (LTA). The composition of TA varies greatly but the presence of both WTA and LTA is highly conserved, hinting at an underlying fundamental function that is distinct from their specific roles in diverse organisms. We report the observation of a periplasmic space in <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> by cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections. The thickness and appearance of this region change upon deletion of genes involved in the attachment of TA, supporting their role in the maintenance of a periplasmic space in Gram-positive bacteria as a possible universal function. Consequences of these mutations were further examined by super-resolved microscopy, following metabolic labeling and fluorophore coupling by click chemistry. This novel labeling method also enabled in-gel analysis of cell fractions. With this approach, we were able to titrate the actual amount of TA per cell and to determine the ratio of WTA to LTA. In addition, we followed the change of TA length during growth phases, and discovered that a mutant devoid of LTA accumulates the membrane-bound polymerized TA precursor.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100737">Simply crushed zizyphi spinosi semen prevents neurodegenerative diseases and reverses age-related cognitive decline in mice</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative diseases are age-related disorders characterized by the cerebral accumulation of amyloidogenic proteins, and cellular senescence underlies their pathogenesis. Thus, it is necessary for preventing these diseases to remove toxic proteins, repair damaged neurons, and suppress cellular senescence. As a source for such prophylactic agents, we selected zizyphi spinosi semen (ZSS), a medicinal herb used in traditional Chinese medicine. Oral administration of ZSS hot water extract ameliorated Aβ and tau pathology and cognitive impairment in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia. Non-extracted ZSS simple crush powder showed stronger effects than the extract and improved α-synuclein pathology and cognitive/motor function in Parkinson’s disease model mice. Furthermore, when administered to normal aged mice, the ZSS powder suppressed cellular senescence, reduced DNA oxidation, promoted brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression and neurogenesis, and enhanced cognition to levels similar to those in young mice. The quantity of known active ingredients of ZSS, jujuboside A, jujuboside B, and spinosin was not proportional to the nootropic activity of ZSS. These results suggest that ZSS simple crush powder is a promising dietary material for the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases and brain aging.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97373">TAK1-mediated phosphorylation of PLCE1 represses PIP2 hydrolysis to impede esophageal squamous cancer metastasis</a></h4>

              
                TAK1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is a key regulator in a wide variety of cellular processes. However, the functions and mechanisms involved in cancer metastasis are still not well understood. Here, we found that TAK1 knockdown promoted esophageal squamous cancer carcinoma (ESCC) migration and invasion, whereas TAK1 overexpression resulted in the opposite outcome. These in vitro findings were recapitulated in vivo in a xenograft metastatic mouse model. Mechanistically, co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry demonstrated that TAK1 interacted with phospholipase C epsilon 1 (PLCE1) and phosphorylated PLCE1 at serine 1060 (S1060). Functional studies revealed that phosphorylation at S1060 in PLCE1 resulted in decreased enzyme activity, leading to the repression of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis. As a result, the degradation products of PIP2 including diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol IP3 were reduced, which thereby suppressed signal transduction in the axis of PKC/GSK-3β/β-Catenin. Consequently, expression of cancer metastasis-related genes was impeded by TAK1. Overall, our data indicate that TAK1 plays a negative role in ESCC metastasis, which depends on the TAK1-induced phosphorylation of PLCE1 at S1060.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104439">SFSWAP is a negative regulator of OGT intron detention and global pre-mRNA splicing</a></h4>

              
                O-GlcNAcylation is the reversible post-translational addition of β-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine to serine and threonine residues of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. It plays an important role in several cellular processes through the modification of thousands of protein substrates. O-GlcNAcylation in humans is mediated by a single essential enzyme, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). OGT, together with the sole O-GlcNAcase OGA, form an intricate feedback loop to maintain O-GlcNAc homeostasis in response to changes in cellular O-GlcNAc using a dynamic mechanism involving nuclear retention of its fourth intron. However, the molecular mechanism of this dynamic regulation remains unclear. Using an O-GlcNAc responsive GFP reporter cell line, we identify SFSWAP, a poorly characterized splicing factor, as a trans-acting factor regulating OGT intron detention. We show that SFSWAP is a global regulator of retained intron splicing and exon skipping that primarily acts as a negative regulator of splicing. In contrast, knockdown of SFSWAP leads to reduced inclusion of a ‘decoy exon’ present in the OGT retained intron which may mediate its role in OGT intron detention. Global analysis of decoy exon inclusion in SFSWAP and UPF1 double knockdown cells indicate altered patterns of decoy exon usage. Together, these data indicate a role for SFSWAP as a global negative regulator of pre-mRNA splicing and positive regulator of intron retention.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100968">APP β-CTF triggers cell-autonomous synaptic toxicity independent of Aβ</a></h4>

              
                Aβ is believed to play a significant role in synaptic degeneration observed in Alzheimer’s disease and is primarily investigated as a secreted peptide. However, the contribution of intracellular Aβ or other cleavage products of its precursor protein (APP) to synaptic loss remains uncertain. In this study, we conducted a systematic examination of their cell-autonomous impact using a sparse expression system in rat hippocampal slice culture. Here, these proteins/peptides were overexpressed in a single neuron, surrounded by thousands of untransfected neurons. Surprisingly, we found that APP induced dendritic spine loss only when co-expressed with BACE1. This effect was mediated by β-CTF, a β-cleavage product of APP, through an endosome-related pathway independent of Aβ. Neuronal expression of β-CTF in mouse brains resulted in defective synaptic transmission and cognitive impairments, even in the absence of amyloid plaques. These findings unveil a β-CTF-initiated mechanism driving synaptic toxicity irrespective of amyloid plaque formation and suggest a potential intervention by inhibiting the endosomal GTPase Rab5.

                Neurovascular coupling, linking neuronal activity to cerebral blood flow, is essential for brain function and underpins functional brain imaging. Whereas mechanisms involved in vasodilation are well-documented, those controlling vasoconstriction remain overlooked. This study unravels the mechanisms by which pyramidal cells elicit arteriole vasoconstriction. Using patch-clamp recording, vascular and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in mouse cortical slices, we show that strong optogenetic activation of layer II/III pyramidal cells induces vasoconstriction, correlating with firing frequency and somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase. Ex vivo and in vivo pharmacological investigations indicate that this vasoconstriction predominantly recruits prostaglandin E2 through the cyclooxygenase-2 pathway, and activation of EP1 and EP3 receptors. We also present evidence that specific interneurons releasing neuropeptide Y, and astrocytes, through 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, contribute to this process. By revealing the mechanisms by which pyramidal cells lead to vasoconstriction, our findings shed light on the complex regulation of neurovascular coupling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101322">Simultaneous polyclonal antibody sequencing and epitope mapping by cryo electron microscopy and mass spectrometry</a></h4>

              
                Antibodies are a major component of adaptive immunity against invading pathogens. Here, we explore possibilities for an analytical approach to characterize the antigen-specific antibody repertoire directly from the secreted proteins in convalescent serum. This approach aims to perform simultaneous antibody sequencing and epitope mapping using a combination of single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and bottom-up proteomics techniques based on mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We evaluate the performance of the deep-learning tool ModelAngelo in determining de novo antibody sequences directly from reconstructed 3D volumes of antibody-antigen complexes. We demonstrate that while map quality is a critical bottleneck, it is possible to sequence antibody variable domains from cryoEM reconstructions with accuracies of up to 80–90%. While the rate of errors exceeds the typical levels of somatic hypermutation, we show that the ModelAngelo-derived sequences can be used to assign the used V-genes. This provides a functional guide to assemble de novo peptides from LC-MS/MS data more accurately and improves the tolerance to a background of polyclonal antibody sequences. Following this proof-of-principle, we discuss the feasibility and future directions of this approach to characterize antigen-specific antibody repertoires.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98970">Diet modulates the therapeutic effects of dimethyl fumarate mediated by the immunometabolic neutrophil receptor HCAR</a></h4>

              
                Monomethyl fumarate (MMF) and its prodrug dimethyl fumarate (DMF) are currently the most widely used agents for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, not all patients benefit from DMF. We hypothesized that the variable response of patients may be due to their diet. In support of this hypothesis, mice subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS, did not benefit from DMF treatment when fed a lauric acid-rich (LA) diet. Mice on normal chow (NC) diet, in contrast, and even more so mice on high-fiber (HFb) diet showed the expected protective DMF effect. DMF lacked efficacy in the LA diet-fed group despite similar resorption and preserved effects on plasma lipids. When mice were fed the permissive HFb diet, the protective effect of DMF treatment depended on hydroxycarboxylic receptor 2 (HCAR2) which is highly expressed in neutrophil granulocytes. Indeed, deletion of <i>Hcar2</i> in neutrophils abrogated DMF protective effects in EAE. Diet had a profound effect on the transcriptional profile of neutrophils and modulated their response to MMF. In summary, DMF required HCAR2 on neutrophils as well as permissive dietary effects for its therapeutic action. Translating the dietary intervention into the clinic may improve MS therapy.

">Differential effects of neurodegenerative disorders on verbal creative idea generation and its cognitive cornerstones</a></h4>

              
                Clinical research has documented a heterogeneous effect of neurodegenerative disorders on creativity. Some disorders are associated with impaired creative performance, while others may preserve, or even enhance, it. However, the underlying cognitive mechanisms that give rise to the heterogeneous behavioural manifestations remain poorly understood. From a theory-driven approach, we conducted a neuropsychological investigation to examine how frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) differentially affected the cognitive mechanisms underlying creative thought (semantic cognition, episodic memory, executive control functions). In parallel, we assessed participants' verbal creative idea generation performance using the ideational fluency task (also known as the Alternate Uses Task). We analysed data from 24 individuals with FTLD [clinical consensus diagnosis corticobasal syndrome (CBS: n=20) or progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP: n=4)], 24 individuals with clinical consensus diagnosis AD, and 24 healthy individuals. We reached four major conclusions. First, while both disease groups exhibited deficits in controlled semantic retrieval and executive control functions, only participants with AD exhibited degradation in semantic representations and episodic memory. Second, both disease groups generated fewer responses in both typical and creative conditions across objects that were context-free - i.e., associated with multiple contexts (e.g., brick) and context-bound -i.e., associated with a dominant context (e.g., table knife). Third, when given a context-free object prompt, the ability to generate novel responses appeared to be preserved in participants with FTLD, which contrasted with an impaired ability when prompted to give creative uses for the context-bound object. Fourth, participants with AD produced similar levels of response novelty for both context-free and context-bound objects. From a clinical-cognitive neuroscience perspective, this study demonstrates that distinct cognitive profiles resulting from different neurodegenerative conditions yield differential effects on creative thought. As the first study to show that the contextual information of semantic stimuli can mediate the novelty of verbal responses, we suggest that future research should carefully examine how this factor influences creative task performance.

">Neuroanatomy Reflects Individual Variability In Impulsivity in Youth</a></h4>

              
                Individual differences in neural circuits underlying emotional regulation, motivation, and decision-making are implicated in many psychiatric illnesses. Interindividual variability in these circuits may manifest, at least in part, as individual differences in impulsivity at both normative and clinically significant levels. Impulsivity reflects a tendency towards rapid, unplanned reactions to internal or external stimuli without considering potential negative consequences coupled with difficulty inhibiting responses. Here, we use multivariate brain-based predictive models to explore the neural bases of impulsivity across multiple behavioral scales, neuroanatomical features (cortical thickness, surface area, and gray matter volume), and sexes (females and males) in a large sample of youth from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study at baseline (n=9,099) and two-year follow-up (n=6,432). Impulsivity is significantly associated with neuroanatomical variability, and these associations vary across behavioral scales and neuroanatomical features. Impulsivity broadly maps onto cortical thickness in dispersed regions (e.g., inferior frontal, lateral occipital, superior frontal, entorhinal), as well as surface area and gray matter volume in specific medial (e.g., parahippocampal, cingulate) and polar (e.g., frontal and temporal) territories. Importantly, while many relationships are stable across sexes and time points, others are sex-specific and dynamic. These results highlight the complexity of the relationships between neuroanatomy and impulsivity across scales, features, sexes, and time points in youth. These findings suggest that neuroanatomy, in combination with other biological and environmental factors, reflects a key driver of individual differences in impulsivity in youth. As such, neuroanatomical markers may help identify youth at increased risk for developing impulsivity-related illnesses. Furthermore, this work emphasizes the importance of adopting a multidimensional and sex-specific approach in neuroimaging and behavioral research.

">Developmental dynamics and axonal transport of cerebral cortex projection neuron mRNAs in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Appropriate development of long-range nervous system circuitry requires dynamic regulation of subcellular mRNA localization, but little is known about how specific neuron subtypes control this critical process in vivo. Here, we employ an integrated genetic and temporally controlled approach to investigate in vivo developmental mRNA dynamics in somata and axons of a prototypical cerebral cortex projection neuron subtype, callosal projection neurons (CPN), which connect the cortical hemispheres to integrate sensorimotor information, and regulate high-level associative cognition and behavior. We identify cis-regulatory elements that are associated with mRNA turnover in CPN somata, including specific 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), and elucidate distinct modes of axon transport in CPN axons for function-specific mRNA classes. Together, these findings elucidate how developing CPN control subcellular mRNA localization, and how dysregulation of these processes might lead to neurodevelopmental and/or neurodegenerative disorders. More broadly, this work identifies general mRNA localization mechanisms that likely function across projection neuron subtypes, and in other polarized cells.

">PACS1 syndrome variant alters proteomic landscape of developing cortical organoids</a></h4>

              
                PACS1 syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from a unique de novo p.R203W variant in Phosphofurin Acidic Cluster Sorting protein 1 (PACS1). PACS1 encodes a multifunctional sorting protein required for localizing furin to the trans-Golgi network. Although few studies have started to investigate the impact of the PACS1 p.R203W variant, the mechanisms by which the variant affects neurodevelopment are still poorly understood. In recent years, ASD patient-derived brain organoids have been increasingly used to identify pathogenic mechanisms and possible therapeutic targets. While most of these studies investigate the mechanisms by which ASD-risk genes affect the transcriptome, studies investigating the proteome are limited. Here, we investigated the effect of PACS1 p.R203W on the proteomic landscape of brain organoids using tandem mass tag (TMT) mass-spectrometry. Time series analysis between PACS1(+/+) and PACS1(+/R203W) organoids uncovered several proteins with dysregulated abundance or phosphorylation status, including known PACS1 interactors. Although we observed low overlap between proteins with altered expression and phosphorylation, the resulting dysregulated processes converged. The presence of PACS1 p.R203W variant putatively accelerated synaptogenesis and impaired vesicle loading and recycling, putatively leading to defective and/or incomplete synaptic function. Finally, the key dysregulated proteins observed in PACS1(+/R203W) organoids were also enriched in ASD-risk genes and have been associated with other neurological diseases. Our results highlight that proteomic analyses not only enhance our understanding of general NDD mechanisms by complementing transcriptomic studies, but also could uncover additional targets, facilitating therapy development.

">Linking Oestradiol (E2) Timing and Tempo, Brain Development, and Mental Health in Adolescent Females</a></h4>

              
                Background: Earlier timing and faster tempo of puberty have been associated with altered brain development and increased mental health symptoms in adolescents, particularly females. However, the role of oestradiol (E2) in these associations is unclear. Methods: Using longitudinal data from the US-based Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study SM (ABCD Study (R), we investigated whether, in females (N ~ 3k), E2 timing (at age 10) and tempo (rate of change from age 10 to 12) were prospectively associated with mental health symptoms at age 13 via structural brain development from age 10 to 12. Linear mixed-effects models and Bayesian mediation models were fitted to investigate the aims of the study. Results: Findings showed that E2 timing was not associated with mental health symptoms. However, earlier E2 timing was associated with a greater reduction in total cortical volume, total surface area, and surface area in the superior and middle temporal cortex over time. Further, a faster E2 tempo was associated with an increase in mental health symptoms, and this association was mediated by a faster reduction in total cortical volume and total surface area over time. Conclusion: Findings suggest that earlier E2 timing and faster E2 tempo contribute to accelerated development of gray matter structure in adolescent females, and for E2 tempo, such associated brain changes may partly contribute to increased mental health risk.

">SYNAPTIC INTERACTIONS IN PRIMATE MOTOR CORTEX: RELATIONS BETWEEN CONNECTIVITY AND INTRACORTICAL LOCATION</a></h4>

              
                To investigate intracortical microcircuits within primate motor cortical areas, we documented pairs of neurons whose synaptic interactions were identified by spike-triggered averaging (STA) of intracellularly recorded membrane potentials and whose relative location was histologically identified. Average synchronous excitation potentials (ASEPs) were the most commonly observed feature in STAs between neuron pairs in all cortical layers (about 70%). This synchrony spread broadly for distances of more than 4 mm, gradually decreasing in amplitude and probability with cell separation. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were observed among 9% of the neuron pairs, whose separation extended for distances of more than 4 mm. The peak amplitudes of EPSPs were inversely correlated with cell separation. Most source neurons were located in layer II-III or layer V, while the postsynaptic target neurons had wide laminar distribution. The probability of finding excitatory connections was not uniform within the cortical space. The connectivity between neuron pairs was relatively dense within 1.0 mm, and became sparse for distances between 1.0 and 2.0 mm, and showed a second peak for distance between 2.0 and 4.0 mm. Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) and/or average synchronous inhibitory potentials (ASIPs) were observed for 10% of neuron pairs. Most of these were separated by less than 1.0 mm, suggesting that their influence was restricted within their own and neighboring columns. The major source neurons that provide these inhibitory effects were located within layer II-III. We conclude that excitatory synaptic effects (ASEPs and EPSPs) are widely distributed and omni-directional within primate motor cortex, while inhibitory connections (ASIPs and IPSPs) are restricted within columnar dimensions, and are predominantly directed from superficial to deeper layers. The appearance of independent zones that had no functional connectivity with neighboring columns indicates that primate motor cortical areas may not be organized in a uniform way. This would support the sparse coding theory and multiple representations of cortical output in the motor cortex.

">Mesoscale Imaging of Cortical Sensorimotor Integration in Huntington's Disease Mice During Reward-Guided Behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects numerous brain functions, yet how altered sensory processing contributes to behavioral and learning deficits remains poorly understood. Previous wide-field mesoscale imaging and electrophysiological recording from anesthetized HD mice revealed that sensory stimulation induced exaggerated, prolonged cortical activity across more brain regions compared to wildtype (WT) littermates. This suggests differences in sensory processing; as such, this study aimed to investigate the cortical activity in a cue-based sensory-guided learning task in a custom-built Raspberry Pi-controlled two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) rig. The rig reliably enabled head-fixed zQ175 knock-in HD mice and WT controls crossed with Thy1-GCaMP6s mice, to perform a cue-based visual discrimination task while mesoscale calcium imaging recorded activity across layer 2/3 of the cortex. Mice that successfully licked the reward spout displayed decreased global cortical activity before the reward presentation, with WT mice showing more spatially localized suppression than HD mice. HD mice exhibited exaggerated cortical responses to visual stimuli and prolonged motor-related activity during licking. While this is an exploratory pilot study with limited sample size, preventing definitive genotype-based comparisons, the custom behavioral system lays the groundwork for future studies into how sensory processing deficits contribute to cognitive impairments in HD. This work provides an important step toward understanding the interplay between cortical circuit dysfunction and behavioral outcomes in HD, offering a novel platform to investigate early sensorimotor integration learning impairments.

">Attention induced perceptual traveling waves in binocular rivalry</a></h4>

              
                Cortical traveling waves -smooth changes of phase over time across the cortical surface- have been proposed to modulate perception periodically as they travel through retinotopic cortex. Yet, little is known about the underlying computational principles. Here, we make use of binocular rivalry, a perceptual phenomenon in which perceptual (illusory) waves are perceived when a shift in dominance occurs between two rival images. First, we assessed these perceptual waves using psychophysics. Participants viewed a stimulus restricted to an annulus around fixation, with orthogonal orientations presented to each eye. The stimulus presented to one eye was of higher contrast thus generating perceptual dominance. When a patch of higher contrast was flashed briefly at one position in the other eye, it created a change in dominance that started at that location of the flash and expanded progressively, like a wave, as the previously suppressed stimulus became dominant. We found that the duration of the perceptual propagation increased with both distance traveled and eccentricity of the annulus. Diverting attention away from the annulus reduced drastically the occurrence and the speed of the wave. Second, we developed a computational model of traveling waves in which competition between the neural representations of the two stimuli is driven by both attentional modulation and mutual inhibition. We found that the model captured the key features of wave propagation dynamics. Together, these findings provide new insights into the functional relevance of cortical traveling waves and offer a framework for further experimental investigation into their role in perception.

">FMed-Diffusion Federated Learning on Medical Image Diffusion</a></h4>

              
                Medical data is not available for public access due to privacy concerns of the patients and the stakeholders trustworthiness. However, Artificial Intelligence, especially all deeplearning models, is data hungry and fails to produce clinically relevant results without much data. Moreover, augmentation strategies are deployed to overcome the less data hurdle. The promising future in this direction is generative AI augmented data. The chatGPT and DALLE2 have become commercial products leveraging the generative AI in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. The diffusion models have started giving many promising results in the generative AI in computer vision. And in medical imaging, they can potentially create synthetic data to augment the scarce dataset. Diffusion models coupled with federated learning can create synthetic data on a large scale without the need to violate data privacy. This synthetic dataset could be used for further training of deeplearning models without the issues of patients identity theft from reverse engineering data. A Federated Learning paradigm of diffusion models has been proposed to overcome this hurdle and its related challenges. Our work focuses on diffusion models in federated learning settings. We named our novel model FMedDiffusion or Federated Learning on Medical Image Diffusion. We trained our model under distributed federated settings imitating real world clinical settings. We have achieved impressive results over three medical image datasets, APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection, Retinal OCT Detection, and COVID CT Detection in the federated setting on par with the traditional training. Our model FMedDiffusion has achieved an FID score of 7.1821 on the APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection dataset, an FID score of 8.8154 on the Retinal OCT Detection dataset and an FID score of 7.4486 on the COVID CT Detection dataset.reverse engineering data.

">Short Report: A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Sleep Deprivation on the Cortical Transcriptome in Animal Models</a></h4>

              
                Sleep deprivation (SD) causes large disturbances in mood and cognition. The molecular basis for these effects can be explored using transcriptional profiling to quantify brain gene expression. In the present report, we used a meta-analysis of public transcriptional profiling data to discover effects of SD on gene expression that are consistent across studies and paradigms. To conduct the meta-analysis, we used pre-specified search terms related to rodent SD paradigms to identify relevant studies within Gemma, a database containing >19,000 re-analyzed microarray and RNA-Seq datasets. Eight studies met our systematic inclusion/exclusion criteria, characterizing the effect of 18 SD interventions on gene expression in the mouse cerebral cortex (collective n=293). For each gene with sufficient data (n=16,290), we fit a random effects meta-analysis model to the SD effect sizes (log(2) fold changes). Our meta-analysis revealed 182 differentially expressed genes in response to SD (false discovery rate<0.05), 104 of which were upregulated and 78 downregulated. Gene-set enrichment analysis (fGSEA) revealed down-regulation in pathways related to stress response (e.g., glucocorticoid receptor, Nr3c1), cell death and neural cell differentiation, and upregulation related to hypoxia and inflammation. Exploratory analyses found that SD duration (ranging from 3-12 hrs) did not significantly influence differential expression. However, recovery sleep (RS: 2-18 hrs) was included in three studies, and reversed the impact of SD on four transcripts. Our meta-analysis illustrates the diverse molecular impact of SD on the rodent cerebral cortex, producing effects that occasionally parallel those seen in the periphery.

">Sex-dimorphic effects of neuromelanin buildup in rodent nigral dopamine neurons: implications for sex-biased vulnerability in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Neuromelanin (NM) is a dark pigment accumulating with age in human substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) dopamine (DA) neurons, conferring the dark look that inspired nigral area's name. Despite NM has long been associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), as melanized neurons favorably degenerate during disease development, NM functions within SNpc DA neurons are still mostly elusive. Here, by exploiting an NM-producing rat model generated by viral vector-induced expression of human Tyrosinase (hTyr), we inspected NM impact on nigral DA neurons' survival and activity, on mitochondrial functionality of SNpc, and behaviors resembling non-motor and motor PD symptoms. Our data reveal sex dimorphism in NM effects on nigrostriatal dopamine circuit, with sex-biased alterations in neuronal firing activity and underlying intrinsic currents, nigral mitochondrial functions, and non-motor PD symptoms (anxiety). In conclusion, this study discloses unrealized NM effects within nigral DA neurons, advancing our comprehension of sex-specific features shaping sex-biased vulnerability to PD.

">A neuroprotective tetrapeptide for treatment of acute traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major clinical problem because of the high incidence and the severity of the subsequent sequelae. Despite extensive efforts, there are no therapeutic drugs clinically approved for treating acute TBI patients. To address this unmet need, we assessed the activity of the tetrapeptide, CAQK, in mice. When administered intravenously shortly after moderate or severe TBI, CAQK accumulates in the injured brain in mice and pigs. CAQK binds to an extracellular matrix glycoprotein complex that is upregulated in injured brain. Treatment of TBI mice with CAQK resulted in reduction in the size of the injury compared to control mice. There was reduced upregulation of the glycoprotein complex, less apoptosis, and lower expression of inflammatory markers in the injured area, indicating that CAQK alleviates neuroinflammation and the ensuing secondary injury. CAQK treatment also improved functional deficit in TBI mice, with no overt toxicity. Our findings suggest that CAQK may have therapeutic applications in TBI.

">Small-world scale-free brain graphs from EEG</a></h4>

              
                Developing individualized spatial models that capture the complex dynamics of multi-electrode EEG data is essential for accurately decoding global neural activity. A widely used approach is network modeling, where electrodes are represented as nodes. A key challenge lies in defining the network edges and weights, as precise connectivity estimation is critical for enhancing neural characterization and extracting discriminative features, such as those needed for task decoding. In this work, we propose a method for inferring subject-specific brain graphs from EEG data, explicitly designed to exhibit small-world and scale-free network properties. Our approach begins by computing phase-locking values between EEG channel pairs to build a backbone graph, which is then refined into an individualized small-world and scale-free network. To reduce computational complexity while preserving subject-specific characteristics, we apply Kron reduction to the resulting graph. We evaluated the proposed method on motor imagery decoding and brain fingerprinting tasks using two EEG datasets. Results show that our model consistently outperforms other benchmark graph models. Furthermore, we show that integrating classical EEG features with those derived using graph signal processing principles significantly improves performance. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of the proposed graph construction framework to enhance EEG analysis, with promising implications for a wide range of applications in cognitive neuroscience and brain-computer interface research.

">SynGAP forms biocondensates at sub-micromolar concentrations and recruits PSD95 and receptor oligomers, functioning as a key initiator of PSD formation</a></h4>

              
                A key issue in neuronal circuit regulation is how synapse formation is initiated. Synapse formation could start when one or more synaptic scaffold proteins that can initiate synapse formation reach certain threshold concentrations in the dendritic shaft, which might lead to their oligomerization or even liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). By combining in vitro reconstitution of purified proteins with live-cell single-molecule and confocal imaging, we demonstrated that SynGAP alone forms assemblies of nanoscale clusters containing several to several tens of molecules at 10-nM order concentrations and micron-scale LLPS hydrogel-like condensates at submicromolar concentrations. The trimers of SynGAP's intrinsically disordered region (IDR) induced by its coiled-coil domain are responsible for SynGAP condensation. CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation moderately suppresses SynGAP condensation, and also increases condensate liquidity. While PSD95 fails to form assemblies under these conditions, it is recruited to SynGAP condensates by specifically binding to the PDZ-binding motif of SynGAP. SynGAP[PSD95] condensates selectively immobilize postsynaptic transmembrane proteins, Neuroligin1 and AMPAR-TARP2 complexes, in a manner dependent on their oligomerization state, indicating cooperative recruitment dynamics among SynGAP, PSD95, and transmembrane components, which might mimic initial PSD assembly. These findings suggest that SynGAP may act as a primary nucleator of postsynaptic density assembly, challenging the PSD95-centered models.

">Saccades orchestrate intraocular glucose to shape visual responses in birds</a></h4>

              
                Birds exhibit remarkable vision despite lacking the typical network of blood vessels in their eyes. The characteristic poses a long-standing question about how avian retinas fulfill high energy demands necessary for sight. Here we show that natural, rhythmic eye movements, known as oscillatory saccades, orchestrate intraocular metabolic dynamics and attention-guided visual processing in pigeons. In a series of integrated experiments, we monitored eye movements along with glucose levels in the eye and neuronal activity in key brain regions receiving direct input from the retina. We found that these saccades generate fluctuations in intraocular glucose concentrations, closely linked to changes in neuronal visual responses over timescales of seconds to minutes. Moreover, pharmacological manipulations that altered glucose availability and eliminated these oscillatory saccades resulted in corresponding shifts in neuronal responses, demonstrating a causal linkage between oscillatory saccades, metabolic regulation, and visual processing. These findings reveal a mechanism by which birds actively evoked saccades during attention-driven information gathering, propelling retinal metabolism and facilitating their vision in the absence of retinal vasculature. This study underscores the interplay among eye movements, metabolic regulation, and high-level visual performance, suggesting broader implications for how eye movements contribute to retinal health, attention, and visual function across species.

">Adolescent Binge Ethanol Exposure Confers Lasting Alcohol Tolerance across a Cumulative Ethanol Challenge in Adulthood: Involvement of Proinflammatory HMGB1 Signaling</a></h4>

              
                Background. Epidemiological studies suggest heavy adolescent binge drinking is strongly associated with later development of an alcohol use disorder (AUD). Alcohol tolerance (i.e., an acquired reduction in acute alcohol responsivity) is a universally recognized symptom of AUD, but the direct contribution of adolescent binge drinking to adult alcohol tolerance is poorly understood. Methods and Materials. To investigate the contributions of adolescent binge ethanol exposure to lasting acquisition of acute tolerance, we used our ethanol response battery (ERB) to assess intoxication rating, hypothermia, motor coordination, and balance across cumulative ethanol doses (i.e., 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 g/kg) in adult female Wistar rats following adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and glycyrrhizic acid treatment following AIE. Results. We report AIE, which models human adolescent binge drinking, confers lasting alcohol tolerance across cumulative ethanol doses and blunts ethanol-induced increases in proinflammatory HMGB1 plasma levels. Adolescent LPS (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment, which mimics AIE-induced HMGB1-mediated neuroinflammation, induces adult alcohol tolerance and blunts HMGB1 release across cumulative ethanol doses on the ERB. Assessment of proinflammatory HMGB1 involvement in AIE-induced acquisition of lasting alcohol tolerance revealed that post-AIE administration of the HMGB1 inhibitor glycyrrhizic acid reversed the AIE-induced acquisition of alcohol tolerance in adulthood. Conclusions. These data reveal that (1) adolescent binge drinking confers long-lasting low ethanol responsivity, (2) proinflammatory neuroimmune activation contributes to the development of alcohol tolerance, and (3) blockade of proinflammatory HMGB1 signaling reverses AIE-induced acquisition of alcohol tolerance in adulthood. These findings suggest a potential mechanistic target for the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of AUD.

">M-ECG: Extracting Heart Signals with a Novel Computational Analysis of Magnetoencephalography Data</a></h4>

              
                Magnetoencephalography (MEG) measures the magnetic fields generated by neural activity with high temporal and spatial resolution. Because of its focus on brain activity, other biopotentials, including muscle artifacts and heart signals, are typically filtered or rejected. In this study, the feasibility of extracting cardiac signals from MEG data, which is termed magnetoencephalographic electrocardiogram (M-ECG; in contrast to the electrocardiogram or ECG) is explored. Using the publicly available Brainstorm MEG auditory dataset CTF and OMEGA resting-state sample dataset, a novel algorithm is developed that utilizes either independent component analysis (ICA) or MEG reference sensors to extract M-ECG signals and compute heart rate variability (HRV) from MEG data reliably and accurately. Signal processing methods in the time, frequency, and time-frequency domains along with statistical tests such as Spearman correlation, root mean square error, mean absolute error, Bland-Altman mean difference, and Mann-Whitney U Test are employed to assess the similarities across the signals. The results indicate a significant alignment of temporal and frequency spectral power characteristics between M-ECG HRV and ECG HRV signals, suggesting a promising degree of similarity and correspondence. The findings highlight the feasibility of extracting M-ECG and computing HRV directly from raw MEG data. These insights hold the potential to enhance multimodal neuroimaging methodologies and further elucidate the intricate interplay between brain activity and cardiovascular function. The potential of HRV as a biomarker for brain disorders could improve diagnostic accuracy, prognostic assessment, and therapeutic strategies, particularly in neurological disorders with centrally mediated autonomic dysfunction.

">Respiration shapes the neural dynamics of successful remembering in humans.</a></h4>

              
                Respiration has been shown to impact memory retrieval, yet the neural dynamics underlying this effect remain unclear. Here, we investigated how respiration shapes both behavioral and neural expressions of memory retrieval by re-analyzing an existing dataset where scalp electroencephalography and respiration recordings were acquired while participants (N = 18) performed an episodic memory task. Our results unveil that respiration influences retrieval-related power fluctuations in the /{beta} band and concomitant memory reactivation. Specifically, we found that both key neural signatures of successful remembering were co-modulated during exhalation, with the strength of the interaction between respiration and reactivation processes being associated with memory performance. Together, these findings suggest that respiration may act as a scaffold for episodic memory retrieval in humans by coordinating the neural conditions that support effective remembering.

">Brain network dynamics determine tau presence while regional vulnerability governs tau load in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                In Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau pathology accumulates gradually throughout the brain, with clinical decline reflecting tau progression. A comprehensive understanding of, first, whether tau propagation is predominantly governed by connectome-based diffusion, regional vulnerability, or an interplay of both, and second, which types of brain connectivity or regional factors best explain tau propagation, remains crucial for advancing our understanding of AD progression. Here, we apply multi-scale mechanistic disease progression simulations to human data, to disentangle the influence of local mechanisms on global tau progression patterns in AD. We find that whether tau reaches a brain region (presence) and how much tau accumulates there (load) are governed by different mechanisms. Tau presence patterns are highly consistent across the population, and can be largely explained through synaptic spread through white-matter networks and excitatory-inhibitory dynamics. Meanwhile tau load differs across people, and is driven by a combination of synaptic spread and intrinsic or extrinsic regional properties, including regional {beta}-amyloid load, MAPT gene expression and regional blood flow. Finally, while distinct tau patterns in the population could each be explained by established AD mechanisms, our models highlight a role of distinct brain networks (parietal functional networks in MTL-sparing AD tau subtype) and neurotransmitter systems (cholinergic system in posterior subtype). Together, this work suggests that network dynamics likely determine the sequence of regional tau progression, while individual-specific tissue-vulnerability factors influence regional tau load.

">DAGLα/β, 2-AG release, and Parkinson's Disease: Exploring a causal link.</a></h4>

              
                The diacylglycerol lipases, DAGL and DAGL{beta}, hydrolyse diacylglycerol (DAG) to produce 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), a key endocannabinoid (eCB) and CB/CB2 receptor ligand. While DAGL is well established as a regulator of CB-dependent synaptic plasticity, recent studies have identified DAGLB mutations as a cause of autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of DAGL{beta} mRNA expression, demonstrating its co-expression with DAGL mRNA predominantly in excitatory neurons throughout the adult nervous system. We see no evidence for enrichment of the DAGLs or CB transcripts in the striatum or in dopaminergic neurons. We discuss these findings within a review of recent literature that points to a wider involvement of the eCB system in PD. Notably, DAGL-dependent 2-AG release at synapses relies on -synuclein function - a protein central to PD pathophysiology-implicating both DAGLs in PD and pointing to widespread disruption in 2-AG release. Consistent with this, substantial reductions in 2-AG levels have been reported in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of PD patients. Depression, a major non-motor symptom of PD, often precedes the onset of motor deficits by several years. Human and mouse genetic studies suggest that reduced DAGL activity may contribute to depression by impairing 2-AG-mediated CB receptor signalling, which is crucial for synaptic plasticity, stress resilience, and mood regulation. These findings point to a potential causal link between DAGL dysfunction and the non-motor symptoms in PD.
