              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Theta oscillations in frontal cortex differentially modulate accuracy and speed in flexible stimulus- and action-based learning</a></h4>

              
                Flexible reward learning relies on frontal cortex, with substantial evidence indicating the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) play important roles. Recent studies in both rat and macaque suggest theta oscillations (5-10 Hz) may be a spectral signature that coordinates this learning. However, causal network-level interactions between ACC and OFC in flexible learning remain unclear. We investigated the learning of stimulus-outcome (S-O) and action-outcome (A-O) associations using a combination of simultaneous in-vivo electrophysiology in dorsal ACC and ventral OFC, partnered with bilateral inhibitory DREADDs in ACC. In freely-behaving male and female rats and using a within-subject design, we examined accuracy and speed of response across distinct and precisely-defined trial epochs including correct choice, incorrect choice, and reward collection. We report significant modulation of accuracy by theta power in both ACC and OFC. Both ACC and OFC theta oscillations consistently signaled accuracy in the initial discrimination phase, whereas it was OFC theta alone in the reversal phases of both S-O and A-O learning. Theta power in either region was not correlated with deliberation speed. Indeed, theta modulation of accuracy was dissociable from its involvement in speed of response which was affected by ACC inhibition, most prominently in A-O learning. Results are discussed with reference to the nonhuman primate literature, where there is by contrast more reported specialization of OFC and ACC in flexible learning of stimuli and actions. The present results also point to a specific role of OFC theta in signaling a reversal of either kind.

                SCN2A is an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk gene and encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel. However, the impact of autism-associated SCN2A de novo variants on human neuron development is unknown. We studied SCN2A using isogenic SCN2A-/- induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and patient-derived iPSCs harboring a p.R607* or a C-terminal p.G1744* de novo truncating variant. We used Neurogenin2 to generate excitatory glutamatergic neurons and found that SCN2A+/p.R607* and SCN2A-/- neurons displayed a reduction in synapse formation and excitatory synaptic activity using multielectrode arrays and electrophysiology. However, the p.G1744* variant, which leads to early-onset seizures in addition to ASD, altered action-potential dynamics but not synaptic activity. Proteomic and functional analysis of SCN2A+/p.R607* neurons revealed defects in neuronal morphology and bioenergetic pathways, which were not present in SCN2A+/p.G1744* neurons. Our study reveals that SCN2A de novo variants can have differential impact on human neuron function and signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early stage of Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1 (SCA1) progression exhibits region- and cell-specific pathology and is partially ameliorated by Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)</a></h4>

              
                Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by an abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in the gene Ataxin1 (ATXN1) and characterized by motor deficits, cognitive decline, changes in affect, and premature lethality. Due to the severe cerebellar degeneration in SCA1, the pathogenesis of Purkinje cells has been the main focus of previous studies. However, mutant ATXN1 is expressed throughout the brain, and pathology in brain regions beyond the cerebellar cortex likely contribute to the symptoms of SCA1. Here, we investigate early-stage SCA1 alterations in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in clinically relevant brain regions including hippocampus and brain stem of Atxn1154Q/2Q mice, a knock-in mouse model of SCA1 expressing mutant ATXN1 globally. Our results indicate shared and brain region specific astrocyte pathology early in SCA1 preceding neuronal loss. We found reduced expression of homeostatic astrocytic genes Kcnj10, Aqp4, Slc1a2 and Gja1, all of which are key for neuronal function in the hippocampus and brain stem. These gene expression changes did not correlate with classical astrogliosis. Neuronal and microglial numbers were largely unaltered at this early stage of SCA1 with the exception of cerebellar white matter, where we found significant reduction in microglial density, and the brain stem where we detected an increase in microglial cell counts. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a growth factor important for the survival and function of neurons with broad therapeutic potential for many brain diseases. We report here that BDNF expression is decreased in cerebellum and medulla of patients with SCA1. Moreover, we found that BDNF had dual effect on SCA1 and wild-type mice. Motor performance, strategy development, hippocampal neurogenesis, and expression of astrocyte homeostatic genes in the hippocampus were ameliorated in BDNF-treated SCA1 mice and further enhanced in BDNF-treated wild-type mice. On the other hand, BDNF had a negative effect on memory recall and expression of homeostatic genes in the brain stem astrocytes both in wild-type and in SCA1 mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Incidental reinstatement of faces and scenes in medial temporal lobe subregions during word recognition</a></h4>

              
                During associative retrieval, the brain reinstates neural representations that were present during encoding. The human medial temporal lobe (MTL) with its subregions hippocampus (HC), perirhinal cortex (PRC), and parahippocampal cortex (PHC) plays a central role in neural reinstatement. Previous studies have given compelling evidence for reinstatement in the MTL during explicitly instructed associative retrieval. High-confident recognition may be similarly accompanied by recollection of associated information from the encoding context. It is unclear, however, whether high-confident recognition memory elicits reinstatement in the MTL even in the absence of an explicit instruction to retrieve associated information. Here, we addressed this open question using high-resolution fMRI. Twenty-eight male and female human volunteers engaged in a recognition memory task for words that they had previously encoded together with faces and scenes. Using complementary uni- and multivariate approaches, we show that MTL subregions including the PRC, PHC, and HC differentially reinstate category-specific representations during high-confident word recognition, even though no explicit instruction to retrieve the associated category was given. This constitutes novel evidence that high-confident recognition memory is accompanied by incidental reinstatement of associated category information in MTL subregions, and supports a functional model of the MTL that emphasises content-sensitive representations during both encoding and retrieval.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Molecular and cellular adaptations in hippocampal parvalbumin neurons mediate behavioral responses to chronic social stress</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Behavioral responses to stress are, in part, mediated by the hippocampus and Parvalbumin (PV)-expressing neurons. However, whether chronic stress induces molecular and cellular adaptations in hippocampal PV neurons contribute to stress-induced behavioral outcomes remains elusive. METHOD: Using chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), we investigated the role of neuronal activity and gene expression in hippocampal PV neurons in mediating stress-resilience and -susceptibility. We first used in vivo high-density silicon probe recordings and chemogenetics to test whether the activity of PV neurons in ventral dentate gyrus (PVvDG) is associated with particular behavioral outcomes. To find critical molecular pathways associated with stress-resilience and -susceptibility, we used PV-neuron-selective translating ribosome affinity purification and RNAseq. We used immunoblotting, RNAscope, and region- or cell type-specific gene deletion to determine whether Ahnak, a molecule regulating depression-like behavior, was necessary for behavioral divergence after CSDS. RESULTS: We find CSDS modulates neuronal activity in vDG. Notably, stress-susceptibility is associated with an increase of PVvDG firing, which we find is necessary and sufficient for susceptibility. Additionally, genes involved in mitochondrial function, protein synthesis and synaptogenesis are differentially expressed in hippocampal PV neurons of stress-resilient and -susceptible mice. Interestingly, protein and mRNA levels of Ahnak, an endogenous regulator of L-type calcium channels are associated with susceptibility after CSDS. vDG- and PV cell type-specific deletions reveal that Ahnak is required for stress-susceptibility to CSDS. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that CSDS-induced molecular and cellular adaptations in hippocampal PV neurons mediate behavioral consequences, proposing a mechanism underlying individual differences in stress vulnerability.

	<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease, with fatigue syndrome as one of the main symptoms. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that moderate physical activity (MPA) may have a beneficial effect on postural stability, balance, and clinical parameters. The research group consisted of 137 randomized patients hospitalized at the Department of Neurological Rehabilitation, Medical University of Lodz. Finally, 76 patients were qualified who were divided into two groups—high fatigue (HF) and low fatigue (LF). Participants were assessed twice: before and after a 4-week MPA program using: the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and stabilometric platform tests were performed. Results obtained after the 4-week MPA program showed a positive effect of the MPA with differences between LF and HF groups. The MPA was more effective in MS patients with LF in cognitive functions, functional status, and postural stability but among HF patients in an emotional state, especially in MS patients below 65 years, although in total, both groups benefited from the MPA.</p>

<p>Subanalgesic morphine augments fentanyl analgesia via MOP and DOP interactions that increase G protein activation unrelated to MOP receptor internalization. </p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Opioids are commonly used for the treatment of postoperative and post-traumatic pain; however, their therapeutic effectiveness is limited by undesirable and life-threatening side effects. Researchers have long attempted to develop opioid co-administration therapies that enhance analgesia, but the complexity of opioid analgesia and our incomplete mechanistic understanding has made this a daunting task. We discovered that subanalgesic morphine doses (100 ng/kg–10 µg/kg) augmented the acute analgesic effect of fentanyl (20 µg/kg) following subcutaneous drug co-administration to male rats. In addition, administration of equivalent drug ratios to naïve rat spinal cord membranes induced a twofold increase in G protein activation. The rate of GTP hydrolysis remained unchanged. We demonstrated that these behavioral and biochemical effects were mediated by the delta opioid receptor (DOP). Subanalgesic doses of the DOP-selective agonist SNC80 also augmented the acute analgesic effect of fentanyl. Furthermore, co-administration of the DOP antagonist naltrindole with both fentanyl-morphine and fentanyl-SNC80 combinations prevented augmentation of both analgesia and G protein activation. The mu opioid receptor (MOP) antagonist cyprodime did not block augmentation. Confocal microscopy of the substantia gelatinosa of rats treated with fentanyl, subanalgesic morphine, or this combination showed that changes in MOP internalization did not account for augmentation effects. Together, these findings suggest that augmentation of fentanyl analgesia by subanalgesic morphine is mediated by increased G protein activation resulting from a synergistic interaction between or heterodimerization of MOPs and DOPs. This finding is of great therapeutic significance because it suggests a strategy for the development of DOP-selective ligands that can enhance the therapeutic index of clinically used MOP drugs.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The effects of acetylcholine on cortical activation were studied in wild-type (WT) mice, compared to knockout (KO) mice depleted of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) gene in the basal forebrain, and knockdown (KD) mice with heterogeneous depletion of VAChT gene in the brain. Cortical activation was assessed by comparing power spectra of local field potentials (LFPs) during activated states of rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM) or walk (WLK), with those during non-activated states of slow-wave sleep (SWS) or awake-immobility (IMM). Activation-induced suppression of delta (1–4 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) power in the hippocampus, and delta power in frontal cortex, were reduced in KO and KD mice compared to WT mice. Mean theta frequency was higher in KD than KO mice during WLK and REM, but not different between WT and KO mice. Peak theta (4–12 Hz) and integrated gamma (30–150 Hz) power were not significantly different among mouse groups. However, theta-peak-frequency selected gamma2 (62–100 Hz) power was lower in KO than WT or KD mice during WLK, and theta-peak-frequency selected theta power during REM decreased faster with high theta frequency in KO than WT/ KD mice. Theta power increase during REM compared to WLK was lower in KO and KD mice compared to WT mice. Theta–gamma cross-frequency coherence, a measure of synchronization of gamma with theta phase, was not different among mouse groups. However, during REM, SWS, and IMM, delta-gamma coherence was significantly higher and proximal–distal delta coherence in CA1 was lower in KO than WT/KD mice. We conclude that a deficiency in basal forebrain acetylcholine release not only enhances slow waves and suppresses theta-associated gamma waves during activation, but also increases delta-gamma cross-frequency coherence during nonactivated states, with a possible effect of disrupting cognitive processing during any brain state.</p>

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Myelination is crucial for the development and maintenance of axonal integrity, especially fast axonal action potential conduction. There is increasing evidence that glutamate signaling and release through neuronal activity modulates the myelination process. In this study, we examine the effect of manipulating glutamate signaling on myelination of oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage cells and their development in zebrafish (zf). We use the “intensity-based glutamate-sensing fluorescent reporter” (iGluSnFR) in the zf model (both sexes) to address the hypothesis that glutamate is implicated in regulation of myelinating OLs. Our results show that glial iGluSnFR expression significantly reduces OL lineage cell number and the expression of myelin markers in larvae (zfl) and adult brains. The specific glutamate receptor agonist, L-AP4, rescues this iGluSnFR effect by significantly increasing the expression of the myelin-related genes, <i>plp1b</i> and <i>mbpa</i>, and enhances myelination in L-AP4-injected zfl compared to controls. Furthermore, we demonstrate that degrading glutamate using Glutamat-Pyruvate Transaminase (GPT) or the blockade of glutamate reuptake by L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate (PDC) significantly decreases myelin-related genes and drastically declines myelination in brain ventricle-injected zfl. Moreover, we found that myelin-specific ClaudinK (CldnK) and 36K protein expression is significantly decreased in iGluSnFR-expressing zfl and adult brains compared to controls. Taken together, this study confirms that glutamate signaling is directly required for the preservation of myelinating OLs and for the myelination process itself. These findings further suggest that glutamate signaling may provide novel targets to therapeutically boost remyelination in several demyelinating diseases of the CNS.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Retinoic acid (RA), a metabolite of vitamin A, has many physiological functions, and mounting evidence points to important roles in cognition. <I>In vitro</I> experiments indicate that RA is involved in homeostatic synaptic scaling in the hippocampus, which supports overall network stability during learning. It has been previously determined that disrupted RA signaling in the hippocampus causes deterioration of memory, that RA signaling declines with age in brain, and that application of RA reverses this decline. Here, we explore whether RA signaling is altered in an animal model of neurocognitive aging. We used a Morris water maze protocol to study cognitive decline in aged rats, which assesses hippocampus-dependent spatial memory and reveals substantial interindividual differences in aged animals. Aged unimpaired (AU) rats perform on par with young (Y), while aged impaired (AI) animals exhibit spatial memory deficits. We show that the major substrate for RA, retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), is decreased in AU rats, and retinol cell surface receptor declines with chronological age. Other affected components of RA signaling include selective increases in AI animals in hippocampal synthesis (RALDH1) and catabolism of RA (CYP26B1), RA receptor &alpha;, the RA regulated ionotropic glutamate receptor (GluR1), as well as fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). The results support the conclusion that, surprisingly, increased RA signaling in the aged hippocampus is associated with poor cognitive outcome.</p>

<p>Brain stem is one of the earliest affected regions in synucleinopathies. The present study demonstrated that pontine mean diffusivity values would be a useful neurodegeneration marker in synucleinopathies.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The pons is one of the earliest affected regions in patients with synucleinopathies. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of measuring pontine damage using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in these patients. We enrolled 49 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), 16 patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), 23 patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), and 39 healthy controls in this study. All the participants underwent high-resolution T1-weighted imaging and DTI. Mean diffusivity (MD) and fraction anisotropy (FA) values in the pons were calculated to characterize structural damage. The discriminatory power of pontine MD and FA values to differentiate patients with synucleinopathies from healthy controls was examined using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses. Compared to healthy controls, patients with PD, iRBD, and MSA had increased MD values and decreased FA values in the pons, although no correlation was observed between these DTI measures and disease severity. The ROC analyses showed that MD values in the pons had a fair discriminatory power to differentiate healthy controls from patients with PD (area under the curve [AUC], 0.813), iRBD (AUC, 0.779), and MSA (AUC, 0.951). The AUC for pontine FA values was smaller than that for pontine MD values when differentiating healthy controls from patients with PD (AUC, 0.713; <i>p</i> = 0.054) and iRBD (AUC, 0.686; <i>p</i> = 0.045). Our results suggest that MD values in the pons may be a useful marker of brain stem neurodegeneration in patients with synucleinopathies.</p>

<p>Loss of <i>Cx3cr1</i> function compromises cochlear defense mechanisms against noise-induced neutrophil infiltration and potentiates functional loss of the cochlea. This study provides new insights into the molecular control of cochlear neutrophil activities after noise damage.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The cochlea, the sensory organ for hearing, has a protected immune environment, segregated from the systemic immune system by the blood-labyrinth barrier. Previous studies have revealed that acute acoustic injury causes the infiltration of circulating leukocytes into the cochlea. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling immune cell trafficking are poorly understood. Here, we report the role of CX3CR1 in regulating the entry of neutrophils into the cochlea after acoustic trauma. We employed B6.129P-<i>Cx3cr1<sup>tm1Litt</sup>
</i>/J mice, a transgenic strain that lacks the gene, <i>Cx3cr1</i>, for coding the fractalkine receptor. Our results demonstrate that lack of <i>Cx3cr1</i> results in the augmentation of neutrophil infiltration into cochlear tissues after exposure to an intense noise of 120 dB SPL for 1 hr. Neutrophil distribution in the cochlea is site specific, and the infiltration level is positively associated with noise intensity. Moreover, neutrophils are short lived and macrophage phagocytosis plays a role in neutrophil clearance, consistent with typical neutrophil dynamics in inflamed non-cochlear tissues. Importantly, our study reveals the potentiation of noise-induced hearing loss and sensory cell loss in <i>Cx3cr1<sup>−/−</sup>
</i> mice. In wild-type control mice (<i>Cx3cr1<sup>+/+</sup>
</i>) exposed to the same noise, we also found neutrophils. However, neutrophils were present primarily inside the microvessels of the cochlea, with only a few in the cochlear tissues. Collectively, our data implicate CX3CR1-mediated signaling in controlling neutrophil migration from the circulation into cochlear tissues and provide a better understanding of the impacts of neutrophils on cochlear responses to acoustic injury.</p>

                Background: Osteoporosis is the most prevalent metabolic disease affecting bones. Objective: To investigate the long-term effect of pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) combined with exercise protocol on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone markers in men with osteopenia or osteoporosis. Methods: Ninety-five males with osteopenia or osteoporosis (mean age, 51.26 ± 2.41 years; mean height, 176 ± 2.02 cm; mean weight, 83.08 ± 2.60 kg; mean body–mass index (BMI), 26.08 ± 1.09 kg/m2) participated in the study, and they were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Group 1 received a full-body PEMF and exercise protocol (PEMF +EX), Group 2 received a placebo full-body PEMF and exercise protocol (PPEMF +EX), and Group 3 received a full-body PEMF alone (PEMF). PEMF was applied for the whole body using a full-body mat three times per week for 12 weeks, with an exercise protocol that includes flexibility, aerobic exercise, strengthening, weight-bearing, and balance exercises followed by whole-body vibration (WBV) training. Outcome measures include BMD of total hip and lumbar spine and bone markers [serum osteocalcin (s-OC), Serum amino-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (s-NTX), Serum carboxy-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (s-CTX), Parathyroid hormones (PTH), Bone-specific Alkaline Phosphatase (BSAP), and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (Vit D)]. Results: The BMD of total hip and lumbar spine was significantly increased post-treatment in all groups, and more so in Group 1 and Group 2 than Group 3. There was a significant difference in bone markers in all groups, more so in Group 1 and Group 2 than in Group 3. Conclusion: PEMF combined with exercise protocol exerts a potent role for treating OP, is more effective than exercise and PEMF alone for increasing BMD and enhancing bone formation, and suppresses bone-resorption markers after 12-weeks of treatment with the impact lasting up to 6 months.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Rats spontaneously perceive global motion direction of drifting plaids</a></h4>

Computing global motion direction of extended visual objects is a hallmark of primate high-level vision. Although neurons selective for global motion have also been found in mouse visual cortex, it remains unknown whether rodents can combine multiple motion signals into global, integrated percepts. To address this question, we trained two groups of rats to discriminate either gratings (G group) or plaids (i.e., superpositions of gratings with different orientations; P group) drifting horizontally along opposite directions. After the animals learned the task, we applied a visual priming paradigm, where presentation of the target stimulus was preceded by the brief presentation of either a grating or a plaid. The extent to which rat responses to the targets were biased by such prime stimuli provided a measure of the spontaneous, perceived similarity between primes and targets. We found that gratings and plaids, when uses as primes, were equally effective at biasing the perception of plaid direction for the rats of the P group. Conversely, for G group, only the gratings acted as effective prime stimuli, while the plaids failed to alter the perception of grating direction. To interpret these observations, we simulated a decision neuron reading out the representations of gratings and plaids, as conveyed by populations of either component or pattern cells (i.e., local or global motion detectors). We concluded that the findings for the P group are highly consistent with the existence of a population of pattern cells, playing a functional role similar to that demonstrated in primates. We also explored different scenarios that could explain the failure of the plaid stimuli to elicit a sizable priming magnitude for the G group. These simulations yielded testable predictions about the properties of motion representations in rodent visual cortex at the single-cell and circuitry level, thus paving the way to future neurophysiology experiments.

A continuing challenge in modern medicine is the identification of safer and more efficacious drugs. Precision therapeutics, which have one molecular target, have been long promised to be safer and more effective than traditional therapies. This approach has proven to be challenging for multiple reasons including lack of efficacy, rapidly acquired drug resistance, and narrow patient eligibility criteria. An alternative approach is the development of drugs that address the overall disease network by targeting multiple biological targets (‘polypharmacology’). Rational development of these molecules will require improved methods for predicting single chemical structures that target multiple drug targets. To address this need, we developed the Multi-Targeting Drug DREAM Challenge, in which we challenged participants to predict single chemical entities that target pro-targets but avoid anti-targets for two unrelated diseases: RET-based tumors and a common form of inherited Tauopathy. Here, we report the results of this DREAM Challenge and the development of two neural network-based machine learning approaches that were applied to the challenge of rational polypharmacology. Together, these platforms provide a potentially useful first step towards developing lead therapeutic compounds that address disease complexity through rational polypharmacology.

Pollution from microplastics and anthropogenic fibres threatens lakes, but we know little about what factors predict its accumulation. Lakes may be especially contaminated because of long water retention times and proximity to pollution sources. Here, we surveyed anthropogenic microparticles, i.e., microplastics and anthropogenic fibres, in surface waters of 67 European lakes spanning 30° of latitude and large environmental gradients. By collating data from >2,100 published net tows, we found that microparticle concentrations in our field survey were higher than previously reported in lakes and comparable to rivers and oceans. We then related microparticle concentrations in our field survey to surrounding land use, water chemistry, and plastic emissions to sites estimated from local hydrology, population density, and waste production. Microparticle concentrations in European lakes quadrupled as both estimated mismanaged waste inputs and wastewater treatment loads increased in catchments. Concentrations decreased by 2 and 5 times over the range of surrounding forest cover and potential in-lake biodegradation, respectively. As anthropogenic debris continues to pollute the environment, our data will help contextualise future work, and our models can inform control and remediation efforts.

Several lines of study suggest that peripheral metabolism of amyloid beta (Aß) is associated with risk for Alzheimer disease (AD). In blood, greater than 90% of Aß is complexed as an apolipoprotein, raising the possibility of a lipoprotein-mediated axis for AD risk. In this study, we report that genetic modification of C57BL/6J mice engineered to synthesise human Aß only in liver (hepatocyte-specific human amyloid (HSHA) strain) has marked neurodegeneration concomitant with capillary dysfunction, parenchymal extravasation of lipoprotein-Aß, and neurovascular inflammation. Moreover, the HSHA mice showed impaired performance in the passive avoidance test, suggesting impairment in hippocampal-dependent learning. Transmission electron microscopy shows marked neurovascular disruption in HSHA mice. This study provides causal evidence of a lipoprotein-Aß /capillary axis for onset and progression of a neurodegenerative process.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">SARS-CoV-2 genome datasets analytics for informed infectious disease surveillance [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged economies, health systems, and lives globally. Concerns surrounding near total economic collapse, loss of livelihood and emotional complications ensuing from lockdowns and commercial inactivity, resulted in governments loosening economic restrictions. These concerns were further exacerbated by the absence of vaccines and drugs to combat the disease, with the fear that the next wave of the pandemic would be more fatal. Consequently, integrating disease surveillance mechanism into public healthcare systems is gaining traction, to reduce the spread of community and cross-border infections and offer informed medical decisions. Methods: Publicly available datasets of coronavirus cases around the globe deposited between December, 2019 and March 15, 2021 were retrieved from GISAID EpiFluTM and processed. Also retrieved from GISAID were data on the different SARS-CoV-2 variant types since inception of the pandemic. Results: Epidemiological analysis offered interesting statistics for understanding the demography of SARS-CoV-2 and helped the elucidation of local and foreign transmission through a history of contact travels. Results of genome pattern visualization and cognitive knowledge mining revealed the emergence of high intra-country viral sub-strains with localized transmission routes traceable to immediate countries, for enhanced contact tracing protocol. Variant surveillance analysis indicates increased need for continuous monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 variants.  A collaborative Internet of Health Things (IoHT) framework was finally proposed to impact the public health system, for robust and intelligent support for modelling, characterizing, diagnosing and real-time contact tracing of infectious diseases. Conclusions: Localizing healthcare disease surveillance is crucial in emerging disease situations and will support real-time/updated disease case definitions for suspected and probable cases. The IoHT framework proposed in this paper will assist early syndromic assessments of emerging infectious diseases and support healthcare/medical countermeasures as well as useful strategies for making informed policy decisions to drive a cost effective, smart healthcare system.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">COVID-19 measures and human rights guaranteed by the Japanese Constitution [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Since March 2020, the Act on Special Measures for Pandemic Influenza and New Infectious Diseases Preparedness and Response has been a significant statute in dealing with COVID-19 in Japan. The Act mandates requests, instructions and orders for business suspension and shortened business hours, as well as stay-at-home requests. These measures limit freedom of movement and establishment, guaranteed rights under the Japanese Constitution. This article poses the following research question: “Does the Japanese Constitution allow measures against COVID-19 such as requests, instructions and orders for business suspension and shortened business hours, and stay-at-home requests?” It also asks: “Are measures with penalties allowed by the Constitution?” given the fact that the penalties were introduced in February 2021. This paper introduces constitutional concepts that guarantee or limit individual freedom. Concepts that guarantee individual freedoms include freedom of establishment and movement. These freedoms derive from the constitutional values of freedom to choose one’s occupation and choose and change one’s residence (Art. 22) and the right to own or hold property (Art. 29). Concepts that limit individual freedom include the right to life (Art. 13), welfare rights and public health (Art. 25), and public welfare (Art. 13). Individual freedom that threatens right to life, welfare rights and public health, and public welfare may not be guaranteed. This paper argues that the Constitution allows the measures against COVID-19 limiting freedom of establishment and movement from the perspectives of the right to life, welfare rights, public health, and public welfare, and the government is responsible for reducing the risk to life from COVID-19. It also argues that the Constitution permits measures with penalties, while proportionality needs to be considered.

                Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that establish diversity in the dopaminergic system. Tolve et al. show that the transcription factor BCL11A defines dopaminergic subpopulations with distinct projection targets and susceptibility to neurodegeneration and is required for the establishment and maintenance of normal function of this subset.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">AIM/CD5L attenuates DAMPs in the injured brain and thereby ameliorates ischemic stroke</a></h4>

              
                Maehara et al. show that AIM (or CD5L) is increased in the infarcted brain and associates with DAMPs. The association decreases DAMPs, and therefore, AIM improves post-stroke prognosis in mice by reducing cerebral inflammation. AIM may be a useful therapy for ischemic stroke targeting DAMP-mediated sterile inflammation.

                Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) limit the immune response to tumors, and tumor-infiltrating Treg cells are especially suppressive. However, the mechanisms underlying enhanced Treg cell function are poorly understood. Banerjee et al. show that Tim-3 expression is linked to increased Treg cell suppressive activity, possibly through the cytokine IL-10, in mouse models and people with cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Transitions in lineage specification and gene regulatory networks in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells over human development</a></h4>

              
                Roy et al. use single-cell transcriptomics to compare lineage specification and gene regulatory networks of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from multiple tissues over human ontogeny. Comparison to HSPCs from two blood cancers demonstrates the utility of the dataset for understanding disease processes and the emergence of age-specific blood malignancies.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">Robust innate responses to SARS-CoV-2 in children resolve faster than in adults without compromising adaptive immunity</a></h4>

              
                SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is less severe than in adults. Vono et al. find that children mount a potent but more transient antiviral innate response with a more rapid onset of B cell response. A more efficient early control of inflammation may be key to limiting disease severity.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">Paired heavy and light chain signatures contribute to potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization in public antibody responses</a></h4>

              
                Banach et al. report a SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody along with genetic, structural, and functional features of public antibody responses targeting SARS-CoV-2. These data reveal how structural interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain correlate with viral neutralization, and demonstrate the importance of native antibody heavy:light pairings in convergent antibody responses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Translational control of polyamine metabolism by CNBP is required for Drosophila locomotor function</a></h4>

              
                Microsatellite expansions of CCTG repeats in the cellular nucleic acid-binding protein (<i>CNBP</i>) gene leads to accumulation of toxic RNA and have been associated with myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2). However, it is still unclear whether the dystrophic phenotype is also linked to CNBP decrease, a conserved CCHC-type zinc finger RNA-binding protein that regulates translation and is required for mammalian development. Here, we show that depletion of <i>Drosophila</i> CNBP in muscles causes ageing-dependent locomotor defects that are correlated with impaired polyamine metabolism. We demonstrate that the levels of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and polyamines are significantly reduced upon dCNBP depletion. Of note, we show a reduction of the CNBP-polyamine axis in muscles from DM2 patients. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that dCNBP controls polyamine metabolism through binding dOdc mRNA and regulating its translation. Remarkably, the locomotor defect of dCNBP-deficient flies is rescued by either polyamine supplementation or dOdc1 overexpression. We suggest that this dCNBP function is evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates with relevant implications for CNBP-related pathophysiological conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Microbiome-pathogen interactions drive epidemiological dynamics of antibiotic resistance: a modelling study applied to nosocomial pathogen control</a></h4>

              
                The human microbiome can protect against colonization with pathogenic antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), but its impacts on the spread of antibiotic resistance are poorly understood. We propose a mathematical modelling framework for ARB epidemiology formalizing within-host ARB-microbiome competition, and impacts of antibiotic consumption on microbiome function. Applied to the healthcare setting, we demonstrate a trade-off whereby antibiotics simultaneously clear bacterial pathogens and increase host susceptibility to their colonization, and compare this framework with a traditional strain-based approach. At the population level, microbiome interactions drive ARB incidence, but not resistance rates, reflecting distinct epidemiological relevance of different forces of competition. Simulating a range of public health interventions (contact precautions, antibiotic stewardship, microbiome recovery therapy) and pathogens (<i>Clostridioides difficile</i>, methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae) highlights how species-specific within-host ecological interactions drive intervention efficacy. We find limited impact of contact precautions for Enterobacteriaceae prevention, and a promising role for microbiome-targeted interventions to limit ARB spread.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Optimal plasticity for memory maintenance during ongoing synaptic change</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic connections in many brain circuits fluctuate, exhibiting substantial turnover and remodelling over hours to days. Surprisingly, experiments show that most of this flux in connectivity persists in the absence of learning or known plasticity signals. How can neural circuits retain learned information despite a large proportion of ongoing and potentially disruptive synaptic changes? We address this question from first principles by analysing how much compensatory plasticity would be required to optimally counteract ongoing fluctuations, regardless of whether fluctuations are random or systematic. Remarkably, we find that the answer is largely independent of plasticity mechanisms and circuit architectures: compensatory plasticity should be at most equal in magnitude to fluctuations, and often less, in direct agreement with previously unexplained experimental observations. Moreover, our analysis shows that a high proportion of learning-independent synaptic change is consistent with plasticity mechanisms that accurately compute error gradients.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Bipartite binding and partial inhibition links DEPTOR and mTOR in a mutually antagonistic embrace</a></h4>

              
                The mTORC1 kinase complex regulates cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Because mis-regulation of DEPTOR, an endogenous mTORC1 inhibitor, is associated with some cancers, we reconstituted mTORC1 with DEPTOR to understand its function. We find that DEPTOR is a unique <i>partial</i> mTORC1 inhibitor that may have evolved to preserve feedback inhibition of PI3K. Counterintuitively, mTORC1 activated by RHEB or oncogenic mutation is much more potently inhibited by DEPTOR. Although DEPTOR partially inhibits mTORC1, mTORC1 prevents this inhibition by phosphorylating DEPTOR, a mutual antagonism that requires no exogenous factors. Structural analyses of the mTORC1/DEPTOR complex showed DEPTOR’s PDZ domain interacting with the mTOR FAT region, and the unstructured linker preceding the PDZ binding to the mTOR FRB domain. The linker and PDZ form the minimal inhibitory unit, but the N-terminal tandem DEP domains also significantly contribute to inhibition.

                We developed a <i>Xrcc4<sup>M61R</sup></i> separation of function mouse line to overcome the embryonic lethality of Xrcc4 deficient mice. XRCC4<sup>M61R</sup> protein does not interact with Xlf, thus obliterating XRCC4-Xlf filament formation while preserving the ability to stabilize DNA Ligase IV. X4<sup>M61R</sup> mice, which are DNA repair deficient, phenocopy the <i>Nhej1-/-</i> (known as <i>Xlf</i> -/-) setting with a minor impact on the development of the adaptive immune system. The core NHEJ DNA repair factor XRCC4 is therefore not mandatory for V(D)J recombination aside from its role in stabilizing DNA ligase IV. In contrast, <i>Xrcc4<sup>M61R</sup></i> mice crossed on <i>Paxx-/-</i>, <i>Nhej1-/-</i>, or <i>Atm</i>-/- backgrounds are severely immunocompromised, owing to aborted V(D)J recombination as in <i>Xlf-Paxx</i> and <i>Xlf-Atm</i> double KO settings. Furthermore, massive apoptosis of post-mitotic neurons causes embryonic lethality of <i>Xrcc4<sup>M61R</sup> </i>-<i>Nhej1-/-</i> double mutants. These <i>in vivo</i> results reveal new functional interplays between XRCC4 and PAXX, ATM and Xlf in mouse development and provide new insights in the understanding of the clinical manifestations of human <i>XRCC4</i> deficient condition, in particular its absence of immune deficiency.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Filopodia powered by class X myosin promote fusion of mammalian myoblasts</a></h4>

              
                Skeletal muscle fibers are multinucleated cellular giants formed by the fusion of mononuclear myoblasts. Several molecules involved in myoblast fusion have been discovered, and finger-like projections coincident with myoblast fusion have also been implicated in the fusion process. The role of these cellular projections in muscle cell fusion was investigated herein. We demonstrate that these projections are filopodia generated by class X myosin (Myo10), an unconventional myosin motor protein specialized for filopodia. We further show that Myo10 is highly expressed by differentiating myoblasts, and Myo10 ablation inhibits both filopodia formation and myoblast fusion <i>in vitro</i>. <i>In vivo</i>, Myo10 labels regenerating muscle fibers associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and acute muscle injury. In mice, conditional loss of <i>Myo10 </i>from muscle-resident stem cells, known as satellite cells, severely impairs postnatal muscle regeneration. Furthermore, the muscle fusion proteins Myomaker and Myomixer are detected in myoblast filopodia. These data demonstrate that Myo10-driven filopodia facilitate multi-nucleated mammalian muscle formation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Activation of mTORC1 and c-Jun by Prohibitin1 loss in Schwann cells may link mitochondrial dysfunction to demyelination</a></h4>

              
                Schwann cell (SC) mitochondria are quickly emerging as an important regulator of myelin maintenance in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). However, the mechanisms underlying demyelination in the context of mitochondrial dysfunction in the PNS are incompletely understood. We recently showed that conditional ablation of the mitochondrial protein Prohibitin 1 (PHB1) in SCs causes a severe and fast progressing demyelinating peripheral neuropathy in mice, but the mechanism that causes failure of myelin maintenance remained unknown.  Here, we report that mTORC1 and c-Jun are continuously activated in the absence of <i>Phb1</i>, likely as part of the SC response to mitochondrial damage. Moreover, we demonstrate that these pathways are involved in the demyelination process, and that inhibition of mTORC1 using rapamycin partially rescues the demyelinating pathology. Therefore, we propose that mTORC1 and c-Jun may play a critical role as executioners of demyelination in the context of perturbations to SC mitochondria.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distinct population code for movement kinematics and changes of ongoing movements in human subthalamic nucleus</a></h4>

              
                The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is theorized to globally suppress movement through connections with downstream basal ganglia structures. Current theories are supported by increased STN activity when subjects withhold an uninitiated action plan, but a critical test of these theories requires studying STN responses when an ongoing action is replaced with an alternative. We perform this test in subjects with Parkinson's disease using an extended reaching task where the movement trajectory changes mid-action. We show that STN activity decreases during action switches, contrary to prevalent theories. Further, beta oscillations in the STN local field potential, which are associated with movement inhibition, do not show increased power or spiking entrainment during switches. We report an inhomogeneous population neural code in STN, with one sub-population encoding movement kinematics and direction and another encoding unexpected action switches. We suggest an elaborate neural code in STN that contributes to planning actions and changing the plans.

                <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> is an opportunistic pathogen that causes the potentially fatal pneumonia known as Legionnaires' Disease. The pathology associated with infection depends on bacterial delivery of effector proteins into the host via the membrane spanning Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS). We have determined sub-3.0 Å resolution maps of the Dot/Icm T4SS core complex by single particle cryo-EM. The high-resolution structural analysis has allowed us to identify proteins encoded outside the Dot/Icm genetic locus that contribute to the core T4SS structure. We can also now define two distinct areas of symmetry mismatch, one that connects the C18 periplasmic ring (PR) and the C13 outer membrane cap (OMC) and one that connects the C13 OMC with a 16-fold symmetric dome. Unexpectedly the connection between the PR and OMC is DotH, with five copies sandwiched between the OMC and PR to accommodate the symmetry mismatch. Finally, we observe multiple conformations in the reconstructions that indicate flexibility within the structure.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Continuous attractors for dynamic memories</a></h4>

              
                Episodic memory has a dynamic nature: when we recall past episodes, we retrieve not only their content, but also their temporal structure. The phenomenon of replay, in the hippocampus of mammals, offers a remarkable example of this temporal dynamics. However, most quantitative models of memory treat memories as static configurations, neglecting the temporal unfolding of the retrieval process. Here, we introduce a continuous attractor network model with a memory-dependent asymmetric component in the synaptic connectivity, which spontaneously breaks the equilibrium of the memory configurations and produces dynamic retrieval. The detailed analysis of the model with analytical calculations and numerical simulations shows that it can robustly retrieve multiple dynamical memories, and that this feature is largely independent of the details of its implementation. By calculating the storage capacity, we show that the dynamic component does not impair memory capacity, and can even enhance it in certain regimes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Regulation of human mTOR complexes by DEPTOR</a></h4>

              
                The vertebrate-specific DEP domain-containing mTOR interacting protein (DEPTOR), an oncoprotein or tumor suppressor, has important roles in metabolism, immunity, and cancer. It is the only protein that binds and regulates both complexes of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a central regulator of cell growth. Biochemical analysis and cryo-EM reconstructions of DEPTOR bound to human mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 reveal that both structured regions of DEPTOR, the PDZ domain and the DEP domain tandem (DEPt), are involved in mTOR interaction. The PDZ domain binds tightly with mildly activating effect, but then acts as an anchor for DEPt association that allosterically suppresses mTOR activation. The binding interfaces of the PDZ domain and DEPt also support further regulation by other signaling pathways. A separate, substrate-like mode of interaction for DEPTOR phosphorylation by mTOR complexes rationalizes inhibition of non-stimulated mTOR activity at higher DEPTOR concentrations. The multifaceted interplay between DEPTOR and mTOR provides a basis for understanding the divergent roles of DEPTOR in physiology and opens new routes for targeting the mTOR-DEPTOR interaction in disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">"Understanding Cortical Arousals during Sleep from Leg Movements: A Pilot Study."</a></h4>

              
                Leg movements during sleep occur in patients with sleep pathology and healthy individuals.  Some (but not all) leg movements during sleep are related to cortical arousals which occur without conscious awareness of the patient but have a significant effect of sleep fragmentation.  Detecting leg movements during sleep that are associated with cortical arousals can provide unique insight into the nature and quality of sleep in both health and disease.  In this study, a novel leg movement monitor is used in conjunction with polysomnography to better understand the relationship between leg movement and electroencephalogram (EEG) defined cortical arousals.  In an approach that we call neuro-extremity analysis, graph theoretic, directed connectivity metrics are used to interrogate the causal links between neural activity measured by EEG and leg movements measured by the sensors within the leg movement monitor.  The leg movement monitor in this study utilizes novel capacitive displacement sensors, and a 9-axis inertial measurement unit to characterize leg and foot movements.  First, the capacitive displacement measures more closely related to EEG-defined cortical arousals than inertial measurements.  Second, the neuro-extremity analysis reveals a temporally evolving connectivity pattern that is consistent with a model of cortical arousals in which brainstem dysfunction leads to near-instantaneous leg movements and a delayed, filtered signal to the cortex.  Neuro-extremity analysis reveals causal relationships between EEG and leg movement sensor time-series data that may aid researchers to better understand the pathophysiology of cortical arousals associated with leg movements during sleep.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bile acids gate dopamine transporter mediated currents</a></h4>

              
                Bile acids (BAs) are molecules derived from cholesterol that are involved in dietary fat absorption. New evidence supports an additional role for BAs as regulators of brain function. Interestingly, sterols such as cholesterol interact with monoamine transporters (MAT), including the dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) which plays a key role in DA neurotransmission and reward circuitries in the brain. The present study explores interactions of the BA, obeticholic acid (OCA), with DAT and mechanistically defines the regulation of DAT activity via both electrophysiology and molecular modeling. We express murine DAT (mDAT) in Xenopus laevis oocytes and confirm that DA induces an inward current that reaches a steady-state at a negative membrane voltage. Next, we show that OCA triggers an inward current through DAT that is Na+ dependent and not regulated by intracellular calcium. OCA also inhibits the DAT-mediated Li+ leak current, a feature that parallels DA action and indicates direct binding to the transporter. Interestingly, OCA does not alter DA affinity nor the ability of DA to promote a DAT-mediated inward current, suggesting that the interaction of OCA with the transporter is non-competitive, in regard to DA. The current induced by OCA is transient in nature, returning to baseline in the continued presence of the BA. To understand the molecular mechanism of how OCA affects DAT electrical activity, we performed docking simulations. These simulations revealed two potential binding sites that provide important insights into the potential functional relevance of the OCA-DAT interaction. First, in the absence of DA, OCA binds DAT through interactions with D421, a residue normally involved in coordinating the binding of the Na+ ion to the Na2 binding site (Borre et al., 2014;Cheng and Bahar, 2015). Furthermore, we uncover a separate binding site for OCA on DAT, of equal potential functional impact, that is facilitated through the residues DAT R445 and D436. This binding may stabilize the inward-facing open (IFo) state by preventing the re-formation of the IF gating salt bridges, R60-D436 and R445-E428, that are required for DA transport. This study suggests that BAs may represent novel pharmacological tools to regulate DAT function, and possibly, associated behaviors.

                Sensory processing in vertebrate olfactory systems is organized across olfactory bulb glomeruli, wherein axons of peripheral sensory neurons expressing the same olfactory receptor co-terminate to transmit receptor-specific activity to central neurons. Understanding how receptors map to glomeruli is therefore critical to understanding olfaction. High-throughput spatial transcriptomics is a rapidly advancing field, but low-abundance olfactory receptor expression within glomeruli has previously precluded high-throughput mapping of receptors to glomeruli. Here we combined spatial sectioning along the anteroposterior, dorsoventral, and mediolateral axes with target capture enrichment sequencing to overcome low-abundance target expression. This strategy allowed us to spatially map 86% of olfactory receptors across the olfactory bulb and uncover a relationship between OR sequence and glomerular position.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Diurnal modulation of multivesicular release controls the efficiency of information transmission at a sensory synapse</a></h4>

              
                Sensory circuits adapt to changes in the external world or the animal's internal state through the actions of neuromodulators. Synapses are key sites at which neuromodulators act but it is not known how they alter the amount of information transmitted. We investigated this question in the context of the diurnal regulation of visual processing in larval zebrafish, focusing on ribbon-type synapses of retinal bipolar cells. We demonstrate that contrast-sensitivity peaks in the afternoon accompanied by an average four-fold increase in the Shannon information transmitted at individual active zones. This increase reflects higher synaptic gain, lower spontaneous noise, reduced variability of stimulus-evoked release and improved temporal precision. Simultaneously, an increase in the probability of multivesicular events with larger information content increases the efficiency of information transmission (bits per vesicle) by factors of 2-3. The neuromodulator dopamine contributes to all these changes in synaptic function, although ON and OFF visual channels are differentially affected. Multivesicular release is a property of synapses in many parts of the brain and this study demonstrates that potentiation by neuromodulators can both increase the amount of information that is transmitted and the efficiency of transmission, revealing a previously unknown mechanism for adjusting neural processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microtubule assembly by soluble tau impairs vesicle endocytosis and excitatory neurotransmission via dynamin sequestration in Alzheimer's disease synapse model</a></h4>

              
                Elevation of soluble wild-type (WT) tau occurs in synaptic compartments in Alzheimer's disease. We addressed whether tau elevation affects synaptic transmission at the calyx of Held in brainstem slices. Whole-cell loading of WT human tau (h-tau) in presynaptic terminals at 10-20 M caused microtubule (MT) assembly and activity-dependent rundown of excitatory neurotransmission. Capacitance measurements revealed that the primary target of WT h-tau is vesicle endocytosis. Blocking MT assembly using nocodazole prevented tau-induced impairments of endocytosis and neurotransmission. Immunofluorescence imaging analyses revealed that MT assembly by WT h-tau loading was associated with an increased bound fraction of the endocytic protein dynamin. A synthetic dodecapeptide corresponding to dynamin-1-pleckstrin-homology domain inhibited MT-dynamin interaction and rescued tau-induced impairments of endocytosis and neurotransmission. We conclude that elevation of presynaptic WT tau induces de novo assembly of MTs, thereby sequestering free dynamins. As a result, endocytosis and subsequent vesicle replenishment are impaired, causing activity-dependent rundown of neurotransmission.

                Photoactivatable drugs and peptides are valuable tools that can drive quantitative studies into endogenous receptor signaling in relatively intact tissue preparations with high spatiotemporal resolution. We previously developed photoactivatable or caged variants of the opioid neuropeptides [Leu5]-enkephalin and dynorphin A (1-8), but these reagents activate multiple opioid receptors simultaneously upon photolysis. To achieve selective engagement of mu opioid receptors (MORs), we developed a photoactivatable derivative of the MOR-selective peptide agonist [D-Ala2, N-MePhe4, Gly-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO). Starting from commercially available DAMGO, we appended a negatively charged carboxynitroveratryl (CNV) caging group to the N-terminal tyrosine side chain (Y) to produce CNV-Y-DAMGO. Dose-response curves in a heterologous functional assay revealed that CNV-Y-DAMGO is ~1,000-fold less potent than DAMGO at MORs. In acute hippocampal brain slices, CNV-Y-DAMGO photoactivation with ultraviolet light resulted in rapid, transient suppression of inhibitory synaptic transmission, and this was blocked by the MOR-selective antagonist CTAP. These results validate CNV-Y-DAMGO as a photopharmacological reagent for manipulating endogenous MOR signaling in brain tissue with light.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The opposing Chloride Cotransporters KCC and NKCC control locomotor activity inconstant light and during long days.</a></h4>

              
                Cation Chloride Cotransporters (CCCs) regulate intracellular chloride ion concentration ([Cl-]i) within neurons, which can reverse the direction of the neuronal response to the neurotransmitter GABA. Na+ K+ Cl- (NKCC) and K+ Cl- (KCC) cotransporters transport Cl- into or out of the cell, respectively. When NKCC activity dominates, the resulting high [Cl-]i can lead to an excitatory and depolarizing response of the neuron upon GABAA receptor opening, while KCC dominance has the opposite effect. This inhibitory-to-excitatory GABA switch has been linked to seasonal adaption of circadian clock function to changing day length, and its dysregulation is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as epilepsy. Constant light normally disrupts circadian clock function and leads to arrhythmic behavior. Here, we demonstrate a function for KCC in regulating Drosophila locomotor activity and GABA responses in circadian clock neurons because alteration of KCC expression in circadian clock neurons elicits rhythmic behavior in constant light. We observed the same effects after downregulation of the Wnk and Fray kinases, which modulate CCC activity in a [Cl-]i-dependent manner. Patch-clamp recordings from clock neurons show that downregulation of KCC results in a more positive GABA reversal potential, while KCC overexpression has the opposite effect. Finally, KCC downregulation represses morning behavioral activity during long photoperiods, while downregulation of NKCC promotes morning activity. In summary, our results support a model in which the regulation of [Cl-]i by a KCC/NKCC/Wnk/Fray feedback loop determines the response of clock neurons to GABA, which is important for adjusting behavioral activity to constant light and long-day conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Physiological noise optimizes multiplexed coding of vibrotactile-like signals in somatosensory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neurons can use different aspects of their spiking to simultaneously represent (multiplex) different features of a stimulus. For example, some pyramidal neurons in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) use the rate and timing of their spikes to respectively encode the intensity and frequency of vibrotactile stimuli. Doing so has several requirements. Because they fire at low rates, pyramidal neurons cannot entrain 1:1 with high-frequency (100-600 Hz) inputs and instead must skip (i.e. not respond to) some stimulus cycles. The proportion of skipped cycles must vary inversely with stimulus intensity for firing rate to encode stimulus intensity. Spikes must phase lock to the stimulus for spike times (intervals) to encode stimulus frequency but, in addition, skipping must occur irregularly to avoid aliasing. Using simulations and in vitro experiments in which S1 pyramidal neurons were stimulated with inputs emulating those induced by vibrotactile stimuli, we show that fewer cycles are skipped as stimulus intensity increases, as required for rate coding, and that physiological noise induces irregular skipping without disrupting phase locking, as required for temporal coding. This occurs because the reliability and precision of spikes evoked by small-amplitude, fast-onset signals are differentially sensitive to noise. Simulations confirmed that differences in stimulus intensity and frequency can be well discriminated based on differences in spike rate or timing, respectively, but only in the presence of noise. Our results show that multiplexed coding by S1 pyramidal neurons is facilitated rather than degraded by physiological levels of noise. In fact, multiplexing is optimal under physiologically noisy conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reduced plasticity in coupling strength in the SCN clock in aging as revealed by Kuramoto modelling</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian circadian clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and consist of a network of coupled neurons, which are entrained to the environmental light-dark cycle. The phase coherence of the neurons is plastic and driven by the length of the day. With aging the capacity to behaviorally adapt to changes in the light regime reduces. The mechanisms underlying photoperiodic adaptation are largely unknown, but are important to unravel for the development of novel interventions to improve the quality of life of the elderly. We analyzed the neuronal synchronization of PER2::LUC protein expression in the SCN of young and old mice entrained to either long or short photoperiod and used the synchronization levels as input for a two-community noisy Kuramoto model. With the Kuramoto model we estimated the coupling strength between and within neuronal subpopulations. The model revealed that the coupling strength between and within subpopulations contributes to photoperiod induced changes in the phase relationship among neurons. We found that the SCN of young mice adapts in coupling strength over a large range, with low coupling strength in long photoperiod and higher coupling strength in short photoperiod. In aged mice we also found low coupling strength in long photoperiod, but strongly reduced capacity to reach high coupling strength in short photoperiod. The inability to respond with an increase in coupling strength shows that manipulation of photoperiod is not a suitable strategy to enhance clock function with aging. We conclude that the inability of aged mice to reach high coupling strength makes aged mice less capable to seasonal adaptation than young mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">NeuroML-DB: Sharing and characterizing data-driven neuroscience models described in NeuroML</a></h4>

              
                As researchers develop computational models of neural systems with increasing sophistication and scale, it is often the case that fully de novo model development is impractical and inefficient. Thus arises a critical need to quickly find, evaluate, re-use, and build upon models and model components developed by other researchers. We introduce the NeuroML Database (NeuroML-DB.org), which has been developed to address this need and to complement other model sharing resources. NeuroML-DB stores over 1,500 previously published models of ion channels, cells, and networks that have been translated to the modular NeuroML model description language. The database also provides reciprocal links to other neuroscience model databases (ModelDB, Open Source Brain) as well as access to the original model publications (PubMed). These links along with Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF) search functionality provide deep integration with other neuroscience community modeling resources and greatly facilitate the task of finding suitable models for reuse. Serving as an intermediate language, NeuroML and its tooling ecosystem enable efficient translation of models to other popular simulator formats. The modular nature also enables efficient analysis of a large number of models and inspection of their properties. Search capabilities of the database, together with web-based, programmable online interfaces, allow the community of researchers to rapidly assess stored model electrophysiology, morphology, and computational complexity properties. We use these capabilities to perform a database-scale analysis of neuron and ion channel models and describe a novel tetrahedral structure formed by cell model clusters in the space of model properties and features.

	<p>Background: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by impairments in social interaction and reciprocal communication. ASD affects about 1% of the general population and is associated with substantial disability and economic loss. A variety of approaches to improve the core deficits and lives of people with ASD have been developed, including behavioral, developmental, educational, and medical interventions. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a neuro-psychomotor approach in children affected by ASD. Methods: The sample consisted of 84 children (66 males, mean age 56.9 ± 15.8 months) affected by ASD assessed between September 2020 to March 2021. The trained therapist was asked to complete the ASD behavior inventory (ASDBI) test at baseline (T0) (September 2020) and after six months (T1) (March 2021) to assess the child’s evolution over the observational period. The study was carried out in southern Italy (Campania Region). Results: ASD children showed a significant improvement for AUTISM composite after 6 months of neuro-psychomotor treatment (T1) compared to baseline (65.4 ± 12.2 vs. 75.8 ± 11.5, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). In particular, significant changes were observed for such domains as the problems of excitability (ECCIT), aggression (AGG), behaviors in social relations (RELSOC), expressive (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), sense/perceptual contact modes (SENS) (p = 0.0007), ritualisms/resistance to changes (RIT) (p = 0.0002), pragmatic/social problems (PPSOC) (p = 0.0009), specific fears (FEARS) (p = 0.01), and learning and memory (AMLR) (p = 0.0007). No differences for the domains Semantic/pragmatic problems (PPSEM) and language (LESP) were found. Conclusions: Our preliminary results suggest the usefulness of the neuro-psychomotor treatment in children with ASD. Although promising, these findings need to be tested further to better understand the long-term effects of this specific type of approach.</p>

	<p>Background: Evaluation of plantar pressure in stroke patients is a parameter that could be used for monitoring and comparing how the timing of starting a rehabilitation program effects patient improvement. Methods: We performed the following clinical and functional evaluations: initial moment (T1), intermediate (T2), and final evaluation at one year (T3). At T1 we studied 100 stroke patients in two groups, A and B (each 50 patients). The first group, A, started rehabilitation in the first three months after having a stroke, and group B started after three months from the time of stroke. Due to the impediments observed during rehabilitation, we made biomechanic evaluation for two lots, I and II (each 25 patients). Assessment of the patient was carried out by clinical (neurologic examination), functional (using the Tinetti Functional Gait Assessment Test for classifying the gait), and biomechanical evaluation (maximal plantar pressure (Pmax), contact area (CA), and pressure distribution (COP)). Results: The Tinetti scale for gait had the following scores: for group A, from 1.34 at the initial moment (T1) to 10.64 at final evaluation (T3), and for group B, 3.08 at initial moment (T1) to 9 at final evaluation (T3). Distribution of COP in the left hemiparesis was uneven at T1 but evolved after rehabilitation. The right hemiparesis had uniform COP distribution even at T1, explained by motor dominance on the right side. CA and Pmax for lot I increased more than 100%, meaning that there is a possibility for favorable improvement if the patients start the rehabilitation program in the first three months after stroke. For lot II, increases of the parameters were less than lot I. Discussions: The recovery potential is higher for patients with right hemiparesis. Biomechanic evaluation showed diversity regarding compensatory mechanisms for the paretic and nonparetic lower limb. Conclusions: CA and Pmax are relevant assessments for evaluating the effects on timing of starting a rehabilitation program after a stroke.</p>

	<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease, is characterized by progressive cognitive impairment. The deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau is considered the hallmark of AD pathology. Many therapeutic approaches such as Food and Drug Administration-approved cholinesterase inhibitors and N–methyl–D–aspartate receptor antagonists have been used to intervene in AD pathology. However, current therapies only provide limited symptomatic relief and are ineffective in preventing AD progression. Cannabidiol (CBD), a phytocannabinoid devoid of psychoactive responses, provides neuroprotective effects through both cannabinoid and noncannabinoid receptors. Recent studies using an AD mouse model have suggested that CBD can reverse cognitive deficits along with Aβ-induced neuroinflammatory, oxidative responses, and neuronal death. Furthermore, CBD can reduce the accumulation of Aβ and hyperphosphorylation of tau, suggesting the possibility of delaying AD progression. Particularly, the noncannabinoid receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, has been suggested to be involved in multiple functions of CBD. Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanisms of CBD is necessary for intervening in AD pathology in depth and for the translation of preclinical studies into clinical settings. In this review, we summarize recent studies on the effect of CBD in AD and suggest problems to be overcome for the therapeutic use of CBD.</p>

	<p>Disease or acquired damage to the central nervous system frequently causes disabling spasticity and central neuropathic pain (NP), both of which are frequent in multiple sclerosis (MS) and spinal cord injury (SCI). Patients with MS and SCI often request treatment with cannabis-based medicine (CBM). However, knowledge about effects, side effects, choice of active cannabinoids (Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD) alone or in combination), and doses of CBM remains limited. Using a double-blind, parallel design in a national multicenter cohort, this study examines the effect of CBM on spasticity and NP. Patients are randomized to treatment with capsules containing either THC, CBD, THC and CBD, or placebo. Primary endpoints are patient-reported pain and spasticity on a numerical rating scale. Other endpoints include quality of life and sleep, depression and anxiety, and relief of pain and spasticity. Side-effects of CBM are described. In a sub-study, the pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of oral capsule CBM are examined. We expect that the study will contribute to the literature by providing information on the effects and side-effects of CBD, THC, and the combination of the two for central neuropathic pain and spasticity. Furthermore, we will describe the PD/PK of THC and CBD in a patient population.</p>

	<p>Background: Chronic traumatic brain injury is a condition that predisposes the brain to activate B-cells and produce neural autoantibodies. Anti-adaptor protein 3, subunit B2 (AP3B2) autoantibodies have thus far been associated with diseases affecting the cerebellum or vestibulocerebellum. Through this case report, we aim to broaden the spectrum of anti-AP3B2-associated disease. Case description: We report on a 51-year-old woman with a brain injury approximately 28 years ago who recently underwent neuropsychological testing, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (cMRI), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Neural autoantibodies were determined in serum and CSF. Our patient suffered from mild cognitive impairment (amnestic MCI, multiple domains) with stable memory deficits and a decline in verbal fluency and processing speed within a two-year interval after the first presentation in our memory clinic. Brain MRI showed brain damage in the right temporoparietal, frontolateral region and thalamus, as well as in the left posterior border of the capsula interna and white matter in the frontal region. Since the brain damage, she suffered paresis of the upper extremities on the left side and lower extremities on the right side as well as gait disturbance. Our search for autoantibodies revealed anti-AP3B2 autoantibodies in serum. Conclusions: Our report expands the spectrum of symptoms to mild cognitive impairment in addition to a gait disturbance associated with anti-AP3B2 autoantibodies. Furthermore, it is conceivable that a prior traumatic brain injury could initiate the development of anti-AP3B2-antibody-associated brain autoimmunity, reported here for the first time.</p>

	<p>Primary progressive aphasias (PPAs) are a group of neurodegenerative diseases presenting with insidious and relentless language impairment. Three main PPA variants have been described: the non-fluent/agrammatic variant (nfvPPA), the semantic variant (svPPA), and the logopenic variant (lvPPA). At the time of diagnosis, patients and their families’ main question pertains to prognosis and evolution, but very few data exist to support clinicians’ claims. The objective of this study was to review the current literature on the longitudinal changes in cognition, behaviours, and functional abilities in the three main PPA variants. A comprehensive review was undertaken via a search on PUBMED and EMBASE. Two authors independently reviewed a total of 65 full-text records for eligibility. A total of 14 group studies and one meta-analysis were included. Among these, eight studies included all three PPA variants. Eight studies were prospective, and the follow-up duration was between one and five years. Overall, svPPA patients showed more behavioural disturbances both at baseline and over the course of the disease. Patients with lvPPA showed a worse cognitive decline, especially in episodic memory, and faster progression to dementia. Finally, patients with nfvPPA showed the most significant losses in language production and functional abilities. Data regarding the prodromal and last stages of PPA are still missing and studies with a longer follow-up observation period are needed.</p>

	<p>Background: Observational tools have been developed to assess pain in cognitively impaired individuals. It is not known, however, whether these tools are universal enough so that even pain depicted in print art can be assessed reliably. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the reliability in scoring facial expressions of pain in dental print art from the 17th, 18th, and 19th century, using a Short Form of the 15-item Pain Assessment in Impaired Cognition (PAIC15-SF) tool. Methods: Seventeen prints of patients undergoing dental procedures were scored twice by two inexperienced observers and an expert and once by a Gold Standard observer. Results: All observers achieved high intra-observer reliability for all four items of the category “facial expressions” and for three items of the category “body movements” (ICC: 0.748–0.991). The remaining two items of the category “body movements”, viz., “rubbing” and “restlessness”, were excluded from further research because it was not possible to calculate a reliable ICC. Overall, the intra-observer reliability of the expert was higher than that of the inexperienced observers. The inter-observer reliability scores varied from poor to excellent (ICC: 0.000–0.970). In comparison to the Gold Standard, the inter-observer reliability of the expert was higher than that of the inexperienced observers. Conclusion: The PAIC15-SF tool is universal enough even to allow reliable assessment of facial expressions of pain depicted in dental print art.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Direct Comparison of Afferents to the Rat Anterior Thalamic Nuclei and Nucleus Reuniens: Overlapping But Different</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Both nucleus reuniens and the anterior thalamic nuclei are densely interconnected with medial cortical and hippocampal areas, connections that reflect their respective contributions to learning and memory. To better appreciate their comparative roles, pairs of different retrograde tracers were placed in these two thalamic sites in adult rats. Both thalamic sites receive modest cortical inputs from layer V that contrasted with much denser projections from layer VI. Despite frequent overlap in layer VI, ventral prefrontal and anterior cingulate inputs to nucleus reuniens were concentrated in the deepest sublayer (VIb). Meanwhile, inputs to the anterior thalamic nuclei originated more evenly from both sublayers VIa and VIb, with the result that they were often located more superficially than the projections to nucleus reuniens. Again, while the many hippocampal (subiculum) neurons projecting to nucleus reuniens and the anterior thalamic nuclei were partially intermingled within the deep cellular parts of the subiculum, cells projecting to nucleus reuniens consistently tended to lie even deeper (i.e., immediately adjacent to the alveus). Variable numbers of double-labeled cells were present in those cortical and subicular portions where the two cell populations intermingled, though they remained in a minority. Our data also show how projections to these two thalamic sites are organized in opposing dorsal/ventral and rostral/caudal gradients across both the cortex and hippocampal formation. While the anterior thalamic nuclei are preferentially innervated by dorsal cortical sites, more ventral frontal sites preferentially reach nucleus reuniens. These anatomic differences may underpin the complementary cognitive functions of these two thalamic areas.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Non-invasive health prediction from visually observable features [version 1; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The unprecedented development of Artificial Intelligence has revolutionised the healthcare industry. In the next generation of healthcare systems, self-diagnosis will be pivotal to personalised healthcare services. During the COVID-19 pandemic, new screening and diagnostic approaches like mobile health are well-positioned to reduce disease spread and overcome geographical barriers. This paper presents a non-invasive screening approach to predict the health of a person from visually observable features using machine learning techniques. Images like face and skin surface of the patients are acquired using camera or mobile devices and analysed to derive clinical reasoning and prediction of the person’s health. Methods: In specific, a two-level classification approach is presented. The proposed hierarchical model chooses a class by training a binary classifier at the node of the hierarchy. Prediction is then made using a set of class-specific reduced feature set. Results: Testing accuracies of 86.87% and 76.84% are reported for the first and second-level classification. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields favourable prediction results while greatly reduces the computational time. Conclusions: The study suggests that it is possible to predict the health condition of a person based on his/her face appearance using cost-effective machine learning approaches.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Thalamic influence on slow wave slope renormalization during sleep</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Slow waves are thought to mediate an overall reduction in synaptic strength during sleep. The specific contribution of the thalamus to this so-called synaptic renormalization is unknown. Thalamic stroke is associated with daytime sleepiness, along with changes to sleep electroencephalography and cognition making it a unique “experiment of nature” to assess the relationship between sleep rhythms, synaptic renormalization, and daytime functions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Sleep was studied by polysomnography and high-density electroencephalography over 17 nights in patients with thalamic (n = 12) and 15 nights in patients with extra-thalamic (n = 11) stroke. Sleep electroencephalography overnight slow wave slope changes, and their relationship with subjective daytime sleepiness, cognition, and other functional tests were assessed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Thalamic and extra-thalamic patients did not differ in terms of age, sleep duration or apnea-hypopnea index. Conversely, overnight slope changes were reduced in a large cluster of electrodes in thalamic compared to extra-thalamic stroke patients. This reduction was related to increased daytime sleepiness. No significant differences were found in other functional tests between the two groups.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In patients with thalamic stroke a reduction in overnight slow wave slope change and increased daytime sleepiness was found. Sleep- and wake-centered mechanisms for this relationship are discussed. Overall, this study suggests a central role of the thalamus in synaptic renormalization.</p>

                Background: Smoking is one of the top three causes of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Natural antioxidants including black cumin (Nigella sativa) may inhibit the pathogenesis of initial process of atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of black cumin (Nigella sativa) in preventing endothelial dysfunction mainly through macrophage M1/M2 inflammatory response in cigarette smoked male Wistars. Methods: In total, 50 Wistar rats were randomly allocated to five experimental groups: two control groups, namely no intervention (K-) and exposure to smoke of 40 cigarettes each day (K+); and three treatment groups: rats given a dose of 0.3 g (P1), 0.6 g (P2) or 1.2 g (P3) black cumin per kilograms bodyweight/ day, respectively, and exposed to smoke of 40 cigarettes each day. After 28 days of cigarette smoke exposure, macrophage M1/M2 ratio was evaluated by counting total M1 and M2 in ten microscope field of view. Data were analysed by Mann-Whitney test. Results: The M1 / ​​M2 ratio on K (-) was 0.9 7 ± 0.9 8 (<1) which means M2 was dominant, while the M1 / ​​M2 ratio on K (+) was of 4.97 ± 3.42 (> 1) which means M1 dominant. There was no significant difference in the number of M1 count in treatment groups P1, P2, P3 (p value = 0.996; 0.170; 0.884, respectively) when compared with K+. Additionally, P2 group has the lower M1 number with the highest significance value when compared to K+. The number of M1 counts on P1 did not differ significantly when compared to P2 with p = 0.121 and P3 with p = 0.936. Conclusions: In sum, ethanol extract of black cumin prevents endothelial dysfunction by inhibiting increase in macrophages M1 / M2 ratio in rats Wistar exposed to sub-chronic cigarette smoke.

                <p>The frequency of CD20<sup>+</sup> T cells was recently reported to be increased in several inflammatory conditions. We report that in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) CD20<sup>+</sup> T cells display a distinct pro-inflammatory phenotype with pathogenic properties. Anti-CD20 treatment virtually extinguished CD20<sup>+</sup> T cells, which may be important for its broad effectiveness. Dimethylfumarat dampened the activity of differentiated CD20<sup>+</sup> T cells, while fingolimod reduced their abundance only as part of its overall T cell suppressive capacity. Of note, natalizumab treatment increased the frequency of CD20<sup>+</sup> effector T cells, highlighting that widely-used MS therapeutics affect this pro-inflammatory T cell subset with assumed pathogenic potential surprisingly differentially.</p>

                Background: Sea grapes or  Caulerpa racemosa have a lot of phytochemical content, especially unsaturated fatty acids that are beneficial for health. This study aims to evaluate the effects of sea grapes extract on blood glucose levels, total cholesterol-, and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC)-1α in male Wistar rats, which were given per-oral (p.o.) cholesterol- and carbohydrates fat-enriched diets (CFED). Methods: Forty male Wistar albino rats weighing between 200 – 250 g were used for this study. Animals were randomly distributed into four groups of ten animals each. Group A served as control (received standard dry pellet diet). Rats in group B were fed on CFED for 4 weeks.  Groups C and D were fed on CFED and were administered 150 and 450 mg/kg of  sea grapes extract (p.o.), respectively. Results: Group C rats indicated a blood glucose reduction and an increase in PGC-1α serum, in comparison to group D (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between group C and D in blood cholesterol reduction (high dose of the extract did not have significant effects) (p=0.222), and both groups had the same effect in lowering total cholesterol in rats. Conclusion: Sea grapes extract is proven to improve blood glucose, total cholesterol, and PGC-1α levels in rats fed with CFED.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Characterization of the NiRAN domain from RNA-dependent RNA polymerase provides insights into a potential therapeutic target against SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Abhisek Dwivedy, Richard Mariadasse, Mohammed Ahmad, Sayan Chakraborty, Deepsikha Kar, Satish Tiwari, Sankar Bhattacharyya, Sudipta Sonar, Shailendra Mani, Prafullakumar Tailor, Tanmay Majumdar, Jeyaraman Jeyakanthan, Bichitra Kumar Biswal</p>

Apart from the canonical fingers, palm and thumb domains, the RNA dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) from the viral order <i>Nidovirales</i> possess two additional domains. Of these, the function of the Nidovirus RdRp associated nucleotidyl transferase domain (NiRAN) remains unanswered. The elucidation of the 3D structure of RdRp from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), provided the first ever insights into the domain organisation and possible functional characteristics of the NiRAN domain. Using <i>in silico</i> tools, we predict that the NiRAN domain assumes a kinase or phosphotransferase like fold and binds nucleoside triphosphates at its proposed active site. Additionally, using molecular docking we have predicted the binding of three widely used kinase inhibitors and five well characterized anti-microbial compounds at the NiRAN domain active site along with their drug-likeliness. For the first time ever, using basic biochemical tools, this study shows the presence of a kinase like activity exhibited by the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Interestingly, a well-known kinase inhibitor- Sorafenib showed a significant inhibition and dampened viral load in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. In line with the current global COVID-19 pandemic urgency and the emergence of newer strains with significantly higher infectivity, this study provides a new anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug target and potential lead compounds for drug repurposing against SARS-CoV-2.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling to explore the potential impact of asymptomatic human infections on transmission and dynamics of African sleeping sickness</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Maryam Aliee, Matt J. Keeling, Kat S. Rock</p>

<i>Gambiense</i> human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT, sleeping sickness) is one of several neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) where there is evidence of asymptomatic human infection but there is uncertainty of the role it plays in transmission and maintenance. To explore possible consequences of asymptomatic infections, particularly in the context of elimination of transmission—a goal set to be achieved by 2030—we propose a novel dynamic transmission model to account for the asymptomatic population. This extends an established framework, basing infection progression on a number of experimental and observation gHAT studies. Asymptomatic gHAT infections include those in people with blood-dwelling trypanosomes, but no discernible symptoms, or those with parasites only detectable in skin. Given current protocols, asymptomatic infection with blood parasites may be diagnosed and treated, based on observable parasitaemia, in contrast to many other diseases for which treatment (and/or diagnosis) may be based on symptomatic infection. We construct a model in which exposed people can either progress to either asymptomatic skin-only parasite infection, which would not be diagnosed through active screening algorithms, or blood-parasite infection, which is likely to be diagnosed if tested. We add extra parameters to the baseline model including different self-cure, recovery, transmission and detection rates for skin-only or blood infections. Performing sensitivity analysis suggests all the new parameters introduced in the asymptomatic model can impact the infection dynamics substantially. Among them, the proportion of exposures resulting in initial skin or blood infection appears the most influential parameter. For some plausible parameterisations, an initial fall in infection prevalence due to interventions could subsequently stagnate even under continued screening due to the formation of a new, lower endemic equilibrium. Excluding this scenario, our results still highlight the possibility for asymptomatic infection to slow down progress towards elimination of transmission. Location-specific model fitting will be needed to determine if and where this could pose a threat.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Stochastic model of lignocellulosic material saccharification</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eric Behle, Adélaïde Raguin</p>

The processing of agricultural wastes towards extraction of renewable resources is recently being considered as a promising alternative to conventional biofuel production. The degradation of agricultural residues is a complex chemical process that is currently time intensive and costly. Various pre-treatment methods are being investigated to determine the subsequent modification of the material and the main obstacles in increasing the enzymatic saccharification. In this study, we present a computational model that complements the experimental approaches. We decipher how the three-dimensional structure of the substrate impacts the saccharification dynamics. We model a cell wall microfibril composed of cellulose and surrounded by hemicellulose and lignin, with various relative abundances and arrangements. This substrate is subjected to digestion by different cocktails of well characterized enzymes. The saccharification dynamics is simulated <i>in silico</i> using a stochastic procedure based on a Gillespie algorithm. As we additionally implement a fitting procedure that optimizes the parameters of the simulation runs, we are able to reproduce experimental saccharification time courses for corn stover. Our model highlights the synergistic action of enzymes, and confirms the linear decrease of sugar conversion when either lignin content or crystallinity of the substrate increases. Importantly, we show that considering the crystallinity of cellulose in addition to the substrate composition is essential to interpret experimental saccharification data. Finally, our findings support the hypothesis of xylan being partially crystalline.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">An assembly-free method of phylogeny reconstruction using short-read sequences from pooled samples without barcodes</a></h4>

A current strategy for obtaining haplotype information from several individuals involves short-read sequencing of pooled amplicons, where fragments from each individual is identified by a unique DNA barcode. In this paper, we report a new method to recover the phylogeny of haplotypes from short-read sequences obtained using pooled amplicons from a mixture of individuals, without barcoding. The method, AFPhyloMix, accepts an alignment of the mixture of reads against a reference sequence, obtains the single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNP) patterns along the alignment, and constructs the phylogenetic tree according to the SNP patterns. AFPhyloMix adopts a Bayesian inference model to estimate the phylogeny of the haplotypes and their relative abundances, given that the number of haplotypes is known. In our simulations, AFPhyloMix achieved at least 80% accuracy at recovering the phylogenies and relative abundances of the constituent haplotypes, for mixtures with up to 15 haplotypes. AFPhyloMix also worked well on a real data set of kangaroo mitochondrial DNA sequences.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A statistical model for describing and simulating microbial community profiles</a></h4>

Many methods have been developed for statistical analysis of microbial community profiles, but due to the complex nature of typical microbiome measurements (e.g. sparsity, zero-inflation, non-independence, and compositionality) and of the associated underlying biology, it is difficult to compare or evaluate such methods within a single systematic framework. To address this challenge, we developed SparseDOSSA (Sparse Data Observations for the Simulation of Synthetic Abundances): a statistical model of microbial ecological population structure, which can be used to parameterize real-world microbial community profiles and to simulate new, realistic profiles of known structure for methods evaluation. Specifically, SparseDOSSA’s model captures marginal microbial feature abundances as a zero-inflated log-normal distribution, with additional model components for absolute cell counts and the sequence read generation process, microbe-microbe, and microbe-environment interactions. Together, these allow fully known covariance structure between synthetic features (i.e. “taxa”) or between features and “phenotypes” to be simulated for method benchmarking. Here, we demonstrate SparseDOSSA’s performance for 1) accurately modeling human-associated microbial population profiles; 2) generating synthetic communities with controlled population and ecological structures; 3) spiking-in true positive synthetic associations to benchmark analysis methods; and 4) recapitulating an end-to-end mouse microbiome feeding experiment. Together, these represent the most common analysis types in assessment of real microbial community environmental and epidemiological statistics, thus demonstrating SparseDOSSA’s utility as a general-purpose aid for modeling communities and evaluating quantitative methods. An open-source implementation is available at http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/sparsedossa2.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multilevel selection favors fragmentation modes that maintain cooperative interactions in multispecies communities</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gil J. B. Henriques, Simon van Vliet, Michael Doebeli</p>

Reproduction is one of the requirements for evolution and a defining feature of life. Yet, across the tree of life, organisms reproduce in many different ways. Groups of cells (e.g., multicellular organisms, colonial microbes, or multispecies biofilms) divide by releasing propagules that can be single-celled or multicellular. What conditions determine the number and size of reproductive propagules? In multicellular organisms, existing theory suggests that single-cell propagules prevent the accumulation of deleterious mutations (e.g., cheaters). However, groups of cells, such as biofilms, sometimes contain multiple metabolically interdependent species. This creates a reproductive dilemma: small daughter groups, which prevent the accumulation of cheaters, are also unlikely to contain the species diversity that is required for ecological success. Here, we developed an individual-based, multilevel selection model to investigate how such multi-species groups can resolve this dilemma. By tracking the dynamics of groups of cells that reproduce by fragmenting into smaller groups, we identified fragmentation modes that can maintain cooperative interactions. We systematically varied the fragmentation mode and calculated the maximum mutation rate that communities can withstand before being driven to extinction by the accumulation of cheaters. We find that for groups consisting of a single species, the optimal fragmentation mode consists of releasing single-cell propagules. For multi-species groups we find various optimal strategies. With migration between groups, single-cell propagules are favored. Without migration, larger propagules sizes are optimal; in this case, group-size dependent fissioning rates can prevent the accumulation of cheaters. Our work shows that multi-species groups can evolve reproductive strategies that allow them to maintain cooperative interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Wireless power transfer with transmit diversity [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Wireless power transfer is important for energizing and recharging the Internet-of-Things (IoT) cordlessly. Harnessing energy effectively from radio waves has become a crucial task. It is known that diversities at the transmitting antenna and waves (i.e. simultaneous continuous waves with center frequencies separated apart) can enhance the radio frequency (RF) to direct current (DC) energy conversion. What remains unknown is the extent of which the wave diversity enhances the conversion gain. This study attempts to examine the RF-to-DC conversion gain of applying wave diversity. This paper investigates the effects of wave diversity on the energy conversion efficiency, and contributes the analytical expression that relate the conversion efficiency to the diversity count, i.e. the number of simultaneously transmitted sinewaves. Methods: We adopted a theoretical approach to the problem. First, we derived and presented a theoretical model that incorporated different forms of transmit diversity, i.e. antenna and wave diversities. This model then connected a RF-to-DC energy conversion model resulting from polynomial fitting on circuit simulation results. With the availability of these two models, we determined the theoretical energy conversion gain of simultaneously transmitting multiple sinewaves. Results: The results showed that transmitting multiple sinewaves simultaneously yields diversity gain and higher energy conversion efficiency. Most importantly, the gain and conversion efficiency can now be theoretically quantified. For example, at certain RF power measured at the receiver circuit, the diversity gain of transmitting four sinewaves is 2.6 (as compared to transmitting single sinewave). In fact, both the diversity gain and conversion efficiency increased with the number of simultaneously transmitted sinewaves. In another example, the conversion efficiency of transmitting four sinewaves is 0.1 as compared to 0.075 of two sinewaves. Conclusions: In summary, this paper presents a novel analytical expression for wave diversity in the context of wireless power transfer.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Spatial memory impairments are observed in people with Huntington's disease (HD), however, the domain of spatial memory has received little focus when characterizing the cognitive phenotype of HD. Spatial memory is traditionally thought to be a hippocampal-dependent function, while the neuropathology of HD centers on the striatum. Alongside spatial memory deficits in HD, recent neurocognitive theories suggest that a larger brain network is involved, including the striatum. We examined the relationship between hippocampal and striatal volumes and spatial memory in 36 HD gene expansion carriers, including premanifest (<i>n</i> = 24) and early manifest HD (<i>n</i> = 12), and 32 matched healthy controls. We assessed spatial memory with Paired Associates Learning, Rey–Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, and the Virtual House task, which assesses three components of spatial memory: navigation, object location, and plan drawing. Caudate nucleus, putamen, and hippocampal volumes were manually segmented on T1-weighted MR images. As expected, caudate nucleus and putamen volumes were significantly smaller in the HD group compared to controls, with manifest HD having more severe atrophy than the premanifest HD group. Hippocampal volumes did not differ significantly between HD and control groups. Nonetheless, on average, the HD group performed significantly worse than controls across all spatial memory tasks. The spatial memory components of object location and recall of figural and topographical drawings were associated with striatal and hippocampal volumes in the HD cohort. We provide a case to include spatial memory impairments in the cognitive phenotype of HD, and extend the neurocognitive picture of HD beyond its primary pathology within the striatum.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Interaction between Preterm White Matter Injury and Childhood Thalamic Growth</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine how preterm white matter injury (WMI) and long-term thalamic growth interact to predict 8-year neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A prospective cohort of 114 children born at 24 to 32 weeksʼ gestational age (GA) underwent structural and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging early in life (median 32 weeks), at term-equivalent age and at 8 years. Manual segmentation of neonatal WMI was performed on T1-weighted images and thalamic volumes were obtained using the MAGeT brain segmentation pipeline. Cognitive, motor, and visual-motor outcomes were evaluated at 8 years of age. Multivariable regression was used to examine the relationship among neonatal WMI volume, school-age thalamic volume, and neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>School-age thalamic volumes were predicted by neonatal thalamic growth rate, GA, sex, and neonatal WMI volume (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). After accounting for total cerebral volume, WMI volume remained associated with school-age thalamic volume (β = −0.31, <i>p</i> = 0.005). In thalamocortical tracts, fractional anisotropy (FA) at term-equivalent age interacted with early WMI volume to predict school-age thalamic volumes (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.02). School-age thalamic volumes and neonatal WMI interacted to predict full-scale IQ (<i>p</i> = 0.002) and adverse motor scores among those with significant WMI (<i>p</i> = 0.01). Visual-motor scores were predicted by thalamic volumes (<i>p</i> = 0.04).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In very preterm-born children, neonatal thalamic growth and WMI volume predict school-age thalamic volumes. The emergence at term of an interaction between FA and WMI to impact school-age thalamic volume indicates dysmaturation as a mechanism of thalamic growth failure. Cognition is predicted by the interaction of WMI and thalamic growth, highlighting the need to consider multiple dimensions of brain injury in these children. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                Bruxism is a disease with a multifactorial etiology. Its clinical manifestations are most often an unaesthetic smile with abraded tooth surfaces, temporomandibular disorders and muscle hyperactivity. Here we present a case of bruxism where proper articulation of the occlusal splint was performed using the T-scan Novus system. A patient with bruxism underwent treatment with stabilization splint made by 3D printer technology. Intraoral scanning was performed using Trios Color (3Shape), and the digital design was achieved using the 3Shape Dental system design - splint studio. Formlabs Form 2 printer with biocompatible resin Dental LT Clear Resin was used for printing. The T-Scan Novus system with software attached to it, version 9.1, was used for digital examination of the occlusion. A 2.7 mm thick occlusal splint was developed, and the software adapted the occlusion with antagonists. After adjustment with T-Scan Novus, a reduction in disocclusion time of the patient was achieved, which is a desired result in the treatment of bruxism. The position of the joint components was proven radiologically. The treatment of bruxism with splint therapy continues to be the main method of treatment. Using digital technology allows for more accurate constructions and precise balancing of occlusal relationships.

Here the authors show that CTCF is not only pivotal for 3D chromatin structure and enhancer-promoter interactions in zebrafish, but it is also essential for controlling the expression of thousands of genes during development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">In situ cryo-ET structure of phycobilisome–photosystem II supercomplex from red alga</a></h4>

              
                Phycobilisome (PBS) is the main light-harvesting antenna in cyanobacteria and red algae. How PBS transfers the light energy to photosystem II (PSII) remains to be elucidated. Here we report the in situ structure of the PBS–PSII supercomplex from <i>Porphyridium purpureum</i> UTEX 2757 using cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging. Our work reveals the organized network of hemiellipsoidal PBS with PSII on the thylakoid membrane in the native cellular environment. In the PBS–PSII supercomplex, each PBS interacts with six PSII monomers, of which four directly bind to the PBS, and two bind indirectly. Additional three ‘connector’ proteins also contribute to the connections between PBS and PSIIs. Two PsbO subunits from adjacent PSII dimers bind with each other, which may promote stabilization of the PBS–PSII supercomplex. By analyzing the interaction interface between PBS and PSII, we reveal that α<sup>LCM</sup> and ApcD connect with CP43 of PSII monomer and that α<sup>LCM</sup> also interacts with CP47' of the neighboring PSII monomer, suggesting the multiple light energy delivery pathways. The in situ structures illustrate the coupling pattern of PBS and PSII and the arrangement of the PBS–PSII supercomplex on the thylakoid, providing the near-native 3D structural information of the various energy transfer from PBS to PSII.

                The extent splicing is regulated at single-cell resolution has remained controversial due to both available data and methods to interpret it. We apply the SpliZ, a new statistical approach, to detect cell-type-specific splicing in &gt;110K cells from 12 human tissues. Using 10x data for discovery, 9.1% of genes with computable SpliZ scores are cell-type-specifically spliced, including ubiquitously expressed genes <i>MYL6</i> and <i>RPS24</i>. These results are validated with RNA FISH, single-cell PCR, and Smart-seq2. SpliZ analysis reveals 170 genes with regulated splicing during human spermatogenesis, including examples conserved in mouse and mouse lemur. The SpliZ allows model-based identification of subpopulations indistinguishable based on gene expression, illustrated by subpopulation-specific splicing of classical monocytes involving an ultraconserved exon in <i>SAT1</i>. Together, this analysis of differential splicing across multiple organs establishes that splicing is regulated cell-type-specifically.

                Laboratory HbA<sub>1c</sub> does not always predict diabetes complications and our aim was to establish a glycaemic measure that better reflects intracellular glucose exposure in organs susceptible to complications. Six months of continuous glucose monitoring data and concurrent laboratory HbA<sub>1c</sub> were evaluated from 51 type 1 diabetes (T1D) and 80 type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. Red blood cell (RBC) lifespan was estimated using a kinetic model of glucose and HbA<sub>1c</sub>, allowing the calculation of person-specific adjusted HbA<sub>1c</sub> (aHbA<sub>1c</sub>). Median (IQR) RBC lifespan was 100 (86–102) and 100 (83–101) days in T1D and T2D, respectively. The median (IQR) absolute difference between aHbA<sub>1c</sub> and laboratory HbA<sub>1c</sub> was 3.9 (3.0–14.3) mmol/mol [0.4 (0.3–1.3%)] in T1D and 5.3 (4.1–22.5) mmol/mol [0.5 (0.4–2.0%)] in T2D. aHbA<sub>1c</sub> and laboratory HbA<sub>1c</sub> showed clinically relevant differences. This suggests that the widely used measurement of HbA<sub>1c</sub> can underestimate or overestimate diabetes complication risks, which may have future clinical implications.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Comparison of transcriptional initiation by RNA polymerase II across eukaryotic species</a></h4>

              
                The preinitation complex (PIC) for transcriptional initiation by RNA polymerase (Pol) II is composed of general transcription factors that are highly conserved. However, analysis of ChIP-seq datasets reveals kinetic and compositional differences in the transcriptional initiation process among eukaryotic species. In yeast, Mediator associates strongly with activator proteins bound to enhancers, but it transiently associates with promoters in a form that lacks the kinase module. In contrast, in human, mouse, and fly cells, Mediator with its kinase module stably associates with promoters, but not with activator-binding sites. This suggests that yeast and metazoans differ in the nature of the dynamic bridge of Mediator between activators and Pol II and the composition of a stable inactive PIC-like entity. As in yeast, occupancies of TBP and associated factors (Tafs) at mammalian promoters are not strictly correlated. This suggests that within PICs, TFIID is not a monolithic entity, and multiple forms of TBP affect initiation at different classes of genes. TFIID in flies, but not yeast and mammals, interacts strongly at regions downstream of the initiation site, consistent with the importance of downstream promoter elements in that species. Lastly, Taf7 and the mammalian-specific Med26 subunit of Mediator also interact near the Pol II pause region downstream of the PIC, but only in subsets of genes and often not together. Species-specific differences in PIC structure and function are likely to affect how activators and repressors affect transcriptional activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding natural astrocyte rhythms: dynamic actin waves result from environmental sensing by primary rodent astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are key regulators of brain homeostasis, which is essential for proper cognitive function. The role of cytoskeletal dynamics in this critical regulatory process is unknown. Here we find that actin is dynamic in certain subcellular regions, especially near the cell boundary. Our results further indicate that actin dynamics concentrates into hotspot regions that selectively respond to certain chemophysical stimuli, specifically the homeostatic challenges of ion or water concentration increases. Substrate topography makes actin dynamics more frequent yet weaker, and it also alters actin network structure. Superresolution images analyzed with a filament extraction algorithm demonstrate that surface topography is associated with a predominant perpendicular alignment of actin filaments near the cell boundary whereas flat substrates result in an actin cortex mainly parallel to the cell boundary. Thus, actin structure and dynamics together integrate information from different aspects of the environment that might steer the operation of neural cell networks.

	<p>Nocardia brain abscess is relatively rare, accounting for about 1–2% of all brain abscesses, and its mortality rate is three times higher than of other types of bacterial brain abscesses; thus, early diagnosis and treatment are essential. Nocardia brain abscess generally occurs in immunodeficient patients. We report a case of Nocardia farcinica brain abscess in a multiple myeloma patient treated with proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib and ixazomib), cyclophosphamide, and corticosteroid. The patient was treated with ceftriaxone and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, together with drainage of the brain abscess. Regular brain MRI follow-ups showed that intracranial lesions were gradually absorbed and improved.</p>

	<p>The ability to rapidly process others’ emotional signals is crucial for adaptive social interactions. However, to date it is still unclear how observing emotional facial expressions affects the reactivity of the human motor cortex. To provide insights on this issue, we employed single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate corticospinal motor excitability. Healthy participants observed happy, fearful and neutral pictures of facial expressions while receiving TMS over the left or right motor cortex at 150 and 300 ms after picture onset. In the early phase (150 ms), we observed an enhancement of corticospinal excitability for the observation of happy and fearful emotional faces compared to neutral expressions specifically in the right hemisphere. Interindividual differences in the disposition to experience aversive feelings (personal distress) in interpersonal emotional contexts predicted the early increase in corticospinal excitability for emotional faces. No differences in corticospinal excitability were observed at the later time (300 ms) or in the left M1. These findings support the notion that emotion perception primes the body for action and highlights the role of the right hemisphere in implementing a rapid and transient facilitatory response to emotional arousing stimuli, such as emotional facial expressions.</p>

	<p>Object sounds can enhance the attentional selection and perceptual processing of semantically-related visual stimuli. However, it is currently unknown whether crossmodal semantic congruence also affects the post-perceptual stages of information processing, such as short-term memory (STM), and whether this effect is modulated by the object consistency with the background visual scene. In two experiments, participants viewed everyday visual scenes for 500 ms while listening to an object sound, which could either be semantically related to the object that served as the STM target at retrieval or not. This defined crossmodal semantically cued vs. uncued targets. The target was either in- or out-of-context with respect to the background visual scene. After a maintenance period of 2000 ms, the target was presented in isolation against a neutral background, in either the same or different spatial position as in the original scene. The participants judged the same vs. different position of the object and then provided a confidence judgment concerning the certainty of their response. The results revealed greater accuracy when judging the spatial position of targets paired with a semantically congruent object sound at encoding. This crossmodal facilitatory effect was modulated by whether the target object was in- or out-of-context with respect to the background scene, with out-of-context targets reducing the facilitatory effect of object sounds. Overall, these findings suggest that the presence of the object sound at encoding facilitated the selection and processing of the semantically related visual stimuli, but this effect depends on the semantic configuration of the visual scene.</p>

	<p>Educational systems around the world encourage students to engage in programming activities, but programming learning is one of the most challenging learning tasks. Thus, it was significant to explore the factors related to programming learning. This study aimed to identify computer programming e-learners’ personality traits, self-reported cognitive abilities and learning motivating factors in comparison with other e-learners. We applied a learning motivating factors questionnaire, the Big Five Inventory—2, and the SRMCA instruments. The sample consisted of 444 e-learners, including 189 computer programming e-learners, the mean age was 25.19 years. It was found that computer programming e-learners demonstrated significantly lower scores of extraversion, and significantly lower scores of motivating factors of individual attitude and expectation, reward and recognition, and punishment. No significant differences were found in the scores of self-reported cognitive abilities between the groups. In the group of computer programming e-learners, extraversion was a significant predictor of individual attitude and expectation; conscientiousness and extraversion were significant predictors of challenging goals; extraversion and agreeableness were significant predictors of clear direction; open-mindedness was a significant predictor of a diminished motivating factor of punishment; negative emotionality was a significant predictor of social pressure and competition; comprehension-knowledge was a significant predictor of individual attitude and expectation; fluid reasoning and comprehension-knowledge were significant predictors of challenging goals; comprehension-knowledge was a significant predictor of clear direction; and visual processing was a significant predictor of social pressure and competition. The SEM analysis demonstrated that personality traits (namely, extraversion, conscientiousness, and reverted negative emotionality) statistically significantly predict learning motivating factors (namely, individual attitude and expectation, and clear direction), but the impact of self-reported cognitive abilities in the model was negligible in both groups of participants and non-participants of e-learning based computer programming courses; χ² (34) = 51.992, p = 0.025; CFI = 0.982; TLI = 0.970; NFI = 0.950; RMSEA = 0.051 [0.019–0.078]; SRMR = 0.038. However, as this study applied self-reported measures, we strongly suggest applying neurocognitive methods in future research.</p>

     alt="Comparing axon regeneration in male and female mice after peripheral nerve injury"/>
<p>In the mammalian peripheral nervous system, axon regeneration occurs spontaneously after injury. This study examined if axon regeneration after sciatic nerve crush injury was sex dependent and found that the extent of axon regeneration was indistinguishable in male and female mice. Transcriptome analysis revealed that many genes associated with neurite outgrowth were commonly induced in the two sexes, despite that a majority of genes were sex-dependently induced by injury. Therefore, although male and female mice exhibit similar axon regeneration, the mechanisms involved might not be identical.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Axons in the adult mammalian central nervous system fail to regenerate after injury. By contrast, spontaneous axon regeneration occurs in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) due to a supportive PNS environment and an increase in the intrinsic growth potential induced by injury via cooperative activation of multifaceted biological pathways. This study compared axon regeneration and injury responses in C57BL/6 male and female mice after sciatic nerve crush (SNC) injury. The extent of axon regeneration <i>in vivo</i> was indistinguishable in male and female mice when observed at 3 days after SNC injury, and primary dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons from injured, male and female mice extended axons to a similar length. Moreover, the induction of selected regeneration-associated genes (RAGs), such as <i>Atf3</i>, <i>Sprr1a</i>, <i>Gap43</i>, <i>Sox11</i>, <i>Jun</i>, <i>Gadd45a</i>, and <i>Smad1</i> were comparable in male and female DRGs when assessed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, the RNA-seq analysis of male and female DRGs revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SNC groups compared to sham-operated groups included many common genes associated with neurite outgrowth. However, we also found that a large number of genes in the DEGs were sex dependent, implicating the involvement of distinct gene regulatory network in the two sexes following peripheral nerve injury. In conclusion, we found that male and female mice mounted a comparable axon regeneration response and many RAGs were commonly induced in response to SNC. However, given that many DEGs were sex-dependently expressed, future studies are needed to investigate whether they contribute to peripheral axon regeneration, and if so, to what extent.</p>

     alt="Neuroimmunological complications arising from chemotherapy-induced gut toxicity and opioid exposure in female dark agouti rats"/>
<p>5-Fluorouracil-induced gut toxicity resulted in a main neuroimmunological effect in the thoracic region with carprofen ameliorating this effect. Buprenorphine and tramadol increased astrocyte reactivity marker expression, yet decreased thoracic IL-1beta expression. Understanding the peripheral-to-central complications arising in chemotherapy-induced toxicities and analgesic treatments may elucidate potential mechanisms contributing to the central complications arising from chemotherapy.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cancer patients may experience symptom clusters, including chemotherapy-induced (CI) gut toxicity (CIGT) and cognitive impairment. Analgesic selection for pain associated with CIGT is difficult as opioids induce glial reactivity and unwanted side effects. This study quantified central glial reactivity and proinflammatory effects in rats with CIGT using three mechanistically different analgesics. Regional adaptations were indicative of immune-to-brain signaling routes. Utilizing a 5-fluorouracil-induced GT (5IGT) rat model and analgesic intervention (carprofen (CAR), buprenorphine (BUP), and tramadol (TRAM)), spinal and brain neuroimmune modulation was examined via microglial, astrocyte, and proinflammatory (cluster of differentiation molecule 11b; CD11b, glial fibrillary associated protein; GFAP, and interleukin-1 beta; IL1β) reactivity marker expression changes by western blot analysis. 5IGT significantly increased thoracic GFAP (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and IL-1β (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) expression, CAR and BUP ameliorated these effects. BUP and TRAM with 5-FU synergistically increased hippocampal GFAP expression. CAR administered with 5IGT significantly elevated hippocampal and thoracic CD11b expression levels (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The neuroimmune responses observed in this study suggest activation of peripheral-to-central immune signaling pathways. We speculate that the opioid-induced hippocampal changes inferred a humorally mediated mechanism, whereas thoracic neuroimmune modifications indicated activation of an indirect neural route. Although TRAM ameliorated 5IGT-intestinal inflammation, this opioid presents complications relating to bodyweight and regional glial dysregulation (neuroinflammation) and may not be optimal in the management of pain associated with 5IGT. The chemotherapy-induced gut-derived neuroimmune consequences observed suggest a potential mechanistic contribution to central components of the cancer symptom cluster experience, while the opioid-related glial changes have implications for optimal pain management in this setting warranting further investigation.</p>

<p>Mice were subjected to the acquisition, extinction, and reinstatement of methamphetamine-induced conditioned place preference, and fecal samples were collected at each phase.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The gut–brain axis provides a pathway for the interaction between gut microbiota and methamphetamine (METH) addiction. However, the gut microbial signatures during different phases of METH use remain unclear. In the present study, we established models of acquisition, extinction, and reinstatement of METH-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in male mice and detected the gut microbiome profiles of the fecal samples at the three phases by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Our results revealed that the richness of the gut microbiome increased following repeated METH administration, and it decreased after 4 weeks of abstinence. The microbial richness remained at a low level after one METH challenge at the reinstatement phase. The abundance of several genera including <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, and <i>Lactobacillus</i> differentially altered among phases of METH-induced CPP. The co-occurrence networks of the gut microbiome became weaker and more unstable during the development of METH-induced CPP at the extinction and reinstatement phases. Notably, the predicted gene functions of short-chain fatty acid metabolism, which were correlated with the abundance of <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, and <i>Lactobacillus</i>, were found differentially enriched among phases of METH-induced CPP. Our findings highlight a potential association between perturbations of the gut microbiome and different phases of METH use.</p>

<p>The differential effects of osteopontin on major functions of primary resting and activated astrocytes.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The glycoprotein osteopontin is highly upregulated in central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as ischemic stroke. Osteopontin regulates cell growth, cell adhesion, homeostasis, migration, and survival of various cell types. Accordingly, osteopontin is considered an essential regulator of regeneration and repair in the ischemic milieu. Astrocytes are the most abundant cells in the CNS and play significant roles in health and disease. Astrocytes are involved in homeostasis, promote neuroprotection, and regulate synaptic plasticity. Upon activation, astrocytes may adopt different phenotypes, termed A1 and A2. The direct effects of osteopontin on astrocytes, especially in distinct activation states, are yet unknown. The current study aimed to elucidate the impact of osteopontin on resting and active astrocytes. We established an inflammatory <i>in vitro</i> model of activated (A1) primary astrocytes derived from neonatal wistar rats by exposure to a distinct combination of proinflammatory cytokines. To model ischemic stroke <i>in vitro</i>, astrocytes were subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in the presence or absence of osteopontin. Osteopontin modulated the activation phenotype by attenuating A1- and restoring A2-marker expression without compromising the active astrocytes’ immunocompetence. Osteopontin promoted the proliferation of active and the migration of resting astrocytes. Following transient OGD, osteopontin mitigated the delayed ongoing death of primary astrocytes, promoting their survival. Data suggest that osteopontin differentially regulates essential functions of resting and active astrocytes and confirm a significant regulatory role of osteopontin in an <i>in vitro</i> ischemia model. Furthermore, the data suggest that osteopontin constitutes a promising target for experimental therapies modulating neuroregeneration and repair.</p>

     alt="Stochastic and sinusoidal electrical stimuli increase the irregularity and gain of Type A and B medial vestibular nucleus neurons, in vitro"/>
<p>Stochastic and sinusoidal stimuli shown to increase neuronal discharge irregularity and gain in Type A and B medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) neurons. Potentially via antagonism of voltage-sensitive channels expressed on MVN neuronal membranes such as the large conductance K<sup>+</sup> channels (<i>black</i>) and associated N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, and the T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels associated with slow conductance K<sup>+</sup> channels (<i>gray</i>).</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) has been shown to improve vestibular function potentially via stochastic resonance, however, it remains unknown how central vestibular nuclei process these signals. <i>In vivo</i> work applying electrical stimuli to the vestibular apparatus of animals has shown changes in neuronal discharge at the level of the primary vestibular afferents and hair cells. This study aimed to determine the cellular impacts of stochastic, sinusoidal, and stochastic + sinusoidal stimuli on individual medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) neurons of male and female C57BL/6 mice. All stimuli increased the irregularity of MVN neuronal discharge, while differentially affecting neuronal gain. This suggests that the heterogeneous MVN neuronal population (marked by differential expression of ion channels), may influence the impact of electrical stimuli on neuronal discharge. Neuronal subtypes showed increased variability of neuronal firing, where Type A and B neurons experienced the largest gain changes in response to stochastic and sinusoidal stimuli. Type C neurons were the least affected regarding neuronal firing variability and gain changes. The membrane potential (MP) of neurons was altered by sinusoidal and stochastic + sinusoidal stimuli, with Type B and C neuronal MP significantly affected. These results indicate that GVS-like electrical stimuli impact MVN neuronal discharge differentially, likely as a result of heterogeneous ion channel expression.</p>

     alt="Anesthesia in mice activates discrete populations of neurons throughout the brain"/>
<p>The use of transgenic TRAP*TB mice permitted visualization of neurons active during a first stage experimental condition (red) as well as neurons active during a second stage condition (green). Results varied by brain regions of interest. In PvH nearly all active neurons proved to be anesthesia-on. In PV the proportion was 11:8.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The brain undergoes rapid, dramatic, and reversible transitioning between states of wakefulness and unconsciousness during natural sleep and in pathological conditions such as hypoxia, hypotension, and concussion. Transitioning can also be induced pharmacologically using general anesthetic agents. The effect is selective. Mobility, sensory perception, memory formation, and awareness are lost while numerous housekeeping functions persist. How is selective transitioning accomplished? Classically a handful of brainstem and diencephalic “arousal nuclei” have been implicated in driving brain-state transitions on the grounds that their net activity systematically varies with brain state. Here we used transgenic targeted recombination in active populations mice</p>
