                Dysregulation of Tau in Alzheimer disease affects multiple cellular compartments and functions. Tau interacts directly with and translocates through the plasma membrane, a potential site of Tau fibril and membrane pore formation, but its physiological state and behavior in this compartment are unknown. Using quantitative single-molecule imaging in live cells, we observed that Tau exhibits both confined and free diffusion near the plasma membrane. Preventing Tau/microtubule interactions either pharmacologically or biochemically increased Tau mobility; however, the heterogeneous mobility pattern persisted. Tau formed transient hot spots of ~70 nm in radius, displaying stationary and mobile phases. Compared to the ~40 ms dwell time of Tau on microtubules, the hot spots were long-lasting (tens of seconds), and resistant to microtubule perturbations and cholesterol depletion. We suggest that the mobile pool acts as a reservoir supplying Tau to functional sites, with the hot spots serving as assembly sites for the physiological and pathological functions of Tau.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ventral pallidum GABA neurons bidirectionally control opioid relapse across rat behavioral models</a></h4>

              
                Opioid addiction is a chronic, relapsing disorder. Whether addicted individuals are forced to abstain or they decide themselves to quit using drugs, relapse rates are high--especially upon encountering contexts and stimuli associated with prior opioid use. Rodents similarly show context- and cue-induced reinstatement of drug seeking following abstinence, and intriguingly, the neural circuits underlying these relapse-like behaviors differ when abstinence is involuntarily imposed, versus when animals decide themselves to cease taking drug. Here, we employ two complementary rat behavioral models of relapse-like behavior for the highly reinforcing opioid drug remifentanil, and asked whether GABAergic neurons in the ventral pallidum (VPGABA) control opioid seeking under these behavioral conditions. Specifically, we asked how chemogenetically stimulating VPGABA neurons with clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) influences the ability of contextual or discrete remifentanil-paired cues to reinstate drug seeking following either voluntary (punishment-induced; GroupPunish), or experimenter-imposed (extinction training; GroupExt) abstinence. In GroupPunish rats, we also chemogenetically inhibited VPGABA neurons, and examined spontaneous VP activity (Fos) during cued-reinstatement. In both GroupPunish and GroupExt rats, stimulating Gq-signaling in VPGABA neurons augmented remifentanil reinstatement in a cue- and context-dependent manner. Conversely, engaging inhibitory Gi-signaling in VPGABA neurons in GroupPunish suppressed cue-induced reinstatement, and additionally cue-triggered seeking was correlated with Fos in rostral, but not caudal VP. In contrast, neither stimulating nor inhibiting VPGABA neurons influenced unpunished remifentanil self-administration. We conclude that VPGABA neurons bidirectionally control opioid seeking regardless of the specific relapse model employed, highlighting their fundamental role in opioid relapse-like behavior across behavioral models, and potentially across species.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human Cerebral Spheroids Undergo Activity Dependent Changes In Cellular Composition And MicroRNA Expression</a></h4>

              
                Activity-induced neurogenesis has been extensively studied in rodents but the lack of ante mortem accessibility to human brain at the cellular and molecular levels limits studies of the process in humans. Using cerebral spheroids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we investigated the effects of increased neuronal activity on neurogenesis. Our studies demonstrate that increasing neuronal activity with 4-aminopyridine in 3-month-old cerebral spheroids is associated with increases in the numbers of new neurons and decreases in the population of new glial cells. We also observed a significant decrease in the expression of miR-135a, which has previously been shown to be decreased in exercise-induced neurogenesis. Predicted targets of miR-135a include key participants in the SMAD2/3 and BDNF pathways. Together, our results suggest that iPSC-derived cerebral spheroids are an attractive model to study some aspects of activity-induced neurogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dopamine transporter and synaptic vesicle sorting defects initiate auxilin-linked Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Auxilin participates in the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs), thereby facilitating synaptic vesicle (SV) regeneration at presynaptic sites. Auxilin (DNAJC6/PARK19) loss-of-function mutations cause early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we utilized auxilin-knockout (KO) mice to elucidate the mechanisms through which auxilin deficiency and clathrin-uncoating deficits lead to PD. We demonstrate that auxilin KO mice display the cardinal features of PD, including progressive motor deficits, -synuclein pathology, nigral dopaminergic loss, and neuroinflammation. Through unbiased proteomic and neurochemical analyses, we demonstrate that dopamine homeostasis is disrupted in auxilin KO brains, including via slower dopamine reuptake kinetics in vivo, an effect associated with dopamine transporter misrouting into axonal membrane deformities in the dorsal striatum. We also show that elevated macroautophagy and defective SV protein sorting contribute to ineffective dopamine sequestration and homeostasis, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration. This study advances our knowledge of how presynaptic endocytosis deficits lead to dopaminergic vulnerability and pathogenesis of PD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Abnormal brain state distribution and network connectivity in a SYNGAP1 rat model</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the SYNGAP1 gene are one of the common predictors of neurodevelopmental disorders, commonly resulting in individuals developing autism, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and sleep deficits. EEG recordings in neurodevelopmental disorders show potential to identify clinically translatable biomarkers to both diagnose and track the progress of novel therapeutic strategies, as well as providing insight into underlying pathological mechanisms. In a rat model of SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency in which the exons encoding the calcium/lipid binding and GTPase activating protein (GAP) domains have been deleted (Syngap+/{Delta}-GAP) we analysed the duration and occurrence of wake, non rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) brain states during 6 hour multi-electrode EEG recordings. We find that although Syngap+/{Delta}-GAP animals spend an equivalent percent time in wake and sleep states, they have an abnormal brain state distribution as the number of wake and NREM bouts are reduced and there is an increase in the average duration of both wake and NREM epochs. We perform connectivity analysis by calculating the average imaginary coherence between electrode pairs at varying distance thresholds during these states. In group averages from pairs of electrodes at short distances from each other, a clear reduction in connectivity during NREM is present between 11.5 Hz and 29.5 Hz, a frequency range that overlaps with sleep spindles, oscillatory phenomena thought to be important for normal brain function and memory consolidation. Sleep spindles occurrence, amplitude, power and spread across multiple electrodes were not reduced in Syngap+/{Delta}-GAP rats, with only a small decrease in duration detected. Nonetheless, by analysing the dynamic imaginary coherence during sleep spindles, we found a reduction in high connectivity instances between short-distance electrode pairs. Finally, by comparing the dynamic imaginary coherence during sleep spindles between individual electrode pairs, we identified a group of channels over the right somatosensory, association and visual cortices that have a significant reduction in connectivity during sleep spindles in mutant animals. These data suggest that Syngap+/{Delta}-GAP rats have altered brain state dynamics and EEG connectivity, which may have clinical relevance for SYNGAP haploinsufficiency in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Speech understanding oppositely affectsacoustic and linguistic neural tracking in aspeech rate manipulation paradigm.</a></h4>

              
                When listening to continuous speech, the human brain can track features of the presented speech signal. It has been shown that neural tracking of acoustic features is a prerequisite for speech understanding and can predict speech understanding in controlled circumstances. However, the brain also tracks linguistic features of speech, which may be more directly related to speech understanding. We investigated acoustic and linguistic speech processing as a function of varying speech understanding by manipulating the speech rate. In this paradigm, acoustic and linguistic speech processing are affected simultaneously but in opposite directions: When the speech rate increases, more acoustic information per second is present. In contrast, linguistic information decreases as speech becomes less intelligible at higher speech rates. We measured the EEG of 18 participants who listened to speech at various speech rates. As expected and confirmed by the behavioral results, speech understanding decreased with increasing speech rate. Accordingly, linguistic neural tracking decreased with increasing speech rate, but acoustic neural tracking increased. This indicates that neural tracking of linguistic representations can capture the gradual effect of decreasing speech understanding. In addition, increased acoustic neural tracking does not necessarily imply better speech understanding. This suggests that, although more challenging to measure due to the low signal-to-noise ratio, linguistic neural tracking may be a more direct predictor of speech understanding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sensitisation of colonic nociceptors by TNFα is dependent on TNFR1 expression and p38 MAPK activity</a></h4>

              
                Visceral pain is a leading cause of morbidity in gastrointestinal diseases, which is exacerbated by the gut related side-effects of many analgesics. New treatments are needed and further understanding of the mediators and mechanisms underpinning visceral nociception in disease states is required to facilitate this. The pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF is linked to pain in patients with inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome and has been shown to sensitise colonic sensory neurons. Somatic, TNF-triggered thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity is mediated by TRPV1 signalling and p38 MAPK activity respectively, downstream of TNFR1 receptor activation. We therefore hypothesised that TNFR1-evoked p38 MAPK activity may also be responsible for TNF sensitisation of colonic afferent responses to the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin, and noxious distension of the bowel. Using Ca2+ imaging of dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons, we observed TNF-mediated increases in intracellular [Ca2+] and sensitisation of capsaicin responses. The sensitising effects of TNF were dependent on TNFR1 expression and attenuated by TRPV1 and p38 MAPK inhibition. Consistent with these findings, ex vivo colonic afferent fibre recordings demonstrated enhanced response to noxious ramp distention of the bowel and bath application of capsaicin following TNF pre-treatment. Responses were reversed by p38 MAPK inhibition and absent in tissue from TNFR1 knockout mice. Our findings demonstrate a contribution of TNFR1, p38 MAPK and TRPV1 to TNF-induced sensitisation of colonic afferents, highlighting the potential utility of these drug targets for the treatment of visceral pain in GI disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Experimental Suppression of TMS-EEG Sensory Potentials</a></h4>

              
                Background: The sensory experience of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) evokes cortical responses measured in EEG that confound interpretation of TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs). Methods for sensory masking have been proposed to minimize sensory contributions to the TEP, but the most effective combination for suprathreshold TMS to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is unknown. Objective: We applied sensory suppression techniques and quantified electrophysiology and perception from suprathreshold dlPFC TMS to identify the best combination to minimize the sensory TEP. Methods: In 21 healthy adults, we applied single pulse TMS at 120% resting motor threshold (rMT) to the left dlPFC and compared EEG vertex N100-P200 and perception. Conditions included three protocols: No masking (no auditory masking, no foam, jittered inter-stimulus interval (ISI)), Standard masking (auditory noise, foam, jittered ISI), and our ATTENUATE protocol (auditory noise, foam, over-the-ear protection, unjittered ISI). Results: ATTENUATE reduced vertex N100-P200 by 56%, "click" loudness perception by 50%, and scalp sensation by 36%. We show that sensory prediction, induced with predictable ISI, has a suppressive effect on vertex N100-P200, and that combining standard suppression protocols with sensory prediction provides the best N100-P200 suppression. ATTENUATE was more effective than Standard masking, which only reduced vertex N100-P200 by 22%, loudness by 27%, and scalp sensation by 24%. Conclusions: We introduce a sensory suppression protocol superior to Standard masking and demonstrate that using an unjittered ISI can contribute to minimizing sensory confounds. ATTENUATE provides superior sensory suppression to increase TEP signal-to-noise and contributes to a growing understanding of TMS-EEG sensory neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Abnormal molecular signatures of inflammation, energy metabolism and vesicle biology in human Huntington disease peripheral tissues</a></h4>

              
                Background: A major challenge in neurodegenerative diseases concerns identifying biological disease signatures that track with disease progression or respond to an intervention. Several clinical trials in Huntington disease (HD), an inherited, progressive neurodegenerative disease, are currently ongoing. Therefore, we examined whether peripheral tissues can serve as a source of readily accessible biological signatures at the RNA and protein level in HD patients. Results: We generated large, high-quality human datasets from skeletal muscle, skin and adipose tissue to probe molecular changes in human premanifest and early manifest HD patients - those most likely involved in clinical trials. In-depth single nucleotide polymorphism data across the HTT gene will facilitate the use of the generated primary- and iPSC cell lines in allele-specific targeting approaches. The analysis of the transcriptomics and proteomics data shows robust, stage-dependent dysregulation. Gene ontology analysis confirmed the involvement of inflammation and energy metabolism in peripheral HD pathogenesis. Furthermore, we observed changes in the homeostasis of extracellular vesicles, where we found consistent changes of genes and proteins involved in this process. Conclusions: Our 'omics data document the involvement of inflammation, energy metabolism and extracellular vesicle homeostasis. This demonstrates the potential to identify biological signatures from peripheral tissues in HD suitable as biomarkers in clinical trials. Together with the primary cell lines established from peripheral tissues and a large panel of iPSC lines that can serve as human models of HD, the generated data are a valuable and unique resource to advance the current understanding of molecular mechanisms driving HD pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Large-scale biophysically detailed model of somatosensory thalamocortical circuits in NetPyNE</a></h4>

              
                The primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of mammals is critically important in the perception of touch and related sensorimotor behaviors. In 2015 the Blue Brain Project developed a groundbreaking rat S1 microcircuit simulation with over 31,000 neurons with 207 morpho-electrical neuron types, and 37 million synapses, incorporating anatomical and physiological information from a wide range of experimental studies. We have implemented this highly-detailed and complex model S1 model in NetPyNE, using the data available in the Neocortical Microcircuit Collaboration Portal. NetPyNE provides a Python high-level interface to NEURON and allows defining complicated multiscale models using an intuitive declarative standardized language. It also facilitates running parallel simulations, automates the optimization and exploration of parameters using supercomputers, and provides a wide range of built-in analysis functions. This will make the S1 model more accessible and simpler to scale, modify and extend in order to explore research questions or interconnect to other existing models. Despite some implementation differences, the NetPyNE model closely reproduced the original cell morphologies, electrophysiological responses, spatial distribution for all 207 cell types; and the connectivity properties of the 1941 pathways, including synaptic dynamics and short-term plasticity (STP). The NetPyNE S1 simulations produced reasonable physiological rates and activity patterns across all populations, and, when STP was included, produced a 1 Hz oscillation comparable to that of the original model. We also extended the model by adding thalamic circuits, including 6 distinct thalamic populations with intrathalamic, thalamocortical and corticothalamic connectivity derived from experimental data. Overall, our work provides a widely accessible, data-driven and biophysically-detailed model of the somatosensory thalamocortical circuits that can be utilized as a community tool for researchers to study neural dynamics, function and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Recurrent circuits amplify corticofugal signals and drive feed-forward inhibition in the inferior colliculus</a></h4>

              
                The inferior colliculus (IC) is a midbrain hub critical for perceiving complex, time-varying sounds such as speech. In addition to processing ascending inputs from most auditory brainstem nuclei, the IC receives descending inputs from auditory cortex that control IC neuron feature selectivity, plasticity, and certain forms of perceptual learning. Although these corticofugal synapses primarily release the excitatory transmitter glutamate, many physiology studies show that auditory cortical activity has a net inhibitory effect on IC neuron spiking. Perplexingly, anatomy studies indicate that corticofugal axons primarily target glutamatergic IC neurons while only sparsely innervating IC GABA neurons, thereby suggesting that corticofugal inhibition of the IC occurs largely independently of feedforward activation of local GABA neurons. We shed light on this paradox using in vitro electrophysiology and optogenetics in acute IC slices from fluorescent reporter mice. We find that corticofugal synaptic strength is indeed stronger onto IC glutamate compared to GABA neurons. Nevertheless, two mechanisms enable reliable corticofugal activation of local GABA neurons. 1) Many IC GABA neurons fire tonically at rest, such that sparse and weak excitation suffices to significantly increase their spike rates. 2) Corticofugal activity triggers barrages of large amplitude, polysynaptic EPSPs in IC GABA neurons, owing to a dense intra-collicular connectivity from local axon collaterals of IC glutamate neurons. Consequently, repetitive activity in corticofugal fibers drives spikes in IC GABA neurons and generates substantial recurrent inhibition. Thus, descending signals trigger intra-collicular inhibition despite apparent constraints of monosynaptic connectivity between auditory cortex and IC GABA neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Data-driven multiscale model of macaque auditory thalamocortical circuits reproduces in vivo dynamics</a></h4>

              
                We developed a biophysically-detailed model of the macaque auditory thalamocortical circuits, including primary auditory cortex (A1), medial geniculate body (MGB) and thalamic reticular nuclei (TRN), using the NEURON simulator and NetPyNE multiscale modeling tool. We simulated A1 as a cortical column with a depth of 2000 m and 200 m diameter, containing over 12k neurons and 30M synapses. Neuron densities, laminar locations, classes, morphology and biophysics, and connectivity at the long-range, local and dendritic scale were derived from published experimental data. The A1 model included 6 cortical layers and multiple populations of neurons consisting of 4 excitatory and 4 inhibitory types, and was reciprocally connected to the thalamus (MGB and TRN) mimicking anatomical connectivity. MGB included core and matrix thalamocortical neurons with layer-specific projection patterns to A1, and thalamic interneurons projecting locally. Auditory stimulus related inputs were simulated using phenomenological models of the cochlear auditory nerve and the inferior colliculus, which served as input to MGB. The model generated cell type and layer-specific firing rates consistent with overall ranges observed experimentally, and accurately simulated the corresponding local field potentials (LFPs), current source density (CSD), and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Laminar CSD patterns during spontaneous activity and responses to speech input were similar to those recorded experimentally. Physiological oscillations emerged spontaneously across frequency bands without external rhythmic inputs and were comparable to those recorded in vivo. We used the model to unravel the contributions from distinct cell type and layer-specific neuronal populations to oscillation events detected in CSD, and explore how these relate to the population firing patterns. Overall, the computational model provides a quantitative theoretical framework to integrate and interpret a wide range of experimental data in auditory circuits. It also constitutes a powerful tool to evaluate hypotheses and make predictions about the cellular and network mechanisms underlying common experimental measurements, including MUA, LFP and EEG signals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multiplex imaging of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons with CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX) technology</a></h4>

              
                Background: Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models have been hailed as a breakthrough for understanding disease and developing new therapeutics. The major advantage of iPSC-derived neurons is that they carry the genetic background of the donor, and as such could be more predictive for clinical translation. However, the development of these cell models is time-consuming and expensive and it is thus critical to maximize biomarker readout from every model that is developed. One option is to use a highly multiplexed biomarker imaging assay, like CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX), which allows detection of 50+ targets in situ at single-cell resolution. New Method: This paper describes the development of CODEX in neuronal cell cultures derived from human iPSCs. Results: We differentiated human iPSCs into mixed neuronal and glial cultures on glass coverslips. We then developed and optimized a panel of 21 antibodies to phenotype iPSC-derived neuronal subtypes of cortical, dopaminergic, and striatal neurons, as well as astrocytes, and pre-and postsynaptic proteins. Comparison with existing methods: Compared to standard immunocytochemistry, CODEX oligo-conjugated fluorophores circumvent antibody host interactions and allow for highly customized multiplexing. Conclusion: We show that CODEX can be applied to iPSC neuronal cultures and developed fixation and staining protocols for the neurons to sustain the multiple wash-stain cycles of the technology. Furthermore, we demonstrate both cellular and subcellular resolution imaging of multiplexed biomarkers in the same samples. CODEX is a powerful technique that complements other single-cell omics technologies for in-depth phenotype analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tau seeding without tauopathy</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative tauopathies such as Alzheimer disease (AD) are caused by brain accumulation of tau assemblies. Evidence suggests tau functions as a prion, and cells and animals efficiently propagate unique tau assemblies. This suggests a dedicated cellular replication machinery, with normal physiologic function for tau seeds. Consequently, we hypothesized that healthy control brains would have seeding activity. We recently developed a novel monoclonal antibody (MD3.1) specific for tau seeds. We used this antibody to immunopurify tau from the parietal and cerebellar cortices of 19 healthy subjects ranging 19-65 years. We detected seeding in the parietal cortex, but not in the cerebellum, or in wild-type or human tau knockin mice, suggesting that cellular/genetic context dictates development of seed-competent tau. Seeding did not correlate with subject age or brain tau levels. Dot blot analyses revealed no AT8 immunoreactivity above background levels in parietal and cerebellar extracts and <1/100 of that present in AD. Based on binding to a panel of antibodies, the conformational characteristics of control seeds differed from AD, suggesting a unique underlying assembly, or structural ensemble. The ability of tau to adopt self-replicating conformations under non-pathogenic conditions may reflect normal function that goes awry in disease states.

                Understanding cortical function requires studying its multiple scales: molecular, cellular, circuit and behavior. We developed a biophysically detailed multiscale model of mouse primary motor cortex (M1) with over 10,000 neurons, 30 million synapses. Neuron types, densities, spatial distributions, morphologies, biophysics, connectivity and dendritic synapse locations were derived from experimental data. The model includes long-range inputs from 7 thalamic and cortical regions, and noradrenergic inputs from locus coeruleus. Connectivity depended on cell class and cortical depth at sublaminar resolution. The model reproduced and predicted in vivo layer- and cell type-specific responses (firing rates and LFP) associated with behavioral states (quiet and movement) and experimental manipulations (noradrenaline receptor blocking and thalamus inactivation), and enabled us to evaluate different hypotheses of the circuitry and mechanisms involved. This quantitative theoretical framework can be used to integrate and interpret M1 experimental data and sheds light on the M1 cell type-specific multiscale dynamics associated with a range of experimental conditions and behaviors.

                Stem cells show intrinsic interferon signaling, which protects them from viral infections. In the brain, type I interferon signaling increases in stem cells as they age and reduces their ability to become activated for repair. Whether interferons impact stem cell activity only in aging, how, and if it is coupled to the intrinsic immune function remains elusive. Our study shows that interferon-{beta} arrested stem cells in G0 of the cell cycle and transiently increased their TOR signaling before switching it off. This bimodal regulation of TOR is needed to repress translation of Sox2. Single-cell transcriptomics reveals that in the absence of interferon receptors, interferon signaling levels change and its increase with age disappears. Mathematical simulations indicate that interferons are beneficial in the young and harmful in the old brain. Our study identifies interferons as genuine regulators of stem cell homeostasis and potential therapeutic target to repair the aging brain.

                Kleefstra syndrome in humans is characterized by general delay in development, intellectual disability and autistic features. The mouse model of this disease (Ehmt1+/-) expresses anxiety, autistic-like traits, and aberrant social interactions with non-cagemates. To investigate how Ehmt1+/- mice behave with unfamiliar conspecifics, we allowed adult, male animals to freely interact for 10 minutes in a neutral, novel environment within a host-visitor setting. In 17 out of 74 trials there were defensive and offensive behaviors. Our key finding was that Ehmt1+/- mice displayed defensive postures, attacking and biting; in contrast, wild-type (WT) interacting with other WT did not enact such behaviors. Further, if there was a fight between an Ehmt1+/- and a WT mouse, it was always the Ehmt1+/- who initiated these behaviors.

                Objective: Cervical transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) is a promising technology that can support motor function recovery of upper-limbs after spinal cord injury. Its efficacy may depend on the ability to recruit sensory afferents and convey excitatory inputs onto motoneurons. Therefore, understanding its physiological mechanisms is critical to accelerate its development towards clinical applications. In this study, we used an anatomically realistic computational model of the cervical spine to compare -motor, A-sensory, and A{beta}-sensory fiber activation thresholds and activation sites. Approach: We developed a tridimensional geometry of the cervical body and tSCS electrodes with a cathode centred at the C7 spinous process and an anode placed over the anterior neck. The geometrical model was used to estimate the electric potential distributions along motor and sensory fiber trajectories at the C7 spinal level using a finite element method. We implemented dedicated motor and sensory fiber models to simulate the -motor and A-sensory fibers using 12, 16, and 20 {micro}m diameter fibers, and A{beta}-sensory fibers using 6, 9, and 12 {micro}m diameter fibers. We estimated nerve fiber activation thresholds and sites for a 2 ms monophasic stimulating pulse and compared them across the fiber groups. Main results: Our results showed lower activation thresholds of A- and A{beta}-sensory fibers compared with -motor fibers, suggesting preferential sensory fiber activation. We also found no differences between activation thresholds of A-sensory and large A{beta}-sensory fibers, implying they were co-activated. The activation sites were located at the dorsal and ventral root levels. Significance: Using a realistic computational model, we demonstrated preferential activation of dorsal root A- and A{beta}-sensory fibers compared with ventral root -motor fibers during cervical tSCS. These findings suggest high proprioceptive and cutaneous contributions to neural activations during cervical tSCS, which inform the underlying mechanisms of upper-limb functional motor recovery.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hindbrain catecholaminergic inputs to the paraventricular thalamus scale feeding and metabolic efficiency in stress-related contexts</a></h4>

              
                Aim: The regulation of food intake and energy balance relies on the integration of exteroceptive and interoceptive signals monitoring nutritional, metabolic and emotional states. This study aims at unraveling the role of catecholaminergic (CA) inputs to the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) in scaling feeding and metabolic efficiency. Methods: To tackle this question, a region-specific retrograde disruption of PVT CA inputs was performed. Behavioral tests and in vivo calorimetric technologies were mobilized to study the adaptive strategies underlying feeding, metabolic efficiency and nutrient partitioning. Moreover, immunofluorescence investigations were conducted to identify the sources of TH-neurons projecting to the PVT and to reveal the molecular pattern of neuronal activation (cFos) in the PVT as well as in homeostasis-related regions of the hypothalamus. Results: First, we show that PVT CA inputs mainly arise from the hindbrain, notably the locus coeruleus (LC) and the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). Second, we reveal that PVT CA inputs contribute to feeding strategies and metabolic efficiency in environmental, behavioral, physiological and metabolic stress-like contexts. Third, we show that PVT CA inputs contribute in modulating the activity of PVT as well as lateral (LH) and dorsomedial (DMH) hypothalamic neurons. Conclusion: This study, by assessing the key role of PVT CA inputs in scaling homeostatic and allostatic regulations of feeding patterns, reveals the integrative and converging hindbrain[-&gt;]PVT paths that contribute to whole-body metabolic adaptations in stress-like contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Traveling waves in the monkey frontoparietal network predict recent reward memory</a></h4>

              
                Brain function depends on neural communication, but the mechanisms of this communication are not well understood. Recent studies suggest that one form of neural communication is through traveling waves (TWs)-patterns of neural oscillations that propagate within and between areas. We show that TWs appear robustly in microarray recordings in monkey frontal and parietal cortex and encode memory for recent rewards. While making saccades to obtain probabilistic rewards, monkeys were sensitive to the (statistically irrelevant) prior reward, which is consistent with behavioral biases produced by reward history. TWs in frontal and parietal areas were stronger in trials following a prior reward versus a lack of reward and, in the frontal lobe, correlated with the monkeys' sensitivity to the prior reward. The findings suggest that neural communication across fronto-parietal areas, reflected by TWs, maintains default reward memories, while communication within the frontal lobe mediates the read out of the memories for prospective expectations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reading instruction causes changes in category-selective visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Education sculpts specialized neural circuits for skills like reading that are critical to success in modern society but were not anticipated by the selective pressures of evolution. Does the emergence of brain regions that selectively process novel visual stimuli like words occur at the expense of cortical representations of other stimulus categories like faces and objects? To answer this question we designed a randomized controlled trial where pre-literate children (five years of age) were randomly assigned to intervention programs that either taught reading skills (Letter Intervention) or oral language comprehension skills (Language Intervention). Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data collected before and after the interventions revealed that being assigned to the Letter versus Language Intervention induced different patterns of changes in category selective responses in high-level visual cortex. We found moderate support for the notion that words compete with other objects for cortical territory as children become attuned to this new class of visual stimuli. How these changes play out over a longer timescale is still unclear but, based on these data, we can surmise that high-level visual cortex undergoes rapid changes as children enter school and begin establishing new skills like literacy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain aging is faithfully modelled in organotypic brain slices and accelerated by prions</a></h4>

              
                Mammalian models are essential for brain aging research. However, the long lifespan and limited amenability to genetic and pharmacological perturbations have hindered the use of mammals for dissecting aging-regulatory molecular networks and discovering new anti-aging interventions. To circumvent these limitations, we developed an ex vivo model system that faithfully mimics the aging process of the mammalian brain using cultured mouse brain slices. Genome-wide gene expression analyses showed that brain slices spontaneously upregulated senescence-associated genes over time and reproduced many of the transcriptional characteristics of aged brains. Treatment with rapamycin, a classical anti-aging compound, largely abolished the time-dependent transcriptional changes in brain slices. Using this model system, we discovered that prions drastically accelerated the development of age-related molecular signatures and the pace of brain aging. We confirmed this finding in mouse models and human victims of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. These data establish a novel, eminently tractable mammalian model of brain aging, and uncover a surprising acceleration of brain aging in prion diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chronic Alcohol Consumption Alters Home-Cage Behaviors and Responses to Ethologically Relevant Predator Tasks in Mice</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol use disorders (AUD) are the most prevalent substance use disorders worldwide. Considering recent reports indicating an increase in alcohol use particularly in females, it is vital to understand how alcohol history impacts behavior. Animal model research on withdrawal-associated affective states tends to focus on males, forced alcohol paradigms, and a few traditional anxiety/stress tests. While this has been essential, heavy alcohol use triggers adverse withdrawal-related affective states that can influence how people respond to a large variety of life events and stressors. To this end, we show that behaviors in the home-cage, open field, looming disc, and robogator predator threat task, which vary in task demand and intensity, are altered in mice with a history of voluntary alcohol consumption. In alcohol-exposed males, behaviors in the home cage, a low anxiety baseline environment, suggest increased vigilance/exploration. However, in the open field and robogator task, which induce heightened arousal and task demands, a more hesitant/avoidant phenotype is seen. Female alcohol mice show no behavioral alterations in the home cage and open field test, however, in the looming disc task, which mimics an overhead advancing predator and forces a behavioral choice, we see greater escape responses compared to water controls, indicative of active stress coping behaviors. This suggests females may begin to show alcohol-induced alterations as task demands increase. To date, few drugs have advanced past clinical trials for the treatment of AUD, and those that have are predominately used in life-threatening situations only. No treatments exist for ameliorating negative withdrawal related states, which could aid in harm reduction related to heavy alcohol use. Understanding how withdrawal alters a variety of behavioral responses that are linked to stress coping can widen our understanding of alcohol abuse and lead us closer to better therapeutics to help individuals with AUD.

	<p>Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Harz is regarded as a significant anatomist who helped the entire medical world to discover and develop new techniques in order to improve patient treatment as well as decrease death rates. He discovered fascia propria recti in 1899, which is important in total mesorectal excision which improves cancer treatment as well as outcomes. He played an important role in developing the neuron theory which states that the nervous system consists of multiple individual cells, called neurons, which currently stands as the basis of the impulse transmission of neurons. Waldeyer was also interested in cytology, where he made a substantial contribution, being the first who adopted the name &amp;amp;ldquo;Chromosome&amp;amp;rdquo;. Therefore, he accelerated the progress of what it is now known as Genetics. In conclusion, starting from the Fascia propria recti and continuing with great discoveries in cytology and neuron theory, Wilhelm von Waldeyer represents a key person in what we today call medicine.</p>

	<p>Language ability is strongly related to important child developmental outcomes. Family-level socioeconomic status influences child language ability; it is unclear if, and through which mechanisms, neighborhood-level factors impact child language. The current study investigated the association between neighborhood factors (deprivation and disorder) assessed before birth and child language outcomes at age 5, with sleep duration as a potential underlying pathway. Secondary analysis was conducted on data collected between 2008 and 2018 on a subsample of 2444 participants from the All Our Families cohort study (Calgary, Canada) for whom neighborhood information from pregnancy could be geocoded. Neighborhood deprivation was determined using the Vancouver Area Neighborhood Deprivation Index (VANDIX), and disorder was assessed using crime reports. Mothers reported on their children&amp;amp;rsquo;s sleep duration and language ability. Multilevel modeling indicated that greater neighborhood deprivation and disorder during pregnancy were predictive of lower scores on the Child Communication Checklist&amp;amp;ndash;2 (CCC&amp;amp;ndash;2) at 5 years. Path analyses revealed an indirect effect of neighborhood disorder on language through child sleep duration at 12 months. These results add to growing evidence that child development should be considered within the context of multiple systems. Sleep duration as an underlying link between environmental factors and child language ability warrants further study as a potential target for intervention.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pharmacogenetic and whole-brain activity analyses uncover integration of distinct molecular and circuit programs that drive learning</a></h4>

              
                Habituation is a foundational learning process critical for animals to adapt their behavior to changes in their sensory environment. Although habituation is considered a simple form of learning, the identification of a multitude of molecular pathways including several neurotransmitter systems that regulate this process suggests an unexpected level of complexity. How the vertebrate brain integrates these various pathways to accomplish habituation learning, whether they act independently or intersect with one another, and whether they act via divergent or overlapping neural circuits has remained unclear. To address these questions, we combined pharmacogenetic pathway analysis with unbiased whole-brain activity mapping using the larval zebrafish. This approach revealed five distinct molecular and circuit modules that regulate habituation learning and identified a set of molecularly defined brain regions associated with four of the five modules. Moreover, we find that in module 1 the palmitoyltransferase Hip14 cooperates with dopamine and NMDA signaling to drive plasticity, while in module 3 the adaptor protein complex subunit Ap2s1 drives habituation by antagonizing dopamine signaling, revealing two distinct and opposing roles for dopaminergic neuromodulation in the regulation of learning. Combined, our results define a core set of distinct modules that act in concert to regulate learning-associated plasticity, and provide compelling evidence that even seemingly simple learning behaviors in a compact vertebrate brain are regulated by a complex and overlapping set of molecular and circuit mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multiple mechanisms mediate the suppression of motion vision during escape maneuvers in flying Drosophila.</a></h4>

              
                Animals must be able to discriminate self-generated (reafferent) from external (exafferent) sensory input. Otherwise, the former could interfere with perception and behavioral actions. The way this can be achieved is through an efference copy, which suppresses reafferent sensory input. An example for this is the optomotor response of the fly. With the optomotor response, flies stabilize a straight flight path by correcting for unintended deviations, which they sense as visual motion of their surrounding or optic flow. HS cells of the fly are tuned to rotational optic flow and are thought to mediate optomotor responses to horizontal motion. It has been shown that during spontaneous turns, an efference copy influences the membrane potential of HS cells. Here we investigate the influence of an efference copy during looming-elicited evasive turns combined with a subsequent optomotor stimulus in Drosophila. We show that looming stimuli themselves can influence the processing of preferred-direction motion in HS cells. In addition, an efference copy can influence visual processing during saccades in both directions, but only in a subset of cells. Our study supports the notion that processing of sensory information is finely tuned and dependent on both stimulus history and behavioral context.

                Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons are thought to modulate how organisms process and respond to environmental stimuli through impacts on arousal, attention, memory, and motivated behavior. We questioned whether basal forebrain cholinergic neurons are directly involved in conditioned behavior, independent of ancillary roles in stimulus processing. We found that cholinergic neurons are active during behavioral responding for a reward - even in the absence of reward or discrete stimuli. Photostimulation of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain or their terminals in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) selectively drove conditioned responding (licking), but not unconditioned licking nor innate motor outputs. In vivo electrophysiological recordings revealed reward-contingency-dependent-gating of cholinergic suppression of BLA neural activity during cholinergic photostimulation, but not dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Finally, cholinergic terminals suppressed BLA projection neuron activity via monosynaptic muscarinic receptor signaling and facilitation of firing in GABAergic interneurons. Taken together, we show that cholinergic effects are modulated by reward contingency in a target-specific manner to promote conditioned responding. Given that the effects cholinergic photostimulation were modulated by rewards, our results constrain clinical goals of augmenting cholinergic function to improve neuropsychiatric symptoms.

                In adulthood, sleep-wake rhythms are one of the most prominent behaviors under circadian control. However, during early life, sleep is spread across the 24-hour day. The mechanism through which sleep rhythms emerge, and the consequent advantage conferred to a juvenile animal, are unknown. In 2nd instar Drosophila larvae (L2), like human infants, sleep is not under circadian control. Here, we identify the precise developmental timepoint when the circadian clock begins to regulate sleep in Drosophila, leading to the emergence of sleep rhythms at the early 3rd instar stage (L3). At this stage, a cellular connection forms between DN1a clock neurons and arousal-promoting Dh44 neurons, bringing arousal under clock control to drive the emergence of circadian sleep. Finally, we demonstrate that L3 but not L2 larvae exhibit long-term memory (LTM) of an aversive cue, and that this LTM depends upon deep sleep generated once sleep rhythms begin. We propose that the developmental emergence of circadian sleep enables more complex cognitive processes, including the onset of enduring memories.

                Microcircuits in the neocortex are functionally organized along layers and columns, which are the fundamental modules of cortical information processing. While the function of cortical microcircuits has focused on neuronal elements, much less is known about the functional organization of astrocytes and their bidirectional interaction with neurons. Here we show that CB1R-mediated astrocyte activation by neuron-released endocannabinoids elevate astrocyte Ca2+ levels, stimulate ATP/adenosine release as gliotransmitters, and transiently depress synaptic transmission in layer 5 pyramidal neurons at relatively distant synapses (20 um) from the stimulated neuron. This astrocyte-mediated heteroneuronal synaptic depression occurred between pyramidal neurons within a cortical column and was absent in neurons belonging to adjacent cortical columns. Moreover, this form of heteroneuronal synaptic depression occurs between neurons located in particular layers, following a specific connectivity pattern that depends on a layer-specific neuron-to-astrocyte signaling. These results unravel the existence of astrocyte-mediated non-synaptic communication between cortical neurons, and that this communication is column- and layer-specific, which adds further complexity to the intercellular signaling processes in the cortex.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) patients possess circulating T cells that recognize specific -synuclein- (-syn)-derived epitopes. One epitope, -syn32-46, interacts strongly with the HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele implicated in multiple autoimmune diseases. Whether this interaction and -syn-specific T cells play roles in PD pathogenesis remains unknown. We report that -syn32-46 immunization of a humanized mouse that expresses HLA-DRB1*15:01 triggers intestinal inflammation. This enteric pathology is characterized by activation of innate and adaptive immune responses and type I interferon signaling as well as loss of enteric dopaminergic neurons in the submucosal plexus, and results in constipation and weight loss. Depletion of CD4+, but not CD8+, T cells partially rescues enteric neurodegeneration. Thus, an interaction between -syn32-46 and HLA-DRB1*15:01 induces gut inflammation and CD4+ T cell-mediated loss of enteric dopaminergic neurons in the humanized mice. These findings suggest a mechanism for the prodromal enteric features of PD and indicate future directions for disease screening and treatment.

                The hippocampal CA2 region, an area important for social memory, has been suspected to play a role in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) because of its resistance to the degeneration observed in neighboring CA1 and CA3 regions in both human and rodent models of TLE. However, little is known about whether alterations in CA2 properties serve to promote seizure generation or propagation. Here we have used the pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (PILO-SE) model of TLE to explore the role of CA2. Ex vivo electrophysiological recordings from acute hippocampal slices revealed a set of coordinated changes that enhance CA2 intrinsic excitability, reduce CA2 local inhibitory input, and increase CA2 excitatory output to its major CA1 synaptic target. Moreover, selective silencing of CA2 pyramidal cells using a chemogenetic approach caused a significant decrease in the frequency of spontaneous seizures. These findings provide the first evidence that CA2 actively contributes to TLE seizure activity and may thus be a promising therapeutic target.

                Nucleus accumbens (NAc) is an important part of basal ganglia and receives major transsynaptic inputs from medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), basolateral amygdala nucleus (BL) and hippocampus (HPC). The neural circuits formed by mPFC, BL, HPC with NAc are closely related to diverse brain functions such as decision-making, social behavior, reward seeking behavior and aggressive behavior. However, a lack of information about network structure of NAc top-down afference has limited our understanding of mechanisms of these functions. Here, we systematically analyzed whole brain patterns of inputs to mPFC/HPC/BL-NAc projectors via using (TRIO) labeling strategy. We found that the upstream input patterns between mPFC-core and mPFC-shell projections, BL-core and BL-shell projections, HPC-core and HPC-shell projections were similar. The projections from mPFC and BL to NAc receive a wide range of inputs, while the projections from HPC to NAc receive convergent inputs. Furthermore, all of mPFC/HPC/BL-NAc projectors receive considerable inputs from respective local regions. This study lays a foundation for further analysis of complex NAc functional mechanisms.

                That sensory neurons alone transduce mechanical stimuli was challenged by the discovery of nociceptive Schwann cells that can initiate pain. Consistent with the existence of inherently mechanosensitive sensory Schwann cells, we found that mechanosensory function of almost all nociceptors, including those signaling fast pain were critically dependent on sensory Schwann cells. Furthermore, in polymodal nociceptors, sensory Schwann cells signal mechanical, but not cold or heat pain. Terminal Schwann cells also surround mechanoreceptor nerve-endings forming Meissners corpuscles that signal vibrotactile touch, raising the possibility that touch sensation is also dependent on such cells. Using optogenetics we show that Meissner`s corpuscle Schwann cells are necessary for the detection and perception of vibrotactile stimuli. Our results show that sensory Schwann cells within diverse glio-neural mechanosensory end-organs are sensors for mechanical pain as well as touch perception. These results place specialized sensory Schwann cells at the center of somatic sensation to all types of mechanical stimuli.

                Understanding changes in information processing between different brain states is a major challenge for contemporary neuroscience. On the circuit level, the encoding capability is quantified by the spectrally resolved dynamic gain function. Its shape, in particular its bandwidth, is important for behavioral performance and possibly even mental capabilities. It has been presumed to be under evolutionary pressure, yet its underlying physiological determinants remain unclear. A systematic characterization had so far been precluded by the computational complexity of realistic neurons. Here we develop a general analysis framework applicable to neuron models as well as experiments on real neurons. We decompose the dynamic gain function by breaking down the physical signal transformation into subthreshold processes, namely current-to-voltage filtering and AP pattern formation, and suprathreshold action potential initiation. Applying this decomposition, we show that: 1. Ultrafast population encoding can be realized by a type II neuron with Hodgkin-Huxley type potassium and sodium channels. 2. Adding a big dendrite improves high bandwidth encoding, primarily by attenuating low-frequency signal representation in the subthreshold region. 3. The initiation dynamics limits the 300-400 Hz bandwidth of real neurons, but not the 100 Hz bandwidth of the model. Our dynamic gain analysis can be universally applied to understand how (patho-) physiological modulation or mutagenesis changes a population's encoding capability.

	<p>Cognitive impairment is frequently reported among anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) patients as well as anti-phospholipid antibody (aPL) carriers, but it is less studied than other manifestations of this condition. Moreover, the exact prevalence of cognitive impairment in these patients has not been accurately determined, mainly due to inconsistency in the tools used to identify impairment, small sample sizes, and variability in the anti-phospholipid antibodies measured and positivity cutoffs. The notion of a direct pathogenic effect is supported by the observation that the higher the number of aPLs present and the higher the load of the specific antibody, the greater the risk of cognitive impairment. There is some evidence to suggest that besides the thrombotic process, inflammation-related pathways play a role in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in APS. The cornerstone treatments of APS are anti-coagulant and anti-thrombotic medications. These treatments have shown some favorable effects in reversing cognitive impairment, but solid evidence for the efficacy and safety of these treatments in the context of cognitive impairment is still lacking. In this article, we review the current knowledge regarding the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical associations, and treatment of cognitive impairment associated with APS and aPL positivity.</p>

	<p>For more than a decade, NMDAR autoimmune encephalitis has been studied and treated as a neurological condition, and good results have been achieve through immune therapies. Apart from being well represented in the CNS, NMDA receptors are currently known of and being studied in multiple non-neuronal cells with potential clinical significance. The association of NMDAR autoimmune encephalitis with pregnancy is rare, and hypokalemia is not mentioned. Methods: We present the case of a 30-year-old woman with NMDAR autoimmune encephalitis in her 17th week of pregnancy associated with persistent hypokalemia that had no apparent cause and resisted Kalium chloride supplementation. A diagnostic work-up including clinical, laboratory, and imagistic examinations, was performed. The case was monitored between May and September 2016 at Neurology, SCJUT. Results: Severe hypokalemia with normal serum sodium levels persisted throughout the course of clinical manifestation of anti-NMDAR autoimmune encephalitis. Conclusions: NMDAR autoimmune encephalitis is under-diagnosed in its atypical clinical variants, and this disease&amp;amp;rsquo;s association with hypokalemia is not mentioned in the literature. Still, it is of clinical importance because it attests to the implications of other organs/systems in the general autoimmune process of NMDAR encephalitis, and it might change the way we address certain psychiatric disorders by searching underlying organic conditions.</p>

	<p>The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has starkly increased, instigating research into risk factors for ASD. This research has identified immune risk factors for ASD, along with evidence of immune dysfunction and excess inflammation frequently experienced by autistic individuals. Increased innate inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, are seen repeatedly in ASD; however, the origin of excess IL-6 in ASD has not been identified. Here we explore specific responses of circulating monocytes from autistic children. We isolated CD14+ monocytes from whole blood and stimulated them for 24 h under three conditions: media alone, lipoteichoic acid to activate TLR2, and lipopolysaccharide to activate TLR4. We then measured secreted cytokine concentrations in cellular supernatant using a human multiplex bead immunoassay. We found that after TLR4 activation, CD14+ monocytes from autistic children produce increased IL-6 compared to monocytes from children with typical development. IL-6 concentration also correlated with worsening restrictive and repetitive behaviors. These findings suggest dysfunctional activation of myeloid cells, and may indicate that other cells of this lineage, including macrophages, and microglia in the brain, might have a similar dysfunction. Further research on myeloid cells in ASD is warranted.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) patients using dopamine agonists can develop withdrawal symptoms, referred to as dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome (DAWS), under dose tapering or discontinuation of these drugs. DAWS includes a severe stereotypical cluster of psychiatric and psychological symptoms encompassing severe mood and anxiety disturbances, autonomic symptoms, as well as generalized pain and drug cravings. However, symptoms of withdrawal of dopamine replacement therapies (DRT) are not simply limited to dopamine agonists tapering, as observed in PD patients on deep brain stimulation after dopaminergic drugs withdrawal related to surgery. To date, no DRT-related withdrawal syndrome has been described in PD patients who discontinue rasagiline, an irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B). Here we report three PD patients who developed a severe withdrawal syndrome after rasagiline suspension. The syndrome was mainly characterized by prominent psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety with panic attacks, dysphoria, and agitation) associated with fatigue, generalized pain, and autonomic manifestations (closely resembling symptoms of DAWS). In our opinion, this report suggests the importance of closely monitoring PD patients undergoing rasagiline suspension for withdrawal symptoms and provides interesting points of reflection on the role of rasagiline and other MAO-B inhibitors in mood disorders.</p>

	<p>Emerging studies have reported that functional brain networks change with increasing age. Graph theory is applied to understand the age-related differences in brain behavior and function, and functional connectivity between the regions is examined using electroencephalography (EEG). The effect of normal aging on functional networks and inter-regional synchronization during the working memory (WM) state is not well known. In this study, we applied graph theory to investigate the effect of aging on network topology in a resting state and during performing a visual WM task to classify aging EEG signals. We recorded EEGs from 20 healthy middle-aged and 20 healthy elderly subjects with their eyes open, eyes closed, and during a visual WM task. EEG signals were used to construct the functional network; nodes are represented by EEG electrodes; and edges denote the functional connectivity. Graph theory matrices including global efficiency, local efficiency, clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, node strength, node betweenness centrality, and assortativity were calculated to analyze the networks. We applied the three classifiers of K-nearest neighbor (KNN), a support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) to classify both groups. The analyses showed the significantly reduced network topology features in the elderly group. Local efficiency, global efficiency, and clustering coefficient were significantly lower in the elderly group with the eyes-open, eyes-closed, and visual WM task states. KNN achieved its highest accuracy of 98.89% during the visual WM task and depicted better classification performance than other classifiers. Our analysis of functional network connectivity and topological characteristics can be used as an appropriate technique to explore normal age-related changes in the human brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Patient perspectives on home-based rehabilitation exercise and general physical activity after total hip arthroplasty: A qualitative study (PHETHAS-2) [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Home-based rehabilitation exercise following Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) shows similar outcomes compared to supervised outpatient rehabilitation exercise. Little is known about patients' experiences with home-based rehabilitation, and this study aimed to investigate how patients perceived home-based rehabilitation exercise and general physical activity after THA, focusing on facilitators and barriers. Methods: Semi-structured interviews of qualitative design were conducted with 22 patients who had undergone THA and who had performed home-based rehabilitation exercise. The study took place in a regional hospital in Denmark between January 2018 and May 2019. Data were analyzed using an interpretive thematic analysis approach, with theoretical underpinning from the concept ‘conduct of everyday life’. The study is embedded within the Pragmatic Home-Based Exercise Therapy after Total Hip Arthroplasty-Silkeborg trial (PHETHAS-1). Results: The main theme, ‘wishing to return to the well-known everyday life’, and the subtheme ‘general physical activity versus rehabilitation exercise’ were identified. Generally, participants found the home-based rehabilitation exercise boring but were motivated by the goal of returning to their well-known everyday life and performing their usual general physical activities. Participants enrolled in the PHETHAS-1 study used the enrollment as part of their motivation for doing the exercises.  Both pain and the absence of pain were identified as barriers for doing home-based rehabilitation exercise. Pain could cause insecurity about possible medical complications, while the absence of pain could lead to the rehabilitation exercise being perceived as pointless. Conclusions: The overall goal of returning to the well-known everyday life served as a facilitator for undertaking home-based rehabilitation exercise after THA along with the flexibility regarding time and place for performing exercises. Boring exercises as well as both pain and no pain were identified as barriers to the performance of home-based rehabilitation exercise. Participants were motivated towards performing general physical activities which were part of their everyday life.

                Background: Due to the absence of an effective vaccine for dengue, community-led vector control strategy could be a sustainable approach for dengue prevention. Therefore, this study aimed to assess people’s knowledge of dengue vectors and the practice of preventive measures to avoid vector mosquitoes by means of a structured questionnaire. Methods: A telephone-based survey was conducted between July 2019 to December 2019 from confirmed dengue patients and general people without dengue fever living in Chattogram, Bangladesh. Patients’ contact information was collected from two tertiary care hospitals. The level of knowledge and preventive practice were determined through the scoring of each participant against their responses. The association of individuals’ knowledge and practice scores with demographic variables was measured through chi-square and binary logistic analyses.    Results: Overall, 61.9% of participants (72% case and 51.7% non-case) had good knowledge, whereas only 10.6% of them (12.7% case and 8.7% non-case) strongly practiced the mosquito prevention methods. However, significant variation in the level of knowledge was found between the two groups. Urban residents had 2.20 times higher knowledge compared to semi urban. Students and government officials had 3.39 times and 3.17 times better knowledge than general workers respectively. Permanent residents had 2.01 times better knowledge in comparison to the people living in temporary housing. In terms of mosquito preventive measures, semi-urban people showed 3.19 times (CI=0.97-10.52) stronger practice compared to rural people. Conclusions: This study suggests that dengue control strategies should focus on the effective practice of mosquito prevention by engaging community people.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The SAMBA tool uses long reads to improve the contiguity of genome assemblies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Aleksey V. Zimin, Steven L. Salzberg</p>

Third-generation sequencing technologies can generate very long reads with relatively high error rates. The lengths of the reads, which sometimes exceed one million bases, make them invaluable for resolving complex repeats that cannot be assembled using shorter reads. Many high-quality genome assemblies have already been produced, curated, and annotated using the previous generation of sequencing data, and full re-assembly of these genomes with long reads is not always practical or cost-effective. One strategy to upgrade existing assemblies is to generate additional coverage using long-read data, and add that to the previously assembled contigs. SAMBA is a tool that is designed to scaffold and gap-fill existing genome assemblies with additional long-read data, resulting in substantially greater contiguity. SAMBA is the only tool of its kind that also computes and fills in the sequence for all spanned gaps in the scaffolds, yielding much longer contigs. Here we compare SAMBA to several similar tools capable of re-scaffolding assemblies using long-read data, and we show that SAMBA yields better contiguity and introduces fewer errors than competing methods. SAMBA is open-source software that is distributed at https://github.com/alekseyzimin/masurca.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The properties of human disease mutations at protein interfaces</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Benjamin J. Livesey, Joseph A. Marsh</p>

The assembly of proteins into complexes and their interactions with other biomolecules are often vital for their biological function. While it is known that mutations at protein interfaces have a high potential to be damaging and cause human genetic disease, there has been relatively little consideration for how this varies between different types of interfaces. Here we investigate the properties of human pathogenic and putatively benign missense variants at homomeric (isologous and heterologous), heteromeric, DNA, RNA and other ligand interfaces, and at different regions in proteins with respect to those interfaces. We find that different types of interfaces vary greatly in their propensity to be associated with pathogenic mutations, with homomeric heterologous and DNA interfaces being particularly enriched in disease. We also find that residues that do not directly participate in an interface, but are close in three-dimensional space, show a significant disease enrichment. Finally, we observe that mutations at different types of interfaces tend to have distinct property changes when undergoing amino acid substitutions associated with disease, and that this is linked to substantial variability in their identification by computational variant effect predictors.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Estimating the glutamate transporter surface density in distinct sub-cellular compartments of mouse hippocampal astrocytes</a></h4>

Glutamate transporters preserve the spatial specificity of synaptic transmission by limiting glutamate diffusion away from the synaptic cleft, and prevent excitotoxicity by keeping the extracellular concentration of glutamate at low nanomolar levels. Glutamate transporters are abundantly expressed in astrocytes, and previous estimates have been obtained about their surface expression in astrocytes of the rat hippocampus and cerebellum. Analogous estimates for the mouse hippocampus are currently not available. In this work, we derive the surface density of astrocytic glutamate transporters in mice of different ages via quantitative dot blot. We find that the surface density of glial glutamate transporters is similar in 7-8 week old mice and rats. In mice, the levels of glutamate transporters increase until about 6 months of age and then begin to decline slowly. Our data, obtained from a combination of experimental and modeling approaches, point to the existence of stark differences in the density of expression of glutamate transporters across different sub-cellular compartments, indicating that the extent to which astrocytes limit extrasynaptic glutamate diffusion depends not only on their level of synaptic coverage, but also on the identity of the astrocyte compartment in contact with the synapse. Together, these findings provide information on how heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of glutamate transporters in the plasma membrane of hippocampal astrocytes my alter glutamate receptor activation out of the synaptic cleft.

                <p>by Daniel Kaiser, Arthur M. Jacobs, Radoslaw M. Cichy</p>

Abstract conceptual representations are critical for human cognition. Despite their importance, key properties of these representations remain poorly understood. Here, we used computational models of distributional semantics to predict multivariate fMRI activity patterns during the activation and contextualization of abstract concepts. We devised a task in which participants had to embed abstract nouns into a story that they developed around a given background context. We found that representations in inferior parietal cortex were predicted by concept similarities emerging in models of distributional semantics. By constructing different model families, we reveal the models’ learning trajectories and delineate how abstract and concrete training materials contribute to the formation of brain-like representations. These results inform theories about the format and emergence of abstract conceptual representations in the human brain.

Classical mathematical models of tumor growth have shaped our understanding of cancer and have broad practical implications for treatment scheduling and dosage. However, even the simplest textbook models have been barely validated in real world-data of human patients. In this study, we fitted a range of differential equation models to tumor volume measurements of patients undergoing chemotherapy or cancer immunotherapy for solid tumors. We used a large dataset of 1472 patients with three or more measurements per target lesion, of which 652 patients had six or more data points. We show that the early treatment response shows only moderate correlation with the final treatment response, demonstrating the need for nuanced models. We then perform a head-to-head comparison of six classical models which are widely used in the field: the Exponential, Logistic, Classic Bertalanffy, General Bertalanffy, Classic Gompertz and General Gompertz model. Several models provide a good fit to tumor volume measurements, with the Gompertz model providing the best balance between goodness of fit and number of parameters. Similarly, when fitting to early treatment data, the general Bertalanffy and Gompertz models yield the lowest mean absolute error to forecasted data, indicating that these models could potentially be effective at predicting treatment outcome. In summary, we provide a quantitative benchmark for classical textbook models and state-of-the art models of human tumor growth. We publicly release an anonymized version of our original data, providing the first benchmark set of human tumor growth data for evaluation of mathematical models.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Impact on carbon emissions of online study for a cohort of overseas students: A retrospective cohort study [version 4; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: One of the benefits of online education is the potential reduction in carbon emissions through the decrease in travel to attend a university in person. We estimated the savings in CO2 emissions of an international cohort of master’s students who studied fully online from their home countries, rather than travelling to the UK and living there while attending university. Methods: The city and country of residence of a cohort of students who first enrolled in the fully online Peoples-uni/Manchester Metropolitan University Master of Public Health programme between the second semester of 2011 and the first semester 2013 were recorded. Total difference in emissions was calculated by adding the estimated aviation emissions between Manchester, UK and the cities where students resided, to the difference in per capita emissions between the country of origin and the UK for the time that the student would have spent in Manchester, based on the semester in which they first enrolled. Results: 128 students enrolled from 55 cities in 31 countries. 93 students were from a range of African countries and 18 from the Indian sub-continent. Flights to and from Manchester were estimated to have accounted for 114,553kg of CO2 and living in Manchester for the duration of their course compared with staying in the home country would have been equivalent to 854,904kg of CO2. The combined net savings was 969,457kg of CO2. Conclusions: A small cohort of overseas students, largely from Africa and India, studied online rather than attending university in the UK. The likely saving by this small cohort of nearly a million kg of CO 2 emissions offers an indication of the potential environmental benefits of offering university education online to overseas students.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Situations of work-related diseases and injuries among agriculturists in the upper northeast regions of Thailand [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Agriculturists exposed to health hazards are affected by increased occupational disease. This retrospective study aimed to investigate situations of work-related diseases and injuries among agriculturists in upper northeast Thailand. Methods: The secondary data of international classification of diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) case reports of occupational disease among farmers for 2014-2016, from the database of the Health Data Center (HDC), were used. We collected the number of registered farmers from the agricultural office and secondary data of ICD-10 from the hospital information system (HIS) of healthcare services in Udon Thani and Roi-Et provinces. The annual morbidity rate of occupational diseases was analyzed and presented at a rate per 100,000 farmers of the studied area. Results: Among farmers who visited healthcare service providers, lung disease, which was not reported as occupational disease of the HDC database, was the highest ranking of all diseases, followed by work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs), noise- and heat-related diseases, and pesticide toxicity, respectively, while the injury rate was as high as that of WMSDs. The morbidity rate of Udon Thani was higher than that of Roi-Et province, whose rate was closer to the national rate. The number of farmers from the HDC database was not reflective of numbers of registered farmers, even though the case reports of the HDC was lower than that of the HIS with occupational ICD-10 codes, which might explain the underestimation of the morbidity rate of occupational disease. Conclusions: The morbidity rate of lung disease, noise- and heat-related diseases, and pesticide toxicity increased every year (2014-2016) and reflects the health problems among agriculturists in Thailand. The underestimation in the reported disease rate is explained from big data analysis by the rare recording of work-related cases among those agriculturists. Therefore, Thai agriculturists should be supported in registration with occupational diseases surveillance as holistic healthcare.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">A binocular synaptic network supports interocular response alignment in visual cortical neurons</a></h4>

              
                Scholl, Tepohl, et al. investigate how signals from the two eyes are combined within synaptic populations of individual neurons to shape a coherent representation. Rather than a convergence of monocular streams, they find that intracortical binocular networks are key to shaping alignment in cortical layer 2/3.

                Granzyme A (GZMA) is a serine protease secreted by cytotoxic lymphocytes, with <i>Gzma</i><sup>-/-</sup> mouse studies having informed our understanding of GZMA’s physiological function. We show herein that <i>Gzma</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice have a mixed C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N genetic background and retain the full-length nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (<i>Nnt</i>) gene, whereas <i>Nnt</i> is truncated in C57BL/6J mice. Chikungunya viral arthritis was substantially ameliorated in <i>Gzma</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice; however, the presence of <i>Nnt</i> and the C57BL/6N background, rather than loss of GZMA expression, was responsible for this phenotype. A new CRISPR active site mutant C57BL/6J <i>Gzma</i><sup>S211A</sup> mouse provided the first insights into GZMA’s bioactivity free of background issues, with circulating proteolytically active GZMA promoting immune-stimulating and pro-inflammatory signatures. Remarkably, k-mer mining of the Sequence Read Archive illustrated that ≈27% of Run Accessions and ≈38% of BioProjects listing C57BL/6J as the mouse strain had <i>Nnt</i> sequencing reads inconsistent with a C57BL/6J genetic background. <i>Nnt</i> and C57BL/6N background issues have clearly complicated our understanding of GZMA and may similarly have influenced studies across a broad range of fields.

                The centrosome composed of a pair of centrioles (mother and daughter) and pericentriolar material, and is mainly responsible for microtubule nucleation and anchorage in animal cells. The subdistal appendage (SDA) is a centriolar structure located at the mother centriole’s subdistal region, and it functions in microtubule anchorage. However, the molecular composition and detailed structure of the SDA remain largely unknown. Here, we identified α-taxilin and γ-taxilin as new SDA components that form a complex via their coiled-coil domains and that serve as a new subgroup during SDA hierarchical assembly. The taxilins’ SDA localization is dependent on ODF2, and α-taxilin recruits CEP170 to the SDA. Functional analyses suggest that α- and γ-taxilin are responsible for SDA structural integrity and centrosomal microtubule anchorage during interphase and for proper spindle orientation during metaphase. Our results shed light on the molecular components and functional understanding of the SDA hierarchical assembly and microtubule organization.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Physiological TLR4 regulation in human fetal membranes as an explicative mechanism of a pathological preterm case</a></h4>

              
                The integrity of human fetal membranes is crucial for harmonious fetal development throughout pregnancy. Their premature rupture is often the consequence of a physiological phenomenon that has been exacerbated. Beyond all the implied biological processes, inflammation is of primary importance and is qualified as ‘sterile’ at the end of pregnancy. In this study, complementary methylomic and transcriptomic strategies on amnion and choriodecidua explants obtained from the altered (cervix zone) and intact fetal membranes at term and before labour were used. By cross-analysing genome-wide studies strengthened by in vitro experiments, we deciphered how the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), an actor in pathological fetal membrane rupture, is controlled. Indeed, it is differentially regulated in the altered zone and between both layers by a dual mechanism: (1) the methylation of TLR4 and miRNA promoters and (2) targeting by miRNA (let-7a-2 and miR-125b-1) acting on the 3’-UTR of TLR4. Consequently, this study demonstrates that fine regulation of TLR4 is required for sterile inflammation establishment at the end of pregnancy and that it may be dysregulated in the pathological premature rupture of membranes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Novel insights from a multiomics dissection of the hayflick limit</a></h4>

              
                The process wherein dividing cells exhaust proliferative capacity and enter into replicative senescence has become a prominent model for cellular aging in vitro. Despite decades of study, this cellular state is not fully understood in culture and even much less so during aging. Here, we revisit Leonard Hayflick’s original observation of replicative senescence in WI-38 human lung fibroblasts equipped with a battery of modern techniques including RNA-seq, single cell RNA-seq, proteomics, metabolomics, and ATAC-seq. We find evidence that the transition to a senescent state manifests early, increases gradually, and corresponds to a concomitant global increase in DNA accessibility in nucleolar and lamin associated domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate that senescent WI-38 cells acquire a striking resemblance to myofibroblasts in a process similar to the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) that is regulated by the transcription factors YAP1/TEAD1 and TGF-&#x1D6FD;2. Lastly, we show that verteporfin inhibition of YAP1/TEAD1 activity in aged WI-38 cells robustly attenuates this gene expression program.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The transcriptional corepressor CTBP-1 acts with the SOX family transcription factor EGL-13 to maintain AIA interneuron cell identity in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                Cell identity is characterized by a distinct combination of gene expression, cell morphology, and cellular function established as progenitor cells divide and differentiate. Following establishment, cell identities can be unstable and require active and continuous maintenance throughout the remaining life of a cell. Mechanisms underlying the maintenance of cell identities are incompletely understood. Here, we show that the gene <i>ctbp-1,</i> which encodes the transcriptional corepressor <i>C-t</i>erminal <i>b</i>inding <i>p</i>rotein-1 (CTBP-1), is essential for the maintenance of the identities of the two AIA interneurons in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans. ctbp-1</i> is not required for the establishment of the AIA cell fate but rather functions cell-autonomously and can act in later larval stage and adult worms to maintain proper AIA gene expression, morphology and function. From a screen for suppressors of the <i>ctbp-1</i> mutant phenotype, we identified the gene <i>egl-13,</i> which encodes a SOX family transcription factor. We found that <i>egl-13</i> regulates AIA function and aspects of AIA gene expression, but not AIA morphology. We conclude that the CTBP-1 protein maintains AIA cell identity in part by utilizing EGL-13 to repress transcriptional activity in the AIAs. More generally, we propose that transcriptional corepressors like CTBP-1 might be critical factors in the maintenance of cell identities, harnessing the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors like EGL-13 to selectively regulate gene expression in a cell-specific manner.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Plant SYP12 syntaxins mediate an evolutionarily conserved general immunity to filamentous pathogens</a></h4>

              
                Filamentous fungal and oomycete plant pathogens that invade by direct penetration through the leaf epidermal cell wall cause devastating plant diseases. Plant pre-invasive immunity towards non-adapted filamentous pathogens is highly effective and durable. Pre- and post-invasive immunity correlates with the formation of evolutionarily conserved and cell-autonomous cell wall structures, named papillae and encasements, respectively. Yet, it is still unresolved how papillae/encasements are formed and whether these defense structures prevent pathogen ingress. Here we show that in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, the two closely related members of the SYP12 clade of syntaxins (PEN1 and SYP122) are indispensable for the formation of papillae and encasements.  Moreover, loss-of-function mutants were hampered in pre-invasive immunity towards a range of phylogenetically distant non-adapted filamentous pathogens, underlining the versatility and efficacy of this defense. Complementation studies using SYP12s from the early diverging land plant, <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>, showed that the SYP12 clade immunity function has survived 470 My of independent evolution. These results suggest that ancestral land plants evolved the SYP12 clade to provide a broad and durable pre-invasive immunity to facilitate their life on land, and pave the way to a better understanding of how adapted pathogens overcome this ubiquitous plant defense strategy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Interactions between strains govern the eco-evolutionary dynamics of microbial communities</a></h4>

              
                Genomic data has revealed that genotypic variants of the same species, i.e., strains, coexist and are abundant in natural microbial communities. However, it is not clear if strains are ecologically equivalent, and at what characteristic genetic distance they might exhibit distinct interactions and dynamics. Here, we address this problem by tracking 10 taxonomically diverse microbial communities from the pitcher plant <i>Sarracenia purpurea</i> in the laboratory for more than 300 generations. Using metagenomic sequencing, we reconstruct their dynamics over time and across scales, from distant phyla to closely related genotypes. We find that most strains are not ecologically equivalent and exhibit distinct dynamical patterns, often being significantly more correlated with strains from another species than their own. Although even a single mutation can affect laboratory strains, on average, natural strains typically decouple in their dynamics beyond a genetic distance of 100 base pairs. Using mathematical consumer-resource models, we show that these taxonomic patterns emerge naturally from ecological interactions between community members, but only if the interactions are coarse-grained at the level of strains, not species. Finally, by analyzing genomic differences between strains, we identify major functional hubs such as transporters, regulators, and carbohydrate-catabolizing enzymes, which might be the basis for strain-specific interactions. Our work suggests that fine-scale genetic differences in natural communities could be created and stabilized via the rapid diversification of ecological interactions between strains.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Induction of osteogenesis by bone-targeted Notch activation</a></h4>

              
                Declining bone mass is associated with aging and osteoporosis, a disease characterized by progressive weakening of the skeleton and increased fracture incidence. Growth and lifelong homeostasis of bone rely on interactions between different cell types including vascular cells and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). As these interactions involve Notch signaling, we have explored whether treatment with secreted Notch ligand proteins can enhance osteogenesis in adult mice. We show that a bone-targeting, high affinity version of the ligand Delta-like 4, termed Dll4<sub>(E12)</sub>, induces bone formation in male mice without causing adverse effects in other organs, which are known to rely on intact Notch signaling. Due to lower bone surface and thereby reduced retention of Dll4<sub>(E12)</sub>, the same approach failed to promote osteogenesis in female and ovariectomized mice but strongly enhanced trabecular bone formation in combination with parathyroid hormone. Single cell analysis of stromal cells indicates that Dll4<sub>(E12) </sub>primarily acts on MSCs and has comparably minor effects on osteoblasts, endothelial cells or chondrocytes. We propose that activation of Notch signaling by bone-targeted fusion proteins might be therapeutically useful and can avoid detrimental effects in Notch-dependent processes in other organs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Emergence of time persistence in an interpretable data-driven neural network model</a></h4>

              
                Establishing accurate as well as interpretable models of networks activity is an open challenge in systems neuroscience. Here we infer an energy-based model of the ARTR, a circuit that controls zebrafish swimming statistics, using functional recordings of the spontaneous activity of hundreds of neurons. Although our model is trained to reproduce the low-order statistics of the network activity at short time-scales, its simulated dynamics quantitatively captures the slowly alternating activity of the ARTR. It further reproduces the modulation of this persistent dynamics by the bath temperature and visual stimulation. Mathematical analysis of the model unveils a low-dimensional landscape-based representation of the ARTR activity, where the slow network dynamics reflects Arrhenius-like barriers crossings between metastable states. Our work thus shows how data-driven models built from large neural populations recordings can be reduced to low-dimensional functional models in order to reveal the fundamental mechanisms controlling the collective neuronal dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Corticospinal excitability is influenced by the recent history of electrical digital stimulation: implications for the relative magnitude of short-latency afferent inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Background Electrical stimulation of the hand can suppress the motor evoked potential (MEP) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor hand area (M1-HAND) when the afferent stimulus arrives in M1-HAND at the time of TMS. The magnitude of short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) is expressed as the ratio between the conditioned and unconditioned MEP and is widely used to probe sensorimotor interactions in human physiological studies. Objective/Hypothesis We hypothesized that corticospinal excitability and SAI are influenced by the recent history of peripheral electrical stimulation. Methods In twenty healthy participants, we recorded MEPs from the right first dorsal interosseus muscle. MEPs were evoked by single-pulse TMS of the left M1-HAND alone (unconditioned TMS) or by TMS preceded by electrical stimulation of the right index finger ('homotopic' conditioning) or little finger ('heterotopic' conditioning). The three conditions were pseudo-randomly intermixed or delivered in blocks in which a single condition was repeated five or ten times. MEP amplitudes and SAI magnitudes were compared using linear mixed effect models. Results All stimulation protocols consistently produced SAI, which was stronger after homotopic stimulation. Randomly intermingling the three stimulation conditions reduced the relative magnitude of homotopic and heterotopic SAI as opposed to blocked stimulation. The apparent attenuation of SAI was caused by a suppression of the unconditioned but not the conditioned MEP amplitude during the randomly intermixed condition. Conclusion(s) The recent history of afferent stimulation modulates corticospinal excitability. This 'history effect' impacts on the relative magnitude of SAI depending on how conditioned and unconditioned responses are intermixed and needs to be taken into consideration when probing afferent inhibition and corticospinal excitability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Joint coding of visual input and eye/head position in V1 of freely moving mice</a></h4>

              
                Visual input to the brain during natural behavior is highly dependent on movements of the eyes, head, and body. Neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) respond to eye and head movements, but how information about eye and head position is integrated with visual processing during free movement is unknown, since visual physiology is generally performed under head-fixation. To address this, we performed single-unit electrophysiology in V1 of freely moving mice while simultaneously measuring the mouse's eye position, head orientation, and the visual scene from the mouse's perspective. We mapped spatiotemporal receptive fields using a generalized linear model (GLM) that predicted the activity of V1 neurons based on gaze-corrected visual input. Critically, a large fraction of visually-responsive neurons showed tuning for eye position and head orientation. Incorporating these variables into the GLM revealed that visual and positional signals in most neurons are multiplicatively integrated, consistent with computation via gain fields and nonlinear mixed selectivity. These results provide new insight into coding in mouse V1, and more generally provide a paradigm for performing visual physiology under natural conditions, including active sensing and ethological behavior.

                Astronauts returning from long-duration spaceflights experience visual-vestibular conflicts that causes motion sickness, perceptions that the environment is moving when it is not, problems with walking, and other functional tasks. To evaluate whether astronauts will have similar decrements associated with visual-vestibular conflicts after they land on Mars following exposure to weightlessness, participants were held by a device that offloads their weight; first entirely (0 G) for 10 minutes, and then partially (0.38 G) or not at all (1 G) for 15 minutes. Tandem (heel-to-toe) walk was used to assess the subjects walking performance. Ten subjects performed 2 trials of 10 steps on a medium-density foam surface. Four conditions were investigated: (a) 1 G in virtual reality (VR); (b) 1 G in VR with a superimposed disorienting optokinetic simulation (VR+DOS); (c) 0.38 G in VR; and (d) 0.38 G in VR+DOS. Tandem walk performance decreased in VR+DOS compared to VR in both 1 G and simulated 0.38 G. Tandem walking performance in VR+DOS was better in 0.38 G compared to 1 G. Tandem walking performance in VR+DOS in 1 G was not significantly different from tandem walking performance after spaceflight or bed rest. The increased tandem walking performance in 0.38 G compared to 1 G was presumably due to an increased cone of stability, allowing larger amplitude of body sway without resulting in a fall. Tandem walking on a compliant foam surface in VR+DOS is a potential analog for simulating postflight dynamic balance deficits in astronauts.

                Despite decades of research, whether the C. elegans traveling-wave sinusoidal body pattern during locomotion is produced (a) by the undulations of the head followed by wave propagation down the body, or (b) via centrally coordinated posture control along the body, is still under debate. By studying relationships between the time series of postural angles along the body extracted from videos of moving worms, we find that the reflex-chain model can be refuted, in both forward and backward locomotion as well as during swimming and crawling behaviors. We show that information theory applied to animal behavior can yield insights into the neural control of behavior.

                Although the etiology of major depressive disorder remains poorly understood, impairment of gamma oscillations recently emerged as a potential biomarker for major depression. The olfactory bulb (OB) is a major source of brain wide gamma oscillations and bulbectomy is an animal model for depression. Here we demonstrate that chemogenetic suppression of OB neuronal activity or temporally suppressing the OB to pyriform cortex synaptic transmission decreased gamma oscillation power in multiple brain areas associated with depression-like behaviors. To assess the hypothesized link between depression and diffuse depression of gamma oscillations, we employed gamma phase-dependent closed loop neuromodulation of cortical areas, paced by the native OB output. This procedure alleviated depressive-like behaviors in animals and suggests that restoring gamma oscillations may improve depression in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Why Are Alzheimer's Disease Patients Unaware of their Memory Deficits?</a></h4>

              
                Anosognosia, or the lack of awareness of one's own impairment, is frequent for memory deficits in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although often related to frontal dysfunctions, the neural mechanisms of anosognosia remain largely unknown. We hypothesized that anosognosia in AD may result from a failure in the error-monitoring system, thus preventing patients from being aware of and learning from their own errors. We, therefore, investigated the event-related potentials evoked by erroneous responses during a memory task in two groups of amyloid positive individuals who had only subjective memory complaints at study entry: 1) those who progressed to AD; and 2) those who remained cognitively normal after five years of follow-up. Our findings revealed direct evidence of a failure in the error-monitoring system at early stages of AD, suggesting that it may be the critical neural substrate of anosognosia in this neurodegenerative disorder.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Taurine or N-acetylcysteine treatments prevent memory impairment and metabolite profile alterations in the hippocampus of high-fat diet-fed female mice</a></h4>

              
                Obesity impacts brain metabolism and function, and constitutes a risk factor for dementia development. Long-term exposure to obesogenic diets leads to taurine accumulation in the hippocampus of rodents. Taurine has putative beneficial effects on cell homeostasis, and is reported to improve cognition. Therefore, hippocampal taurine accumulation in obese and diabetic models might constitute a counteracting response to metabolic stress. This study tested the hypothesis that treatment with taurine or with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which provides cysteine for the synthesis of taurine and the antioxidant glutathione, prevent obesity-associated hippocampal alterations and memory impairment. Female mice were fed either a regular diet or a high-fat diet (HFD). For the same period, some mice had access to 3%(w/v) taurine or 3%(w/v) NAC in the drinking water. After 2 months, magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to measure metabolite profiles. Then, memory was assessed in novel object and novel location recognition tests. HFD feeding caused memory impairment in both tests, and reduced concentration of lactate, phosphocreatine-to-creatine ratio, and the neuronal marker N-acetylaspartate in the hippocampus. Both taurine and NAC prevented HFD-induced memory impairment and N-acetylaspartate reduction. NAC, but not taurine, prevented the HFD-induced reduction of lactate and phosphocreatine-to-creatine ratio. Analysis of the metabolite profile further revealed prominent NAC/taurine-induced increase of glutamate and GABA levels in the hippocampus. We conclude that NAC and taurine prevent of neuronal dysfunction, while only NAC prevents energy metabolism dysregulation in HFD-induced obesity in female mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Top-down control of the left visual field bias in cued visual spatial attention</a></h4>

              
                A left visual field (LVF) bias in perceptual judgements, response speed and discrimination accuracy are well documented in humans. However, LVF bias can be modulated by perceptual and task demands. For example, cuing spatial attention can reduce or eliminate the LVF bias, suggesting that attentional control can compensate for the LVF bias. We investigated this possibility directly by recording pupillometry together with fMRI in a cued visual spatial attention task. Prior to the onset of a task-relevant target stimulus, we observed that the pupil was significantly more dilated following attend-right than attend-left cues even though task performance did not differ. This difference in pupil dilation was inversely related to the corresponding difference in later target-evoked pupil dilation and in the reaction times to those targets, suggesting that an increased attentional effort was triggered by the attend-right cues, and this offset the LVF bias, equating behavioral performance. The differences in pupil dilation to the right versus left hemifield were correlated with corresponding fMRI differences primarily in the right hemisphere, supporting the idea that the increased attentional effort for rightward attention is mediated by activity in right hemisphere networks, which illuminates how attentional control mediates attentional biases in vision.

                Purpose: This study analyzes the effects of retrospective lipid suppression, a simulated macromolecular prior knowledge and different spline baseline stiffness values on 9.4 T multi-slice proton FID-MRSI data spanning the whole cerebrum of human brain and its reproducibility of metabolite ratio (/tCr) maps for 10 brain metabolites. Methods: Measurements were performed twice on five volunteers using a non-accelerated FID MRSI 2D sequence at 9.4 T. The effects of retrospective lipid L2-regularization, macromolecular spectrum and different LCModel baseline flexibilities on SNR, FWHM, fitting residual, CRLB and the concentration ratio maps were investigated. Intra-subject, inter-session coefficient of variation of the mean metabolite ratios (/tCr) of each slice was calculated. Results: L2-regularization provided effective suppression of lipid-artifacts, but should be avoided if no artifacts are detected. Transversal, sagittal and coronal of many metabolite ratio maps correspond to anatomically expected concentration relations in gray and white matter for the majority of the cerebrum when using a flexible baseline in LCModel fit. Additionally, results from the second measurements of the same subjects show that slice positioning and data quality correlate significantly to the first measurement. Conclusion: Concentration ratio maps (/tCr) for 4 metabolites (tCho, NAA, Glu, mI) spanning the majority and six metabolites (NAAG, GABA, GSH, Tau, Gln, Asp) covering 32 mm in the upper part of the brain were acquired at 9.4 T using multi-slice FID MRSI with retrospective lipid suppression, a macromolecular spectrum and a flexible LCModel baseline.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evidence for independent processing of shape by vision and touch</a></h4>

              
                Although visual object recognition is well-studied and relatively well understood, much less is understood about how shapes are recognized by touch and how such haptic stimuli might be compared to visual shapes. One might expect that the processes of visual and haptic object recognition engage identical brain structures given the similarity of the problem and the advantages of avoiding redundant brain circuitry, but it has not yet been established the extent to which this is true. We recruited human participants to perform a one-back same-different visual and haptic shape comparison task both within (i.e., comparing two visual shapes or two haptic shapes) and across (i.e., comparing visual with haptic shapes) modalities. Participants saw or felt a shape and responded according to whether they thought the shape was the same or different from the previously felt or seen shape. We then used various shape metrics to predict performance based on the shape, orientation, and modality of the two stimuli which were being compared on each trial. We found that the fixed orientation of the shape stimuli was an important factor for predicting within-modal behavior, but the orientation of shapes compared across modality did not depend on knowing the presented orientation. We also found that the metrics which best predict shape comparison behavior heavily depended on the modality of the two shapes. We take these results as evidence that object recognition is not necessarily performed in a single, modality-agnostic region.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human orbitofrontal cortex signals decision outcomes to sensory cortex during behavioural adaptations</a></h4>

              
                The ability to respond adaptively to an ever-changing environment relies on the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The OFC sends neuroanatomical projections to the primary sensory cortex - yet the contribution of this top-down feedback projection to behavioural flexibility in humans is unknown. Inspired from recent rodent studies, we here combined a probabilistic Go/No-Go tactile reversal learning task with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in human participants to investigate how OFC interacts with the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) to promote flexible decision-making. We show a distinct task-dependent engagement of S1 and lateral OFC: while the lateral OFC responds saliently and transiently to rule-switches, activity in S1 reflects initial task learning and persistent engagement after each rule-switch event. Unlike the contralateral S1, which represents the sensory input, activity in ipsilateral S1 mirrors the outcome value during re-learning. Importantly, the implementation of this outcome-selectivity in ipsilateral S1 is dependent on top-down 'teaching' signals from lateral OFC. Overall, as in mice, we show comparable physiological and computational signatures of how dynamic interactions between OFC and sensory cortex support flexible decision-making in humans.

                The neurotransmitter dopamine plays an important role in the processing of emotional memories, and prior research suggests that dopaminergic manipulations immediately after fear learning can affect the retention and generalization of acquired fear. The current study focuses specifically on the role of dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs) in differential fear responding in male Wistar rats. In a series of five experiments, D2R dopaminergic drugs were injected systemically after differential cued fear conditioning. One day later, the differential expression of acquired fear was assessed. All five experiments involved the administration of the D2R agonist quinpirole at different doses or saline (n = 12, 16 or 44 rats/treatment condition). Additionally, one of the studies administered the D2R antagonist raclopride (n = 12 rats/treatment condition). We found no indications for an effect of quinpirole or raclopride on differential fear responding during a later drug-free test. In addition, there were no effects of treatment on baseline freezing levels (i.e., before tone onset) or freezing during the conditioned tones (CS+) at test. We did observe acute behavioral effects of both drugs on a locomotor activity test.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Scratching bouts are modeled as Bernoulli trials until successful itch-extinguishing in mice</a></h4>

              
                Itching and subsequent scratching behavior have been observed in many species, including humans. The behavior was evolved to remove skin parasites. Yet, scratching is performed without reliable indicators of whether a parasite is present. We addressed this apparent paradox by studying scratching in mice. Video recordings of ~5000 scratching bouts were collected in free-moving C57BL6/J mice. The statistical properties of their temporal sequence were analyzed. Inter-bout time intervals preceding over 50% of 5000 bouts were <10 s. We hypothesized that episodes of repetitive scratching corresponded to the duration of discrete events of itch sensation and comprised bouts separated by inter-bout intervals of <10 s. The distribution of itch episodes comprising n (n = 1, 2, 3, ...) scratching bouts was well-approximated by the geometric distribution with success probability = 0.5 in healthy mice and lower probability in dry skin mice. This suggests that scratching bouts are modeled by probabilistic Bernoulli trials, and their repetitive sequence in each episode continues until the itch is successfully extinguished. Accordingly, we can presume the presence of parasites from the repeat length of scratching bouts determined by the probability of successful itch-extinguishing. This may provide a promising stochastic model to assess itchy phenotypes.

                Characterization of brain infarct lesion in rodent models of stroke is crucial to assess the outcome of stroke therapies and to study the disease pathophysiology. However, so far it has been mostly performed by: 1) histological methods, a time-consuming process that lead to significant flaws and tissue distortion; or 2) via MRI imaging, which is faster, yielding 3D information but at high costs. High-resolution micro-CT imaging became, in the last decade, a simple, fast, and cheaper solution, allowing 3D analysis of samples. Here, we describe that high-resolution micro-CT, either using iodine/OsO4 as contrast agents, can be successfully applied for fine quantification and localization of lesion size and edema volume in preclinical stroke models. We successfully correlated this new approach with the standard histological method TTC. In transient MCAO mouse stroke model, we were able to identify/quantify large lesioned areas (segmented in core and penumbra), up to degenerated finer striatal myelinated fibers in a transient ischemic attack (TIA) mouse model, at different timepoints post-ischemia, through manual and automatic segmentation approaches (deep learning). Furthermore, 3D reconstructions of the whole brain allow for brain atlas co-registration of the specific affected brain areas. Hence, the presented methodology, through iodine/OsO4 micro-CT imaging, constitutes a valuable advance in tools for precise and detailed assessment of stroke outcomes in preclinical animal studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sensory target detection at local and global time scales dissociates modality-specific and supramodal dynamics in the cortical hierarchy</a></h4>

              
                Much debate revolves around how the cortex integrates information from different sensory modalities to generate predictions about sensory events. The classic perspective that multisensory processes are organised along a hierarchy from strictly modality-specific to supramodal processes has been challenged by evidence suggesting that the cortex is multisensory at all levels. Here we examined whether responses to sensory expectation violations which require the integration of inputs from different sensory modalities rely on early or late cortical functions. To that end, we designed a crossmodal hierarchical oddball paradigm in which expectations about sensory inputs were generated and violated in different sensory modalities at two nested hierarchical levels. We investigated whether there are shared cortical signatures between the crossmodal effect and either lower-order unimodal local responses or higher-order global responses to sensory surprise thought to be modality-independent. A temporal decoding analysis revealed that crossmodal effects unfold at different stages of the cortical hierarchy. Using temporal decoding, we found that the crossmodal effect shared cortical dynamics with its unimodal counterpart but not with global responses to sensory expectation violations. Beyond shared dynamics, we also demonstrate that cross- and unimodal prediction violations modulate common connections in a network with interconnected modality-specific early and late frontal regions.

                The cochlea of the mammalian inner ear includes an active, hydromechanical amplifier thought to arise via the piezoelectric action of the outer hair cells (OHCs). A classic problem of cochlear biophysics is that the long resistance-capacitance (RC) time constant of the hair-cell membrane produces an effective cut-off frequency much lower than that of most audible sounds. The long RC time constant implies that the OHC receptor potential--and hence its electromotile response--decreases by several orders of magnitude over the frequency range of hearing. This 'RC problem' is often invoked to question the role of cycle-by-cycle OHC-based amplification in mammalian hearing. Here, we use published data and simple physical reasoning to show that the RC problem is, in practice, a relatively minor physical issue whose importance has been unduly magnified by viewing it through the wrong lens. Indeed, our analysis indicates that the long RC time constant is actually beneficial for hearing, reducing noise and distortion while increasing the fidelity of cochlear amplification.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel rhesus macaque model of Huntington's disease recapitulates key neuropathological changes along with progressive motor and cognitive decline</a></h4>

              
                We created a new nonhuman primate model of the genetic neurodegenerative disorder, Huntington's disease (HD), by injecting a mixture of recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors, serotypes AAV2 and AAV2.retro, each expressing a fragment of human mutant HTT (mHTT) into the caudate and putamen of adult rhesus macaques. This novel modeling strategy results in robust expression of mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) in the injected brain regions, as well as dozens of other cortical and subcortical brain regions that are also affected in human HD patients. We queried the disruption of cortico-basal ganglia circuitry for 20-months post-surgery using a variety of behavioral and imaging readouts. Compared to controls, mHTT-treated macaques developed progressive working memory decline and motor impairment. Multimodal imaging revealed circuit-wide white and gray matter degenerative processes in several key brain regions affected in HD. This novel model will aid in the development of disease biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for this devastating disorder.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel hidden Markov approach to studying dynamic functional connectivity states in human neuroimaging</a></h4>

              
                How can we better understand the underlying neural mechanisms of brain dynamics? Many groups have examined brain states as a means of identifying recurring patterns of activity or connectivity. Although there is an abundance of methods of establishing and interpreting brain states, hidden Markov models are becoming an increasingly popular choice to extract recurring patterns of intensity or connectivity in neuroimaging data. These models not only recognize spatial patterns of brain states, but also ascertain their temporal progression. An assortment of hidden Markov model instantiations has arisen for diverse purposes, and these have been applied to a variety of neuroimaging datasets. However, most of these instantiations have focused on intensity-based states, i.e. states defined by the activity levels of one or more nodes, rather than connectivity-based states, i.e. states defined by patterns of functional connectivity between nodes. The intensity-based approach is problematic if we want to understand connectivity dynamics, since there is no reason to believe that the resultant states can provide any useful information about dynamic connectivity patterns. Here we aimed to remedy this methodological challenge by introducing a new hidden Markov model approach based on identifying states defined as full functional connectivity profiles among brain regions, and applying this approach to directly extract connectivity-based states in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We then empirically explore the behavior of this new model in comparison to existing approaches based on intensity-based states and summed functional connectivity states, utilizing the widely-available HCP unrelated 100 functional magnetic resonance imaging "resting state" dataset. Results show that our newly-introduced 'full functional connectivity' model discovered connectivity states with more distinguishable patterns than those derived from previously-employed approaches, and demonstrated clear superiority in recovering simulated connectivity-based states. These findings suggest that if our goal is to extract and interpret connectivity states in neuroimaging data, our new model can reveal more insights than previous methods, and intensity-based or summed functional connectivity-based approaches miss crucial information about the evolution of functional connectivity in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Poor matching of action codes challenges 'mirroring' in macaque F5 mirror neurons</a></h4>

              
                The discharge of F5 mirror neurons of a monkey observing another individual performing an action has been interpreted as a motor representation, stimulated by sensory input, ultimately serving action understanding. This hypothesis requires mirror neurons to exhibit an action tuning that is matched between action observation and execution. However, the evidence for this is insufficient, mainly because previous work has suffered from a limited exploration of action space tuning and an object vs. action vision confound. To overcome these limitations, we conducted an experiment in which identical objects had to be manipulated in three different ways in order to serve distinct action goals. We show that the population of F5 mirror neurons can dissociate the three actions almost perfectly, during both observation and execution. However, the population code for action execution was only poorly matched to the code for observation. Just a few neurons exhibited only matched codes, yet, always confined to short, varying segments of the overall action. These findings challenge the hypothesis that an observer understands the actions of others by the activation of motor representations of the observed actions. Rather they support the alternative notion that F5 might use information on observed actions to select behavioral responses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gamma Oscillations and Emotional Memory</a></h4>

              
                Increased visual gamma band activity is known to relate to memory and encoding in cognitive tasks and has been shown to be present during arousing compared to neutral stimulus processing. Here, we set out to investigate whether gamma activity is stronger for later remembered compared to later forgotten emotional pictures. Thirty-two healthy participants underwent a passive viewing task in which they viewed 208 (104 arousing (52 pleasant and 52 unpleasant) and 104 neutral) pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) database while we simultaneously recorded their electroencephalogram (EEG). Immediately after, they performed a recognition task including the 208 target pictures they saw before and 104 new pictures (52 arousing (26 pleasant and 26 unpleasant) and 52 neutral) as lures. We found that arousing pictures (unpleasant ones in particular) were better remembered compared to neutral pictures. Importantly, gamma activity was enhanced for remembered compared to forgotten pictures and this effect was stronger for arousing pictures. We conclude that previous findings regarding enhanced gamma as a signature of subsequent memory generalizes to emotional memory. Our findings therefore shed new light on the role of visual gamma band activity in arousal and memory formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Musical expertise shapes visual-melodic memory integration</a></h4>

              
                Music can act as a powerful mnemonic device that can elicit vivid episodic memories. However, how musical information is integrated with non-musical information is largely unknown. Here, we investigated whether and how musical expertise modulates binding of melodies and visual information into integrated memory representations. We reasoned that the significant mnemonic demands of musicianship might alter the underlying integration process and reveal mechanisms by which music promotes retrieval of non-musical memories. Professional musicians and musical laypersons learned overlapping pairs of everyday objects and melodies (AB- and BC-pairs, object-melody and melody-object pairs). Participants were then tested for memory of studied pairs (direct trials) and for inferential AC-decisions (indirect trials). Although musicians showed a higher overall performance than non-musicians, both groups performed well above chance level in both trial types. Non-musicians reacted faster in indirect compared to direct trials, whereas the reverse pattern was found in musicians. Differential correlations of trial type performance between groups further suggested that non-musicians efficiently formed integrated ABC-triplets already during the encoding phase of the task, while musicians separately memorized AB- and BC-pairs and recombined them at retrieval for AC-decisions. Our results suggest that integrative encoding is a default mechanism for integration of musical and non-musical stimuli that works with great efficacy even in musically untrained subjects and may contribute to the everyday experience of music-evoked episodic memories. By contrast, recombination at retrieval seems to be an advanced strategy for memory integration that critically depends on an expert ability to maintain and discriminate musical stimuli across extended memory delays.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Constitutively active STING causes neuroinflammation and degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in mice</a></h4>

              
                The innate immune system can protect against certain aspects of neurodegenerative diseases, but also contribute to disease progression. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is activated after detection of cytoplasmic dsDNA by cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase) as part of the defense against viral pathogens, activating type I interferon and NF-kB/inflammasome signaling. In order to specifically test the relevance of this pathway for the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease, we studied a mouse model with heterozygous expression of the constitutively active STING variant N153S. In adult mice expressing N153S STING, the number of dopaminergic neurons was smaller than in controls, as was the density of dopaminergic axon terminals and the concentration of dopamine in the striatum. We also observed alpha-synuclein pathology and a lower density of synaptic puncta. Neuroinflammation was quantified by staining astroglia and microglia, by measuring mRNAs, proteins and nuclear translocation of transcription factors. Neuroinflammatory markers were already elevated in juvenile mice, thus preceding the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Inflammation and neurodegeneration were blunted in mice deficient for signaling by type I interferons or inflammasomes, but not suppressed completely. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that chronic activation of the STING innate immunity pathway is sufficient to cause degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. This pathway could be targeted therapeutically.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Heroin Self-Administration Induces Altered Dopamine Terminal Dynamics in the Nucleus Accumbens</a></h4>

              
                Administration of heroin results in the engagement of multiple brain regions and the rewarding and addictive effects are mediated, at least partially, through activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system. However, less is known about dopamine system function following chronic exposure to heroin. Withdrawal from chronic heroin exposure is likely to drive a state of low dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), as previously observed during withdrawal from other drug classes. Thus, we aimed to investigate alterations in NAc dopamine terminal function following chronic heroin self-administration to identify a mechanism for dopaminergic adaptations. Adult male Long Evans rats were trained to self-administer heroin (0.05 mg/kg/inf, IV) and then placed on a long access (FR1, 6-hrs, unlimited inf, 0.05 mg/kg/inf) protocol to induce escalation of intake. After one day of withdrawal, male rats exhibited lower basal extracellular levels of dopamine as well as reduced dopaminergic responses to a heroin challenge (0.1 mg/kg/inf, IV). Following heroin self-administration, rats had decreased basal extracellular levels of dopamine and blunted dopamine response following a heroin challenge (0.1 mg/kg/inf, IV) in the NAc compared to saline controls. FSCV revealed that heroin-exposed rats have reduced stimulated dopamine release during tonic-like, single-pulse stimulations but increased phasic-like dopamine release during multi-pulse stimulation trains (5 pulses, 5-100Hz) in addition to an altered dynamic range of release stimulation intensities when compared to controls. Further, we found that presynaptic D3 autoreceptor and kappa-opioid receptor activity was increased following heroin self-administration. These results reveal a marked low dopamine state following heroin-exposure and suggest the combination of altered dopamine release dynamics may contribute to increased heroin seeking.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Movement characteristics impact decision-making and vice versa</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies suggest that humans are capable of coregulating the speed of decisions and movements if promoted by task incentives. It is unclear however whether such behavior is inherent to the process of translating decisional information into movements, beyond posing a valid strategy in some task contexts. Therefore, in a behavioral online study we imposed time constraints to either decision or movement -phases of a sensorimotor task, ensuring that coregulating decisions and movements was not promoted by task incentives. We found that participants indeed moved faster when fast decisions were promoted and decided faster when subsequent movements had to be executed swiftly. Furthermore, inflicting faster movements seems to alter decision-making in a similar fashion as conditions promoting faster decisions: In both fast-decision and fast-movement blocks, decisions relied more strongly on information presented shortly rather than long before movement onset. Taken together, these findings suggest that decisions not only impact movement characteristics, but that properties of movement impact the time and manner with which decisions are made. We interpret these behavioral results in the context of embodied decision-making, whereby shared neural mechanisms may not only enable faster movements but also assist in making decisions in less time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural mechanism of acute stress management by trace aminergic signalling in the lateral habenula</a></h4>

              
                Stress management is a prerequisite for the survival of vertebrates because chronic stress may cause depression and is known to negatively modulate the dopaminergic reward system. Enhanced excitability of neurons in the lateral habenula (LHb) induced by chronic stress is essential for silencing dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) via GABAergic neurons in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg). However, the effect of acute stress on the LHb-RMTg-VTA pathway is unknown. Here, we show that both aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC)-expressing neurons (D-neurons) in the LHb and dopaminergic neurons in the VTA are activated by acute stress, whereas GABAergic neurons in the RMTg are not. Selective stimulation of LHb D-neurons and AADC knockdown of these neurons reverse-regulate the RMTg-VTA pathway. Circuit tracing and electrophysiology data demonstrate that trace aminergic signalling by LHb D-neurons directly suppresses RMTg GABAergic neurons. Furthermore, local activation of trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1; a trace amine receptor) in the RMTg is sufficient to rescue the despair-like behaviour produced by the loss of AADC expression. Our results identify a novel efferent pathway from the LHb to the RMTg whereby trace aminergic signalling allows the brain to manage acute stress by preventing VTA dopaminergic neuron hypoactivity. The TAAR1-mediated trace aminergic signalling in the LHb-RMTg pathway may hold promise as a therapeutic target for stress-mediated psychological diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Graph theoretical analysis reveals the adaptive role of the left ventral occipito-temporal cortex in the brain networks during speech processing</a></h4>

              
                The left ventral occipito-temporal cortex (left-vOT) plays a key role in reading. Several studies have also reported its activation during speech processing, suggesting that it may play a role beyond written word recognition. Here, we adopt a graph theoretical analysis to investigate the functional role of this area in the whole-brain network while participants processed spoken sentences in different tasks. We find that its role and interactions with other areas changes in an adaptive manner. In a low-level speech perception task, the left-vOT is part of the visual network and acts as a connector that supports the communication with other cognitive systems. When speech comprehension is required, the area becomes a connector within the sensorimotor-auditory network typically recruited during speech processing. However, when comprehension is compromised due to degradation of speech input, the area disengages from the sensorimotor-auditory network. It becomes part of the visual network again and turns from connector into a simple peripheral node. These varying connectivity patterns are coherent with the Interactive Account considering the left-vOT as a convergent zone with multiple functions and interaction patterns that depend on task demands and the nature of sensory input.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modulation of stress-related behaviour by hypothalamic engagement of preproglucagon neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract</a></h4>

              
                Stress-induced behaviours are driven by complex neural circuits and some neuronal populations concurrently modulate diverse behavioural and physiological responses to stress. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1)-producing preproglucagon (PPG) neurons within the lower brainstem caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTS) are particularly sensitive to stressful stimuli and are implicated in multiple physiological and behavioural responses to interoceptive and psychogenic threats. However, the afferent inputs driving stress-induced activation of PPG neurons are largely unknown, and the role of PPG neurons in anxiety-like behaviour is controversial. Through chemogenetic manipulations we reveal that cNTS PPG neurons have the ability to moderately increase anxiety-like behaviours in mice in a sex-dependent manner. Using an intersectional approach, we show that a corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-rich input from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) drives activation of both the cNTS as a whole and PPG neurons in particular in response to acute stress. Finally, we demonstrate that NTS-projecting PVN neurons are necessary for the ability of acute stress to suppress food intake. Our findings reveal sex differences in behavioural responses to PPG neural activation and highlight a hypothalamic-brainstem pathway in stress-induced hypophagia.

	<p>Emerging research on psychological adjustment during the COVID-19 outbreak has suggested that young people may be particularly vulnerable to increases in negative affect during the pandemic. However, the association between alcohol use in youth and change in negative affect during this unprecedented time is not clear. Using an online survey, this study obtained scores on negative affect (before and during the COVID-19 pandemic), pandemic-related stress, change in drinking frequency, and traits including resilience, impulsivity and anhedonia, from a sample of drinkers and non-drinkers, up to the age of 21. Young drinkers experienced a greater increase in negative affect during the pandemic compared to non-drinkers, and this differential rise in negative affect was mediated by the pandemic-related stress of social isolation. Young drinkers also experienced a decrease in alcohol use during the pandemic, but this was not associated with a change in negative affect. Interestingly, young drinkers with greater resilience and lower anhedonia reported less increase in negative affect during the COVID-19 pandemic. Taken together, these results show that the greater increase in negative affect that young drinkers experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to their non-drinking counterparts, was mediated by pandemic-related social isolation. Moreover, greater resilience and lower anhedonia may have served as protective factors for mitigating the social isolation-induced worsening of negative affect in young drinkers during the pandemic. These findings may inform future studies investigating potential indicators of maladaptive affective responses to public health crises in vulnerable adolescent populations.</p>

	<p>Cat-scratch disease is an illness caused by Bartonella henselae that occurs as a result of contact with an infected kitten or dog, such as a bite or scratch. It is more prevalent in children and young adults, as well as immunocompromised individuals. There are limited publications examining the features of CSD in patients. As such, the purpose of this research was to assess the clinical neuro-ophthalmological consequences of CSD reported in the literature. Among the ophthalmologic disorders caused by cat-scratch disease in humans, Parinaud oculoglandular syndrome, uveitis, vitritis, retinitis, retinochoroiditis and optic neuritis are the most prevalent. The neurological disorders caused by cat-scratch disease in humans include encephalopathy, transverse myelitis, radiculitis, and cerebellar ataxia. The current review addresses the neuro-ophthalmological clinical manifestations of cat-scratch disease, as described in papers published over the last four decades (1980&amp;amp;ndash;2022). All the data gathered were obtained from PubMed, Medline and Google Scholar. The current descriptive review summarizes the most-often-encountered clinical symptomatology in instances of cat-scratch disease with neurological and ocular invasion. Thus, the purpose of this review is to increase knowledge of cat-scratch disease&amp;amp;rsquo;s neuro-ophthalmological manifestations.</p>

	<p>Focused ultrasound is a promising therapeutic technique, as it involves the focusing of an ultrasonic beam with sufficient acoustic energy into a target brain region with high precision. Low-intensity ultrasound transmission by a single-element transducer is mostly established for neuromodulation applications and blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier disruption for drug delivery. However, transducer positioning errors can occur without fine control over the sonication, which can affect repeatability and lead to reliability problems. The objective of this study was to determine whether the target brain region would be stable under small displacement (0.5 mm) of the transducer based on numerical simulations. Computed-tomography-derived three-dimensional models of a rat head were constructed to investigate the effects of transducer displacement in the caudate putamen (CP) and thalamus (TH). Using three different frequencies (1.1, 0.69, and 0.25 MHz), the transducer was displaced by 0.5 mm in each of the following six directions: superior, interior, anterior, posterior, left, and right. The maximum value of the intracranial pressure field was calculated, and the targeting errors were determined by the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) overlap between the free water space (FWHMwater) and transcranial transmission (FWHMbase). When the transducer was positioned directly above the target region, a clear distinction between the target regions was observed, resulting in 88.3%, 81.5%, and 84.5% FWHMwater for the CP and 65.6%, 76.3%, and 64.4% FWHMwater for the TH at 1.1, 0.69, and 0.25 MHz, respectively. Small transducer displacements induced both enhancement and reduction of the peak pressure and targeting errors, compared with when the transducer was displaced in water. Small transducer displacement to the left resulted in the lowest stability, with 34.8% and 55.0% targeting accuracy (FWHMwater) at 1.1 and 0.69 MHz in the TH, respectively. In addition, the maximum pressure was reduced by up to 11% by the transducer displacement. This work provides the targeting errors induced by transducer displacements through a preclinical study and recommends that attention be paid to determining the initial sonication foci in the transverse plane in the cases of small animals.</p>

	<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients receiving natalizumab and who are at risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) often switch to other high-efficacy disease-modifying therapies including fingolimod as a risk mitigation strategy, which could impact treatment safety and effectiveness. The TRANSITION study aimed to evaluate the safety of fingolimod over two years in patients with MS after switching from natalizumab in a real-world setting. The safety and effectiveness were assessed by monitoring serious and other adverse events (SAEs, AEs). We assessed effectiveness by recording relapses, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores, and MRI activity. Of 637 patients enrolled, 505 completed the study (mean age, 42 years). Overall, 72.8% and 12.7% experienced AEs and SAEs respectively. The most common AEs were fatigue, headache, and urinary tract infection; no cases of PML were observed. Fingolimod treatment resulted in low disease activity. Patients with &amp;amp;le;8 weeks washout period had a markedly lower risk of relapses (4.5%) than those with &amp;amp;gt;8 weeks (51.4%). In patients switching from natalizumab to fingolimod, no new safety signals with overall low relapse activity were observed in patients with washout latencies of &amp;amp;le;8 weeks before fingolimod initiation. Fingolimod was found to be safe and effective in patients transitioning from natalizumab.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The action of acetylcholine in the cortex is critical for cognitive functions and cholinergic drugs can improve functions such as attention and working memory. An alternative means of enhancing cholinergic neuromodulation in primates is the intermittent electrical stimulation of the cortical source of acetylcholine, the nucleus basalis (NB) of Meynert. NB stimulation generally increases firing rate of neurons in the prefrontal cortex, however its effects on single neurons are diverse and complex. We sought to understand how NB stimulation affects global measures of neural activity by recording and analyzing local field potentials (LFPs) in monkeys as they performed working memory tasks. NB stimulation primarily decreased power in the alpha frequency range during the delay interval of working memory tasks. The effect was consistent across variants of the task. No consistent modulation in the delay interval of the task was observed in the gamma frequency range, which has previously been implicated in the maintenance of working memory. Our results reveal global effects of cholinergic neuromodulation via deep brain stimulation, an emerging intervention for the improvement of cognitive function.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Approximately 1 in 36 children are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The disorder is four times more common in males than in females. Zinc deficiency and mutations in <i>SHANK2</i> and <i>SHANK3</i> (members of a family of excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding proteins) are all risk factors that may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease. The presence of shankopathies (loss of one copy of the <i>SHANK3</i> gene) can lead to the development of Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMDS)—a rare genetic disorder characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, poor motor tone, and ASD-like symptoms. We reviewed the relationship between zinc, ASD, and PMDS as well as the effect of zinc supplementation in improving symptoms of ASD and PMDS based on 22 studies published within 6 years (2015–2020). Zinc deficiency (assessed by either dietary intake, blood, hair, or tooth matrix) was shown to be highly prevalent in ASD and PMDS patients as well as in preclinical models of ASD and PMDS. Zinc supplements improved the behavioral deficits in animal models of ASD and PMDS. Clinical trials are still needed to validate the beneficial therapeutic effects of zinc supplements in ASD and PMDS patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prospective cohort study of the predictive value of inflammatory biomarkers over clinical variables in children and young people with cancer presenting with fever and neutropenia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Fever during chemotherapy induced neutropenia is a common and potentially life-threatening complication of the treatment of childhood cancer. Predictions of poor outcome could be enhanced by incorporating serum biomarkers of inflammation at presentation and reassessment. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted of children under 18 years old, being treated for cancer or a cancer-like condition, who presented with fever (≥ 38.0°C) and neutropenia (neutrophil count < 0.5*109/L). Clinical features were recorded, along with three experimental inflammatory biomarkers: procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8). Outcomes included serious medical complications (SMC): any infection related mortality, critical care and organ support, severe sepsis, septic shock, significant microbiologically defined infection, or radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Results Biomarker assessments were undertaken in 43 episodes of fever and neutropenia, from 31 patients aged between four months and 17 years old (median six years): 20 were female and 22 had acute leukaemia. Five episodes of SMC were noted. PCT, IL-6 and IL-8 had poor individual discriminatory ability (C-statistic 0.48 to 0.60) and did not add to the value of clinical risk stratification tools. Insufficient data were collected to formally assess the value of repeated assessments. Conclusions Incorporating serum biomarkers of inflammation at presentation of episodes of fever with neutropenia in childhood does not clearly improve risk stratification. The value of serial assessments requires further investigation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Corporate governance and shareholders’ confidence in cooperative corporations: a systematic literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The confidence of Bottom 40 (B40) shareholders is crucial for cooperative corporation’s sustenance within wider corporate governance. An in-depth study on cooperatives is needed, as they play a crucial role in the Malaysian economic system and contribute greatly to the country’s social development. However, in the current landscape, confidence among shareholders is at stake. This study aims to identify the research gap into corporate governance for cooperative corporations  in relation to B40 shareholder confidence, as well as identify current study challenges and develop a conceptual framework for future research. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review, with the use of agency theory to assess shareholders’ confidence. Emerald, ProQuest, InderScience, Scopus and Science Direct were the online databases used in this study to search  five  keyword phrases: corporate governance, confidence, cooperative, agency theory and Bottom 40% (B40) household. Tranfield’s five stages were used to conduct the systematic review. Results: Only 5 of the 324 studies assess shareholders’ confidence in cooperatives, as well as one paper on B40 and two papers on agency theory. Our review presents three major findings. First, research in the context of B40 shareholder’s confidence in cooperative corporations  is limited. Second, the challenges related to shareholders’ confidence in B40 are major issues in the context. Third, research on agency theory in the context of shareholders’ confidence within cooperative corporations and corporate governance is still scant. Conclusions: This review urges the research community to conduct more studies based on the highlighted research gaps.

                Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to have immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and angiogenesis effects that are useful for relieving inflammation, recovery, and protection of lung tissues in COVID-19 patients. Secretome, a secretory product of MSCs, has several advantages over MSCs. We conducted a study to investigate secretomes’ effectiveness and safety profile as a treatment for severe COVID-19.  Methods: A double-blind, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted between February 2021 and July 2021 in three top COVID-19 referral hospitals in the Greater Jakarta area, Indonesia. Eligible subjects (n=40) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to an intervention group (n=20) and a control group (n=20). The primary outcome of this study was the changes in inflammatory markers and the ratio of inflammatory to anti-inflammatory markers. The secondary outcomes of this study included clinical outcome, laboratory outcome, radiological outcome, RT-PCR result conversion, and safety profile of MSC secretome. Results: Our analysis showed that on the 14th day after placebo administration, IL-6 level in the control group was significantly increased [4.110 (2.403–12.820) at baseline to 13.320 (2.958–33.285) on the 14th day after intervention, p=0.017]. The IL-6/IL-10 ratio in the control group was significantly increased (p=0.036) on the 14th day after placebo administration. We also found that most of the subjects who received placebo had high levels of IL-6 and ferritin (p=0.043) on the seventh day after the intervention. However, we found no significant differences in inflammatory marker levels on the seventh day and 14th day after intervention between both groups. There was no adverse event reported. There were no significant differences in the laboratory outcome, radiology outcome, RT-PCR result conversion, and safety profiles between both groups. Conclusions: MSC secretome can control inflammation in patients with severe COVID-19 and has a good safety profile. MSC secretome is a promising treatment modality for severe COVID-19.

                Background: In autoimmune vasculitis, autoantibodies to Human Proteinase 3 (PR3), a human serine protease, seems to have a role on the inception of c-ANCA associated vasculitis. The origin of this autoreactive response remains unclear. However, for several autoreactive responses, molecular mimicry between environmental antigens and human proteins is key to trigger autoantibodies and finally autoimmunity manifestations. Considering that PR3 is a serine protease and house dust mite (HDM) group 3 allergens share this biochemical activity, the aim of this study was to identify cross-reactive epitopes between serine proteases from human and mites using an in silico approach. Methods: Multi alignment among amino acid sequences of PR3 and HDM group 3 allergens was performed to explore identity and structural homology. ElliPro and BepiPred in silico tools were used to predict B and T cell epitopes. Consurf tool was used to conduct identification of conserved regions in serine proteases family. Results: PR3 and HDM group 3 allergens shared moderate identity and structural homology (root mean square deviation < 1). One B cell cross reactive epitope among serine proteases was identified (29I, 30V, 31G, 32G, 34E, 36K, 37A, 38L, 39A and 54C) and two T cell epitopes. Conclusions: PR3 have structural homology and share cross reactive epitopes with HDM group 3 allergens.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Career planning courses increase career readiness of graduate and postdoctoral trainees [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Given national calls for intentional career development during graduate and post-graduate scientific training, this study assessed career readiness development within the context of academic career courses. The current study evaluated the effects of academic career courses offered at two institutions that were specifically designed to increase career awareness, interest, and career-related confidence among doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows. Methods: Participants enrolled in a career course at trainees’ respective academic institutions and responded to pre- and post-course surveys (n=32, n=148). The paper offers a thematic analysis of each of the two courses using an individualized learning plan career development framework and describes the results of their respective pretest-posttest evaluations which indicated increases in career readiness. Results: Though the format and content provided in each course varied, participation was associated with increases in career readiness. Participants reported increased career-awareness including a greater familiarity with different types of careers overall. Furthermore, interest in tenure track faculty careers increased in both samples, which may assuage fears that exposure to diverse career pathways could reduce interest in academic careers. Transferrable skills, including career planning and awareness also significantly increased. Course participants reported an increase in the number and type of mentors they interacted with beyond their principal faculty mentor (other faculty, professional PhDs, peers, and administrative staff). Conclusions: Findings provide supporting evidence for the benefits of implementing structured career development efforts during PhD training; even with varying content, delivery methods, and instructor type, both academic career courses led to significant gains in career awareness and readiness. Successful development and delivery of academic career courses, with a focus on career planning skills, suggest that institutions can utilize these and are an effective way to prepare PhDs for their transition from training positions into careers.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Meta-analysis reveals an extreme “decline effect” in the impacts of ocean acidification on fish behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jeff C. Clements, Josefin Sundin, Timothy D. Clark, Fredrik Jutfelt</p>

Ocean acidification—decreasing oceanic pH resulting from the uptake of excess atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>—has the potential to affect marine life in the future. Among the possible consequences, a series of studies on coral reef fish suggested that the direct effects of acidification on fish behavior may be extreme and have broad ecological ramifications. Recent studies documenting a lack of effect of experimental ocean acidification on fish behavior, however, call this prediction into question. Indeed, the phenomenon of decreasing effect sizes over time is not uncommon and is typically referred to as the “decline effect.” Here, we explore the consistency and robustness of scientific evidence over the past decade regarding direct effects of ocean acidification on fish behavior. Using a systematic review and meta-analysis of 91 studies empirically testing effects of ocean acidification on fish behavior, we provide quantitative evidence that the research to date on this topic is characterized by a decline effect, where large effects in initial studies have all but disappeared in subsequent studies over a decade. The decline effect in this field cannot be explained by 3 likely biological explanations, including increasing proportions of studies examining (1) cold-water species; (2) nonolfactory-associated behaviors; and (3) nonlarval life stages. Furthermore, the vast majority of studies with large effect sizes in this field tend to be characterized by low sample sizes, yet are published in high-impact journals and have a disproportionate influence on the field in terms of citations. We contend that ocean acidification has a negligible direct impact on fish behavior, and we advocate for improved approaches to minimize the potential for a decline effect in future avenues of research.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A feature of maternal sleep apnea during gestation causes autism-relevant neuronal and behavioral phenotypes in offspring</a></h4>

Mounting epidemiologic and scientific evidence indicates that many psychiatric disorders originate from a complex interplay between genetics and early life experiences, particularly in the womb. Despite decades of research, our understanding of the precise prenatal and perinatal experiences that increase susceptibility to neurodevelopmental disorders remains incomplete. Sleep apnea (SA) is increasingly common during pregnancy and is characterized by recurrent partial or complete cessations in breathing during sleep. SA causes pathological drops in blood oxygen levels (intermittent hypoxia, IH), often hundreds of times each night. Although SA is known to cause adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, the long-term consequences of maternal SA during pregnancy on brain-based behavioral outcomes and associated neuronal functioning in the offspring remain unknown. We developed a rat model of maternal SA during pregnancy by exposing dams to IH, a hallmark feature of SA, during gestational days 10 to 21 and investigated the consequences on the offspring’s forebrain synaptic structure, synaptic function, and behavioral phenotypes across multiples stages of development. Our findings represent a rare example of prenatal factors causing sexually dimorphic behavioral phenotypes associated with excessive (rather than reduced) synapse numbers and implicate hyperactivity of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in contributing to the behavioral aberrations. These findings have implications for neuropsychiatric disorders typified by superfluous synapse maintenance that are believed to result, at least in part, from largely unknown insults to the maternal environment.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">People’s desire to be in nature and how they experience it are partially heritable</a></h4>

Nature experiences have been linked to mental and physical health. Despite the importance of understanding what determines individual variation in nature experience, the role of genes has been overlooked. Here, using a twin design (TwinsUK, number of individuals = 2,306), we investigate the genetic and environmental contributions to a person’s nature orientation, opportunity (living in less urbanized areas), and different dimensions of nature experience (frequency and duration of public nature space visits and frequency and duration of garden visits). We estimate moderate heritability of nature orientation (46%) and nature experiences (48% for frequency of public nature space visits, 34% for frequency of garden visits, and 38% for duration of garden visits) and show their genetic components partially overlap. We also find that the environmental influences on nature experiences are moderated by the level of urbanization of the home district. Our study demonstrates genetic contributions to individuals’ nature experiences, opening a new dimension for the study of human–nature interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A cortical network processes auditory error signals during human speech production to maintain fluency</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Muge Ozker, Werner Doyle, Orrin Devinsky, Adeen Flinker</p>

Hearing one’s own voice is critical for fluent speech production as it allows for the detection and correction of vocalization errors in real time. This behavior known as the auditory feedback control of speech is impaired in various neurological disorders ranging from stuttering to aphasia; however, the underlying neural mechanisms are still poorly understood. Computational models of speech motor control suggest that, during speech production, the brain uses an efference copy of the motor command to generate an internal estimate of the speech output. When actual feedback differs from this internal estimate, an error signal is generated to correct the internal estimate and update necessary motor commands to produce intended speech. We were able to localize the auditory error signal using electrocorticographic recordings from neurosurgical participants during a delayed auditory feedback (DAF) paradigm. In this task, participants hear their voice with a time delay as they produced words and sentences (similar to an echo on a conference call), which is well known to disrupt fluency by causing slow and stutter-like speech in humans. We observed a significant response enhancement in auditory cortex that scaled with the duration of feedback delay, indicating an auditory speech error signal. Immediately following auditory cortex, dorsal precentral gyrus (dPreCG), a region that has not been implicated in auditory feedback processing before, exhibited a markedly similar response enhancement, suggesting a tight coupling between the 2 regions. Critically, response enhancement in dPreCG occurred only during articulation of long utterances due to a continuous mismatch between produced speech and reafferent feedback. These results suggest that dPreCG plays an essential role in processing auditory error signals during speech production to maintain fluency.

                Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was firstly identified in China and has been declared a global pandemic. Several serious extrapulmonary manifestations due to SARS-CoV-2 infection have also been reported and associated with hypercoagulability thrombotic vasculopathy. In addition, cases of Mycobacterium-leprae infection have also been known associated with blood coagulation abnormality. Methods: Here, we report a 56-year-old male with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) with concomitant leprosy infection with manifestation of glans penile necrosis, presented to the emergency department with acute penile pain. This case is unique because no occlusion blood flow to the penile was observed in the radiographic imaging. We described the potential pathophysiology in this case through a literature review. Results: The patient received treatment according to the COVID-19 protocol and was given low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) therapy for 4 days. During the follow up, the clinical and functional condition of the penis showed significant improvement. Conclusions: Microthrombus involvement, platelet abnormalities and impaired hemostasis due to SARS-CoV-2 and leprosy co-infection are the hypothesis in this case report.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A STUDY OF CATASTROPHIC HEALTH EXPENDITURES IN INDIA - EVIDENCE FROM NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY DATA: 2014-2018 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Background: India is taking steps to provide Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Out-of-pocket (OOP) health care payment is the most important mechanism for health care payment in India. This study aims to investigate the effect of OOP health care payments on catastrophic health expenditures (CHE). Methods: Data from the National Sample Survey Organization, Social Consumption in Health 2014 and 2018 are used to investigate the effect of OOP health expenditure on household welfare in India. Three aspects of catastrophic expenditure were analyzed in this paper: (i) incidence and intensity of ‘catastrophic’ health expenditure, (ii) socioeconomic inequality in catastrophic health expenditures, and (iii) factors affecting catastrophic health expenditures. Results: The odds of incidence and intensity of CHE were higher for the poorer households. Using the logistic regression model, it was observed that the odds of incidence of CHE was higher among the households with at least one child aged less than 5 years, one elderly person, one secondary educated female member, and if at least one member in the household used a private healthcare facility for treatment. The multiple regression model showed that the intensity of CHE was higher among households with members having chronic illness, and if members had higher duration of stay in the hospital. Subsidizing healthcare to the households having elderly members and children is necessary to reduce CHE. Conclusion: Expanding health insurance coverage, increasing coverage limits, and inclusion of coverage for outpatient and preventive services are vital to protect households. Strengthening public primary health infrastructure and setting up a regulatory organization to establish policies and conduct regular audits to ensure that private hospitals do not increase hospitalizations and the duration of stay is necessary.

                Background: Several systemic diseases manifest themselves in the oral cavity. Oral manifestations of lupus erythematosus (LE) are associated with a significantly increased risk of cancer. Dentists who are unaware of these lesions will possibly miss them. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the prevalence of oral manifestations in patients with LE in a sample of the Egyptian population. Methods: A descriptive study was performed on 189 patients attending the Internal Medicine Department, Rheumatology Clinic in EL Qasr EL Ainy Hospital, Cairo University. Every patient was examined clinically after completing a questionnaire. Moreover, patients’ medical records were also evaluated.  The oral manifestations were recorded according to the WHO guide to physical examination of the oral cavity and classified according to their morphologic aspects and localization. Results: Out of 189 patients, there were 182 females (96.3%) and seven males (3.7%). The prevalence of oral lesions in LE patients was 55.6%. The most affected site was the tongue 25.7%. The most common clinical aspect was patches, 53%. About 77.1% of the lesions were asymptomatic.  Conclusions: The present study emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis of oral lesions to recognize patients with LE as the WHO considers oral manifestations of LE a widespread state. Also, implementation of oral hygiene measures and treatment to improve patients’ nutritional state and health-related quality of life are recommended.

                Diet and nutrition play a fundamental role not only in human body composition and in physiology, but have also relevant effects on mood, mental well-being and cognitive performance. In particular, the preservation of mental well-being through a healthy lifestyle, including a well-balanced diet and, in case, through the intake of specific food supplements, is of particular relevance in the perspective of global human ageing, as the brain is affected significantly by a persistent presence of stress factors. Due to the increasing burden of mental and neurological disorders and to the universality of food as a modifiable risk factor, even limited improvements in nutritional habits may translate to a considerable rise of well-being and mental health in the global population. Moreover, the use of targeted, well-balanced food supplements aiming to support the mental health and well-being will probably represent a relevant tool in future decades, together with an increased awareness of the importance of nutrition, also considering the COVID-19 pandemic and the related stressful events and limitations we are still experiencing at global level. The aim of this review is to summarize the experimental and clinical data reported in the literature concerning the beneficial effects of a subset of micro- and macronutrients contained both in food and in supplements, namely magnesium, folic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and alpha-tocopherol, on a series of disorders, including stress, anxiety, low sleep quality, and low cognitive performance.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Online harassment in Japan: Dissecting the targeting of a female journalist [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Harassment on the Internet, particularly on social media such as Twitter, has reached a level where it can, without exaggeration, be characterised as a real-world societal problem in Japan. However, studies on this phenomenon in the Japanese language environment, especially adopting a victim-centric perspective, are rare. In this paper, we incorporated the concept of online harassment and reviewed existing studies about online harassment from Japan and abroad. We then conducted a detailed case analysis of the “flaming” of a female journalist and those who targeted her on Twitter. Based on our analysis, we observed that there were three layers of users who targeted the journalist: influencers, users who responded to the instigation by influencers, and trolls. Each harassed the journalist, but in a different manner. Given Japan’s particular difficulty of imposing domestic regulations on social media companies that are mostly from abroad, we propose and describe possible measures that individuals and their employers should consider taking.

                Using structure-guided design, the authors develop second-generation ChroME-based cation channel rhodopsins that exhibit extremely high potency while preserving fast kinetics, thereby expanding the optogenetic toolbox. ChroME2.0 opsins permit spatially and temporally precise two-photon holographic neural control at unprecedented scales, a key technological step forward for understanding brain circuits and behavior.

                Somatostatin-expressing entopedunculus projections to the lateral habenula release glutamate and GABA. Using mathematical simulations and new electrophysiological approaches, Kim et al. show that both neurotransmitters are packaged into the same synaptic vesicles. Inhibitors of release, such as serotonin, affect both transmitters by reducing probability of release of these co-packaged vesicles.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Predictive coding of natural images by V1 firing rates and rhythmic synchronization</a></h4>

              
                Uran, Peter et al. use self-supervised neural networks to quantify stimulus predictability in natural images to investigate the context-dependence of V1 signals. Firing rates decrease with the predictability, specifically of high-level image features. By contrast, γ-synchronization increases with the predictability of low-level features and emerges for low-dimensional, strongly compressible images.

                The primary motor cortex (M1) is known to be a critical site for movement initiation and motor learning. Surprisingly, it has also been shown to possess reward-related activity, presumably to facilitate reward-based learning of new movements. However, whether reward-related signals are represented among different cell types in M1, and whether their response properties change after cue-reward conditioning remains unclear. Here, we performed longitudinal <i>in vivo</i> two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to monitor the activity of different neuronal cell types in M1 while mice engaged in a classical conditioning task. Our results demonstrate that most of the major neuronal cell types in M1 showed robust but differential responses to both the conditioned cue stimulus (CS) and reward, and their response properties undergo cell-type specific modifications after associative learning. PV-INs' responses became more reliable to the CS, while VIP-INs' responses became more reliable to reward. PNs only showed robust responses to novel reward, and they habituated to it after associative learning. Lastly, SOM-INs' responses emerged and became more reliable to both the CS and reward after conditioning. These observations suggest that cue- and reward-related signals are preferentially represented among different neuronal cell types in M1, and the distinct modifications they undergo during associative learning could be essential in triggering different aspects of local circuit reorganization in M1 during reward-based motor skill learning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Overriding impaired FPR chemotaxis signaling in diabetic neutrophil stimulates infection control in murine diabetic wound</a></h4>

              
                Infection is a major co-morbidity that contributes to impaired healing in diabetic wounds. Although impairments in diabetic neutrophils have been blamed for this co-morbidity, what causes these impairments and whether they can be overcome, remain largely unclear. Diabetic neutrophils, isolated from diabetic individuals, exhibit chemotaxis impairment but this peculiar functional impairment has been largely ignored because it appears to contradict the clinical findings which blame excessive neutrophil influx as a major impediment to healing in chronic diabetic ulcers. Here, we report that exposure to glucose in diabetic range results in impaired chemotaxis signaling through the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) in neutrophils, culminating in reduced chemotaxis and delayed neutrophil trafficking in the wound of <i>Lepr<sup>db</sup></i> (db/db) type 2 diabetic mice, rendering diabetic wound vulnerable to infection. We further show that at least some auxiliary receptors remain functional under diabetic conditions and their engagement by the pro-inflammatory cytokine CCL3, overrides the requirement for FPR signaling and substantially improves infection control by jumpstarting the neutrophil trafficking toward infection, and stimulates healing in diabetic wound. We posit that CCL3 may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers if it is applied topically after the surgical debridement process which is intended to reset chronic ulcers into acute fresh wounds.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Functional visualization of NK Cell-mediated killing of metastatic single tumor cells</a></h4>

              
                Natural killer (NK) cells lyse invading tumor cells to limit metastatic growth in the lung, but how some cancers evade this host protective mechanism to establish a growing lesion is unknown. Here we have combined ultra-sensitive bioluminescence imaging with intravital two-photon microscopy involving genetically-encoded biosensors to examine this question. NK cells eliminated disseminated tumor cells from the lung within 24 hrs of arrival, but not thereafter. Intravital dynamic imaging revealed that 50% of NK-tumor cell encounters lead to tumor cell death in the first 4 hrs after tumor cell arrival, but after 24 hrs of arrival, nearly 100% of the interactions result in the survival of the tumor cell. During this 24 hrs period, the probability of ERK activation in NK cells upon encountering the tumor cells was decreased from 68% to 8%, which correlated with the loss of the activating ligand CD155/PVR/Necl5 from the tumor cell surface. Thus, by quantitatively visualizing the NK-tumor cell interaction at the early stage of metastasis, we have revealed the crucial parameters of NK cell immune surveillance in the lung.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Zinc finger protein Zfp335 controls early T cell development and survival through β-selection-dependent and -independent mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                T cell development in the thymus undergoes the process of differentiation, selective proliferation and survival from CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup> double negative (DN) stage to CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double positive (DP) stage prior to the formation of CD4<sup>+</sup> helper and CD8<sup>+</sup> cytolytic T cells ready for circulation. Each developmental stage is tightly regulated by sequentially-operating molecular networks, of which only limited numbers of transcription regulators have been deciphered. Here we identified Zfp335 transcription factor as a new player in the regulatory network controlling thymocyte development in mice. We demonstrate that <i>Zfp335</i> intrinsically controls DN to DP transition, as T cell-specific deficiency in <i>Zfp335</i> leads to a substantial accumulation of DN3 along with reduction of DP, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> thymocytes. This developmental blockade at DN stage results from the impaired intracellular TCRβ expression as well as increased susceptibility to apoptosis in thymocytes. Transcriptomic and ChIP-seq analyses revealed a direct regulation of transcription factors <i>Bcl6</i> and <i>Rorcβ</i> by Zfp335. Importantly, enhanced expression of TCRβ and <i>Bcl6/Rorc</i> restores the developmental defect during DN3 to DN4 transition and improves thymocytes survival, respectively. These findings identify a critical role of <i>Zfp335</i> in controlling T cell development by maintaining intracellular TCRβ expression-mediated β-selection and independently activating cell survival signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mapping dopaminergic projections in the human brain with resting-state fMRI</a></h4>

              
                The striatum receives dense dopaminergic projections making it a key region of the dopaminergic system. Its dysfunction has been implicated in various conditions including Parkinson's disease (PD) and substance use disorder. However, the investigation of dopamine-specific functioning in humans is problematic as current MRI approaches are unable to differentiate between dopaminergic and other projections. Here, we demonstrate that 'connectopic mapping' -a novel approach for characterizing fine-grained, overlapping modes of functional connectivity- can be used to map dopaminergic projections in striatum. We applied connectopic mapping to resting-state functional MRI data of the Human Connectome Project (population cohort; <i>N</i>=839) and selected the second-order striatal connectivity mode for further analyses. We first validated its specificity to dopaminergic projections by demonstrating a high spatial correlation (<i>r</i>=0.884) with dopamine transporter availability -a marker of dopaminergic projections- derived from DaT SPECT scans of 209 healthy controls. Next, we obtained the subject-specific second-order modes from 20 controls, and 39 PD patients scanned under placebo and under dopamine replacement therapy (L-DOPA), and show that our proposed dopaminergic marker tracks PD diagnosis, symptom severity and sensitivity to L-DOPA. Finally, across 30 daily alcohol users and 38 daily smokers, we establish strong associations with self-reported alcohol and nicotine use. Our findings provide evidence that the second-order mode of functional connectivity in striatum maps onto dopaminergic projections, tracks inter-individual differences in PD symptom severity and L-DOPA sensitivity, and exhibits strong associations with levels of nicotine and alcohol use, thereby offering a new biomarker for dopamine-related (dys)function in the human brain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Host-pathogen genetic interactions underlie tuberculosis susceptibility in genetically diverse mice</a></h4>

              
                The outcome of an encounter with <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </i>(<i>Mtb</i>) depends on the pathogen's ability to adapt to the variable immune pressures exerted by the host. Understanding this interplay has proven difficult, largely because experimentally tractable animal models do not recapitulate the heterogeneity of tuberculosis disease. We leveraged the genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse panel in conjunction with a library of <i>Mtb</i> mutants to create a resource for associating bacterial genetic requirements with host genetics and immunity. We report that CC strains vary dramatically in their susceptibility to infection and produce qualitatively distinct immune states. Global analysis of <i>Mtb </i>transposon mutant fitness (TnSeq) across the CC panel revealed that many virulence pathways are only required in specific host microenvironments, identifying a large fraction of the pathogen's genome that has been maintained to ensure fitness in a diverse population. Both immunological and bacterial traits can be associated with genetic variants distributed across the mouse genome, making the CC a unique population for identifying specific host-pathogen genetic interactions that influence pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">COVID-19 infection enhances susceptibility to oxidative-stress induced parkinsonism</a></h4>

              
                Background: Viral induction of neurological syndromes has been a concern since parkinsonian-like features were observed in patients diagnosed with encephalitis lethargica subsequent to the 1918 influenza pandemic. Given the similarities in the systemic responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection with those observed after pandemic influenza, there is a question if a similar syndrome of post-encephalic parkinsonism could follow COVID-19 infection. Objectives: To determine if prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 increased sensitivity to a mitochondrial toxin known to induce parkinsonism. Methods: hACE2 mice were infected with SARS-CoV-2 to induce mild to moderate disease. After 31 days recovery, mice were administered a non-lesion inducing dose of the parkinsonian toxin MPTP. Subsequent neuroinflammation and SNpc dopaminergic neuron loss was determined and compared to SARS-CoV-2 or MPTP alone. Results: hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 or MPTP showed no SNpc DA neuron loss following MPTP. In mice infected and recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, MPTP induced a 23% or 19% greater loss of SNpc dopaminergic neurons than SARS-CoV-2 or MPTP, respectively (p < 0.05). Examination of microglial activation showed a significant increase in the number of activated microglia in the SARS-CoV-2 + MPTP group compared to SARS-CoV-2 or MPTP alone. Conclusions: Our observations have important implications for long-term public health, given the number of people that have survived SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as for future public policy regarding infection mitigation. However, it will be critical to determine if other agents known to increase risk of PD also have synergistic effects with SARS-CoV-2 and if are abrogated by vaccination.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptomic analysis of aging mouse sciatic nerve reveals early pathways leading to sarcopenia</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sarcopenia, the age-associated decline in skeletal muscle mass and strength, has long been considered a disease of muscle only, but accumulating evidence suggests that sarcopenia could originate from the neural components controlling muscles. To identify early molecular changes in the efferent nerves that may drive sarcopenia initiation, we performed a longitudinal transcriptomic analysis of the sciatic nerve in aging mice. Methods: Sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle were obtained from young adult, middle-aged, old, and sarcopenic (5,18, 21 and 24 months old, respectively) C57BL/6J female mice (n=6 per age group). Sciatic nerve RNA was extracted and subjected to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), with real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) validation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Functional enrichment analysis of clusters of genes associated with patterns of gene expression across age groups was performed. Sarcopenia was confirmed with qRT-PCR of previously established markers of sarcopenia onset in gastrocnemius muscle. Results: We detected 33 significant DEGs in sciatic nerve of 18-month-old mice compared to 5-month-old mice (absolute value of fold change > 2; false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05) which we validated with qRT-PCR of the three top up- and down-regulated genes. Up-regulated genes were associated with circadian rhythm and the AMPK signaling pathway, while down-regulated genes were associated with biosynthesis and metabolic pathways and circadian rhythm. Strikingly, we detected a significant increase in Myog expression (log2 fold change = 18.93, FDR q-value = 1.54x10-12) in sciatic nerve of 18-month-old mice, before up-regulation in muscle was observed. We identified seven clusters of genes with similar expression patterns across groups. Functional enrichment analysis of these clusters revealed biological processes that may be implicated in sarcopenia initiation including extracellular matrix organization and circadian regulation of gene expression. Conclusions: Gene expression changes in mouse peripheral nerve can be detected prior to overt clinical onset of sarcopenia. These early molecular changes we report shed a new light on biological processes that may be implicated in sarcopenia initiation and pathogenesis. Future studies will validate which of the key changes we reported have disease modifying and/or biomarker potential.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of clozapine-N-oxide and compound 21 on sleep in laboratory mice</a></h4>

              
                Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) are chemogenetic tools that modulate a targeted cell population using chemical ligands which bind specifically to modified receptors. Despite the common use of DREADDs in neuroscience and sleep research, potential effects of the DREADD actuator clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) on sleep, which could arise from back-metabolism to clozapine or binding to endogenous neurotransmitter receptors, have never been systematically tested. Here we show that intraperitoneal injections of commonly used doses of CNO alter sleep in wild-type male laboratory mice. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) to analyse sleep, we found that CNO suppresses rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep, changes EEG spectral power during non-REM (NREM) sleep, and alters sleep architecture in a pattern previously reported for clozapine. Interestingly, we found that the novel DREADD actuator, compound 21 (C21), similarly modulates sleep despite not being able to back convert to clozapine. Our results demonstrate that CNO and C21 can affect the sleep of wild-type mice, which do not express DREADD receptors. This implies that back-metabolism to clozapine is not the sole mechanism underlying side effects of chemogenetic actuators and therefore any chemogenetic experiment should include a DREADD-free control group injected with the same CNO, C21 or newly developed actuator. We suggest that electrophysiological sleep assessment could serve as a sensitive tool to test the biological inertness of novel chemogenetic actuators.
