              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">RapID Cell Counter: Semi-Automated and Mid-Throughput Estimation of Cell Density within Diverse Cortical Layers</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Tracking and quantifying the abundance and location of cells in the developing brain is essential in neuroscience research, enabling a greater understanding of mechanisms underlying nervous system morphogenesis. Widely used experimental methods to quantify cells labeled with fluorescent markers, such as immunohistochemistry (IHC), <I>in situ</I> hybridization, and expression of transgenes via stable lines or transient <I>in utero</I> electroporations (IUEs), depend on accurate and consistent quantification of images. Current methods to quantify fluorescently-labeled cells rely on labor-intensive manual counting approaches, such as the Fiji plugin <I>Cell Counter</I>, which requires custom macros to enable higher-throughput analyses. Here, we present RapID Cell Counter, a semi-automated cell-counting tool with an easy-to-implement graphical user interface (GUI), which facilitates quick and consistent quantifications of cell density within user-defined boundaries that can be divided into equally-partitioned segments. Compared with the standard manual counting approach, we show that RapID matched accuracy and consistency and only required ~10% of user time relative to manual counting methods, when quantifying the distribution of fluorescently-labeled neurons in mouse IUE experiments. Using RapID, we recapitulated previously published work focusing on two genes, <I>SRGAP2</I> and <I>CUL5</I>, important for projection neuron (PN) migration in the neocortex and used it to quantify PN displacement in a mouse knock-out model of <I>RBX2</I>. Moreover, RapID is capable of quantifying other cell types in the brain with complex cell morphologies, including astrocytes and dopaminergic neurons. We propose RapID as an efficient method for neuroscience researchers to process fluorescently-labeled brain images in a consistent, accurate, and mid-throughput manner.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Dysregulated mRNA Translation in the G2019S LRRK2 and LRRK2 Knock-Out Mouse Brains</a></h4>

              
                <p>The G2019S mutation in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) causes familial Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) and is also found in a subset of idiopathic cases. Prior studies in <I>Drosophila</I> and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived dopamine neurons uncovered a pronounced effect of G2019S LRRK2 on mRNA translation. It was previously reported that G2019S LRRK2 promotes translation of mRNAs with complex 5' untranslated region (UTR) secondary structure, resulting in increased expression of calcium channels and dysregulated calcium homeostasis in human dopamine neurons. Here, we show that dysregulated translation occurs in the brains of mammalian LRRK2 models <I>in vivo</I>. Through ribosome profiling studies of global translation, we observe that mRNAs with complex 5'UTR structure are also preferentially translated in the G2019S LRRK2-expressing mouse brain. Reporter assays suggest that this 5'UTR preference is independent of translation initiation factors. Conversely, translation of mRNAs with complex 5'UTR secondary structure is downregulated in LRRK2 knock-out (KO) mouse brain, indicating a robust link between LRRK2 kinase activity and translation of mRNA with complex 5'UTR structure. Further, substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) dopamine neurons in the G2019S LRRK2-expressing brain exhibit increased calcium influx, which is consistent with the previous report from human dopamine neurons. These results collectively suggest that LRRK2 plays a mechanistic role in translational regulation, and the G2019S mutation in LRRK2 causes translational defects leading to calcium dysregulation in the mammalian brain.</p>

                Background: Placenta accreta is a pregnancy condition where the placenta's blood vessels attach too deeply to the uterine wall. Incidence of placenta accreta  is increasingly seen today as the rate of cesarean section increases, however, the exact pathophysiology of this condition is still not fully understood. Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1  (sflt-1) as a protein produced by the placenta was found to be decreased in placenta accreta, Therefore we aim  to see if  sfltsFlt-1 has a role in the development of placenta accreta. Methods: This study involved 40 samples from patients that had been diagnosed with placenta accreta spectrum disorder (case group), and 40 samples from patients with normal pregnancies (control group)  at Rumah Skit Umum Pusat H.Adam Malik (RSUP) Haji Adam Malik Medan, in Indonesia.  Diagnosis of placenta accreta syndrome was based on Placenta Accreta Spectrum  Score (PAS), and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics  (FIGO) classification of placenta accreta spectrum disorder.Analyses  were performed by independent t-test, man Mann-Whitney U test, and Kruskal-Wallis analysis test, with a P-value <0.05  considered as statistically significant (95%CI). Results: Based on this study, we found that the sFlt-1 level in the case group was lower than the control group. Data analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test showed that there was a difference in sFlt-1 levels in this study group (p = 0.02), which was further evaluated  with post hoc analysis using Mann. -Whitney U test. The results indicated that there were significant differences between the control and PAS 0, PAS1, and PAS 2 (p = 0.043; p = 0.002; p = 0.03). Conclusion: sFlt-1 levels decreased in placental invasive pregnancies compared to normal pregnancies, however, this still needs to be investigated further in a multi-center study, considering that sFlt-1 levels are also influenced by ethnicity and other conditions that cannot be excluded in this study.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Augmented reality emotion recognition for autism spectrum disorder children [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder that affects brain development. The prevalence of ASD is one in 68 children. Low social motivation is the main cause in developing social communication skills deficiency. As a result, it is becoming difficult for them to express themselves, to be able to manage social interactions, and they lack the ability to comfort others and even share their own feelings. This study aimed to design a mobile application based on augmented reality (AR) focusing on social interactions and communication aspect for children with ASD. The scope is in emotion recognition, which makes use of emotional icons to help them improve their social skills, more specifically on helping them to recognize various emotions. The emotions are represented by emojis inspired by Dr. Paul Ekman who has created the basic six emotions, namely happiness, sadness, disgust, fear, surprise, and angry. Additional emotions such as confound face, winking with tongue, cold sweat, blowing kiss, flushed, sleepy, disappointed, and winking are included. AR is able to gage the children’s attention when they view the animated emojis. The application enables the children with ASD to be more willing in recognizing different emotional expressions and improve their social skills by expressing their own feelings. The scope of the study is limited to emotion recognition. It is developed based on literature reviews without guidance of any certified ASD specialist. AR is an interactive technology that places digital information in our physical world in real time, providing precise registration in all three dimensions. Existing literature proved that the traditional face-to-face teaching methods have failed to increase the interest and ability of ASD children because the teacher has full control in the classroom. This study adds value to the existing works to incorporate AR as additional intervention in treating ASD children.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Enhancing innovative delivery in schools using design thinking [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The pandemic has created challenges in all sectors of the economy and education. Traditional teaching approaches seem futile in the new context, thus the need to constantly reinvent the delivery to meet the fast-paced changes in the education domain. Hence, Design Thinking (DT) is an alternative approach that might be useful in the given context. DT is known to be a human-centric approach to innovative problem-solving processes. DT could be employed in the delivery process to develop twenty-first-century skills and enhance creativity and innovation, in an attempt to identify alternative solutions. The study explores the role of design thinking (DT) in the form of empathy, thinking process, gamified lessons and curriculum enhancement, which leads to innovative delivery among teachers. It enhances and facilitates innovative content delivery by leveraging creativity. The study targeted 131 teachers, whereby 61 are primary school teachers and 70 are secondary school teachers. A questionnaire constituting of 23 close-ended questions using the 5-point Likert scale was used to collect data. Data was analyzed using SmartPLS to establish relationships between DT and Innovative Delivery in schools. The data was further analyzed to seek co-relations between the DT steps and the successful transformation of content delivery by teachers. The study established a framework for the application of design thinking for teachers as the primary support in developing activities for their students. The study showed that thinking process, gamifying lessons and curriculum enhancement have positive significance in innovative delivery, whereas empathy did not show a significant positive relationship. The outcome of this study will help fill the gap towards creating an interesting method of delivery in schools and constantly innovating the method to suit the evolving generation. This insight is crucial for the Ministry of Education and policymakers to enhance teachers’ ability to innovatively deliver content to students.

                Klomp et al. show that CHK1 is essential for KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer cell growth. CHK1 inhibition causes apoptotic growth suppression, MYC loss, and compensatory ERK and autophagy activation. Concurrent CHK1, ERK, and/or autophagy inhibition enhances apoptotic growth suppression. Additionally, genetic depletion of ERK-regulated DNA damage repair protein RIF1 phenocopies ERK inhibition.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Redox-sensitive cyclophilin A elicits chemoresistance through realigning cellular oxidative status in colorectal cancer</a></h4>

              
                Peng et al. show that CypA is a redox-sensitive effector regulating cellular oxidative status through a PRDX2-mediated noncanonical antioxidant system, which contributes to colorectal cancer (CRC) resistance to 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin. Targeting CypA by cyclosporine A sensitizes CRC to chemotherapy, indicating that CypA may serve as a potential druggable therapeutic target.

                How exogenous lipid supplements influence hPSCs has been a puzzling question. Xu et al. show that LPA is a major lipid component influencing metabolism and gene expression. Although pluripotency is independent of lipid supplements, LPA induces a distinct and reversible cellular state and could be useful in stem cell applications.

                Niimi et al. show that FOXO1 inhibits lymphatic valve development via PRDM1. They also demonstrate that oscillatory shear stress upregulates lymphatic-valve-specific genes via Akt-dependent inactivation of FOXO1 and subsequent reduction of PRDM1. Their study provides insights into how lymphatic valve formation is repressed.

                Fallatah et al. use genome-wide approaches to investigate the function of mammalian nuclear Ago1 during muscle differentiation in mouse C2C12 cells. They show that enhancer-bound Ago1 controls eRNA-dependent CBP-mediated H3K27Ac. Depletion of Ago1 reduces global H3K27ac and programmed expression of genes related to skeletal muscle differentiation.

TTN3-deficient pancreatic beta cells exhibit impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion, identifying an additional regulatory pathway for diabetes mellitus.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Decreased dopaminergic inhibition of pyramidal neurons in anterior cingulate cortex maintains chronic neuropathic pain</a></h4>

              
                Lançon et al. show that dopamine inhibits pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) via D1R signaling and subsequent opening of HCN channels. Activation of ACC D1R provides analgesia and is necessary for relief of ongoing pain. Supplementing supraspinal dopamine normalizes ACC pyramidal hyperexcitability and reduces neuropathic hyperalgesia.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dinosaur bonebed amber from an original swamp forest soil</a></h4>

              
                Dinosaur bonebeds with amber content, yet scarce, offer a superior wealth and quality of data on ancient terrestrial ecosystems. However, the preserved palaeodiversity and/or taphonomic characteristics of these exceptional localities had hitherto limited their palaeobiological potential. Here, we describe the amber from the Lower Cretaceous dinosaur bonebed of Ariño (Teruel, Spain) using a multidisciplinary approach. Amber is found in both a root layer with amber strictly in situ and a litter layer mainly composed of aerial pieces unusually rich in bioinclusions, encompassing 11 insect orders, arachnids, and a few plant and vertebrate remains, including a feather. Additional palaeontological data—charophytes, palynomorphs, ostracods— are provided. Ariño arguably represents the most prolific and palaeobiologically diverse locality in which fossiliferous amber and a dinosaur bonebed have been found in association, and the only one known where the vast majority of the palaeontological assemblage suffered no or low-grade pre-burial transport. This has unlocked unprecedentedly complete and reliable palaeoecological data out of two complementary windows of preservation—the bonebed and the amber—from the same site.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ovipositor and mouthparts in a fossil insect support a novel ecological role for early orthopterans in 300 million years old forests</a></h4>

              
                A high portion of the earliest known insect fauna is composed of the so-called ‘lobeattid insects’, whose systematic affinities and role as foliage feeders remain debated. We investigated hundreds of samples of a new lobeattid species from the Xiaheyan locality using a combination of photographic techniques, including reflectance transforming imaging, geometric morphometrics, and biomechanics to document its morphology, and infer its phylogenetic position and ecological role. <i>Ctenoptilus frequens</i> sp. nov. possessed a sword-shaped ovipositor with valves interlocked by two ball-and-socket mechanisms, lacked jumping hind-legs, and certain wing venation features. This combination of characters unambiguously supports lobeattids as stem relatives of all living Orthoptera (crickets, grasshoppers, katydids). Given the herein presented and other remains, it follows that this group experienced an early diversification and, additionally, occurred in high individual numbers. The ovipositor shape indicates that ground was the preferred substrate for eggs. Visible mouthparts made it possible to assess the efficiency of the mandibular food uptake system in comparison to a wide array of extant species. The new species was likely omnivorous which explains the paucity of external damage on contemporaneous plant foliage.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">TCR meta-clonotypes for biomarker discovery with tcrdist3 enabled identification of public, HLA-restricted clusters of SARS-CoV-2 TCRs</a></h4>

              
                T-cell receptors (TCRs) encode clinically valuable information that reflects prior antigen exposure and potential future response. However, despite advances in deep repertoire sequencing, enormous TCR diversity complicates the use of TCR clonotypes as clinical biomarkers. We propose a new framework that leverages experimentally inferred antigen-associated TCRs to form meta-clonotypes – groups of biochemically similar TCRs – that can be used to robustly quantify functionally similar TCRs in bulk repertoires across individuals. We apply the framework to TCR data from COVID-19 patients, generating 1831 public TCR meta-clonotypes from the SARS-CoV-2 antigen-associated TCRs that have strong evidence of restriction to patients with a specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype. Applied to independent cohorts, meta-clonotypes targeting these specific epitopes were more frequently detected in bulk repertoires compared to exact amino acid matches, and 59.7% (1093/1831) were more abundant among COVID-19 patients that expressed the putative restricting HLA allele (false discovery rate [FDR]&lt;0.01), demonstrating the potential utility of meta-clonotypes as antigen-specific features for biomarker development. To enable further applications, we developed an open-source software package, <i>tcrdist3,</i> that implements this framework and facilitates flexible workflows for distance-based TCR repertoire analysis.

                Circadian rhythms in mammals are orchestrated by a central clock within the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Our understanding of the electrophysiological basis of SCN activity comes overwhelmingly from a small number of nocturnal rodent species, and the extent to which these are retained in day-active animals remains unclear. Here, we recorded the spontaneous and evoked electrical activity of single SCN neurons in the diurnal rodent <i>Rhabdomys pumilio</i>, and developed cutting-edge data assimilation and mathematical modeling approaches to uncover the underlying ionic mechanisms. As in nocturnal rodents, <i>R. pumilio</i> SCN neurons were more excited during daytime hours. By contrast, the evoked activity of <i>R. pumilio</i> neurons included a prominent suppressive response that is not present in the SCN of nocturnal rodents. Our modeling revealed and subsequent experiments confirmed transient subthreshold A-type potassium channels as the primary determinant of this response, and suggest a key role for this ionic mechanism in optimizing SCN function to accommodate <i>R. pumilio</i>’s diurnal niche.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Glutamine deprivation triggers NAGK-dependent hexosamine salvage</a></h4>

              
                Tumors frequently exhibit aberrant glycosylation, which can impact cancer progression and therapeutic responses. The hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) produces uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), a major substrate for glycosylation in the cell. Prior studies have identified the HBP as a promising therapeutic target in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). The HBP requires both glucose and glutamine for its initiation. The PDA tumor microenvironment is nutrient poor, however, prompting us to investigate how nutrient limitation impacts hexosamine synthesis. Here, we identify that glutamine limitation in PDA cells suppresses de novo hexosamine synthesis but results in increased free GlcNAc abundance. GlcNAc salvage via N-acetylglucosamine kinase (NAGK) is engaged to feed UDP-GlcNAc pools. <i>NAGK</i> expression is elevated in human PDA, and <i>NAGK</i> deletion from PDA cells impairs tumor growth in mice. Together, these data identify an important role for NAGK-dependent hexosamine salvage in supporting PDA tumor growth.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A molecular mechanism for the generation of ligand-dependent differential outputs by the epidermal growth factor receptor</a></h4>

              
                The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that couples the binding of extracellular ligands, such as EGF and transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), to the initiation of intracellular signaling pathways. EGFR binds to EGF and TGF-α with similar affinity, but generates different signals from these ligands. To address the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon, we have carried out cryo-EM analyses of human EGFR bound to EGF and TGF-α. We show that the extracellular module adopts an ensemble of dimeric conformations when bound to either EGF or TGF-α. The two extreme states of this ensemble represent distinct ligand-bound quaternary structures in which the membrane-proximal tips of the extracellular module are either juxtaposed or separated. EGF and TGF-α differ in their ability to maintain the conformation with the membrane-proximal tips of the extracellular module separated, and this conformation is stabilized preferentially by an oncogenic EGFR mutation. Close proximity of the transmembrane helices at the junction with the extracellular module has been associated previously with increased EGFR activity. Our results show how EGFR can couple the binding of different ligands to differential modulation of this proximity, thereby suggesting a molecular mechanism for the generation of ligand-sensitive differential outputs in this receptor family.

                The study of naturalistic social behavior requires quantification of animals’ interactions. This is generally done through manual annotation—a highly time-consuming and tedious process. Recent advances in computer vision enable tracking the pose (posture) of freely behaving animals. However, automatically and accurately classifying complex social behaviors remains technically challenging. We introduce the Mouse Action Recognition System (MARS), an automated pipeline for pose estimation and behavior quantification in pairs of freely interacting mice. We compare MARS’s annotations to human annotations and find that MARS’s pose estimation and behavior classification achieve human-level performance. We also release the pose and annotation datasets used to train MARS to serve as community benchmarks and resources. Finally, we introduce the Behavior Ensemble and Neural Trajectory Observatory (BENTO), a graphical user interface for analysis of multimodal neuroscience datasets. Together, MARS and BENTO provide an end-to-end pipeline for behavior data extraction and analysis in a package that is user-friendly and easily modifiable.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Columnar processing of border ownership in primate visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                To understand a visual scene, the brain segregates figures from background by assigning borders to foreground objects. Neurons in primate visual cortex encode which object owns a border (border ownership), but the underlying circuitry is not understood. Here, we used multielectrode probes to record from border ownership-selective units in different layers in macaque visual area V4 to study the laminar organization and timing of border ownership selectivity. We find that border ownership selectivity occurs first in deep layer units, in contrast to spike latency for small stimuli in the classical receptive field. Units on the same penetration typically share the preferred side of border ownership, also across layers, similar to orientation preference. Units are often border ownership-selective for a range of border orientations, where the preferred sides of border ownership are systematically organized in visual space. Together our data reveal a columnar organization of border ownership in V4 where the earliest border ownership signals are not simply inherited from upstream areas, but computed by neurons in deep layers, and may thus be part of signals fed back to upstream cortical areas or the oculomotor system early after stimulus onset. The finding that preferred border ownership is clustered and can cover a wide range of spatially contiguous locations suggests that the asymmetric context integrated by these neurons is provided in a systematically clustered manner, possibly through corticocortical feedback and horizontal connections.

                Projections from the basal amygdala (BA) to the ventral hippocampus (vH) are proposed to provide information about the rewarding or threatening nature of learned associations to support appropriate goal-directed and anxiety-like behaviour. Such behaviour occurs via the differential activity of multiple, parallel populations of pyramidal neurons in vH that project to distinct downstream targets, but the nature of BA input and how it connects with these populations is unclear. Using channelrhodopsin-2-assisted circuit mapping in mice, we show that BA input to vH consists of both excitatory and inhibitory projections. Excitatory input specifically targets BA- and nucleus accumbens-projecting vH neurons, and avoids prefrontal cortex-projecting vH neurons; while inhibitory input preferentially targets BA-projecting neurons. Through this specific connectivity, BA inhibitory projections gate place-value associations by controlling the activity of nucleus accumbens-projecting vH neurons. Our results define a parallel excitatory and inhibitory projection from BA to vH that can support goal-directed behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A novel live-cell imaging assay reveals regulation of endosome maturation</a></h4>

              
                Cell-cell communication is an essential process in life, with endosomes acting as key organelles for regulating uptake and secretion of signaling molecules. Endocytosed material is accepted by the sorting endosome where it either is sorted for recycling or remains in the endosome as it matures to be degraded in the lysosome. Investigation of the endosome maturation process has been hampered by the small size and rapid movement of endosomes in most cellular systems. Here, we report an easy versatile live-cell imaging assay to monitor endosome maturation kinetics, which can be applied to a variety of mammalian cell types. Acute ionophore treatment led to enlarged early endosomal compartments that matured into late endosomes and fused with lysosomes to form endolysosomes. Rab5-to-Rab7 conversion and PI(3)P formation and turn over were recapitulated with this assay and could be observed with a standard widefield microscope. We used this approach to show that Snx1 and Rab11-positive recycling endosome recruitment occurred throughout endosome maturation and was uncoupled from Rab conversion. In contrast, efficient endosomal acidification was dependent on Rab conversion. The assay provides a powerful tool to further unravel various aspects of endosome maturation.

A major challenge in analysis of such networks is the identification of noise confounds, which introduce temporal ties that are nonessential, or links that are formed by chance due to local properties of the nodes. Several approaches have been suggested in the past for static networks or temporal networks with binary weights for extracting significant ties whose likelihood cannot be reduced to the local properties of the nodes. In this work, we propose a data-driven procedure to reveal the irreducible ties in dynamic functional connectivity of resting-state fMRI data with continuous weights. This framework includes a null model that estimates the latent characteristics of the distributions of temporal links through optimization, followed by a statistical test to filter the links whose formation can be reduced to the activities and local properties of their interacting nodes. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach by applying it to a resting-state fMRI dataset, and provide further discussion on various aspects and advantages of it.</span>

A key histopathological observation is that tau protein aggregates follow a structured progression pattern through the brain. Mathematical network models of prion-like propagation have the ability to capture such patterns, but a number of factors impact the observed staging result, thus introducing questions regarding model selection. Here, we introduce a novel approach, based on braid diagrams, for studying the structured progression of a marker evolving on a network. We apply this approach to a six-stage ‘Braak pattern’ of tau proteins, in Alzheimer’s disease, motivated by a recent observation that seed-competent tau precedes tau aggregation. We show that the different modeling choices, from the model parameters to the connectome resolution, play a significant role in the landscape of observable staging patterns. Our approach provides a systematic way to approach model selection for network propagation of neurodegenerative diseases that ensures both reproducibility and optimal parameter fitting.</span>

Ninety-seven participants with a history of stroke were assessed using language impairment measures (<span style="font-style:italic;">Auditory Verbal Comprehension</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Spontaneous Speech</span> scores from the Western Aphasia Battery–Revised) and MRI (structural, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting-state functional connectivity). We analyzed the association between functional connectivity and language and controlled for multiple potential neuroanatomical confounders, namely structural connectivity. We identified functional connections within the left hemisphere ventral stream where decreased functional connectivity, independent of structural connectivity, was associated with speech comprehension impairment. These connections exist in frontotemporal and temporoparietal regions. Our results suggest poor speech comprehension in aphasia is at least partially caused by loss of cortical synchrony in a left hemisphere ventral stream network and is not only reflective of localized necrosis or structural connectivity.</span>

Directed functional connectivity measures, such as the generalized partial directed coherence (GPDC), provide estimates of the causal influence between areas.

We analyzed this problem by evaluating the effectiveness of GPDC to estimate the connectivity of a ground-truth, data-constrained computational model of a large-scale network model of the mouse cortex. The model contains 19 cortical areas composed of spiking neurons, with areas connected by long-range projections with weights obtained from a tract-tracing cortical connectome. We show that GPDC values provide a reasonable estimate of structural connectivity, with an average Pearson correlation over simulations of 0.74. Moreover, even in a typical electrophysiological recording scenario containing five areas, the mean correlation was above 0.6. These results suggest that it may be possible to empirically estimate structural connectivity from functional connectivity even when detailed whole-brain recordings are not achievable.</span>

We found that attentional load effects were observable in measures of pupil diameter and in a set of brain regions that parametrically modulated their BOLD activity and mesoscale network-level integration. In addition, the regional patterns of network reconfiguration were correlated with the spatial distribution of the α2a adrenergic receptor.

                Adolescent alcohol use can permanently alter brain function and lead to poor health outcomes in adulthood. Emerging evidence suggests that alcohol use predispose to pain disorders or exacerbate existing pain conditions, but the neural mechanisms are currently unknown. Here we report that mice exposed to adolescent intermittent access to ethanol (AIE) exhibit increased pain sensitivity and depressive-like behaviors that persist after alcohol cessation and are accompanied by elevated CD68 expression in microglia and reduced numbers of serotonin (5-HT)-expressing neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). 5-HT expression was also reduced in the thalamus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and amygdala as well as the lumbar dorsal horn of the spinal cord. We then found that chronic minocycline administration after AIE alleviated hyperalgesia and social deficits, while chemogenetic activation of microglia in the DRN of Cx3cr1-cre-GFP mice reproduced the effects of AIE on pain and social interaction. Taken together, these results indicate that microglial activation in the DRN may be a primary driver of pain and negative affect after AIE.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">How synchrony and metastable network dynamics are affected in fast and slow timescales with aging: Implication for Cognition</a></h4>

              
                Both healthy and pathological aging exhibits gradual deterioration of structure but interestingly in healthy aging adults often maintains a high level of cognitive performance in a variety of cognitively demanding task till late age. What are the relevant network measures that could possibly track these dynamic changes which may be critically relevant for maintenance of cognitive functions through lifespan and how does these measures affected by the specific alterations in underlying anatomical connectivity till day remains an open question. In this work, we propose that whole-brain computational models are required to test the hypothesis that aging affects the brain network dynamics through two highly relevant network measures synchrony and metastability. Since aging entails complex processes involving multiple timescales we test the additional hypothesis that whether these two network measures remain invariant or exhibit different behavior in the fast and slow timescales respectively. The altered global synchrony and metastability with aging can be related to shifts in the dynamic working point of the system based on biophysical parameters e.g., time delay, and inter-areal coupling constrained by the underlying structural connectivity matrix.Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, we estimate structural connectivity (SC) of individual group of participants and obtain network level synchrony, metastability indexing network dynamics from resting state functional MRI data for both young and elderly participants in the age range of 18-89 years. Subsequently, we simulate a whole-brain Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators with appropriate conduction delay and interareal coupling strength to test the hypothesis of shifting of dynamic working point with age-associated alteration in network dynamics in both neural and ultraslow BOLD signal time scales. Specifically, we investigate the age-associated difference in metastable brain dynamics across large-scale neurocognitive brain networks e.g., salience network (SN), default mode network (DMN), and central executive network (CEN) to test spatio-temporal changes in default to executive coupling hypothesis with age. Interestingly, we find that the metastability of the SN increases substantially with age, whereas the metastability of the CEN and DMN networks do not substantially vary with age suggesting a clear role of conduction delay and global coupling in mediating altered dynamics in these networks. Moreover, our finding suggests that the metastability changes from slow to fast timescales confirming previous findings that variability of brain signals relates differently in slower and faster time scales with aging. However, synchrony remains invariant network measure across timescales and agnostic to the filtering of fast signals. Finally, we demonstrate both numerically and analytically long-range anatomical connections as oppose to shot-range or mid-range connection alterations is responsible for the overall neural difference in large-scale brain network dynamics captured by the network measure metastability. In summary, we propose a theoretical framework providing a systematic account of tracking age-associated variability and synchrony at multiple time scales across lifespan which may pave the way for developing dynamical theories of cognitive aging.

                Neural activity in the auditory system synchronizes to sound rhythms, and brain environment synchronization is thought to be fundamental to successful auditory perception. Sound rhythms are often operationalized in terms of the sound's amplitude envelope. We hypothesized that, especially for music, the envelope might not best capture the complex spectrotemporal fluctuations that give rise to beat perception and synchronize neural activity. This study investigated 1) neural entrainment to different musical features, 2) tempo dependence of neural entrainment, and 3) dependence of entrainment on familiarity, enjoyment, and ease of beat perception. In this electroencephalography study, 37 human participants listened to tempo modulated music (1 to 4 Hz). Independent of whether the analysis approach was based on temporal response functions (TRFs) or reliable components analysis (RCA), the spectral flux of music, as opposed to the amplitude envelope, evoked strongest neural entrainment. Moreover, music with slower beat rates, high familiarity, and easy to perceive beats elicited the strongest neural response. Based on the TRFs, we could decode music stimulation tempo, but also perceived beat rate, even when the two differed. Our results demonstrate the importance of accurately characterizing musical acoustics in the context of studying neural entrainment, and demonstrate the sensitivity of entrainment to musical tempo, familiarity, and beat salience.

                Learning and memory storage is a complex process that has proven challenging to tackle. It is likely that, in real nature, the instructive value of reinforcing experiences is acquired rather than innate. The association between seemingly neutral stimuli increases the gamut of possibilities to create meaningful associations and increases the predictive power of moment-by-moment experiences. Here we report physiological and behavioral evidence of olfactory unimodal sensory preconditioning in fruit flies. We show that the presentation of a pair of odors (S1 and S2) before one of them (S1) is associated with electric shocks elicits a conditional response not only to the trained odor (S1) but to the odor previously paired with it (S2). This occurs even if the S2 odor was never presented in contiguity with the aversive stimulus. In addition, we show that inhibition of the small G protein and known forgetting regulator Rac1 facilitates the association between S1/S2 odors. These results indicate that flies can infer value to non-paired odor based on the previous associative structure between odors, and inhibition of Rac1 lengthens the time of olfactory sensory buffer, allowing linking of neutral odors presented in sequence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hypothermia Suppresses Uncoupling of Oxidative-Phosphorylation after Neonatal Cerebral Hypoxia-Ischemia</a></h4>

              
                Hypothermia is the best available therapy for neonatal hypoxia ischemia (HI) brain injury, but its primary mechanisms remain uncertain. We hypothesize that HI induces, whereas hypothermia represses, uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), an increase of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) despite reduction of the mitochondrial energy output. We used a multiparametric photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) system to compare the effects of HI and post HI hypothermic treatment on CMRO2 in awake 10 day old (P10) mice. Here we show that hypoxia (10% O2) elevated CMRO2, but the addition of unilateral carotid artery ligation suppressed CMRO2 and sparked a rapid overshoot of post HI CMRO2 in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex for at least 2 hours. The post HI surge of CMRO2 was linked to an increase of mitochondrial oxygen consumption and superoxide outburst, despite reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Notably, post HI hypothermia blocked the surge of superoxide and CMRO2, primarily by limiting oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), leading to better preservation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), creatine (Cr) and N acetylaspartate (NAA) after HI. Mice that did not receive hypothermia exhibited ~80% reduction of CMRO2 at 24 h post HI, coupled to a large cortical infarction. These results suggest that mitigation of post HI uncoupling of OXPHOS is an early and/or pivotal effect of hypothermia. Further, optical measurement of CMRO2 may be a sensitive and noninvasive method to monitor brain damage in hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).

                Reactivation of newly acquired memories during sleep across hippocampal and neocortical systems is proposed to underlie systems memory consolidation. Here, we investigate spontaneous memory reprocessing during sleep by applying machine learning to source space-transformed magnetoencephalographic data in a two-step exploratory and confirmatory study design. We decode memory-related activity from slow oscillations in hippocampus, frontal cortex and precuneus, indicating parallel memory processing during sleep. Moreover, we show complementary roles of hippocampus and neocortex: while gamma activity indicated memory reprocessing in hippocampus, delta and theta frequencies allowed decoding of memory in neocortex. Neocortex and hippocampus were linked through coherent activity and modulation of high-frequency gamma oscillations by theta, a dynamic similar to memory processing during wakefulness. Overall, we noninvasively demonstrate localized, coordinated memory reprocessing in human sleep.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The HUSH complex controls brain architecture and protocadherin fidelity</a></h4>

              
                Fine-tuning of neural connectivity is important for cerebral functions and brain evolution. Protocadherins provide barcodes for neuronal identity as well as synapse formation and expansion of protocadherin cluster genes has been linked to advanced cognitive functions. The tightly controlled stochastic and combinatorial expression of the different protocadherin isoforms in individual neurons provides the molecular basis for neuronal diversity, neuronal network complexity and function of the vertebrate brain. How protocadherins are epigenetically controlled has not yet been fully elucidated. Here we show that the HUSH (human silencing hub) complex containing H3K9me3 binding protein M-phase phosphoprotein 8 (MPP8) and Microrchidia CW-type zinc finger protein 2 (MORC2), critically controls the fidelity of protocadherin expression. MPP8 and MORC2A are highly expressed in the murine brain and exclusively found in neurons. Genetic inactivation of Mphosph8 (coding for MPP8) or Morc2a in the nervous system of mice leads to increased brain size, altered brain architecture, and behavioral changes. Mechanistically, MPP8 and MORC2A precisely and selectively suppress the repetitive-like protocadherin gene cluster on mouse chromosome 18 in a H3K9me3-dependent manner, thereby affecting synapse formation. Moreover, we demonstrate that individual MPHOSPH8- or MORC2-deficient neurons in human cerebral organoids express increased numbers of clustered protocadherin isoforms. Our data identify the HUSH complex, previously linked to silencing of repetitive transposable elements, as a key epigenetic regulator of protocadherin expression in the nervous system and thereby brain development and neuronal individuality in mice and humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structural and functional organization of visual responses in the inferior olive of larval zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                The olivo-cerebellar system plays an important role in vertebrate sensorimotor control. According to a classical theory of cerebellar cortex, the inferior olive (IO) provides Purkinje cells with error information which drives motor learning in the cerebellum. Here we investigate the sensory representations in the IO of larval zebrafish and their spatial organization. Using single-cell labeling of genetically identified IO neurons we find that they can be divided into at least two distinct groups based on their spatial location, dendritic morphology, and axonal projection patterns. In the same genetically targeted population, we recorded calcium activity in response to a set of visual stimuli using 2-photon imaging. We found that most IO neurons showed direction selective and binocular responses to visual stimuli and that functional properties were spatially organized within the IO. Light-sheet functional imaging that allowed for simultaneous activity recordings at the soma and axonal level revealed tight coupling between soma location, axonal projections and functional properties of IO neurons. Taken together, our results suggest that anatomically-defined classes of inferior olive neurons correspond to distinct functional types, and that topographic connections between IO and cerebellum contribute to organization of the cerebellum into distinct functional zones.

                In the context of visual attention, it has been classically assumed that missing the response to a target or erroneously selecting a distractor occurs as a consequence of the (miss)allocation of attention in space. In the present paper, we challenge this view and provide evidence that, in addition to encoding spatial attention, prefrontal neurons also encode a distractibility-to-impulsivity state. Using supervised dimensionality reduction techniques, we identify two partially overlapped neuronal subpopulations associated either with attention or overt behaviour. The degree of overlap accounts for the behavioural gain associated with the good allocation of attention. We further describe the neural variability accounting for distractibility-to-impulsivity behaviour by a two dimensional state associated with optimality in task and responsiveness. Overall, we thus show that behavioural performance arises from the integration of task-specific neuronal processes and pre-existing neuronal states describing task-independent behavioural states, shedding new light on attention disorders such as ADHD.

                Octopus cells are remarkable projection neurons of the mammalian cochlear nucleus, with extremely fast membranes and wide frequency tuning. They are considered prime examples of coincidence detectors but are poorly characterized in vivo. We discover that octopus cells are selective to frequency sweep direction, a feature that is absent in their auditory nerve inputs. In vivo intracellular recordings reveal that direction selectivity does not derive from cross-channel coincidence detection but hinges on the amplitudes and activation sequence of auditory nerve inputs tuned to clusters of hotspot frequencies. A simple biophysical model of octopus cells excited with real nerve spike trains recreates direction selectivity through interaction of intrinsic membrane conductances with activation sequence of clustered inputs. We conclude that octopus cells are sequence detectors, sensitive to temporal patterns across cochlear frequency channels. The detection of sequences rather than coincidences is a much simpler but powerful operation to extract temporal information.

                How muscle actions are coordinated to realize animal movement is a fundamental question in behavioral study. To obtain the overall muscular activity patterns accompanying behaviors at high spatiotemporal resolution is technically difficult. In this work, we used light sheet microscopy to simultaneously image and analyze the activity, length and orientation of Drosophila larval muscles across body segments at single muscle resolution in nearly free behaviors. For typical behavioral modes such as peristalsis, head cast and turning, larval muscles showed behavioral mode specific activity patterns. Unexpectedly, reorientation of larval head involves muscle tone in the apparently motionless posterior segments. With a STGCN(spatial temporal graph convolution neural network)-Generator model, sequence of larval behavioral poses outlined by morphological patterns of muscles could be accurately predicted based on the time series of ventral but not dorsal muscle activities, and vice versa. Laser ablation of ventral but not dorsal muscles interrupted peristaltic wave and undermined head cast in both frequency and amplitude. Our results provide a simplified muscle activity representation of soft body motion that can be used for probing the key components of animal motor control.

                Autonomic parasympathetic preganglionic neurons (PGN) drive contraction of the bladder during micturition but remain quiescent during bladder filling. This quiescence is postulated to be due to recurrent inhibition of PGN by fast-firing adjoining interneurons. Here, we defined four distinct neuronal types within lamina VII of the lumbosacral spinal cord, where PGN are situated, by combining whole cell patch clamp recordings with k-means clustering of a range of electrophysiological parameters. Additional morphological analysis separated these neuronal classes into parasympathetic preganglionic populations (PGN) and a fast firing interneuronal population. Kv3 channels are voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv) that allow fast and precise firing of neurons. We found that blockade of Kv3 channels by tetraethylammonium (TEA) reduced neuronal firing frequency and isolated high-voltage-activated Kv currents in the fast-firing population but had no effect in PGN populations. Furthermore, Kv3 blockade potentiated the local and descending inhibitory inputs to PGN indicating that Kv3-expressing inhibitory neurons are synaptically connected to PGN. Taken together, our data reveal that Kv3 channels are crucial for fast and regulated neuronal output of a defined population that may be involved in intrinsic spinal bladder circuits that underpin recurrent inhibition of PGN.

                Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a wave of pronounced depolarization of brain tissue accompanied by substantial shifts in ionic concentrations and cellular swelling. Here, we validate a computational framework for modelling electrical potentials, ionic movement, and cellular swelling in brain tissue during CSD. We consider different model variations representing wild type or knock-out/knock-down mice and systematically compare the numerical results with reports from a selection of experimental studies. We find that the data for several CSD hallmarks obtained computationally, including wave propagation speed, direct current shift duration, peak in extracellular K + concentration as well as a pronounced shrinkage of extracellular space, are well in line with what has previously been observed experimentally. Further, we assess how key model parameters including cellular diffusivity, structural ratios, membrane water and/or K + permeabilities affect the set of CSD characteristics.

                In the cerebral cortex, the vasculature plays important homeostatic functions, especially at the highly connected complex capillary networks. The association of focal capillary ischemia with the neurodegenerative disease as well as the laminar vascular dynamics have prompted studies of vascular micro-occlusion via photothrombosis. However, technical challenges of this approach remain, including increased temporal precision of occlusion, increasing the depth of vascular occlusion, understanding how such micro-occlusion impacts local blood flow, and ultimately the neuronal effects of such changes. Here, we have developed a novel approach that employs ultra-fast multiphoton light to induce focal Rose Bengal-induced photothrombosis. We demonstrated induction of highly precise and fast occlusion of microvessels at various types and depths. The change of the microvascular architecture and hemodynamics after occlusion revealed the autoregulation and significant difference between upstream vs downstream in layer 2/3. Further, we found that micro-occlusion at two different layers within the same vascular arbor results in distinct effects on the acute flow redistribution mechanism. To examine neuronal effects of such micro-occlusion, we produced infarct of capillaries surrounding a labeled target neuron and found this induces dramatic and rapid lamina-specific degeneration in neuronal dendritic architecture. In sum, our technique enhanced the precision and power of the photothrombotic study of microvascular function. The current results pointed to the importance of laminar scale regulation within the microvascular network, a finding which may be relevant for models of neurovascular disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cross-modal Semantic Relationships Guide Spontaneous Orienting in Real-life Scenes</a></h4>

              
                In real-world scenes, the different objects and events available to our senses are interconnected within a rich web of semantic associations. These semantic links help parse information and make sense of the environment. For example, during goal-directed attention, characteristic everyday life object sounds help speed up visual search for these objects in natural and dynamic environments. However, it is not known whether semantic correspondences also play a role under spontaneous observation. Here, we investigated this question addressing whether crossmodal semantic congruence can drive spontaneous, overt visual attention in free-viewing conditions. We used eye-tracking whilst participants (N=45) viewed video clips of realistic complex scenes presented alongside sounds of varying semantic congruency with objects within the videos. We found that characteristic sounds increased the probability of looking, the number of fixations, and the total dwell time on the semantically corresponding visual objects, in comparison to when the same scenes were presented with semantically neutral sounds or just with background noise only. Our results suggest that crossmodal semantic congruence has an impact on spontaneous gaze and eye movements, and therefore on how attention samples information in a free viewing paradigm. Our findings extend beyond known effects of object-based crossmodal interactions with simple stimuli and shed new light upon how audio-visual semantically congruent relationships play out in everyday life scenarios.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mutation-related apparent myelin, not axon density, drives white matter differences in premanifest Huntington's disease: Evidence from in vivo ultra-strong gradient MRI</a></h4>

              
                White matter (WM) alterations have been observed early in Huntington's disease (HD) progression but their role in the disease-pathophysiology remains unknown. We exploited ultra-strong-gradient MRI to tease apart contributions of myelin (with the magnetization transfer ratio), and axon density (with the restricted volume fraction from the Composite Hindered and Restricted Model of Diffusion) to WM differences between premanifest HD patients and age- and sex-matched controls. Diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) measures were also assessed. We used tractometry to investigate region-specific changes across callosal segments with well-characterized early- and late-myelinating axonal populations, while brain-wise alterations were explored with tract-based cluster analysis (TBCA). Behavioural measures were included to explore disease-associated brain-function relationships. We detected lower myelin in the rostrum of patients (tractometry: p = 0.0343; TBCA: p = 0.030), but higher myelin in their splenium (p = 0.016). Importantly, patients' myelin and mutation size were positively associated (all p-values < 0.01), indicating that increased myelination might be a direct result of the mutation. Finally, myelin was higher than controls in younger patients but lower in older patients (p = 0.003), suggesting detrimental effects of increased myelination later in the course of the disease. Higher FR in patients' left cortico-spinal tract (CST) (p = 0.03) was detected, and was found to be positively associated with MTR in the posterior callosum (p = 0.033), possibly suggesting compensation to myelin alterations. This comprehensive, ultra-strong gradient MRI investigation provides novel evidence of CAG-driven myelin alterations in premanifest HD which may reflect neurodevelopmental, rather than neurodegenerative disease-associated changes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Non-uniform distribution of dendritic nonlinearities differentially engages thalamostriatal and corticostriatal inputs onto cholinergic interneurons</a></h4>

              
                The tonic activity of striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) is modified differentially by their afferent inputs. Although their unitary synaptic currents are identical, cortical inputs onto distal dendrites only weakly entrain CINs, whereas proximal thalamic inputs trigger abrupt pauses in discharge in response to salient external stimuli. To test whether the dendritic expression of the active conductances that drive autonomous discharge contribute to the CINs' capacity to dissociate cortical from thalamic inputs, we used an optogenetics-based method to quantify dendritic excitability. We found that the persistent sodium (NaP) current gave rise to dendritic boosting and that the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) current gave rise to a subhertz membrane resonance. This resonance may underlie our novel finding of an association between CIN pauses and internally-generated slow wave events in sleeping non-human primates. Moreover, our method indicated that dendritic NaP and HCN currents were preferentially expressed in proximal dendrites. We validated this non-uniform distribution with two-photon imaging of dendritic back-propagating action potentials, and by demonstrating boosting of thalamic, but not cortical, inputs by NaP currents. Thus, the localization of active dendritic conductances in CIN dendrites mirrors the spatial distribution of afferent terminals and may promote their differential responses to thalamic vs. cortical inputs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">General factors of white matter microstructure from DTI and NODDI in the developing brain</a></h4>

              
                Preterm birth is closely associated with diffuse white matter dysmaturation inferred from diffusion MRI and neurocognitive impairment in childhood. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) are distinct dMRI modalities, yet metrics derived from these two methods share variance across tracts. This raises the hypothesis that dimensionality reduction approaches may provide efficient whole-brain estimates of white matter microstructure that capture (dys)maturational processes. To investigate the optimal model for accurate classification of generalised white matter dysmaturation in preterm infants we assessed variation in DTI and NODDI metrics across 16 major white matter tracts using principal component analysis and structural equation modelling, in 79 term and 141 preterm infants at term equivalent age. We used logistic regression models to evaluate performances of single-metric and multimodality general factor frameworks for efficient classification of preterm infants based on variation in white matter microstructure. Single-metric general factors from DTI and NODDI capture substantial shared variance (41.8-72.5%) across 16 white matter tracts, and two multimodality factors captured 93.9% of variance shared between DTI and NODDI metrics themselves. General factors associate with preterm birth and a single model that includes all seven DTI and NODDI metrics provides the most accurate prediction of microstructural variations associated with preterm birth. This suggests that despite global covariance of dMRI metrics in neonates, each metric represents information about specific (and additive) aspects of the underlying microstructure that differ in preterm compared to term subjects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Using child-friendly movie stimuli to study the development of face, place, and object regions from age 3 to 12 years</a></h4>

              
                Scanning young children while watching short, engaging, commercially-produced movies has emerged as a promising approach for increasing data retention and quality. Movie stimuli also evoke a richer variety of cognitive processes than traditional experiments - allowing the study of multiple aspects of brain development simultaneously. However, because these stimuli are uncontrolled, it is unclear how effectively distinct profiles of brain activity can be distinguished from the resulting data. Here we develop an approach for identifying multiple distinct subject-specific Regions of Interest (ssROIs) using fMRI data collected during movie-viewing. We focused on the test case of higher-level visual regions selective for faces, scenes, and objects. Adults (N=13) were scanned while viewing a 5.5 minute child-friendly movie, as well as a traditional experiment with isolated faces, scenes, and objects. We found that just 2.7 minutes of movie data could identify subject-specific face, scene, and object regions. While successful, the movie approach was still less effective than a traditional localizer. Having validated our approach in adults, we then used the same methods on movie data collected from 3-12-year-old children (N=122). Movie response timecourses in 3-year-old childrens face, scene, and object regions were already significantly and specifically predicted by timecourses from the corresponding regions in adults. We also found evidence of continued developmental change, particularly in the face-selective posterior superior temporal sulcus. Taken together, our results reveal both early maturity and functional change in face, scene, and object regions, and more broadly highlight the promise of short, child-friendly movies for developmental cognitive neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-task representations in human cortex transform along a sensory-to-motor hierarchy</a></h4>

              
                Human cognition recruits diverse neural processes, yet the organizing computational and functional architectures remain unclear. Here, we characterized the geometry and topography of multi-task representations across human cortex using functional MRI during 26 cognitive tasks in the same subjects. We measured the representational similarity across tasks within a region, and the alignment of representations between regions. We found a cortical topography of representational alignment following a hierarchical sensory-association-motor gradient, revealing compression-then-expansion of multi-task dimensionality along this gradient. To investigate computational principles of multi-task representations, we trained multi-layer neural network models to transform empirical visual to motor representations. Compression-then-expansion organization in models emerged exclusively in a training regime where internal representations are highly optimized for sensory-to-motor transformation, and not under generic signal propagation. This regime produces hierarchically structured representations similar to empirical cortical patterns. Together, these results reveal computational principles that organize multi-task representations across human cortex to support flexible cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structured connectivity in the cerebellum enables noise-resilient pattern separation</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum is thought to detect and correct errors between intended and executed commands1-3 and is critical for social behaviors, cognition and emotion4-6. Computations for motor control must be performed quickly to correct errors in real time and should be sensitive to small differences between patterns for fine error correction while being resilient to noise7. Influential theories of cerebellar information processing have largely assumed random network connectivity, which increases the encoding capacity of the network's first layer8-13. However, maximizing encoding capacity reduces resiliency to noise7. To understand how neuronal circuits address this fundamental tradeoff, we mapped the feedforward connectivity in the mouse cerebellar cortex using automated large-scale transmission electron microscopy (EM) and convolutional neural network-based image segmentation. We found that both the input and output layers of the circuit exhibit redundant and selective connectivity motifs, which contrast with prevailing models. Numerical simulations suggest these redundant, non-random connectivity motifs increase discriminability of similar input patterns at a minimal cost to the network's overall encoding capacity. This work reveals how neuronal network structure can balance encoding capacity and redundancy, unveiling principles of biological network architecture with implications for artificial neural network design.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Highly accurate retinotopic maps of the physiological blind spot in human visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                The physiological blind spot is a naturally occurring scotoma corresponding with the optic disc in the retina of each eye. Even during monocular viewing, observers are usually oblivious to the scotoma, in part because the visual system extrapolates information from the surrounding area. Unfortunately, studying this visual field region with neuroimaging has proven difficult, as it occupies only a small part of retinotopic cortex. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a novel data-driven method for mapping the retinotopic organization in and around the blind spot representation in V1. Our approach allowed for highly accurate reconstructions of the extent of an observer's blind spot, and out-performed conventional model-based analyses. This method opens exciting opportunities to study the plasticity of receptive fields after visual field loss, and our data add to evidence suggesting that the neural circuitry responsible for impressions of perceptual completion across the physiological blind spot most likely involves regions of extrastriate cortex - beyond V1.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The interaction between neural populations: Additive versus diffusive coupling</a></h4>

              
                Models of networks of populations of neurons commonly assume that the interactions between neural populations are via additive or diffusive coupling. When using the additive coupling, a population's activity is affected by the sum of the activities of neighbouring populations. In contrast, when using the diffusive coupling a neural population is affected by the sum of the differences between its activity and the activity of its neighbours. These two coupling functions have been used interchangeably for similar applications. Here, we show that the choice of coupling can lead to strikingly different brain network dynamics. We focus on a model of seizure transitions that has been used both with additive and diffusive coupling in the literature. We consider networks with two and three nodes, and large random and scale-free networks with 64 nodes. We further assess functional networks inferred from magnetoencephalography (MEG) from people with epilepsy and healthy controls. To characterize the seizure dynamics on these networks, we use the escape time, the brain network ictogenicity (BNI) and the node ictogenicity (NI), which are measures of the network's global and local ability to generate seizures. Our main result is that the level of ictogenicity of a network is strongly dependent on the coupling function. We find that people with epilepsy have higher additive BNI than controls, as hypothesized, while the diffusive BNI provides the opposite result. Moreover, individual nodes that are more likely to drive seizures with one type of coupling are more likely to prevent seizures with the other coupling function. Our results on the MEG networks and evidence from the literature suggest that the additive coupling may be a better modelling choice than the diffusive coupling, at least for BNI and NI studies. Thus, we highlight the need to motivate and validate the choice of coupling in future studies.

	<p>The aim of this study is to verify the conditions under which a series of visual stimuli (line segments) will be subjectively perceived as visual lines or surfaces employing four experiments. Two experiments were conducted with the method of subjective evaluation of the line segments, and the other two with the Osgood semantic differential. We analysed five variables (thickness, type, orientation, and colour) potentially responsible for the lines&amp;amp;rsquo; categorisation. The four experiments gave similar results: higher importance of the variables thickness and type; general lower significance of the variable colour; and general insignificance of the variable orientation. Interestingly, for the variable type, straight lines are evaluated as surfaces more frequently than curved lines and perceived as geometrical, flat, hard, static, rough, sharp, bound, sour, frigid, masculine, cold and passive. Curved lines are prevalently evaluated as lines, and categorised as organic, rounded, soft, dynamic, fluffy, blunt, free, sweet, sensual, feminine, warm and active. These results highlight the specificity of perceptual characteristics for the considered variables and confirm the relevance of the characteristics of variables such as thickness and type.</p>

	<p>The Emotional Enhancement of Memory (EEM) has been well-demonstrated in adults, but less is known about EEM in children. The present study tested the impact of emotional valence of pictures on episodic memory using behavioral and neurophysiological measures. Twenty-six 8- to 11-year-old children were tested and compared to 30 young adults. Both groups participated in pictures&amp;amp;rsquo; intentional encoding tasks while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded, followed by immediate free recall tasks. Behavioral results revealed a general EEM in free recall performances in both groups, along with a negativity effect in children. ERP responses revealed a particular sensitivity to negative pictures in children with a late emotion effect at anterior clusters, as well as a greater successful encoding effect for emotional pictures compared to neutral ones. For adults, the emotion effect was more pronounced for positive pictures across all time windows from the centro-parietal to the frontal part, and localized in the left hemisphere. Positive pictures also elicited a greater successful encoding effect at anterior clusters in adults. By combining behavioral and neurophysiological measures to assess the EEM in children compared with adults, our study provides new knowledge concerning the interaction between emotional and memory processes during development.</p>

	<p>The ENCALS survival prediction model offers patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) the opportunity to receive a personalized prognosis of survival at the time of diagnosis. We explored experiences of patients with ALS, caregivers, and physicians with discussing personalized prognosis through interviews with patients and their caregivers, and in a focus group of physicians. Thematic analysis revealed four themes with seven subthemes; these were recognized by the focus group. First, tailored communication: physician&amp;amp;rsquo;s communication style and information provision mediated emotional impact and increased satisfaction with communication. Second, personal factors: coping style, illness experiences, and information needs affected patient and caregiver coping with the prognosis. Third, emotional impact ranged from happy and reassuring to regret. Fourth, regaining control over the future: participants found it helpful in looking towards the future, and emphasized the importance of quality over quantity of life. Personalized prognosis can be discussed with minimal adverse emotional impact. How it is communicated&amp;amp;mdash;i.e., tailored to individual needs&amp;amp;mdash;is as important as what is communicated&amp;amp;mdash;i.e., a good or poor prognosis. Discussing personalized prognosis may help patients with ALS and their caregivers regain control over the future and facilitate planning of the future (care). For many patients, quality of life matters more than quantity of time remaining.</p>

	<p>Research in hearing science is accelerating, and a wealth of data concerning auditory brainstem responses (ABR) in various animal models is published in peer-reviewed journals every year. Recently, we reviewed studies using ABR measurements in tinnitus rat models. We found significant discrepancies in the outcomes of these studies, some due to different research approaches and others due to different methodologies. Thus, the present work aimed to collect comprehensive information on all factors influencing ABR recordings in rats and compile recommendations on ABR data reporting. A questionnaire with queries about animal husbandry, transfer, handling, and the exact test conditions before, during, and after ABR recordings was sent to 125 researchers who published the relevant studies between 2015 and 2021. Eighteen researchers provided detailed answers on factors related to ABR measurements. Based on the analysis of the returned questionnaires, we identified three domains reflecting animal-, equipment-, and experiment-dependent factors that might influence the ABR outcome, thus requiring reporting in published research. The analysis of survey results led to the compilation of recommendations for reporting ABR outcomes supported by a literature review. Following these recommendations should facilitate comparative and meta-analyses of ABR results provided by various research groups.</p>

	<p>Speech fluency is a major challenge for young persons who stutter. Reading aloud, in particular, puts high demands on fluency, not only regarding online text decoding and articulation, but also in terms of prosodic performance. A written text has to be segmented into a number of prosodic phrases with appropriate breaks. The present study examines to what extent reading fluency (decoding ability, articulation rate, and prosodic phrasing) may be altered in children (9&amp;amp;ndash;12 years) and adolescents (13&amp;amp;ndash;17 years) who stutter compared to matched control participants. Read speech of 52 children and adolescents who do and do not stutter was analyzed. Children and adolescents who stutter did not differ from their matched control groups regarding reading accuracy and articulation rate. However, children who stutter produced shorter pauses than their matched peers. Results on prosodic phrasing showed that children who stutter produced more major phrases than the control group and more intermediate phrases than adolescents who stutter. Participants who stutter also displayed a higher number of breath pauses. Generally, the number of disfluencies during reading was related to slower articulation rates and more prosodic boundaries. Furthermore, we found age-related changes in general measures of reading fluency (decoding ability and articulation rate), as well as the overall strength of prosodic boundaries and number of breath pauses. This study provides evidence for developmental stages in prosodic phrasing as well as for alterations in reading fluency in children who stutter.</p>

	<p>In clinical practice, patients with language impairments often exhibit suicidal ideation (SI) and suicidal behavior (SB, covering the entire range from suicide attempts, SA, to completed suicides). However, only few studies exist regarding this subject. We conducted a mini-review on the possible associations between neurologic language impairment (on the motor, comprehension, and semantic sides) and SI/SB. Based on the literature review, we hypothesized that language impairments exacerbate psychiatric comorbidities, which, in turn, aggravate language impairments. Patients trapped in this vicious cycle can develop SI/SB. The so-called &amp;amp;ldquo;affective prosody&amp;amp;rdquo; provides some relevant insights concerning the interaction between the different language levels and the world of emotions. This hypothesis is illustrated in a clinical case that we reported, consisting of the case of a 74-year old woman who was admitted to a psychiatric emergency department (ED) after a failed SA. Having suffered an ischemic stroke two years earlier, she suffered from incomplete Broca&amp;amp;rsquo;s aphasia and dysprosody. She also presented with generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms. We observed that her language impairments were both aggravated by the exacerbations of her anxiety and depressive symptoms. In this patient, who had deficits on the motor side, these exacerbations were triggered by her inability to express herself, her emotional status, and suffering. SI was fluctuant, and&amp;amp;mdash;one year after the SA&amp;amp;mdash;she completed suicide. Further studies are needed to ascertain possible reciprocal and interacting associations between language impairments, psychiatric comorbidities, and SI/SB. They could enable clinicians to better understand their patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s specific suffering, as brought on by language impairment, and contribute to the refining of suicide risk detection in this sub-group of affected patients.</p>

	<p>Drug-resistant epilepsy can be most limiting for patients, and surgery represents a viable therapy option. With the growing research on the human connectome and the evidence of epilepsy being a network disorder, connectivity analysis may be able to contribute to our understanding of epilepsy and may be potentially developed into clinical applications. In this magnetoencephalographic study, we determined the whole-brain node degree of connectivity levels in patients and controls. Resting-state activity was measured at five frequency bands in 15 healthy controls and 15 patients with focal epilepsy of different etiologies. The whole-brain all-to-all imaginary part of coherence in source space was then calculated. Node degree was determined and parcellated and was used for further statistical evaluation. In comparison to controls, we found a significantly higher overall node degree in patients with lesional and non-lesional epilepsy. Furthermore, we examined the conditions of high/reduced vigilance and open/closed eyes in controls, to analyze whether patient node degree levels can be achieved. We evaluated intraclass-correlation statistics (ICC) to evaluate the reproducibility. Connectivity and specifically node degree analysis could present new tools for one of the most common neurological diseases, with potential applications in epilepsy diagnostics.</p>

	<p>A better understanding of the transcriptomic modifications that occur in spina bifida may lead to identify mechanisms involved in the progression of spina bifida in utero and the development of new therapeutic strategies that aid in spinal cord regeneration after surgical interventions. In this study, RNA-sequencing was used to identify differentially expressed genes in fetal spinal cords from rats with retinoic acid-induced spina bifida at E15, E17, and E20. Gene ontology, KEGG, and protein&amp;amp;ndash;protein interaction analysis were conducted to predict pathways involved in the evolution of the disease. Approximately 3000, 1000 and 300 genes were differentially expressed compared to the control groups at E15, E17 and E20, respectively. Overall, the results suggest common alterations in certain pathways between gestational time points, such as upregulation in p53 and sonic hedgehog signaling at E15 and E17 and downregulation in the myelin sheath at E17 and E20. However, there were other modifications specific to gestational time points, including skeletal muscle development at E15, downregulated glucose metabolism at E17, and upregulated inflammation at E20. In conclusion, this work provides evidence that gestational age during spina bifida repair may be a significant variable to consider during the development of new regenerative therapeutics approaches.</p>

	<p>REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) is the polysomnographic (PSG) hallmark of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), a feature essential for the diagnosis of this condition. Several additional neurophysiological aspects of this complex disorder have also recently been investigated in depth, which constitute the focus of this narrative review, together with RSWA. First, we describe the complex neural network underlying REM sleep and its muscle atonia, focusing on the disordered mechanisms leading to RSWA. RSWA is then described in terms of its polysomnographic features, and the methods (visual and automatic) currently available for its scoring and quantification are exposed and discussed. Subsequently, more recent and advanced neurophysiological features of RBD are described, such as electroencephalography during wakefulness and sleep, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and vestibular evoked myogenic potentials. The role of the assessment of neurophysiological features in the study of RBD is then carefully discussed, highlighting their usefulness and sensitivity in detecting neurodegeneration in the early or prodromal stages of RBD, as well as their relationship with other proposed biomarkers for the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of this condition. Finally, a future research agenda is proposed to help clarify the many still unclear aspects of RBD.</p>

	<p>Cognitive impairments and social-function deficits are severe complaints in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients. Empathetic pain perception may be disrupted in NF1 patients because of high-level cognitive deficits. This study investigated the empathy profiles of adult patients with NF1, especially concerning whether explicit and implicit empathetic pain perception are abnormal in this population. We examined empathetic pain perception through a paradigm based on perceiving another person&amp;amp;rsquo;s pain; in this task, patients were required to make judgments about the presence of pain or the laterality of the body part, as shown in a picture. Twenty NF1 patients without obvious social or communication difficulties completed the task, and the results were compared with results from the normal controls (NCs). Regarding explicit empathetic pain processing, i.e., judging the presence of &amp;amp;ldquo;pain&amp;amp;rdquo; or &amp;amp;ldquo;no pain&amp;amp;rdquo;, there were no significant differences between patients and controls in accuracy or reaction time. However, in implicit empathetic processing, i.e., judging the laterality of &amp;amp;ldquo;pain&amp;amp;rdquo; or &amp;amp;ldquo;no-pain&amp;amp;rdquo; pictures, NF1 patients had significantly lower accuracy (p = 0.038) and significantly higher reaction times (p = 0.004) than the NCs. These results were consistent with those of a previous study showing that high-level cognitive deficits were prominent in NF1 patients when performing challenging tasks. The mechanisms and related brain network activity underlying these deficits should receive attention in the future.</p>

	<p>The perception of harmonic complexes provides important information for musical and vocal communication. Numerous studies have shown that musical training and expertise are associated with better processing of harmonic complexes, however, it is unclear whether the perceptual improvement associated with musical training is universal to different pitch models. The current study addresses this issue by measuring discrimination thresholds of musicians (n = 20) and non-musicians (n = 18) to diotic (same sound to both ears) and dichotic (different sounds to each ear) sounds of four stimulus types: (1) pure sinusoidal tones, PT; (2) four-harmonic complex tones, CT; (3) iterated rippled noise, IRN; and (4) interaurally correlated broadband noise, called the &amp;amp;ldquo;Huggins&amp;amp;rdquo; or &amp;amp;ldquo;dichotic&amp;amp;rdquo; pitch, DP. Frequency difference limens (DLF) for each stimulus type were obtained via a three-alternative-forced-choice adaptive task requiring selection of the interval with the highest pitch, yielding the smallest perceptible fundamental frequency (F0) distance (in Hz) between two sounds. Music skill was measured by an online test of musical pitch, melody and timing maintained by the International Laboratory for Brain Music and Sound Research. Musicianship, length of music experience and self-evaluation of musical skill were assessed by questionnaire. Results showed musicians had smaller DLFs in all four conditions with the largest group difference in the dichotic condition. DLF thresholds were related to both subjective and objective musical ability. In addition, subjective self-report of musical ability was shown to be a significant variable in group classification. Taken together, the results suggest that music-related plasticity benefits multiple mechanisms of pitch encoding and that self-evaluation of musicality can be reliably associated with objective measures of perception.</p>

	<p>Background: Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) occurs 18&amp;amp;ndash;24 h after ischaemic stroke and is implicated as a potential cause of early neurological deterioration. Increased resistance to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow after ischaemic stroke is a proposed mechanism for ICP elevation. Ultra-short duration hypothermia prevents ICP elevation 24 h post-stroke in rats. We aimed to determine whether hypothermia would reduce CSF outflow resistance post-stroke. Methods: Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion was performed, followed by gradual cooling to 33 &amp;amp;deg;C. At 18 h post-stroke, CSF outflow resistance was measured using a steady-state infusion method. Results: Hypothermia to 33 &amp;amp;deg;C prevented ICP elevation 18 h post-stroke (hypothermia &amp;amp;#8710;ICP = 0.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.6 mmHg vs. normothermia &amp;amp;#8710;ICP = 4.4 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.0 mmHg, p = 0.04) and reduced infarct volume 24 h post-stroke (hypothermia = 78.6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 21.3 mm3 vs. normothermia = 108.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 17.8 mm3; p = 0.01). Hypothermia to 33 &amp;amp;deg;C did not result in a significant reduction in CSF outflow resistance compared with normothermia controls (0.32 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.36 mmHg/&amp;amp;micro;L/min vs. 1.07 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.99 mmHg/&amp;amp;micro;L/min, p = 0.06). Conclusions: Hypothermia treatment was protective in terms of ICP rise prevention, infarct volume reduction, and may be implicated in CSF outflow resistance post-stroke. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms of ICP elevation and hypothermia treatment.</p>

	<p>Overconsumption of high-calorie or unhealthy foods commonly leads to weight gain. Understanding people&amp;amp;rsquo;s neural responses to high-calorie food cues might help to develop better interventions for preventing or reducing overeating and weight gain. In this review, we conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of viewing high-calorie food cues in both normal-weight people and people with obesity. Electronic databases were searched for relevant articles, retrieving 59 eligible studies containing 2410 unique participants. The results of an activation likelihood estimation indicate large clusters in a range of structures, including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), amygdala, insula/frontal operculum, culmen, as well as the middle occipital gyrus, lingual gyrus, and fusiform gyrus. Conjunction analysis suggested that both normal-weight people and people with obesity activated OFC, supporting that the two groups share common neural substrates of reward processing when viewing high-calorie food cues. The contrast analyses did not show significant activations when comparing obesity with normal-weight. Together, these results provide new important evidence for the neural mechanism underlying high-calorie food cues processing, and new insights into common and distinct brain activations of viewing high-calorie food cues between people with obesity and normal-weight people.</p>

	<p>Stress during the pandemic has had an impact on the mental health of healthcare professionals (HCPs). However, little is known about coping and &amp;amp;ldquo;maladaptive&amp;amp;rdquo; coping behaviours of this population. This study investigates &amp;amp;ldquo;maladaptive&amp;amp;rdquo; coping behaviours and their correlation with stress, anxiety and insomnia of Italian HCPs during the pandemic. It reports on a cross-sectional, descriptive and correlational study based on a survey of 1955 Italian HCPs. Overall participants reported increases in cigarette smoking, time spent online and video playing. Overall reported alcohol consumption decreased but increased in those reporting drinking more than once a week. Those reporting starting smoking during the pandemic were found to have higher SAS and PSS scores. Those reporting being online for 3 or more hours were found to have higher ISS scores. Doctors who reported playing video games were found to have higher PSS, ISS and SAS scores whilst nurses who reported playing video games were found to have higher ISS scores. Doctors who reported playing for longer than one hour had higher PSS scores. Online behaviours may be a coping behaviour of HCPs affected by the pandemic. However, this is an underexplored area for the wellbeing of HCPs. These deficits need to be addressed going forward.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The primary olfactory centres of metazoans as diverse as arthropods and mammals consist of an array of fields of dense synaptic neuropil, the olfactory glomeruli. However, the neurochemical structure of crustacean olfactory glomeruli is largely understudied when compared to the insects. We analysed the glomerular architecture in selected species of hermit crabs using immunohistochemistry against presynaptic proteins, the neuropeptides orcokinin, RFamide and allatostatin, and the biogenic amine serotonin. Our study reveals an unexpected level of structural complexity, unmatched by what is found in the insect olfactory glomeruli. Peptidergic and aminergic interneurons provide the structural basis for a regionalization of the crustacean glomeruli into longitudinal and concentric compartments. Our data suggest that local olfactory interneurons take a central computational role in modulating the information transfer from olfactory sensory neurons to projection neurons within the glomeruli. Furthermore, we found yet unknown neuronal elements mediating lateral inhibitory interactions across the glomerular array that may play a central role in modulating the transfer of sensory input to the output neurons through presynaptic inhibition. Our study is another step in understanding the function of crustacean olfactory glomeruli as highly complex units of local olfactory processing.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Simulation software for spiking neuronal network models matured in the past decades regarding performance and flexibility. But the entry barrier remains high for students and early career scientists in computational neuroscience since these simulators typically require programming skills and a complex installation. Here, we describe an installation-free Graphical User Interface (GUI) running in the web browser, which is distinct from the simulation engine running anywhere, on the student&rsquo;s laptop or on a supercomputer. This architecture provides robustness against technological changes in the software stack and simplifies deployment for self-education and for teachers. Our new open-source tool, NEST Desktop, comprises graphical elements for creating and configuring network models, running simulations, and visualizing and analyzing the results. NEST Desktop allows students to explore important concepts in computational neuroscience without the need to learn a simulator control language before. Our experiences so far highlight that NEST Desktop helps advancing both quality and intensity of teaching in computational neuroscience in regular university courses. We view the availability of the tool on public resources like the European ICT infrastructure for neuroscience EBRAINS as a contribution to equal opportunities.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus has been linked to memory encoding and spatial navigation, while the prefrontal cortex is associated with cognitive functions such as decision-making. These regions are hypothesized to communicate in tasks that demand both spatial navigation and decision-making processes. However, the electrophysiological signatures underlying this communication remain to be better elucidated. To investigate the dynamics of the hippocampal–prefrontal interactions, we have analyzed their local field potentials and spiking activity recorded from rats performing a spatial alternation task on a figure eight-shaped maze. We found that the phase coherence of theta peaked around the choice point area of the maze. Moreover, Granger causality revealed a hippocampus → prefrontal cortex directionality of information flow at theta frequency, peaking at starting areas of the maze, and on the reverse direction at delta frequency, peaking near the turn onset. Additionally, the patterns of phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling within and between the regions also showed spatial selectivity, and hippocampal theta and prefrontal delta modulated not only gamma amplitude but also inter-regional gamma synchrony. Finally, we found that the theta rhythm dynamically modulated neurons in both regions, with the highest modulation at the choice area; interestingly, prefrontal cortex neurons were more strongly modulated by the hippocampal theta rhythm than by their local field rhythm. In all, our results reveal maximum electrophysiological interactions between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex near the decision-making period of the spatial alternation task, corroborating the hypothesis that a dynamic interplay between these regions takes place during spatial decisions.</p>

                Background : This research aimed to examine and analyze risk factors for death, hematologic parameters and coagulation in COVID-19 patients at RSUD Dr. Soetomo Surabaya, one of the referral centers for probable COVID-19 patient cases in East Java. Method : This was a retrospective analytical study by taking secondary data on patients with probable COVID-19 cases who were treated in hospital isolation rooms from May to September, 2020. Result : Of 538 probable COVID-19 patients, 217 were tested positive, with an average age of 52.11±13.12 years, and there were 38 death cases. Hematologic parameters, such as white blood cell, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, showed significantly different result in the deceased group. On the other hand, coagulation parameters, consisting of D-dimer, CRP, PT, and aPTT showed significantly similar value in the deceased group. Univariate analysis concluded that chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, WBC, NLR, and PPT counts could predict the mortality, while multivariate analysis revealed that coronary heart disease was the only significant independent predictor of mortality. Conclusion : This research shows that hematologic and coagulation parameters increased in the majority of COVID-19 patients and the deceased group.  While the number of neutrophils and WBC increases, the number of lymphocytes decreases significantly as the disease gets more severe.. Coronary heart disease is an independent predictor of mortality.

                Introduction: Self-management (SM) interventions are complex interventions and one of the main components of high-quality chronic disease care for which the incorporation of the perspectives of patients and their informal caregivers is crucial. We aim to identify, appraise and synthesise the evidence exploring patients’ and caregivers’ perspectives on SM interventions. More precisely, we aim to 1) describe how they value the importance of outcomes of SM interventions, and 2) identify the factors that might impact on acceptability and feasibility of SM interventions based on their preferences and experiences. Methods and analysis: We will conduct four mixed-methods overviews as part of COMPAR-EU, a European Union (EU) funded project aimed to identify the most effective and cost-effective SM interventions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure (HF), obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We will search in MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO for systematic reviews of studies addressing patients’ preferences on outcomes, or their experiences with SM alongside their disease trajectory or with SM interventions, published in English. Selection of studies and data extraction will be conducted in pairs. We will assess the overlap of studies and methodological quality. We will follow a three-step synthesis process: 1) narrative synthesis for quantitative evidence, 2) thematic synthesis for qualitative evidence, and 3) integration of findings in the interpretation phase. Additionally, we will consult on the relevance of findings with patients and their caregivers. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO CRD42019117867

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dissecting cascade computational components in spiking neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shanshan Jia, Dajun Xing, Zhaofei Yu, Jian K. Liu</p>

Finding out the physical structure of neuronal circuits that governs neuronal responses is an important goal for brain research. With fast advances for large-scale recording techniques, identification of a neuronal circuit with multiple neurons and stages or layers becomes possible and highly demanding. Although methods for mapping the connection structure of circuits have been greatly developed in recent years, they are mostly limited to simple scenarios of a few neurons in a pairwise fashion; and dissecting dynamical circuits, particularly mapping out a complete functional circuit that converges to a single neuron, is still a challenging question. Here, we show that a recent method, termed spike-triggered non-negative matrix factorization (STNMF), can address these issues. By simulating different scenarios of spiking neural networks with various connections between neurons and stages, we demonstrate that STNMF is a persuasive method to dissect functional connections within a circuit. Using spiking activities recorded at neurons of the output layer, STNMF can obtain a complete circuit consisting of all cascade computational components of presynaptic neurons, as well as their spiking activities. For simulated simple and complex cells of the primary visual cortex, STNMF allows us to dissect the pathway of visual computation. Taken together, these results suggest that STNMF could provide a useful approach for investigating neuronal systems leveraging recorded functional neuronal activity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Binding induced functional domain motions in the argonaute characterized by adaptive advanced sampling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Danial Pourjafar-Dehkordi, Martin Zacharias</p>

Argonaute proteins in combination with short microRNA (miRNAs) can target mRNA molecules for translation inhibition or degradation and play a key role in many regulatory processes. The miRNAs act as guide RNAs that associate with Argonaute and the complementary mRNA target region. The complex formation results in activation of Argonaute and specific cleavage of the target mRNA. Both the binding and activation processes involve essential domain rearrangements of functional importance. For the <i>Thermus Thermophilus</i> Argonaute (TtAgo) system guide-bound (binary) and guide/target-bound (ternary) complexes are known but how the binding of guide and target mediate domain movements is still not understood. We have studied the Argonaute domain motion in apo and guide/target bound states using Molecular Dynamics simulations and a Hamiltonian replica exchange (H-REMD) method that employs a specific biasing potential to accelerate domain motions. The H-REMD technique indicates sampling of a much broader distribution of domain arrangements both in the apo as well as binary and ternary complexes compared to regular MD simulations. In the apo state domain arrangements corresponding to more compact (closed) states are mainly sampled which undergo an opening upon guide and guide/target binding. Whereas only limited overlap in domain geometry between apo and bound states was found, a larger similarity in the domain distribution is observed for the simulations of binary and ternary complexes. Comparative simulations on ternary complexes with 15 or 16 base pairs (bp) formed between guide and target strands (instead of 14) resulted in dissociation of the 3’-guide strand from the PAZ domain and domain rearrangement. This agrees with the experimental observation that guide-target pairing beyond 14 bps is required for activation and gives a mechanistic explanation for the experimentally observed activation process.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">HillTau: A fast, compact abstraction for model reduction in biochemical signaling networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Upinder S. Bhalla</p>

Signaling networks mediate many aspects of cellular function. The conventional, mechanistically motivated approach to modeling such networks is through mass-action chemistry, which maps directly to biological entities and facilitates experimental tests and predictions. However such models are complex, need many parameters, and are computationally costly. Here we introduce the HillTau form for signaling models. HillTau retains the direct mapping to biological observables, but it uses far fewer parameters, and is 100 to over 1000 times faster than ODE-based methods. In the HillTau formalism, the steady-state concentration of signaling molecules is approximated by the Hill equation, and the dynamics by a time-course <i>tau</i>. We demonstrate its use in implementing several biochemical motifs, including association, inhibition, feedforward and feedback inhibition, bistability, oscillations, and a synaptic switch obeying the BCM rule. The major use-cases for HillTau are system abstraction, model reduction, scaffolds for data-driven optimization, and fast approximations to complex cellular signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Crowd control: Reducing individual estimation bias by sharing biased social information</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bertrand Jayles, Clément Sire, Ralf H. J. M. Kurvers</p>

Cognitive biases are widespread in humans and animals alike, and can sometimes be reinforced by social interactions. One prime bias in judgment and decision-making is the human tendency to underestimate large quantities. Previous research on social influence in estimation tasks has generally focused on the impact of single estimates on individual and collective accuracy, showing that randomly sharing estimates does not reduce the underestimation bias. Here, we test a method of social information sharing that exploits the known relationship between the true value and the level of underestimation, and study if it can counteract the underestimation bias. We performed estimation experiments in which participants had to estimate a series of quantities twice, before and after receiving estimates from one or several group members. Our purpose was threefold: to study (i) whether restructuring the sharing of social information can reduce the underestimation bias, (ii) how the number of estimates received affects the sensitivity to social influence and estimation accuracy, and (iii) the mechanisms underlying the integration of multiple estimates. Our restructuring of social interactions successfully countered the underestimation bias. Moreover, we find that sharing more than one estimate also reduces the underestimation bias. Underlying our results are a human tendency to herd, to trust larger estimates than one’s own more than smaller estimates, and to follow disparate social information less. Using a computational modeling approach, we demonstrate that these effects are indeed key to explain the experimental results. Overall, our results show that existing knowledge on biases can be used to dampen their negative effects and boost judgment accuracy, paving the way for combating other cognitive biases threatening collective systems.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Sensory coding and contrast invariance emerge from the control of plastic inhibition over emergent selectivity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by René Larisch, Lorenz Gönner, Michael Teichmann, Fred H. Hamker</p>

Visual stimuli are represented by a highly efficient code in the primary visual cortex, but the development of this code is still unclear. Two distinct factors control coding efficiency: Representational efficiency, which is determined by neuronal tuning diversity, and metabolic efficiency, which is influenced by neuronal gain. How these determinants of coding efficiency are shaped during development, supported by excitatory and inhibitory plasticity, is only partially understood. We investigate a fully plastic spiking network of the primary visual cortex, building on phenomenological plasticity rules. Our results suggest that inhibitory plasticity is key to the emergence of tuning diversity and accurate input encoding. We show that inhibitory feedback (random and specific) increases the metabolic efficiency by implementing a gain control mechanism. Interestingly, this led to the spontaneous emergence of contrast-invariant tuning curves. Our findings highlight that (1) interneuron plasticity is key to the development of tuning diversity and (2) that efficient sensory representations are an emergent property of the resulting network.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A confirmation bias in perceptual decision-making due to hierarchical approximate inference</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Richard D. Lange, Ankani Chattoraj, Jeffrey M. Beck, Jacob L. Yates, Ralf M. Haefner</p>

Making good decisions requires updating beliefs according to new evidence. This is a dynamical process that is prone to biases: in some cases, beliefs become entrenched and resistant to new evidence (leading to primacy effects), while in other cases, beliefs fade over time and rely primarily on later evidence (leading to recency effects). How and why either type of bias dominates in a given context is an important open question. Here, we study this question in classic perceptual decision-making tasks, where, puzzlingly, previous empirical studies differ in the kinds of biases they observe, ranging from primacy to recency, despite seemingly equivalent tasks. We present a new model, based on hierarchical approximate inference and derived from normative principles, that not only explains both primacy and recency effects in existing studies, but also predicts how the type of bias should depend on the statistics of stimuli in a given task. We verify this prediction in a novel visual discrimination task with human observers, finding that each observer’s temporal bias changed as the result of changing the key stimulus statistics identified by our model. The key dynamic that leads to a primacy bias in our model is an overweighting of new sensory information that agrees with the observer’s existing belief—a type of ‘confirmation bias’. By fitting an extended drift-diffusion model to our data we rule out an alternative explanation for primacy effects due to bounded integration. Taken together, our results resolve a major discrepancy among existing perceptual decision-making studies, and suggest that a key source of bias in human decision-making is approximate hierarchical inference.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Protein domain-based prediction of drug/compound–target interactions and experimental validation on LIM kinases</a></h4>

Predictive approaches such as virtual screening have been used in drug discovery with the objective of reducing developmental time and costs. Current machine learning and network-based approaches have issues related to generalization, usability, or model interpretability, especially due to the complexity of target proteins’ structure/function, and bias in system training datasets. Here, we propose a new method “DRUIDom” (DRUg Interacting Domain prediction) to identify bio-interactions between drug candidate compounds and targets by utilizing the domain modularity of proteins, to overcome problems associated with current approaches. DRUIDom is composed of two methodological steps. First, ligands/compounds are statistically mapped to structural domains of their target proteins, with the aim of identifying their interactions. As such, other proteins containing the same mapped domain or domain pair become new candidate targets for the corresponding compounds. Next, a million-scale dataset of small molecule compounds, including those mapped to domains in the previous step, are clustered based on their molecular similarities, and their domain associations are propagated to other compounds within the same clusters. Experimentally verified bioactivity data points, obtained from public databases, are meticulously filtered to construct datasets of active/interacting and inactive/non-interacting drug/compound–target pairs (~2.9M data points), and used as training data for calculating parameters of compound–domain mappings, which led to 27,032 high-confidence associations between 250 domains and 8,165 compounds, and a finalized output of ~5 million new compound–protein interactions. DRUIDom is experimentally validated by syntheses and bioactivity analyses of compounds predicted to target LIM-kinase proteins, which play critical roles in the regulation of cell motility, cell cycle progression, and differentiation through actin filament dynamics. We showed that LIMK-inhibitor-2 and its derivatives significantly block the cancer cell migration through inhibition of LIMK phosphorylation and the downstream protein cofilin. One of the derivative compounds (LIMKi-2d) was identified as a promising candidate due to its action on resistant Mahlavu liver cancer cells. The results demonstrated that DRUIDom can be exploited to identify drug candidate compounds for intended targets and to predict new target proteins based on the defined compound–domain relationships. Datasets, results, and the source code of DRUIDom are fully-available at: https://github.com/cansyl/DRUIDom.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Integrating deep learning with microfluidics for biophysical classification of sickle red blood cells adhered to laminin</a></h4>

Sickle cell disease, a genetic disorder affecting a sizeable global demographic, manifests in sickle red blood cells (sRBCs) with altered shape and biomechanics. sRBCs show heightened adhesive interactions with inflamed endothelium, triggering painful vascular occlusion events. Numerous studies employ microfluidic-assay-based monitoring tools to quantify characteristics of adhered sRBCs from high resolution channel images. The current image analysis workflow relies on detailed morphological characterization and cell counting by a specially trained worker. This is time and labor intensive, and prone to user bias artifacts. Here we establish a morphology based classification scheme to identify two naturally arising sRBC subpopulations—deformable and non-deformable sRBCs—utilizing novel visual markers that link to underlying cell biomechanical properties and hold promise for clinically relevant insights. We then set up a standardized, reproducible, and fully automated image analysis workflow designed to carry out this classification. This relies on a two part deep neural network architecture that works in tandem for segmentation of channel images and classification of adhered cells into subtypes. Network training utilized an extensive data set of images generated by the SCD BioChip, a microfluidic assay which injects clinical whole blood samples into protein-functionalized microchannels, mimicking physiological conditions in the microvasculature. Here we carried out the assay with the sub-endothelial protein laminin. The machine learning approach segmented the resulting channel images with 99.1±0.3% mean IoU on the validation set across 5 <i>k</i>-folds, classified detected sRBCs with 96.0±0.3% mean accuracy on the validation set across 5 <i>k</i>-folds, and matched trained personnel in overall characterization of whole channel images with <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.992, 0.987 and 0.834 for total, deformable and non-deformable sRBC counts respectively. Average analysis time per channel image was also improved by two orders of magnitude (∼ 2 minutes vs ∼ 2-3 hours) over manual characterization. Finally, the network results show an order of magnitude less variance in counts on repeat trials than humans. This kind of standardization is a prerequisite for the viability of any diagnostic technology, making our system suitable for affordable and high throughput disease monitoring.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bayesian calibration of a stochastic, multiscale agent-based model for predicting in vitro tumor growth</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ernesto A. B. F. Lima, Danial Faghihi, Russell Philley, Jianchen Yang, John Virostko, Caleb M. Phillips, Thomas E. Yankeelov</p>

Hybrid multiscale agent-based models (ABMs) are unique in their ability to simulate individual cell interactions and microenvironmental dynamics. Unfortunately, the high computational cost of modeling individual cells, the inherent stochasticity of cell dynamics, and numerous model parameters are fundamental limitations of applying such models to predict tumor dynamics. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a coarse-grained two-scale ABM (cgABM) with a reduced parameter space that allows for an accurate and efficient calibration using a set of time-resolved microscopy measurements of cancer cells grown with different initial conditions. The multiscale model consists of a reaction-diffusion type model capturing the spatio-temporal evolution of glucose and growth factors in the tumor microenvironment (at tissue scale), coupled with a lattice-free ABM to simulate individual cell dynamics (at cellular scale). The experimental data consists of BT474 human breast carcinoma cells initialized with different glucose concentrations and tumor cell confluences. The confluence of live and dead cells was measured every three hours over four days. Given this model, we perform a time-dependent global sensitivity analysis to identify the relative importance of the model parameters. The subsequent cgABM is calibrated within a Bayesian framework to the experimental data to estimate model parameters, which are then used to predict the temporal evolution of the living and dead cell populations. To this end, a moment-based Bayesian inference is proposed to account for the stochasticity of the cgABM while quantifying uncertainties due to limited temporal observational data. The cgABM reduces the computational time of ABM simulations by 93% to 97% while staying within a 3% difference in prediction compared to ABM. Additionally, the cgABM can reliably predict the temporal evolution of breast cancer cells observed by the microscopy data with an average error and standard deviation for live and dead cells being 7.61±2.01 and 5.78±1.13, respectively.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Estimating the dimensionality of the manifold underlying multi-electrode neural recordings</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ege Altan, Sara A. Solla, Lee E. Miller, Eric J. Perreault</p>

It is generally accepted that the number of neurons in a given brain area far exceeds the number of neurons needed to carry any specific function controlled by that area. For example, motor areas of the human brain contain tens of millions of neurons that control the activation of tens or at most hundreds of muscles. This massive redundancy implies the covariation of many neurons, which constrains the population activity to a low-dimensional manifold within the space of all possible patterns of neural activity. To gain a conceptual understanding of the complexity of the neural activity within a manifold, it is useful to estimate its dimensionality, which quantifies the number of degrees of freedom required to describe the observed population activity without significant information loss. While there are many algorithms for dimensionality estimation, we do not know which are well suited for analyzing neural activity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of several representative algorithms for estimating the dimensionality of linearly and nonlinearly embedded data. We generated synthetic neural recordings with known intrinsic dimensionality and used them to test the algorithms’ accuracy and robustness. We emulated some of the important challenges associated with experimental data by adding noise, altering the nature of the embedding of the low-dimensional manifold within the high-dimensional recordings, varying the dimensionality of the manifold, and limiting the amount of available data. We demonstrated that linear algorithms overestimate the dimensionality of nonlinear, noise-free data. In cases of high noise, most algorithms overestimated the dimensionality. We thus developed a denoising algorithm based on deep learning, the “Joint Autoencoder”, which significantly improved subsequent dimensionality estimation. Critically, we found that all algorithms failed when the intrinsic dimensionality was high (above 20) or when the amount of data used for estimation was low. Based on the challenges we observed, we formulated a pipeline for estimating the dimensionality of experimental neural data.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">snpQT: flexible, reproducible, and comprehensive quality control and imputation of genomic data [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Quality control of genomic data is an essential but complicated multi-step procedure, often requiring separate installation and expert familiarity with a combination of different bioinformatics tools. Software incompatibilities, and inconsistencies across computing environments, are recurrent challenges, leading to poor reproducibility. Existing semi-automated or automated solutions lack comprehensive quality checks, flexible workflow architecture, and user control. To address these challenges, we have developed snpQT: a scalable, stand-alone software pipeline using nextflow and BioContainers, for comprehensive, reproducible and interactive quality control of human genomic data. snpQT offers some 36 discrete quality filters or correction steps in a complete standardised pipeline, producing graphical reports to demonstrate the state of data before and after each quality control procedure. This includes human genome build conversion, population stratification against data from the 1,000 Genomes Project, automated population outlier removal, and built-in imputation with its own pre- and post- quality controls.

                Background: Plant products, including seeds are an important source of vitamins, minerals, proteins, and energy. This study aimed to assess parasitic contaminations in roasted groundnuts, nabag, and tasali (watermelon seeds) sold by street vendors in Khartoum State, Sudan. Methods: The frequency of parasitic contaminations among all crop products was detected by washing the plants with saline, and then conducting an examination using a formal ether concentration technique (FECT), followed by a saturated sugar floatation technique. Results: The detected parasites belonged to two species: Entamoeba histolytica (33.3%) and Giardia lamblia (15.6%). No helminthic parasites were detected. Mixed contamination of the mentioned parasites was also observed (11.1%). The most contaminated crop was nabag, followed by groundnut, and finally tasali. Conclusion: No relation was established between the positivity of samples for parasites and crop type, Khartoum State city, or  seller sex. FECT was more sensitive than the saturated sugar floatation technique as a detection method.

                Background: Osteoporosis is the most prevalent metabolic disease affecting bones. Objective: To investigate the long-term effect of pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) combined with exercise protocol on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone markers in men with osteopenia or osteoporosis. Methods: Ninety-five males with osteopenia or osteoporosis (mean age, 51.26 ± 2.41 years; mean height, 176 ± 2.02 cm; mean weight, 83.08 ± 2.60 kg; mean body–mass index (BMI), 26.08 ± 1.09 kg/m2) participated in the study, and they were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Group 1 received a full-body PEMF and exercise protocol (PEMF +EX), Group 2 received a placebo full-body PEMF and exercise protocol (PPEMF +EX), and Group 3 received a full-body PEMF alone (PEMF). PEMF was applied for the whole body using a full-body mat three times per week for 12 weeks, with an exercise protocol that includes flexibility, aerobic exercise, strengthening, weight-bearing, and balance exercises followed by whole-body vibration (WBV) training. Outcome measures include BMD of total hip and lumbar spine and bone markers [serum osteocalcin (s-OC), Serum amino-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (s-NTX), Serum carboxy-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (s-CTX), Parathyroid hormones (PTH), Bone-specific Alkaline Phosphatase (BSAP), and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (Vit D)]. Results: The BMD of total hip and lumbar spine was significantly increased post-treatment in all groups, and more so in Group 1 and Group 2 than Group 3. There was a significant difference in bone markers in all groups, more so in Group 1 and Group 2 than in Group 3. Conclusion: PEMF combined with exercise protocol exerts a potent role for treating OP, is more effective than exercise and PEMF alone for increasing BMD and enhancing bone formation, and suppresses bone-resorption markers after 12-weeks of treatment with the impact lasting up to 6 months.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An empirical study on Resource Description Framework reification for trustworthiness in knowledge graphs [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Knowledge graph (KG) publishes machine-readable representation of knowledge on the Web. Structured data in the knowledge graph is published using Resource Description Framework (RDF) where knowledge is represented as a triple (subject, predicate, object). Due to the presence of erroneous, outdated or conflicting data in the knowledge graph, the quality of facts cannot be guaranteed. Trustworthiness of facts in knowledge graph can be enhanced by the addition of metadata like the source of information, location and time of the fact occurrence. Since RDF does not support metadata for providing provenance and contextualization, an alternate method, RDF reification is employed by most of the knowledge graphs. RDF reification increases the magnitude of data as several statements are required to represent a single fact. Another limitation for applications that uses provenance data like in the medical domain and in cyber security is that not all facts in these knowledge graphs are annotated with provenance data. In this paper, we have provided an overview of prominent reification approaches together with the analysis of popular, general knowledge graphs Wikidata and YAGO4 with regard to the representation of provenance and context data. Wikidata employs qualifiers to include metadata to facts, while YAGO4 collects metadata from Wikidata qualifiers. However, facts in Wikidata and YAGO4 can be fetched without using reification to cater for applications that do not require metadata. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that investigates the method and the extent of metadata covered by two prominent KGs, Wikidata and YAGO4.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although the presymptomatic stages of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) provide a unique chance to delay or even prevent neurodegeneration by early intervention, they remain poorly defined. Leveraging a large multicenter cohort of genetic FTD mutation carriers, we provide a biomarker-based stratification and biomarker cascade of the likely most treatment-relevant stage within the presymptomatic phase: the conversion stage.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We longitudinally assessed serum levels of neurofilament light (NfL) and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy (pNfH) in the Genetic FTD Initiative (GENFI) cohort (n = 444), using single-molecule array technique. Subjects comprised 91 symptomatic and 179 presymptomatic subjects with mutations in the FTD genes <i>C9orf72</i>, <i>GRN</i>, or <i>MAPT</i>, and 174 mutation-negative within-family controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In a biomarker cascade, NfL increase preceded the hypothetical clinical onset by 15 years and concurred with brain atrophy onset, whereas pNfH increase started close to clinical onset. The conversion stage was marked by increased NfL, but still normal pNfH levels, while both were increased at the symptomatic stage. Intra-individual change rates were increased for NfL at the conversion stage and for pNfH at the symptomatic stage, highlighting their respective potential as stage-dependent dynamic biomarkers within the biomarker cascade. Increased NfL levels and NfL change rates allowed identification of presymptomatic subjects converting to symptomatic disease and capture of proximity-to-onset. We estimate stage-dependent sample sizes for trials aiming to decrease neurofilament levels or change rates.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Blood NfL and pNfH provide dynamic stage-dependent stratification and, potentially, treatment response biomarkers in presymptomatic FTD, allowing demarcation of the conversion stage. The proposed biomarker cascade might pave the way towards a biomarker-based precision medicine approach to genetic FTD. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the safety and effectiveness of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) versus vitamin K antagonists (VKA) after recent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) aged ≥85 years.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Individual patient data analysis from seven prospective stroke cohorts. We compared DOAC versus VKA treatment among patients with AF and recent stroke (&lt;3 months) aged ≥85 versus &lt;85 years. Primary outcome was the composite of recurrent stroke, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and all-cause death. We used simple, adjusted, and weighted Cox regression to account for confounders. We calculated the net benefit of DOAC versus VKA by balancing stroke reduction against the weighted ICH risk.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In total, 5,984 of 6,267 (95.5%) patients were eligible for analysis. Of those, 1,380 (23%) were aged ≥85 years and 3,688 (62%) received a DOAC. During 6,874 patient-years follow-up, the impact of anticoagulant type (DOAC versus VKA) on the hazard for the composite outcome did not differ between patients aged ≥85 (HR<sub>≥85y</sub> = 0.65, 95%-CI [0.52, 0.81]) and &lt; 85 years (HR<sub>&lt;85y</sub> = 0.79, 95%-CI [0.66, 0.95]) in simple (p<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.129), adjusted (p<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.094) or weighted (p<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.512) models. Analyses on recurrent stroke, ICH and death separately were consistent with the primary analysis, as were sensitivity analyses using age dichotomized at 90 years and as a continuous variable. DOAC had a similar net clinical benefit in patients aged ≥85 (+1.73 to +2.66) and &lt; 85 years (+1.90 to +3.36 events/100 patient-years for ICH-weights 1.5 to 3.1).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The favorable profile of DOAC over VKA in patients with AF and recent stroke was maintained in the oldest old. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                Background Gura-Ferda forest is one of the Afromontane rainforests in the southwestern region of Ethiopia. However, since 1984, large parts of this forest have become increasingly disturbed and fragmented due to forest conversion into forest farm interface and farmlands. The study was conducted to assess changes of woody species diversity and carbon stock in association with the conversion of natural forest to forest farm interface and farmlands. Methods Data were collected from natural forest, forest farm interface and farmland which are historically forest lands before 1984. A total of 90 nested plots (20m×20m for natural forest and forest farm interface; 50m*100m for farmland)) were established for inventory of woody species. Three 1m×1m subplots were established to collect litter and soil samples. A total of 180 soil samples were collected. The total carbon stocks were estimated by summing carbon stock in the biomass and soil (0-60 cm depth). Results Results showed that Shannon-Wiener diversity (H’) in forest farm interface (H’ = 1.42±0.49) is significantly lower than that of natural forest (H’ = 2.72±0.31) but significantly higher than farmland (H’ = 1.08±0.57). The total carbon stocks of natural forest (388.54±161.63 Mg C ha-1) were approximately 1.53 and 2.67 times higher than that of forest farm interface (252.95±41.86 Mg C ha-1) and farmland (145.58±25.94 Mg C ha-1). Conclusion Our study revealed that along the conversion gradient of natural forest to forest farm interface and farmland there was a significant change of woody species diversity and carbon stocks.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Mitochondrial dysfunction as a trigger of programmed axon death</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial failure has long been associated with programmed axon death (Wallerian degeneration, WD), a widespread and potentially preventable mechanism of axon degeneration. While early findings in axotomised axons indicated that mitochondria are involved during the execution steps of this pathway, recent studies suggest that in addition, mitochondrial dysfunction can initiate programmed axon death without physical injury. As mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with disorders involving early axon loss, including Parkinson’s disease, peripheral neuropathies, and multiple sclerosis, the findings that programmed axon death is activated by mitochondrial impairment could indicate the involvement of druggable mechanisms whose disruption may protect axons in such diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Expression of a CO2-permeable aquaporin enhances mesophyll conductance in the C4 species Setaria viridis</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental limitation of photosynthetic carbon fixation is the availability of CO<sub>2</sub>. In C<sub>4</sub> plants, primary carboxylation occurs in mesophyll cytosol, and little is known about the role of CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion in facilitating C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. We have examined the expression, localization, and functional role of selected plasma membrane intrinsic aquaporins (PIPs) from <i>Setaria italica </i>(foxtail millet) and discovered that <i>SiPIP2;7 </i>is CO<sub>2</sub>-permeable. When ectopically expressed in mesophyll cells of <i>S. viridis</i> (green foxtail), SiPIP2;7 was localized to the plasma membrane and caused no marked changes in leaf biochemistry. Gas-exchange and C<sup>18</sup>O<sup>16</sup>O discrimination measurements revealed that targeted expression of SiPIP2;7 enhanced the conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion from the intercellular airspace to the mesophyll cytosol. Our results demonstrate that mesophyll conductance limits C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis at low <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> and that SiPIP2;7 is a functional CO<sub>2</sub> permeable aquaporin that can improve CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion at the airspace/mesophyll interface and enhance C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Effects of arousal and movement on secondary somatosensory and visual thalamus</a></h4>

              
                Neocortical sensory areas have associated primary and secondary thalamic nuclei. While primary nuclei transmit sensory information to cortex, secondary nuclei remain poorly understood. We recorded juxtasomally from secondary somatosensory (POm) and visual (LP) nuclei of awake mice while tracking whisking and pupil size. POm activity correlated with whisking, but not precise whisker kinematics. This coarse movement modulation persisted after facial paralysis and thus was not due to sensory reafference. This phenomenon also continued during optogenetic silencing of somatosensory and motor cortex and after lesion of superior colliculus, ruling out a motor efference copy mechanism. Whisking and pupil dilation were strongly correlated, possibly reflecting arousal. Indeed LP, which is not part of the whisker system, tracked whisking equally well, further indicating that POm activity does not encode whisker movement per se. The semblance of movement-related activity is likely instead a global effect of arousal on both nuclei. We conclude that secondary thalamus monitors behavioral state, rather than movement, and may exist to alter cortical activity accordingly.
