              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10626">Shannon information and integrated information: message and meaning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.10626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information theory, introduced by Shannon, has been extremely successful and influential as a mathematical theory of communication. Shannon's notion of information does not consider the meaning of the messages being communicated but only their probability. Even so, computational approaches regularly appeal to "information processing" to study how meaning is encoded and decoded in natural and artificial systems. Here, we contrast Shannon information theory with integrated information theory (IIT), which was developed to account for the presence and properties of consciousness. IIT considers meaning as integrated information and characterizes it as a structure, rather than as a message or code. In principle, IIT's axioms and postulates allow one to "unfold" a cause-effect structure from a substrate in a state, a structure that fully defines the intrinsic meaning of an experience and its contents. It follows that, for the communication of meaning, the cause-effect structures of sender and receiver must be similar.

Abstract: Exbodiment describes mind outsourced to engineered matter and how matter reeducates mind. The constraints of exbodied matter encode elements of thought, channel decision-making, and constitute an important part of an extended computational phenotype. Here I provide an introduction and brief cultural history of exbodiment in music, natural history, cognition, and astrobiology. The "Helix of Exbodiment" is introduced to illustrate continuous feedback between mind and matter.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12053">The lack of asymmetry of the Maxwell centroids, and of ocular dominance, in persons with dyslexia</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.12053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the existence of an asymmetry between the two Maxwell centroids at the centre of the two foveas recorded using a foveascope, leads to the ocular dominance in good readers, the lack of asymmetry in most of the observers with dyslexia leads to their non-dominance and their difficulties in reading and writing. Indeed, the lack of asymmetry between the two main roads to the brain, i.e. the two optical nerves, leads to perturbations in the brain central connectivity, namely between the two hemispheres inducing too robust interhemispheric visual connections, beyond the critical period of 7-8 years. The symmetrical mirror-connections like b-d (observed for about 60% of children with dyslexia) or the non-symmetrical connections like b-b (35%) induce confusions and duplications in observers with dyslexia but remain erasable thanks to pulsed systems (glasses, lamps, screens. . .), using Hebbian processes in primary cortex synapses. The effect is instantaneous, non-invasive and compensates the lack of asymmetry. These systems help most of the observers with dyslexia to overcome their difficulties. The orthoptists and speech therapists can acquire and improve the mechanism to help the children to catch up, and perhaps be able to use the foveascope for an early diagnosis with young children.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15234">Adaptive Intelligence: leveraging insights from adaptive behavior in animals to build flexible AI systems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.15234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological intelligence is inherently adaptive -- animals continually adjust their actions based on environmental feedback. However, creating adaptive artificial intelligence (AI) remains a major challenge. The next frontier is to go beyond traditional AI to develop "adaptive intelligence," defined here as harnessing insights from biological intelligence to build agents that can learn online, generalize, and rapidly adapt to changes in their environment. Recent advances in neuroscience offer inspiration through studies that increasingly focus on how animals naturally learn and adapt their world models. In this Perspective, I will review the behavioral and neural foundations of adaptive biological intelligence, the parallel progress in AI, and explore brain-inspired approaches for building more adaptive algorithms.

                arXiv:2406.19104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scale invariance profoundly influences the dynamics and structure of complex systems, spanning from critical phenomena to network architecture. Here, we propose a precise definition of scale-invariant networks by leveraging the concept of a constant entropy-loss rate across scales in a renormalization-group coarse-graining setting. This framework enables us to differentiate between scale-free and scale-invariant networks, revealing distinct characteristics within each class. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive inventory of genuinely scale-invariant networks, both natural and artificially constructed, demonstrating, e.g., that the human connectome exhibits notable features of scale invariance. Our findings open new avenues for exploring the scale-invariant structural properties crucial in biological and socio-technological systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00332">Vision Language Models Know Law of Conservation without Understanding More-or-Less</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.00332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conservation is a critical milestone of cognitive development considered to be supported by both the understanding of quantitative concepts and the reversibility of mental operations. To assess whether this critical component of human intelligence has emerged in Vision Language Models, we leverage the ConserveBench from CogDevelop2K, a data-intensive cognitive experiment benchmark for assaying the developmental trajectory of machine intelligence. The battery includes over 350 questions across four dimensions of physical quantities: volume, solid quantity, length, and number. The former two involve only transformational tasks, whereas the latter two also involve non-transformational tasks assessing the understanding of quantitative concepts alone. Surprisingly, we find that while VLMs are generally capable of conserving, they tend to fail at non-transformational tasks which success is typically considered to be entailed by the ability to conserve. This implies that the law of conservation, at least in concrete domains, may exist without corresponding conceptual understanding of quantity. $\href{https://growing-ai-like-a-child.github.io/pages/Conservation/}{Website}$

                arXiv:2410.10596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the earliest proposals for neural network models of the mind and brain, critics have pointed out key weaknesses in these models compared to human cognitive abilities. Here we review recent work that uses metalearning to overcome several classic challenges by addressing the Problem of Incentive and Practice -- that is, providing machines with both incentives to improve specific skills and opportunities to practice those skills. This explicit optimization contrasts with more conventional approaches that hope the desired behavior will emerge through optimizing related but different objectives. We review applications of this principle to addressing four classic challenges for neural networks: systematic generalization, catastrophic forgetting, few-shot learning and multi-step reasoning. We also discuss the prospects for understanding aspects of human development through this framework, and whether natural environments provide the right incentives and practice for learning how to make challenging generalizations.

                arXiv:2412.10389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing complexity and energy demands of deep learning models have highlighted the limitations of traditional computing architectures, especially for edge devices with constrained resources. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative by mimicking biological neural networks, enabling energy-efficient computation through event-driven processing and temporal encoding. Concurrently, emerging hardware technologies like Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM) and Compute-in-Memory (CIM) architectures aim to overcome the Von Neumann bottleneck by integrating storage and computation. This survey explores the intersection of SNNs and ReRAM-based CIM architectures, focusing on the reliability challenges that arise from device-level variations and operational errors. We review the fundamental principles of SNNs and ReRAM crossbar arrays, discuss the inherent reliability issues in both technologies, and summarize existing solutions to mitigate these challenges.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11112">Populating cellular metamaterials on the extrema of attainable elasticity through neuroevolution</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.11112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trade-offs between different mechanical properties of materials pose fundamental challenges in engineering material design, such as balancing stiffness versus toughness, weight versus energy-absorbing capacity, and among the various elastic coefficients. Although gradient-based topology optimization approaches have been effective in finding specific designs and properties, they are not efficient tools for surveying the vast design space of metamaterials, and thus unable to reveal the attainable bound of interdependent material properties. Other common methods, such as parametric design or data-driven approaches, are limited by either the lack of diversity in geometry or the difficulty to extrapolate from known data, respectively. In this work, we formulate the simultaneous exploration of multiple competing material properties as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem and employ a neuroevolution algorithm to efficiently solve it. The Compositional Pattern-Producing Networks (CPPNs) is used as the generative model for unit cell designs, which provide very compact yet lossless encoding of geometry. A modified Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm is employed to evolve the CPPNs such that they create metamaterial designs on the Pareto front of the MOO problem, revealing empirical bounds of different combinations of elastic properties. Looking ahead, our method serves as a universal framework for the computational discovery of diverse metamaterials across a range of fields, including robotics, biomedicine, thermal engineering, and photonics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11684">Runtime Analysis for Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms in Unbounded Integer Spaces</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.11684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized search heuristics have been applied successfully to a plethora of problems. This success is complemented by a large body of theoretical results. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these results regard problems with binary or continuous decision variables -- the theoretical analysis of randomized search heuristics for unbounded integer domains is almost nonexistent. To resolve this shortcoming, we start the runtime analysis of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, which are among the most successful randomized search heuristics, for unbounded integer search spaces. We analyze single- and full-dimensional mutation operators with three different mutation strengths, namely changes by plus/minus one (unit strength), random changes following a law with exponential tails, and random changes following a power-law. The performance guarantees we prove on a recently proposed natural benchmark problem suggest that unit mutation strengths can be slow when the initial solutions are far from the Pareto front. When setting the expected change right (depending on the benchmark parameter and the distance of the initial solutions), the mutation strength with exponential tails yields the best runtime guarantees in our results -- however, with a wrong choice of this expectation, the performance guarantees quickly become highly uninteresting. With power-law mutation, which is an essentially parameter-less mutation operator, we obtain good results uniformly over all problem parameters and starting points. We complement our mathematical findings with experimental results that suggest that our bounds are not always tight. Most prominently, our experiments indicate that power-law mutation outperforms the one with exponential tails even when the latter uses a near-optimal parametrization. Hence, we suggest to favor power-law mutation for unknown problems in integer spaces.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11810">Optimal Gradient Checkpointing for Sparse and Recurrent Architectures using Off-Chip Memory</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.11810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are valued for their computational efficiency and reduced memory requirements on tasks involving long sequence lengths but require high memory-processor bandwidth to train. Checkpointing techniques can reduce the memory requirements by only storing a subset of intermediate states, the checkpoints, but are still rarely used due to the computational overhead of the additional recomputation phase. This work addresses these challenges by introducing memory-efficient gradient checkpointing strategies tailored for the general class of sparse RNNs and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). SNNs are energy efficient alternatives to RNNs thanks to their local, event-driven operation and potential neuromorphic implementation. We use the Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU) as an exemplary platform for architectures with distributed local memory. We exploit its suitability for sparse and irregular workloads to scale SNN training on long sequence lengths. We find that Double Checkpointing emerges as the most effective method, optimizing the use of local memory resources while minimizing recomputation overhead. This approach reduces dependency on slower large-scale memory access, enabling training on sequences over 10 times longer or 4 times larger networks than previously feasible, with only marginal time overhead. The presented techniques demonstrate significant potential to enhance scalability and efficiency in training sparse and recurrent networks across diverse hardware platforms, and highlights the benefits of sparse activations for scalable recurrent neural network training.

                arXiv:2412.11931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm~II (NSGA-II) is the most popular multi-objective optimization heuristic. Recent mathematical runtime analyses have detected two shortcomings in discrete search spaces, namely, that the NSGA-II has difficulties with more than two objectives and that it is very sensitive to the choice of the population size. To overcome these difficulties, we analyze a simple tie-breaking rule in the selection of the next population. Similar rules have been proposed before, but have found only little acceptance. We prove the effectiveness of our tie-breaking rule via mathematical runtime analyses on the classic OneMinMax, LeadingOnesTrailingZeros, and OneJumpZeroJump benchmarks. We prove that this modified NSGA-II can optimize the three benchmarks efficiently also for many objectives, in contrast to the exponential lower runtime bound previously shown for OneMinMax with three or more objectives. For the bi-objective problems, we show runtime guarantees that do not increase when moderately increasing the population size over the minimum admissible size. For example, for the OneJumpZeroJump problem with representation length $n$ and gap parameter $k$, we show a runtime guarantee of $O(\max\{n^{k+1},Nn\})$ function evaluations when the population size is at least four times the size of the Pareto front. For population sizes larger than the minimal choice $N = \Theta(n)$, this result improves considerably over the $\Theta(Nn^k)$ runtime of the classic NSGA-II.

                arXiv:2412.12016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of individual movement characteristics sets the foundation for the assessment of personal rehabilitation progress and can provide diagnostic information on levels and stages of movement disorders. This work presents a preliminary study for differentiating individual motion patterns using a dataset of 3D upper-limb transport trajectories measured in task-space. Identifying individuals by deep time series learning can be a key step to abstracting individual motion properties. In this study, a classification accuracy of about 95% is reached for a subset of nine, and about 78% for the full set of 31 individuals. This provides insights into the separability of patient attributes by exerting a simple standardized task to be transferred to portable systems.

                arXiv:2412.10461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Class imbalance would lead to biased classifiers that favor the majority class and disadvantage the minority class. Unfortunately, from a practical perspective, the minority class is of importance in many real-life applications. Hybrid sampling methods address this by oversampling the minority class to increase the number of its instances, followed by undersampling to remove low-quality instances. However, most existing sampling methods face difficulties in generating diverse high-quality instances and often fail to remove noise or low-quality instances on a larger scale effectively. This paper therefore proposes an evolutionary multi-granularity hybrid sampling method, called EvoSampling. During the oversampling process, genetic programming (GP) is used with multi-task learning to effectively and efficiently generate diverse high-quality instances. During the undersampling process, we develop a granular ball-based undersampling method that removes noise in a multi-granular fashion, thereby enhancing data quality. Experiments on 20 imbalanced datasets demonstrate that EvoSampling effectively enhances the performance of various classification algorithms by providing better datasets than existing sampling methods. Besides, ablation studies further indicate that allowing knowledge transfer accelerates the GP's evolutionary learning process.

Abstract: Quality diversity (QD) algorithms have shown to provide sets of high quality solutions for challenging problems in robotics, games, and combinatorial optimisation. So far, theoretical foundational explaining their good behaviour in practice lack far behind their practical success. We contribute to the theoretical understanding of these algorithms and study the behaviour of QD algorithms for a classical planning problem seeking several solutions. We study the all-pairs-shortest-paths (APSP) problem which gives a natural formulation of the behavioural space based on all pairs of nodes of the given input graph that can be used by Map-Elites QD algorithms. Our results show that Map-Elites QD algorithms are able to compute a shortest path for each pair of nodes efficiently in parallel. Furthermore, we examine parent selection techniques for crossover that exhibit significant speed ups compared to the standard QD approach.

Abstract: Neural networks are being used to improve the probing of the state spaces of many particle systems as approximations to wavefunctions and in order to avoid the recurring sign problem of quantum monte-carlo. One may ask whether the usual classical neural networks have some actual hidden quantum properties that make them such suitable tools for a highly coupled quantum problem. I discuss here what makes a system quantum and to what extent we can interpret a neural network as having quantum remnants. I suggest that a system can be quantum both due to its fundamental quantum constituents and due to the rules of its functioning, therefore, we can obtain entanglement both due to the quantum constituents' nature and due to the functioning rules, or, in category theory terms, both due to the quantum nature of the objects of a category and of the maps. From a practical point of view, I suggest a possible experiment that could extract entanglement from the quantum functioning rules (maps) of an otherwise classical (from the point of view of the constituents) neural network.

Abstract: Many real-world optimization problems exhibit dynamic characteristics, posing significant challenges for traditional optimization techniques. Evolutionary Dynamic Optimization Algorithms (EDOAs) are designed to address these challenges effectively. However, in existing literature, the reported results for a given EDOA can vary significantly. This inconsistency often arises because the source codes for many EDOAs, which are typically complex, have not been made publicly available, leading to error-prone re-implementations. To support researchers in conducting experiments and comparing their algorithms with various EDOAs, we have developed an open-source MATLAB platform called the Evolutionary Dynamic Optimization LABoratory (EDOLAB). This platform not only facilitates research but also includes an educational module designed for instructional purposes. The education module allows users to observe: a) a 2-dimensional problem space and its morphological changes following each environmental change, b) the behaviors of individuals over time, and c) how the EDOA responds to environmental changes and tracks the moving optimum. The current version of EDOLAB features 25 EDOAs and four fully parametric benchmark generators. The MATLAB source code for EDOLAB is publicly available and can be accessed from [https://github.com/Danial-Yazdani/EDOLAB-MATLAB].

                arXiv:2312.03243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are at the forefront of scientific machine learning, making possible the creation of machine intelligence that is cognizant of physical laws and able to accurately simulate them. However, today's PINNs are often trained for a single physics task and require computationally expensive re-training for each new task, even for tasks from similar physics domains. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a pioneering approach to advance the generalizability of PINNs through the framework of Baldwinian evolution. Drawing inspiration from the neurodevelopment of precocial species that have evolved to learn, predict and react quickly to their environment, we envision PINNs that are pre-wired with connection strengths inducing strong biases towards efficient learning of physics. A novel two-stage stochastic programming formulation coupling evolutionary selection pressure (based on proficiency over a distribution of physics tasks) with lifetime learning (to specialize on a sampled subset of those tasks) is proposed to instantiate the Baldwin effect. The evolved Baldwinian-PINNs demonstrate fast and physics-compliant prediction capabilities across a range of empirically challenging problem instances with more than an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy at a fraction of the computation cost compared to state-of-the-art gradient-based meta-learning methods. For example, when solving the diffusion-reaction equation, a 70x improvement in accuracy was obtained while taking 700x less computational time. This paper thus marks a leap forward in the meta-learning of PINNs as generalizable physics solvers. Sample codes are available at \url{https://github.com/chiuph/Baldwinian-PINN}.

                arXiv:2410.14031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decade, predictive modeling of neural responses in the primate visual system has advanced significantly, largely driven by various DNN approaches. These include models optimized directly for visual recognition, cross-modal alignment through contrastive objectives, neural response prediction from scratch, and large language model embeddings.Likewise, different readout mechanisms, ranging from fully linear to spatial-feature factorized methods have been explored for mapping network activations to neural responses. Despite the diversity of these approaches, it remains unclear which method performs best across different visual regions. In this study, we systematically compare these approaches for modeling the human visual system and investigate alternative strategies to improve response predictions. Our findings reveal that for early to mid-level visual areas, response-optimized models with visual inputs offer superior prediction accuracy, while for higher visual regions, embeddings from LLMs based on detailed contextual descriptions of images and task-optimized models pretrained on large vision datasets provide the best fit. Through comparative analysis of these modeling approaches, we identified three distinct regions in the visual cortex: one sensitive primarily to perceptual features of the input that are not captured by linguistic descriptions, another attuned to fine-grained visual details representing semantic information, and a third responsive to abstract, global meanings aligned with linguistic content. We also highlight the critical role of readout mechanisms, proposing a novel scheme that modulates receptive fields and feature maps based on semantic content, resulting in an accuracy boost of 3-23% over existing SOTAs for all models and brain regions. Together, these findings offer key insights into building more precise models of the visual system.

Abstract: To enhance the accuracy of power load forecasting in wind farms, this study introduces an advanced combined forecasting method that integrates Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) with an Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) algorithm to optimize the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Initially, the VMD algorithm is employed to perform high-precision modal decomposition of the original power load data, which is then categorized into high-frequency and low-frequency sequences based on mutual information entropy theory. Subsequently, this research profoundly modifies the traditional multiverse optimizer by incorporating Tent chaos mapping, exponential travel distance rate, and an elite reverse learning mechanism, developing the IPSO-ELM prediction model. This model independently predicts the high and low-frequency sequences and reconstructs the data to achieve the final forecasting results. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method significantly improves prediction accuracy and convergence speed compared to traditional ELM, PSO-ELM, and PSO-ELM methods.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07507">ConfigX: Modular Configuration for Evolutionary Algorithms via Multitask Reinforcement Learning</a></h4>

Abstract: Recent advances in Meta-learning for Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) have shown the potential of using neural networks to dynamically configure evolutionary algorithms (EAs), enhancing their performance and adaptability across various BBO instances. However, they are often tailored to a specific EA, which limits their generalizability and necessitates retraining or redesigns for different EAs and optimization problems. To address this limitation, we introduce ConfigX, a new paradigm of the MetaBBO framework that is capable of learning a universal configuration agent (model) for boosting diverse EAs. To achieve so, our ConfigX first leverages a novel modularization system that enables the flexible combination of various optimization sub-modules to generate diverse EAs during training. Additionally, we propose a Transformer-based neural network to meta-learn a universal configuration policy through multitask reinforcement learning across a designed joint optimization task space. Extensive experiments verify that, our ConfigX, after large-scale pre-training, achieves robust zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, ConfigX exhibits strong lifelong learning capabilities, allowing efficient adaptation to new tasks through fine-tuning. Our proposed ConfigX represents a significant step toward an automatic, all-purpose configuration agent for EAs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09800">Infinite-dimensional next-generation reservoir computing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.09800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation reservoir computing (NG-RC) has attracted much attention due to its excellent performance in spatio-temporal forecasting of complex systems and its ease of implementation. This paper shows that NG-RC can be encoded as a kernel ridge regression that makes training efficient and feasible even when the space of chosen polynomial features is very large. Additionally, an extension to an infinite number of covariates is possible, which makes the methodology agnostic with respect to the lags into the past that are considered as explanatory factors, as well as with respect to the number of polynomial covariates, an important hyperparameter in traditional NG-RC. We show that this approach has solid theoretical backing and good behavior based on kernel universality properties previously established in the literature. Various numerical illustrations show that these generalizations of NG-RC outperform the traditional approach in several forecasting applications.

	<p>The concept of cognitive reserve (CR) has been a cornerstone in cognitive aging research, offering a framework to explain how life experiences like education, occupation, bilingualism, and physical exercise may buffer individuals from cognitive decline in the face of aging or neurological disease. However, this paper argues that the CR model, while influential, may have outlived its usefulness due to inherent limitations that constrain future research directions and unintentionally encourage &amp;amp;ldquo;magical thinking&amp;amp;rdquo;. Specifically, CR&amp;amp;rsquo;s definition, which relies on cognitive performance being &amp;amp;ldquo;better than expected&amp;amp;rdquo; based on known measures of brain structure and function, makes the concept temporally bound to current scientific understanding, potentially stifling novel insights into cognition. In contrast, we propose a shift to a cognitive capacity (CC) framework, which views cognitive performance as being always determined by the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s structural and functional capacities, without needing to invoke expectations based on incomplete knowledge. The CC framework is broader, encompassing factors that either promote or demote cognitive performance by directly modifying brain structure and function. This reconceptualization opens avenues for investigating cognitive enhancement not only in the context of aging or disease but also in young, healthy individuals. By emphasizing causal pathways between brain changes and cognitive outcomes, this perspective provides a more flexible and testable approach to understanding the mechanisms behind cognitive performance and its modulation across the lifespan.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Cardiac arrest may cause significant hypoxic&amp;amp;ndash;ischemic injury leading to coma, seizures, myoclonic jerks, or status epilepticus. Mortality is high, but accurate prognostication is challenging. A multimodal approach is employed, in which electroencephalography (EEG) forms a key part with several recognised patterns of prognostic significance. Methods: In this retrospective study, clinical and qualitative features of the EEG of patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Kingston General Hospital following cardiac arrest from 2017 to 2020 were reviewed. The study included 81 adult patients (&amp;amp;ge;18 years). Outcome was assessed using the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) as 1&amp;amp;ndash;2 (favourable) or 3&amp;amp;ndash;5 (unfavourable). EEG patterns were divided into groups within the highly malignant, malignant and benign patterns described in the literature. Results: There were a wide range of causes and 22% had a favourable outcome. Highly malignant, malignant and benign patterns were associated with survival in 0%, 70% and 100%, respectively, and favourable outcomes in 0%, 48% and 100%. All patients with seizures died, and 94% with myoclonus had unfavourable outcomes. In contrast, EEG reactivity and improvement on follow-up EEG were associated with a favourable outcome. Conclusions: Highly malignant EEG, seizures and myoclonus were associated with unfavourable outcomes, while patients with malignant EEG had better outcomes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-5/v2?src=rss">Conditioning factors for the scientific productivity of undergraduate students of health sciences at a private Peruvian University: A cross-sectional analytical study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The objective of this study was to determine the conditioning factors for scientific research productivity in university students of health sciences. Scientific productivity, in addition to making visible the generation of new knowledge, contributes to the well-being of the population and provides feedback to the scientific community in terms of methodologies, perspectives and results that help to break down barriers that delimit productivity in scientific research. Methods A cross-sectional analytical observational study was conducted. The study population was 4104 students enrolled during the 2021-I semester in the Faculty of Health Sciences of a private Peruvian university. A sample size of 400 students was determined and a stratified probability sampling was used. The variables were measured through surveys. The dependent variable was scientific research productivity, and the independent variables were institutional culture, knowledge management and technological capital. Summary measures are reported according to the type of variable. The chi-square test with a significance level of p<0.05 was applied to assess the association between the variables of interest. A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed using the Stepwise method. Prevalence ratios (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated. Results From the total of 400 students, 74.5% were male, 57.25% were aged between 18 and 27 years, 17% belonged to the school of human medicine and 72% were in their sixth year of studies. Scientific research productivity was associated with management commitment (PR=1.493; 95%CI: 1.077–2.068, p=0.015), sense of personal growth (PR=1.632; 95%CI: 1.041–2.558; p=0.024), recognition by the university (PR=1.385; 95%CI: 1.012–1.896; p=0.043), strategic alliances (PR=1.422; 95%CI: 1.032–1.959; p=0. 03), having research proposals (PR=1.522; 95%CI: 1.114–2.08; p=0.009), dissemination of results obtained (PR=1.542; 95%CI: 1.12–2.122; p=0.01), availability of human resources (PR=1.591; 95%CI: 1.165–2.173; p=0.004), access to equipment and software (PR=1.482; 95%CI: 1.061–2.069; p=0.018) and to laboratories (PR=1.438; 95%CI: 1.047–1.974; p=0.024). Conclusion It is concluded that the research productivity of undergraduate students of health sciences is low. It is imperative to strengthen the university research culture that empowers students as agents of change and strengthens faculty participation in scientific networks and communities.

                This study aims to evaluate the impact of big data analytics (BDA) on the performance of healthcare supply chain management (HCSCMP) by examining both overall efficiency improvements and identifying critical success factors for effective implementation. Through a systematic literature review, the research investigates how BDA enhances real-time decision-making within healthcare supply chains (HCSCs) and identifies the key enablers required for successful BDA adoption. A comprehensive search strategy was employed to analyze 65 papers, resulting in the inclusion of 39 studies published between 2016 and 2023. The review revealed a preference for literature reviews and questionnaires as the primary research methods. The findings indicate that BDA significantly improves HCSCs’ efficiency, particularly in real-time decision-making and operational management. However, successful BDA implementation depends on addressing critical enablers and overcoming associated challenges.

                Background Dengue infection during pregnancy increases the risk of maternal and neonatal complications; therefore, the objective of this research is to determine these outcomes and describe the clinical manifestations of the infection. Methods A systematic review of studies published in PubMed, MEDLINE, LILACS, Web of Science, Scopus and thesis repositories published between 2013 and October 2023 was performed. DeCS and MeSH dengue and maternal-neonatal outcome were used. Thirteen studies were selected and the New Castle-Ottawa scale was used to assess their quality. Mantel-Haenszel hazard ratios were calculated to report the overall effect size using random-effects models. All analyses were performed in Rev Man 5.4.1 Results The 13 studies involved a population of 18,724 pregnant women, with cohorts ranging from 25 to 17,673 pregnant women. The most frequent outcomes in the pregnant women were cesarean section and postpartum hemorrhage, and in the newborns, preterm delivery and low birth weight. According to the New Castle-Ottawa scale, six studies were considered low risk and seven studies moderate risk. Dengue is a risk factor for postpartum hemorrhage (OR: 2.24), premature rupture of membranes (OR: 1.04) and cesarean section (OR: 1.13). It could not be concluded that dengue is a risk factor for the neonatal outcomes studied. The clinical picture of pregnant women with dengue was predominantly fever, abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, anemia, dyspnea and myalgia. Conclusions Pregnancy-related changes in the immune, cardiovascular and coagulation systems, among others, increase the probability of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in case of DENV infection, such as postpartum hemorrhage, premature rupture of membranes, cesarean section, low birth weight and preterm delivery. Pregnant women should be considered a population at risk and should be included in dengue control, diagnosis and treatment policies.

                This paper explores the concept of α-ψ-ϕ  contractive mappings, contributing to the advancement of self-map extensions and fixed-point theorems within b-metric spaces. We introduce a new class of contractive mappings and demonstrate how they extend traditional contraction principles, offering a broader framework for analyzing fixed points in non-standard spaces. The main result of this study is a generalization of existing fixed-point theorems, supported by comprehensive corollaries, illustrative examples, and rigorous proofs. These findings provide deeper insights into the structure of b-metric spaces and open avenues for further applications in fields such as optimization and machine learning.

                Introduction Numerous studies have concluded that the functional ingredients benefit human health. Similarly, present times have seen exponential growth in functional food in bakery product segments like breads and biscuits. However, there is a lack of information on functional ingredients and their usefulness in developing functional bakery products. This bibliometric study addresses this gap by identifying the current research trends in functional ingredients. Objective To investigate current research trends on functional ingredients and their usefulness in developing functional biscuits. Method The study followed the “Scientific Procedures and Rationales for Systematic Literature Reviews” standards for retrieving literature. The study went through three major stages, “assembling,” “arranging,” and “assessing,” to retrieve 612 articles from the Scopus database from 2013 to 2023. Through further filtering, 395 articles were selected. Result The analysis was conducted using R Studio and VOS viewer. The performance analysis and science mapping tools were used to evaluate the articles. The results showed a 5.76% annual growth in publication trends. The most researched functional ingredients were antioxidants, bioactive compounds, and dietary fiber. The review summarized the most studied foods to develop functional biscuits and highlighted the most experimented technological advancements. Conclusion The study revealed the need for future research studies on functional ingredients with a focus on studying the technical implications of technical advancements in extracting functional ingredients from foods. The study highlights the significance of future studies based on the acceptance of functional biscuits and their sensory properties, focusing on the mass population. The study derives the possible applicability of functional ingredients in developing new formulations from publications and their usefulness in developing new formulations. This insight on the applicability of functional ingredients provides an opportunity for biscuit/cookie manufacturing to boost consumption among the population to a new ascending graph.

                Background Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurological condition that primarily affects older people. Currently available AD drugs are associated with side effects and there is a need to develop natural drugs from plants. Aquilaria is as an endangered medicinal plant genus (commonly called agarwood plants) and various products of Aquilaria plant spp. including resinous heartwood, leaves, bark, and stem have been widely used in various traditional medicine systems. Research on agarwood plants is sparse and only a few previous studies demonstrated their neuroprotective properties in vitro. Owing to the presence of a plethora of secondary metabolites in agarwood plants, it is imperative not only to protect these plants but also evaluate the bioactivity of agarwood phytochemicals. Methods This study used Molsoft tools to predict the physicochemical properties of agarwood ligands, including the number of H-bond donors and acceptors, polar surface area, lipophilicity, solubility, and the molecular polar surface area and volume of agarwood ligands. Additionally, ADMET (absorption, digestion, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) properties were predicted using ADMETlab 2.0. Computational methods such as AutoDock Vina and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were employed for the docking of 41 selected agarwood compounds with AD-related molecular targets. Results and Conclusion According to docking data, three compounds aquilarisin (ASN), aquilarisinin (ANN), aquilarixanthone (AXN) showed highest binding affinity to selected AD targets compared to their known inhibitors. MD simulation studies revealed that, selected agarwood compounds’ protein-ligand complexes showed remarkable structural stability throughout 100ns simulation. The agarwood chemicals aquilarisin, aquilarisinin, aquilarixanthone, pillion (PLN), and agarotetrol (AGT) are consequently suggested as some of the found hits against AD targets, however, additional experimental validation is required to establish their effectiveness.

                Background Yeast strains that are tolerant to several environmental stresses are extensively employed to produce bioethanol from sugar-rich feedstock. Bioethanol production efficiency in Metehara and Fincha Sugar Factories (the two major sugar factories in Ethiopia) is 50% lower than that of similar factories in other parts of the world. Methods In our previous research findings, five wild indigenous strains of multi-stress tolerance yeast were isolated from traditional fermented alcoholic beverages (Tella, Tej, and Areke) in Ethiopia to the purpose of evaluate their potential use for bioethanol using sugarcane molasses as a substrate. Result The optimal parameters for maximum ethanol production were pH of 4.5, 25°Brix, 30°C, 4.0 g/l ammonium sulfate, supplement with yeast extract, and 72 h of incubation period. Under these optimum conditions, 13.13 ± 0.08% (v/v) ethanol was obtained. The yield of hydrous and anhydrous bioethanol from fermented molasses samples were produced at 94.20–95.60% (v/v) and 99.05–99.56% (v/v), respectively. Conclusion According to this finding, Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolate MUT15, Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolate MUT18F, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolate R9MU strains have been good candidates for production of industrial bioethanol.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-710/v2?src=rss">Expert Consensus Methods In The Humanities: An Exploration of their Potential [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Despite the significant role of consensus and dissensus in knowledge production, formal approaches to consensus are notably less common in the humanities compared to their frequent application in natural, social, and life sciences. This article therefore explores the potential of expert consensus methods in humanities-related research. Methods In order to do so, an interdisciplinary team of both sciences researchers experienced in consensus methods and researchers familiar with the domain of the humanities and epistemology, conducted a literary review and exchanged their expertise in multiple brainstorm sessions. Results This resulted in the identification of six key elements of expert consensus methods. It also provided for an overview of different types of expert consensus methods that regularly used in the natural, social, and life sciences: Delphi studies, nominal groups, consensus conferences, and Glaser’s state of the art method and illustrative examples from both sciences and humanities-related studies. An overview of possible purposes for applying these methods is provided to identify the research contexts in which these methods have proven their value, which can be extrapolated to humanities related issues for which these methods seem promising. Conclusions The comparisons and categorisation show that, when focusing on the purposes, there seem to be humanities-related issues that may lend themselves better to structured expert consensus methods than their subject matter and research methods might suggest. When deliberately applied in context chosen by researchers with expertise in a specific humanities domain, expert consensus methods can accelerate epistemic process, enhance transparency, increase replicability, stimulate diversity, and encourage fair processes in humanities research and the application of its findings.

                Background Escherichia coli is a critical priority pathogen due to its significant morbidity, mortality, and growing antimicrobial resistance, underscoring the urgent need for novel control strategies. This bacterium is frequently implicated in outbreaks associated with horticultural products, particularly those cultivated in organic farming systems. The aim of this study was to isolate and evaluate the potential of a bacteriophage as a biocontrol agent against E. coli in compost and agricultural irrigation water. Methods E. coli presence in compost samples (n=17) was determined through microbiological assays, and the bacterial identity was confirmed by PCR amplification of the phoA gene. Antimicrobial resistance profiles of the isolates were assessed using the disk diffusion method. Bacteriophage isolation was conducted from livestock fecal samples using a double-layer agar technique. The stability of the bacteriophage under varying pH levels and temperatures was evaluated, along with its replication dynamics. Additionally, the phage’s efficacy in reducing E. coli populations in compost and irrigation water was assessed. Genomic sequencing and bioinformatic analyses of the bacteriophage were conducted to characterize its genetic profile. Results E. coli strains isolated exhibiting multidrug resistance were isolated from compost samples. The isolated bacteriophage, named Alux-21, exhibited stability at neutral pH and retained viability at both 4°C and 40°C over a six-month period. Importantly, the phage achieved a significant reduction of E. coli counts, exceeding 3.8 logs in compost and 3 logs in irrigation water, demonstrating its superior efficacy compared to previously reported phages in similar substrates. Genomic analysis confirmed the absence of virulence-associated, lysogeny, and antibiotic resistance genes. Conclusion The findings highlight Alux-21 as a sustainable biocontrol agent for E. coli in compost and irrigation water. Field validation will be crucial to establish its scalability and efficacy under real-world agricultural conditions.

                Background Ensuring comprehensive access to family planning improves gender equality, empowers women, and, eventually, reduces poverty. However, in the pastoralist community, women were rooted in strong cultural and religious perspectives that promoted many children, discouraged the use of FP, had high male dominance, and had limited control over their life, including the use of FP. Objective To explore the barriers to LARC utilization among pastoralist women in southern Ethiopia. Methods This study used a qualitative descriptive study design and included thirty-three pastoralist women for focus group discussions and twelve key informants for IDI, who were purposefully selected from three pastoral districts. The participants were interviewed and explored the primary barriers to using LARCs. The principal researcher led the interview via a semi structured interview guide that allowed for flexibility in exploring issues aided by audio tape. The approach included a broad inductive thematic analysis, with significant concepts derived from transcripts. Results In this study, there are many barriers to LARC utilization organized into five themes, including myths and misconception (perceived side effects, FP is not suitable for women who work intensively and carry heavy objects and travel long distances), the desire to have many children (children are wealth and Gods gifts), religious belief, distances of health facilities and husband objection. Conclusion and recommendations Information education communication should be provided to address myths and misconceptions about the LARC during the FP intervention for pastoralist women via HEW, HCP, media, and community education. There is a need to enhance social opportunities by involving religious leaders and partners in decision-making and providing health information and counseling to religious leaders and couples in the community through HEW. As myths and misconceptions about LARC use emanate from a variety of concerns, this study may not cover all of them; therefore, future research is needed to investigate additional myths and misconceptions concerning contraception use.

                <p>by Thiago Ohno Bezerra, Antonio C. Roque</p>

Astrocytes respond to neurotransmitters by increasing their intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals). While glutamate released by neurons trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals through IP<sub>3</sub>- and glutamate transporter-dependent mechanisms, dopamine released in distant sites activates astrocytes via dopaminergic receptors. However, little is known about the modulatory effects of dopamine on glutamate-evoked astrocytic activity. To investigate this question, we developed multi-compartment, conductance-based astrocyte models with three distinct morphologies: unipolar; bipolar; and bifurcated-terminal. Glutamate induced localized responses, while dopamine activated all compartments. In the unipolar model, global dopaminergic stimulation reduced the threshold frequency of glutamatergic stimulation required to activate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Phase-plane analysis of a simplified version of this model revealed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are influenced by compartment radius and neurotransmitter type. Morphology significantly influenced glutamate-dopamine interactions. In the bipolar model, glutamatergic stimulation in one process minimally affected the other. Conversely, in the bifurcated-terminal model, where a single process bifurcates into two secondary processes, high-frequency glutamatergic stimulation in one secondary process evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the other. Dopamine further facilitated this latter cross-process interaction by lowering the glutamatergic stimulation frequency needed to elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the adjacent secondary process. These findings suggest that dopamine enhances the initiation and propagation of glutamate-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, with the extent of propagation depending on astrocytic morphology and the spatial distribution of glutamatergic inputs.

                <p>by Moritz Grosse-Wentrup, Akshey Kumar, Anja Meunier, Manuel Zimmer</p>

Explaining how neuronal activity gives rise to cognition arguably remains the most significant challenge in cognitive neuroscience. We introduce neuro-cognitive multilevel causal modeling (NC-MCM), a framework that bridges the explanatory gap between neuronal activity and cognition by construing cognitive states as (behaviorally and dynamically) causally consistent abstractions of neuronal states. Multilevel causal modeling allows us to interchangeably reason about the neuronal- and cognitive causes of behavior while maintaining a physicalist (in contrast to a strong dualist) position. We introduce an algorithm for learning cognitive-level causal models from neuronal activation patterns and demonstrate its ability to learn cognitive states of the nematode <i>C. elegans</i> from calcium imaging data. We show that the cognitive-level model of the NC-MCM framework provides a concise representation of the neuronal manifold of <i>C. elegans</i> and its relation to behavior as a graph, which, in contrast to other neuronal manifold learning algorithms, supports causal reasoning. We conclude the article by arguing that the ability of the NC-MCM framework to learn causally interpretable abstractions of neuronal dynamics and their relation to behavior in a purely data-driven fashion is essential for understanding biological systems whose complexity prohibits the development of hand-crafted computational models.

In the realm of infectious disease control, accurate modeling of the transmission dynamics is pivotal. As human mobility and commuting patterns are key components of communicable disease spread, we introduce a novel travel time aware metapopulation model. Our model aims to enhance estimations of disease transmission. By providing more reliable assessments on the efficacy of interventions, curtailing personal rights or human mobility behavior through interventions can be minimized. The proposed model is an advancement over traditional compartmental models, integrating explicit transmission on travel and commute, a factor available in agent-based models but often neglected with metapopulation models. Our approach employs a multi-edge graph ODE-based (Graph-ODE) model, which represents the intricate interplay between mobility and disease spread. This granular modeling is particularly important when assessing the dynamics in densely connected urban areas or when heterogeneous structures across entire countries have to be assessed. The given approach can be coupled with any kind of ODE-based model. In addition, we propose a novel multi-layer waning immunity model that integrates waning of different paces for protection against mild and severe courses of the disease. As this is of particular interest for late-phase epidemic or endemic scenarios, we consider the late-phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany. The results of this work show that accounting for resolved mobility significantly influences the pattern of outbreaks. The improved model provides a refined tool for predicting outbreak trajectories and evaluating intervention strategies in relation to mobility by allowing us to assess the transmission that result on traveling. The insights derived from this model can serve as a basis for decisions on the implementation or suspension of interventions, such as mandatory masks on public transportation. Eventually, our model contributes to maintaining mobility as a social good while reducing exuberant disease dynamics potentially driven by travel activities.

Here, we show that mitochondrial form and function rely on synthesis of phosphatidylserine (PS) in the ER through phosphatidylserine synthase (PSS), trafficking of PS from ER to mitochondria (and within mitochondria), and the conversion of PS to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) by phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PISD) in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Using a forward genetic screen in <i>Drosophila</i>, we found that Slowmo (SLMO) specifically transfers PS from the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) to the IMM within the inner boundary membrane (IBM) domain. Thus, SLMO is required for shaping mitochondrial morphology, but its putative conserved binding partner, dTRIAP, is not. Importantly, SLMO’s role in maintaining mitochondrial morphology is conserved in humans via the SLMO2 protein and is independent of mitochondrial dynamics. Our results highlight the importance of a conserved PSS-SLMO-PISD pathway in maintaining the structure and function of mitochondria.

                Abstract Background Gastric metastasis from melanoma is rare and often presents as an unexpected finding, rarely revealing an underlying primary skin melanoma. Case presentation We report a case of a 62-year-old male who presented with abdominal pain, dyspepsia, anorexia, and weight loss. On physical examination abdominal masses and hepatomegaly were detected. Radiological imaging showed widespread masses in the abdominal and thoracic regions. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy identified an umbilicated protruded lesion with central dark pigmentation at the antro-fundic junction. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemical staining were consistent with melanoma. A subsequent rigorous skin examination uncovered a primary malignant skin melanoma. Due to worsening general condition, the patient received palliative hospice care. Conclusion This report highlights the critical need for vigilant skin examination when encountering gastric lesions with dark pigmentation, which led to the identification of initially undetected cutaneous melanoma.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90414">Contributions of associative and non-associative learning to the dynamics of defensive ethograms</a></h4>

              
                Defensive behavior changes based on threat intensity, proximity, and context of exposure, and learning about danger-predicting stimuli is critical for survival. However, most Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigms focus only on freezing behavior, obscuring the contributions of associative and non-associative mechanisms to dynamic defensive responses. To thoroughly investigate defensive ethograms, we subjected male and female adult C57BL/6 J mice to a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm that paired footshock with a serial compound stimulus (SCS) consisting of distinct tone and white noise (WN) stimulus periods. To investigate how associative and non-associative mechanisms affect defensive responses, we compared this paired SCS-footshock group with four control groups that were conditioned with either pseudorandom unpaired presentations of SCS and footshock, shock only, or reversed SCS presentations with inverted tone-WN order, with paired or unpaired presentations. On day 2 of conditioning, the paired group exhibited robust freezing during the tone period with switching to explosive jumping and darting behaviors during the WN period. Comparatively, the unpaired and both reverse SCS groups expressed less tone-induced freezing and rarely showed jumping or darting during WN. Following the second day of conditioning, we observed how defensive behavior changed over two extinction sessions. During extinction, the tone-induced freezing decreased in the paired group, and mice rapidly shifted from escape jumping during WN to a combination of freezing and darting. The unpaired, unpaired reverse, and shock-only groups displayed defensive tail rattling and darting during the SCS, with minimal freezing and jumping. Interestingly, the paired reverse group did not jump to WN, and tone-evoked freezing was resistant to extinction. These findings demonstrate that non-associative factors promote some defensive responsiveness, but associative factors are required for robust cue-induced freezing and high-intensity flight expression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89892">Unsupervised discovery of family specific vocal usage in the Mongolian gerbil</a></h4>

              
                In nature, animal vocalizations can provide crucial information about identity, including kinship and hierarchy. However, lab-based vocal behavior is typically studied during brief interactions between animals with no prior social relationship, and under environmental conditions with limited ethological relevance. Here, we address this gap by establishing long-term acoustic recordings from Mongolian gerbil families, a core social group that uses an array of sonic and ultrasonic vocalizations. Three separate gerbil families were transferred to an enlarged environment and continuous 20-day audio recordings were obtained. Using a variational autoencoder (VAE) to quantify 583,237 vocalizations, we show that gerbils exhibit a more elaborate vocal repertoire than has been previously reported and that vocal repertoire usage differs significantly by family. By performing gaussian mixture model clustering on the VAE latent space, we show that families preferentially use characteristic sets of vocal clusters and that these usage preferences remain stable over weeks. Furthermore, gerbils displayed family-specific transitions between vocal clusters. Since gerbils live naturally as extended families in complex underground burrows that are adjacent to other families, these results suggest the presence of a vocal dialect which could be exploited by animals to represent kinship. These findings position the Mongolian gerbil as a compelling animal model to study the neural basis of vocal communication and demonstrates the potential for using unsupervised machine learning with uninterrupted acoustic recordings to gain insights into naturalistic animal behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99914">Biochemical and neurophysiological effects of deficiency of the mitochondrial import protein TIMM50</a></h4>

              
                TIMM50, an essential TIM23 complex subunit, is suggested to facilitate the import of ~60% of the mitochondrial proteome. In this study, we characterized a <i>TIMM50</i> disease-causing mutation in human fibroblasts and noted significant decreases in TIM23 core protein levels (TIMM50, TIMM17A/B, and TIMM23). Strikingly, TIMM50 deficiency had no impact on the steady-state levels of most of its putative substrates, suggesting that even low levels of a functional TIM23 complex are sufficient to maintain the majority of TIM23 complex-dependent mitochondrial proteome. As TIMM50 mutations have been linked to severe neurological phenotypes, we aimed to characterize TIMM50 defects in manipulated mammalian neurons. TIMM50 knockdown in mouse neurons had a minor effect on the steady state level of most of the mitochondrial proteome, supporting the results observed in patient fibroblasts. Amongst the few affected TIM23 substrates, a decrease in the steady state level of components of the intricate oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial ribosome complexes was evident. This led to declined respiration rates in fibroblasts and neurons, reduced cellular ATP levels, and defective mitochondrial trafficking in neuronal processes, possibly contributing to the developmental defects observed in patients with TIMM50 disease. Finally, increased electrical activity was observed in TIMM50 deficient mice neuronal cells, which correlated with reduced levels of KCNJ10 and KCNA2 plasma membrane potassium channels, likely underlying the patients’ epileptic phenotype.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95296">Livestock abortion surveillance in Tanzania reveals disease priorities and importance of timely collection of vaginal swab samples for attribution</a></h4>

              
                Lack of data on the aetiology of livestock diseases constrains effective interventions to improve livelihoods, food security and public health. Livestock abortion is an important disease syndrome affecting productivity and public health. Several pathogens are associated with livestock abortions but across Africa surveillance data rarely include information from abortions, little is known about aetiology and impacts, and data are not available to inform interventions. This paper describes outcomes from a surveillance platform established in Tanzania spanning pastoral, agropastoral and smallholder systems to investigate causes and impacts of livestock abortion. Abortion events were reported by farmers to livestock field officers (LFO) and on to investigation teams. Events were included if the research team or LFO could attend within 72 hr. If so, samples and questionnaire data were collected to investigate (a) determinants of attribution; (b) patterns of events, including species and breed, previous abortion history, and seasonality; (c) determinants of reporting, investigation and attribution; (d) cases involving zoonotic pathogens. Between 2017–2019, 215 events in cattle (n=71), sheep (n=44), and goats (n=100) were investigated. Attribution, achieved for 19.5% of cases, was significantly affected by delays in obtaining samples. Histopathology proved less useful than PCR due to rapid deterioration of samples. Vaginal swabs provided practical and sensitive material for pathogen detection. Livestock abortion surveillance, even at a small scale, can generate valuable information on causes of disease outbreaks, reproductive losses and can identify pathogens not easily captured through other forms of livestock disease surveillance. This study demonstrated the feasibility of establishing a surveillance system, achieved through engagement of community-based field officers, establishment of practical sample collection and application of molecular diagnostic platforms.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95547">Microstructural asymmetries of the planum temporale predict functional lateralization of auditory-language processing</a></h4>

              
                Structural hemispheric asymmetry has long been assumed to guide functional lateralization of the human brain, but empirical evidence for this compelling hypothesis remains scarce. Recently, it has been suggested that microstructural asymmetries may be more relevant to functional lateralization than macrostructural asymmetries. To investigate the link between microstructure and function, we analyzed multimodal MRI data in 907 right-handed participants. We quantified structural asymmetry and functional lateralization of the planum temporale (PT), a cortical area crucial for auditory-language processing. We found associations between PT functional lateralization and several structural asymmetries, such as surface area, intracortical myelin content, neurite density, and neurite orientation dispersion. The PT structure also showed hemispheric-specific coupling with its functional activity. All these functional-structural associations are highly specific to within-PT functional activity during auditory-language processing. These results suggest that structural asymmetry underlies functional lateralization of the same brain area and highlights a critical role of microstructural PT asymmetries in auditory-language processing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89836">Attention modulates human visual responses to objects by tuning sharpening</a></h4>

              
                Visual stimuli compete with each other for cortical processing and attention biases this competition in favor of the attended stimulus. How does the relationship between the stimuli affect the strength of this attentional bias? Here, we used functional MRI to explore the effect of target-distractor similarity in neural representation on attentional modulation in the human visual cortex using univariate and multivariate pattern analyses. Using stimuli from four object categories (human bodies, cats, cars, and houses), we investigated attentional effects in the primary visual area V1, the object-selective regions LO and pFs, the body-selective region EBA, and the scene-selective region PPA. We demonstrated that the strength of the attentional bias toward the target is not fixed but decreases with increasing target-distractor similarity. Simulations provided evidence that this result pattern is explained by tuning sharpening rather than an increase in gain. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the behavioral effects of target-distractor similarity on attentional biases and suggest tuning sharpening as the underlying mechanism in object-based attention.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90046">A spatial threshold for astrocyte calcium surge</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are active cells involved in brain function through the bidirectional communication with neurons, in which astrocyte calcium plays a crucial role. Synaptically evoked calcium increases can be localized to independent subcellular domains or expand to the entire cell, i.e., calcium surge. Because a single astrocyte may contact ~100,000 synapses, the control of the intracellular calcium signal propagation may have relevant consequences on brain function. Yet, the properties governing the spatial dynamics of astrocyte calcium remains poorly defined. Imaging subcellular responses of cortical astrocytes to sensory stimulation in mice, we show that sensory-evoked astrocyte calcium responses originated and remained localized in domains of the astrocytic arborization, but eventually propagated to the entire cell if a spatial threshold of &gt;23% of the arborization being activated was surpassed. Using <i>Itpr2</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice, we found that type-2 IP<sub>3</sub> receptors were necessary for the generation of astrocyte calcium surge. We finally show using in situ electrophysiological recordings that the spatial threshold of the astrocyte calcium signal consequently determined the gliotransmitter release. Present results reveal a fundamental property of astrocyte physiology, i.e., a spatial threshold for astrocyte calcium propagation, which depends on astrocyte intrinsic properties and governs astrocyte integration of local synaptic activity and subsequent neuromodulation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93778">Identification of an early subset of cerebellar nuclei neurons in mice</a></h4>

              
                Cerebellar nuclei (CN) neurons serve as the primary output of the cerebellum and originate from the cerebellar primordium at early stages of cerebellar development. These neurons are diverse, integrating information from the cerebellar cortex and relaying it to various brain regions. Employing various methodologies, we have characterized a specific subset of CN neurons that do not originate from the rhombic lip or ventricular zone of the cerebellar primordium. Embryos were collected at early stages of development and processed for immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blotting, in situ hybridization (ISH), embryonic culture, DiI labeling, and flow cytometry analysis (FCM). Our findings indicate that a subset of CN neurons expressing α-synuclein (SNCA), OTX2, MEIS2, and p75NTR (NGFR) are located in the rostroventral region of the NTZ. While CN neurons derived from the rhombic lip are positioned in the caudodorsal area of the NTZ in the cerebellar primordium. Utilizing Otx2-GFP and <i>Atoh1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, we have determined that these cells do not originate from the germinal zone of the cerebellar primordium. These results suggest the existence of a novel extrinsic germinal zone for the cerebellar primordium, possibly the mesencephalon, from which early CN neurons originate.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99711">Distinct release properties of glutamate/GABA co-transmission serve as a frequency-dependent filtering of supramammillary inputs</a></h4>

              
                Glutamate and GABA co-transmitting neurons exist in several brain regions; however, the mechanism by which these two neurotransmitters are co-released from the same synaptic terminals remains unclear. Here, we show that the supramammillary nucleus (SuM) to dentate granule cell synapses, which co-release glutamate and GABA, exhibit differences between glutamate and GABA release properties in paired-pulse ratio, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity, presynaptic receptor modulation, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-vesicle coupling configuration. Moreover, uniquantal synaptic responses show independent glutamatergic and GABAergic responses. Morphological analysis reveals that most SuM terminals form distinct glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses in proximity, each characterized by GluN1 and GABA<sub>A</sub>α1 labeling, respectively. Notably, glutamate/GABA co-transmission exhibits distinct short-term plasticities, with frequency-dependent depression of glutamate and frequency-independent stable depression of GABA. Our findings suggest that glutamate and GABA are co-released from different synaptic vesicles within the SuM terminals, and reveal that distinct transmission modes of glutamate/GABA co-release serve as frequency-dependent filters of SuM inputs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96566">Homeostatic synaptic normalization optimizes learning in network models of neural population codes</a></h4>

              
                Studying and understanding the code of large neural populations hinge on accurate statistical models of population activity. A novel class of models, based on learning to weigh sparse nonlinear Random Projections (RP) of the population, has demonstrated high accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. Importantly, these RP models have a clear and biologically plausible implementation as shallow neural networks. We present a new class of RP models that are learned by optimizing the randomly selected sparse projections themselves. This ‘reshaping’ of projections is akin to changing synaptic connections in just one layer of the corresponding neural circuit model. We show that Reshaped RP models are more accurate and efficient than the standard RP models in recapitulating the code of tens of cortical neurons from behaving monkeys. Incorporating more biological features and utilizing synaptic normalization in the learning process, results in accurate models that are more efficient. Remarkably, these models exhibit homeostasis in firing rates and total synaptic weights of projection neurons. We further show that these sparse homeostatic reshaped RP models outperform fully connected neural network models. Thus, our new scalable, efficient, and highly accurate population code models are not only biologically plausible but are actually optimized due to their biological features. These findings suggest a dual functional role of synaptic normalization in neural circuits: maintaining spiking and synaptic homeostasis while concurrently optimizing network performance and efficiency in encoding information and learning.

                Classical serotonergic psychedelics show promise in addressing neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease by modulating pathological brain dynamics. However, the precise neurobiological mechanisms underlying their effects remain elusive. This study introduces a personalized whole-brain model built upon a laminar neural mass framework to elucidate these effects. Using multimodal neuroimaging data from thirty subjects diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, we simulate the impact of serotonin 2A receptor activation, characteristic of psychedelics, on cortical dynamics. By modulating the excitability of layer 5 pyramidal neurons, our models reproduce hallmark changes in EEG power spectra observed under psychedelics, including alpha power suppression and gamma power enhancement. These spectral shifts are shown to correlate strongly with the regional distribution of serotonin 2A receptors. Furthermore, simulated EEG reveals increased complexity and entropy, suggesting restored network function. These findings underscore the potential of serotonergic psychedelics to reestablish healthy oscillatory dynamics in the prodromal and early phases of Alzheimer's disease and offer mechanistic insights into their potential therapeutic effects in neurodegenerative disorders.

">Prefrontal cortex dopamine responds to the total valence of stimuli</a></h4>

              
                The prefrontal cortex (PFC) dopamine system plays an essential role in cognitive flexibility, working memory and psychiatric disease, but determining the conditions under which dopamine in the PFC is released remains an open problem. Both rewarding and aversive stimuli have been found to trigger release, but studies have disagreed on whether the valence of a stimulus or other variables like novelty and salience are the most important. Here we report on recordings of dopamine-dependent fluorescence using a high-sensitivity dopamine indicator. We deliver an array of rewarding, aversive and mixed valence stimuli, as well as stimuli without any obvious valence. We observe that stimuli without valence, as well as the omission of expected stimuli, do not lead to large changes in fluorescence, even when these stimuli and omissions are both novel and engaging. In contrast, both rewarding and aversive stimuli lead to increases in fluorescence, with the most rewarding and most aversive stimuli leading to the largest increases. We test the effect of adding an aversive component to a rewarding stimulus and find that the increases in fluorescence are consistent with a summation of the rewarding and aversive components. We propose that dopamine release in the PFC responds to the total valence of a stimulus, in contrast with the traditional view of basal ganglia dopamine release that depends on the net valence.

">Punishing temporal judgement boosts sense of agency and modulates its underlying neural correlates</a></h4>

              
                Feeling in control of one's actions is fundamental to the formation of action-outcome relationships. Reinforcement and its valence also change the action-outcome relationship, either through behavior promotion or diminishment. In this study we evaluated how reward and punishment reinforcement modulate sense of agency, as measured by intentional binding. Moreover, using electroencephalography (EEG) we evaluated how reward and punishment reinforcement changes outcome event related potentials associated with the accuracy of participants' judgement of the time interval between a key press and audio tone. We found that punishment reinforcement increased intentional binding between the action and outcome more than reward and control feedback. This was also reflected in the outcome event related potentials, where punishment elicited greater P300s and Late Positive Potentials compared to reward and control. We also found increased N100s and diminished P300s and Late Positive Potentials when the participants did not actively participate in evoking the tone. Taken together, our findings showcase that punishment reinforcement boosts sense of agency and modulates associated neural activity more than reward and no reinforcement, as a function of increasing attention and arousal. These findings illuminate the greater effect punishment reinforcement has on behavior and brain activity by its modification of sense of agency, which is important for the development of treatments in psychiatric and neurological diseases.

Cortical slow oscillations occur during sleep or anesthesia and consist of reliable changes between Up and Down phases, characterised by high and low neural activity, respectively. Here we measure electrocorticography responses in the urethane-anesthetised rat and we demonstrate that during an auditory oddball paradigm, deviants trigger cortical Up phase initiations. Triggering of Up phases creates a mismatch response across the cortex, and when deviants fail to trigger Up phases, no mismatch response is present. We therefore propose triggering of cortical Up phases as a mechanism for mismatch negativity generation in unconscious states.

">A Model of Place Field Reorganization During Reward Maximization</a></h4>

              
                When rodents learn to navigate in a novel environment, a high density of place fields emerges at reward locations, fields elongate against the trajectory, and individual fields change spatial selectivity while demonstrating stable behavior. Why place fields demonstrate these characteristic phenomena during learning remains elusive. We develop a normative framework using a reward maximization objective, whereby the temporal difference (TD) error drives place field reorganization to improve policy learning. Place fields are modeled using Gaussian radial basis functions to represent states in an environment, and directly synapse to an actor-critic for policy learning. Each field's amplitude, center, and width, as well as downstream weights, are updated online at each time step to maximize cumulative reward. We demonstrate that this framework unifies three disparate phenomena observed in navigation experiments. Furthermore, we show that these place field phenomena improve policy convergence when learning to navigate to a single target and relearning multiple new targets. To conclude, we develop a normative model that recapitulates several aspects of hippocampal place field learning dynamics and unifies mechanisms to offer testable predictions for future experiments.

">T-type calcium channels participate in intrinsic and synaptic activity of PKCγ neurons of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord during chronic pain</a></h4>

              
                The disinhibition of the excitatory PKCgamma interneurons plays a central role during mechanical allodynia in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, routing harmless information to nociceptive pathways. The T-type calcium channel Cav3.2, necessary for mechanical and cold allodynia, is found in most PKCgamma neurons of the spinal cord. In this study, the role of Cav3.2 in PKCgamma neurons was studied after its pharmacological inhibition and its conditional deletion (KO) in Cav3.2GFP-Flox KI x PKCgamma-CreERT2 x Ai14 mice in normal conditions and in the spared-nerve-injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain. Conditional deletion of Cav3.2 increased the hindpaw basal mechanical sensitivity before surgery, and decreased mechanical pain 7 days, but not 28 days, after surgery. At the cellular level, Cav3.2 participated in the low-threshold currents of PKCgamma neurons and the T-type calcium current of PKCgamma neurons was decreased in KO mice as compared to wild-type (WT). This loss did not convert into proportional alterations in subthreshold properties including rebound potentials, suggesting the involvement of other T-type channels. Action potential kinetics and firing properties seemed similar in WT and KO mice too, but rebound potentials were diminished in the SNI model in WT but not in KO mice. In addition, the modulations of firing properties induced by T-type channel pharmacological blocker Z944 observed in WT mice were absent in KO mice and after SNI. Furthermore, the pairing of action potentials was modified after SNI in WT mice, and not in KO mice. At the synaptic level, excitatory currents were lowered 7- and 28-days after surgery, while inhibitory currents were lowered only at 28 days. These changes were not found in Cav3.2-ablated neurons. Miniature currents analysis indicated that Cav3.2 was involved in both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmissions at the level of PKCgamma neurons. Surprisingly, Z944 did not mimic the effects of Cav3.2 ablation in PKCgamma neurons, suggesting distinct and eventually opposite roles of other T-type calcium channels. Altogether, our results show that Cav3.2 is not mandatory for firing of PKCgamma neurons of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, but that it participates to the SNI-induced changes in their intrinsic and synaptic activity, including changes in their excitatory and inhibitory controls.

">A core set of neural states underlying memory reactivation of naturalistic events in the posterior medial cortex</a></h4>

              
                In sensory and mid-level regions of the brain, stimulus information is often topographically organized; functional responses are arranged in maps according to features such as retinal coordinates, auditory pitch, and object animacy or size. However, such organization is typically measured during stimulus input, e.g., when subjects are viewing gratings or images. Much less is known about the possible spatial organization of function during episodic recall of real-world events, which seems to drive higher-order cortical regions in the default mode network, particularly in posterior midline areas. Prior studies have shown that when multiple people remember a common experience, event-specific activity patterns in the posterior medial cortex are similar across individuals. This indicates that spatially organized functional responses underlying episodic recall do exist. In this paper we leverage fMRI data collected during recall of naturalistic movies to identify a core set of neural states in the posterior medial cortex. These states are stimulus-locked, reactivated during recall, and have a shared spatial organization across brains. We show that a surprisingly small number of these states (16 states across hemispheres) is sufficient to achieve the same levels of reactivation in the posterior medial cortex as when using the standard methods of the field. Furthermore, these states are significantly related to actions and social-affective features of events in the movies. Together, these findings elucidate the properties of a spatially organized code within the posterior default mode network which appears during natural recollection of memories.

">Modulating Prestimulus Alpha and Beta Power with tRNS Establishes Their Causal Role in Visual Perception</a></h4>

              
                Variability in visual perception in response to consistent stimuli is a fundamental phenomenon linked to fluctuations in prestimulus low-frequency neural oscillations--particularly in the alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) bands--typically measured by their power in electroencephalography (EEG) signals. However, the causal role of these prestimulus alpha and beta power fluctuations in visual perception remains unestablished. In this study, we investigated whether prestimulus alpha and beta power causally affect visual perception using transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS). In a sham-controlled, single-blind, within-subject design, 29 participants performed a visual detection task while receiving occipital tRNS. Online functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to measure cortical excitability during stimulation, and offline EEG signals were collected after stimulation. Mental fatigue was incorporated as a state-dependent factor influencing tRNS effects. Our findings demonstrate that, primarily under low fatigue states, tRNS increased cortical excitability during stimulation (indicated by increased fNIRS oxyhemoglobin amplitude), decreased subsequent prestimulus EEG alpha and beta power, and consequently reduced the visual contrast threshold (VCT), indicating enhanced visual perception. Sensitivity analysis revealed that alpha oscillations contributed more significantly to visual perception than beta oscillations under low fatigue. Additionally, the state-dependent effects of tRNS may result from different sensitivities of VCT to neural oscillations across fatigue states. These results provide causal evidence linking prestimulus alpha and beta power to visual perception and underscore the importance of considering brain states in neuromodulation research. Our study advances the understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying visual perception and suggests potential therapeutic applications targeting neural oscillations.

">Random Tree Model of Meaningful Memory</a></h4>

              
                Traditional studies of memory for meaningful narratives focus on specific stories and their semantic structures but do not address common quantitative features of recall across different narratives. We introduce a statistical ensemble of random trees to represent narratives as hierarchies of key points, where each node is a compressed representation of its descendant leaves, which are the original narrative segments. Recall is modeled as constrained by working memory capacity from this hierarchical structure. Our analytical solution aligns with observations from large-scale narrative recall experiments. Specifically, our model explains that (1) average recall length increases sublinearly with narrative length, and (2) individuals summarize increasingly longer narrative segments in each recall sentence. Additionally, the theory predicts that for sufficiently long narratives, a universal, scale-invariant limit emerges, where the fraction of a narrative summarized by a single recall sentence follows a distribution independent of narrative length.

">Juvenile fluoxetine treatment affects the maturation of the medial prefrontal cortex and behavior of adolescent female rats</a></h4>

              
                Background Serotonin is strongly involved in the regulation of brain development. An early-life imbalance in brain serotonin levels may influence the proper formation of neuronal circuits and synaptic plasticity. One of the factors that can affect serotonin concentrations is exposure to fluoxetine (FLX), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, the first-line pharmacological treatment for depression and anxiety in the pediatric population. Women are more prone to depression and anxiety from a young age. The safety of early-life FLX treatment is still questionable. We hypothesized that juvenile FLX treatment influences the brain maturation and behavior of adolescent females. Methods On postnatal days (PNDs) 20-28, juvenile female rats were injected once daily with FLX. Five days later, anxiety- and fear-related behaviors and the response to amphetamine were assessed. On PND 40, the numbers of neurons and glial cells in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus were estimated via stereological methods. Additionally, the mRNA expression of cell survival/apoptosis and synaptic plasticity markers was evaluated via RT qPCR. Results Juvenile FLX attenuated anxiety-like behaviors, impaired fear memory and blunted the locomotor response to amphetamine in adolescent females. Simultaneously, FLX increased the regional volume and the numbers of neurons and astrocytes in specific subregions of the mPFC but not in the hippocampus. Additionally, FLX-treated females presented increased expression of genes regulating cell survival and reduced mRNA levels of AMPA glutamate receptors in the mPFC. Conclusions Juvenile FLX affects the maturation of the mPFC; therefore, this psychotropic drug should be used with caution in young people.

">Investigating the effect of mechanical adaptation on mid-air ultrasound vibrotactile stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Gesture control systems based on mid-air haptics are increasingly used in infotainment systems in cars, where they can provide rich haptic feedback to improve human-computer interactions. Laboratory studies show that mid-air haptic feedback reduces drivers' distractions and improve safety. However, it is unclear how the perception of mid-air ultrasound stimuli is affected by prolonged exposure to vibrational noise, e.g., from the steering wheel of a moving vehicle. Studies on vibrotactile adaptation show that perception of mechanical vibration is impaired by prior exposure to stimuli of the same frequency. Here, we investigated the effect of mechanical adaptation on the perception of mid-air ultrasound stimuli. We measured participants' detection threshold for ultrasound stimuli of different frequencies both before and after exposure to 30 s mechanical vibrations. Across two experiments, we systematically manipulated the frequency and amplitude of the adapting stimulus. We found that exposure to low-frequency mechanical vibrations significantly impaired the detection of low-frequency ultrasound stimuli. In contrast, exposure to high-frequency mechanical vibrations equally impaired perception of both low- and high-frequency ultrasound stimuli. This effect was mediated by the amplitude of the adapting stimulus, with stronger mechanical vibrations producing a larger increase in participants' detection threshold. Overall, these findings show that perception of mid-air ultrasound stimuli is affected by specific sources of mechanical noise. Crucially, frequency-specificity in the low-frequency band also points toward possible mitigating solutions that could help minimising unwanted desensitization of mechanoreceptor channels during mid-air haptic interactions.

">Intentionally vs. Spontaneously Prolonged Gaze: A MEG Study of Active Gaze-Based Interaction</a></h4>

              
                Eye fixations are increasingly used to control computers through gaze-sensitive interfaces, yet the brain mechanisms underlying this non-visual use of gaze remain poorly understood. In this study, we recorded 306-channel magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals while participants played a video game controlled by their eye movements. Each move required selecting an object by fixating on it for at least 500 ms. Gaze dwells were classified as intentional if followed by a confirmation gaze on a special location and as spontaneous otherwise. In contrast to previous EEG studies on gaze-based interaction, we identified both oscillatory and sustained phase-locked MEG activity differentiating intentional and spontaneous gaze dwells, emerging near dwell onset and persisting until its termination. Thus, despite the apparent ease of controlling eye movements for gaze-based interaction, this process engages distinct neural signatures detectable with MEG, which are only partially similar to those observed in tasks requiring explicit inhibition of prepotent oculomotor responses. These findings highlight that contrasting spontaneous and intentional gaze dwells collected during free-behavior gaze-based interaction can serve as a novel methodology for studying mechanisms of voluntary control. Unlike traditional tasks in voluntary eye movement research, this approach avoids unnatural efforts from participants, offering a more naturalistic context for investigation.

">Mapping Global Causal Responses to Noninvasive Modulation of Genetically and Spatially Targeted Neural Populations with Sonogenetic-fPET</a></h4>

              
                Despite significant progress in brain circuit mapping over recent decades, a major challenge remains: no method currently allows for the noninvasive modulation of genetically and spatially defined neural populations while simultaneously monitoring their global effects throughout the brain and body. Here, we present sonogenetic-fPET, a technique that integrates sonogenetics with [18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose functional positron emission tomography (FDG-fPET) to overcome this challenge. Sonogenetics enables noninvasive, spatially targeted modulation of neurons genetically engineered to express the ultrasound-sensitive ion channel TRPV1, while FDG-fPET captures glucose metabolic changes triggered by this stimulation across the brain and body. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique by targeting neurons in the dorsal striatum, showcasing its capability to map global network responses to specific neuronal activation. Incorporating an acoustic hologram for sonogenetics further enables flexible modulation of different brain regions within a single mouse while concurrently mapping the resulting network activity. In summary, sonogenetic-fPET offers a tool for dissecting the global responses of the brain and body to the noninvasive modulation of genetically and spatially defined neuronal populations.

">Axon initial segment plasticity caused by auditory deprivation degrades time difference sensitivity in a model of neural responses to cochlear implants</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic and neural properties can change during periods of auditory deprivation. These changes may disrupt the computations that neurons perform. In the brainstem of chickens, auditory deprivation can lead to changes in the size and biophysics of the axon initial segment (AIS) of neurons in the sound source localization circuit. This is the phenomenon of axon initial segment (AIS) plasticity. Individuals who use cochlear implants (CIs) experience periods of hearing loss, and so we ask whether AIS plasticity in neurons of the medial superior olive (MSO), a key stage of sound location processing, would impact time difference sensitivity in the scenario of hearing with cochlear implants. The biophysical changes that we implement in our model of AIS plasticity include enlargement of the AIS and replacement of low-threshold Potassium conductance with the more slowly-activated M-type Potassium conductance. AIS plasticity has been observed to have a homeostatic effect with respect to excitability. In our model, AIS plasticity has the additional effect of converting MSO neurons from phasic firing type to tonic firing type. Phasic firing is known to have greater temporal sensitivity to coincident inputs. Consistent with this, we find AIS plasticity degrades time difference sensitivity in the auditory deprived MSO neuron model across a range of stimulus parameters. Our study illustrates a possible mechanism of cellular plasticity in a non-peripheral stage of neural processing that could impose barriers to sound source localization by bilateral cochlear implant users.

">Voxel-wise or Region-wise Nuisance Regression for Functional Connectivity Analyses: Does it matter?</a></h4>

              
                Removal of nuisance signals (such as motion) from the BOLD time series is an important aspect of preprocessing to obtain meaningful resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC). The nuisance signals are commonly removed using denoising procedures at the finest resolution, i.e. the voxel time series. Typically the voxel-wise time series are then aggregated into predefined regions or parcels to obtain a rs-FC matrix as the correlation between pairs of regional time series. Computational efficiency can be improved by denoising the aggregated regional time series instead of the voxel time series. However, a comprehensive comparison of the effects of denoising on these two resolutions is missing. In this study, we systematically investigate the effects of denoising at different time series resolutions (voxel- and region-level) in 370 unrelated subjects from the HCP-YA dataset. Alongside the time series resolution, we considered additional factors such as aggregation method (Mean and first eigenvariate [EV]) and parcellation granularity (100, 400, and 1,000 regions). To assess the effect of those choices on the utility of the resulting whole-brain rs-FC, we evaluated the individual specificity (fingerprinting) and the capacity to predict age and three cognitive scores. Our findings show generally equal or better performance for region-level denoising with notable differences depending on the aggregation method. Using mean aggregation yielded equal individual specificity and prediction performance for voxel- and region-level denoising. When EV was employed for aggregation, the individual specificity of voxel-level denoising was reduced compared to region-level denoising. Increasing parcellation granularity generally improved individual specificity. For the prediction of age and cognitive test scores, only fluid intelligence indicated worse performance for voxel-level denoising in the case of aggregating with the EV. Based on these results, we recommend the adoption of region-level denoising for brain-behavior investigations when using mean aggregation. This approach offers equal individual specificity and prediction capacity with reduced computational resources for the analysis of rs-FC patterns.

">Cervical transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation enhances speech recognition in noise: A crossover, placebo-controlled study</a></h4>

              
                Understanding speech in noisy environments is a widespread challenge, even for people with clinically normal hearing and users of hearing aids and cochlear implants. While these devices improve speech audibility, they do not optimize the brain's ability to isolate relevant speech from background noise. Tonic vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been shown to rapidly improve sensory processing in the brain and enhance auditory perception in humans. Here, we investigated whether tonic cervical transcutaneous VNS (ctVNS) can enhance speech-in-noise recognition. Two cohorts of older human adults (60-84 years) completed audiological speech-in-noise assessments, QuickSIN (n=16) or AzBio (n=14), while receiving tonic ctVNS or placebo stimulation to the neck-shoulder junction in a counterbalanced, crossover fashion. Participants repeated sentences spoken amid various levels of background babble. Relative to placebo stimulation, tonic ctVNS improved the signal-to-noise ratio for reliable speech perception (SNR-50) by an average of 0.72 dB in QuickSIN (p=0.033) and 0.38 dB in AzBio (p=0.045), and enhanced word recognition accuracy by 4% (QuickSIN: p=0.0066, AzBio: p=0.000025). Notably, ctVNS benefits exceeded minimum clinically important differences in 39% of participants on average. Improvements by tonic ctVNS were most pronounced in individuals with speech-in-noise deficits (p=0.0089), peaked at noise levels typical of real-world environments (p=0.029), and did not depend on hearing loss severity (p=0.97) or age (p=0.88). Our findings demonstrate that tonic ctVNS delivers immediate, clinically meaningful improvements in speech-in-noise recognition, highlighting its potential to complement traditional assistive hearing technologies and inform novel therapies for sensory processing disorders.

">Mu-opioid receptor activation potentiates excitatory transmission at the habenulo-peduncular synapse</a></h4>

              
                The continuing opioid epidemic poses a huge burden on public health. Identifying the neurocircuitry involved and how opioids modulate their signaling is essential for developing new therapeutic strategies. The medial habenula (MHb) is a small epithalamic structure that projects predominantly to the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) and represents a mu-opioid receptor (MOR) hotspot. This habenulo-peduncular (HP) circuit can regulate nicotine and opioid withdrawal; however, little is known about the physiological impact of MOR on its function. Using MOR-reporter mice, we observed that MORs are expressed in a subset of MHb and IPN cells. Patch-clamp recordings revealed that MOR activation inhibited action potential firing in MOR+ MHb neurons and induced an inhibitory outward current in IPN neurons, consistent with canonical inhibitory effects of MOR. We next used optogenetics to stimulate MOR+ MHb axons to investigate the effects of MOR activation on excitatory transmission at the HP synapse. In contrast to its inhibitory effects elsewhere, MOR activation significantly potentiated evoked glutamatergic transmission to IPN. The facilitatory effects of MOR activation on glutamate co-release was also observed from cholinergic-defined HP synapses. The potentiation of excitatory transmission mediated by MOR activation persisted in the presence of blockers of GABA receptors or voltage-gated sodium channels, suggesting a monosynaptic mechanism. Finally, disruption of MOR in the MHb abolished the faciliatory action of DAMGO, indicating that this non-canonical effect of MOR activation on excitatory neurotransmission at the HP synapse is dependent on pre-synaptic MOR expression. Our study demonstrates canonical inhibitory effects of MOR activation in somatodendritic compartments, but non-canonical faciliatory effects on evoked glutamate transmission at the HP synapse, establishing a new mode by which MOR can modulate neuronal function.

">Corticospinal excitability is facilitated during coordinative action observation and motor imagery of adapted single-leg sit-to-stand movements in young healthy adults</a></h4>

              
                Combined action observation and motor imagery (AOMI) facilitates corticospinal excitability (CSE). This study used single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to explore changes in CSE for coordinative AOMI of a single-leg sit-to-stand (SL-STS) movement. Twenty-one healthy adults completed two testing sessions, where they engaged with baseline (BL), action observation (AO), and motor imagery (MI) control conditions, and three experimental conditions where they observed a slow-paced SL-STS while simultaneously imagining a slow- (AOMIHICO), medium- (AOMIMOCO), or fast-paced (AOMILOCO) SL-STS, with imagery guided through audio sonification. A TMS pulse was delivered to the right leg representation of the left primary motor cortex at three stimulation timepoints aligned with peak EMG activity of the knee extensor muscle group for the slow-, medium-, and fast-paced SL-STS during each condition. Motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes were recorded from the KE muscle group as a marker of CSE for all stimulation timepoints and conditions. A main effect for experimental condition was reported for all three stimulation timepoints. MEP amplitudes were significantly greater for AOMIHICO at T1 and T3, and AOMIMOCO and AOMILOCO at all stimulation timepoints, when compared with control conditions. The findings provide empirical support for the propositions of the Dual-Action Simulation Hypothesis and Visual Guidance Hypothesis accounts for coordinative AOMI. This study builds on existing neurophysiological support for the use of coordinative AOMI as an alternative method for movement (re)learning. Longitudinal research incorporating neurophysiological and behavioral measures is warranted to explore the efficacy of coordinative AOMI for this purpose.

">Adaptation shapes the representational geometry in mouse V1 to efficiently encode the environment</a></h4>

              
                Sensory adaptation dynamically changes neural responses as a function of previous stimuli, profoundly impacting perception. The response changes induced by adaptation have been characterized in detail in individual neurons and at the population level after averaging across trials. However, it is not clear how adaptation modifies the aspects of the representations that relate more directly to the ability to perceive stimuli, such as their geometry and the noise structure in individual trials. To address this question, we recorded from a population of neurons in the mouse visual cortex and presented one stimulus (an oriented grating) more frequently than the others. We then analyzed these data in terms of representational geometry and studied the ability of a linear decoder to discriminate between similar visual stimuli based on the single-trial population responses. Surprisingly, the discriminability of stimuli near the adaptor increased, even though the responses of individual neurons to these stimuli decreased. Similar changes were observed in artificial neural networks trained to reconstruct the visual stimulus under metabolic constraints. We conclude that the paradoxical effects of adaptation are consistent with the efficient coding framework, allowing the brain to improve the representation of frequent stimuli while limiting the associated metabolic cost.

">A multiscale electro-metabolic model of a rat neocortical circuit reveals the impact of ageing on central cortical layers</a></h4>

              
                The high energetic demands of the brain arise primarily from neuronal activity. Neurons consume substantial energy to transmit information as electrical signals and maintain their resting membrane potential. These energetic requirements are met by the neuro-glial-vascular (NGV) ensemble, which generates energy in a coupled metabolic process. In ageing, metabolic function becomes impaired, producing less energy and, consequently, the system is unable to sustain the neuronal energetic needs. We propose a multiscale model of electro-metabolic coupling in a reconstructed rat neocortex. This combines an electro-morphologically reconstructed electrophysiological model with a detailed NGV metabolic model. Our results demonstrate that the large-scale model effectively captures electro-metabolic processes at the circuit level, highlighting the importance of heterogeneity within the circuit, where energetic demands vary according to neuronal characteristics. Finally, in metabolic ageing, our model indicates that the middle cortical layers are particularly vulnerable to energy impairment.

">Chronic High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) exercise in adolescent rat's result in cocaine place aversion and ΔFosB induction</a></h4>

              
                High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) is a form of exercise that has been greatly popularized over the past few years for its many health benefits. Similar to other forms of exercise, HIIT may be beneficial in the prevention of substance use behaviors; however, the extent to which HIIT can impact the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse during adolescence has not been fully evaluated. Here, we assess the effects of HIIT during adolescence on subsequent cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP) in male Lewis rats. The HIIT exercise exposed rats ran on a treadmill for 30 minutes daily (ten three-minute cycles) for six weeks with progressive speed-increased up to 0.8 mph (21.5m/min), while the sedentary rats remained in their home cage. Following the six weeks of exercise, rats were tested for cocaine (25 mg/kg) CPP. Following completion of the behavior test {Delta}FosB levels were measured in the brain. Results showed that the HIIT rats showed significantly attenuated place preference (-19%) in their time spent in the cocaine-paired chamber compared to the sedentary environment rats. In addition, HIIT rats had significantly higher (65%) striatum {Delta}FosB levels compared to the sedentary rats. Our findings show that HIIT exercise during adolescence could be protective against cocaine abuse which may be mediated by an increase in {Delta}FosB. This finding has important clinical implications with respect to exercise mediated protection against substance misuse and abuse. Future studies will examine this effect in females as well as the potential underlying mechanisms.

">Risk optimization during ongoing movement: Insights from movement and gaze behavior in throwing</a></h4>

              
                Handling motor noise is fundamental to successful sensorimotor behavior, especially in high-risk situations. Research using finger-pointing tasks shows that humans account for motor noise and costs of potential outcomes in movement planning. However, does this mechanism generalize to more complex movement tasks? Here, we investigate sensorimotor behavior under risk in throwing across three experiments with 20 participants each. Their task was to throw balls at a target circle, partially overlapped by a penalty circle. This task challenged participants to find strategies that trade off potential penalties and rewards. In the experiments, penalty magnitude and the distance between the circles were manipulated. We measured the location of their final gaze fixation before movement - as an indicator of their planned aiming point - and the ball's impact location. Without penalty, the final gaze fixation and the ball's impact location were both centered on the target. In the penalty condition, the location of the participants' final gaze fixations and the ball's impact shifted away from the penalty circle, with larger shifts for higher penalties and smaller distances. Interestingly, the shifts in the ball's impact locations were not only larger ("more conservative") but also closer to the statistically optimal (expected gain-maximizing) location compared to the fixated aim points. Movement trajectory analyses show that, in penalty conditions, the shifts away from the penalty zone increased until the final phases of the movement. These results suggest that risk evaluation is not completed in a pre-movement planning phase but is further optimized during movement execution.

">Evidence for reduced choroid plexus volume in the aged brain</a></h4>

              
                Background: The choroid plexus plays an important role in brain homeostasis, including the active secretion of cerebrospinal fluid. Its function and structure have been reported to be affected by normal ageing. However, existing measures of choroid plexus volume may be complicated by partial volume (in-vivo MRI) and tissue fixation artefacts (histology). In this study, we investigate possible changes in choroid plexus volume within the lateral ventricles of a mouse model of ageing utilising two structural MRI protocols explicitly designed for time-efficient, high-resolution in-vivo imaging of the choroid plexus. Methods: Two MRI sequences were utilised to examine in-vivo choroid plexus volume in the lateral ventricles of young (~6 months) and aged (~24 months) mouse brains: 1) an ultra-long echo-time T2 weighted fast-spin-echo and 2) a multi-TE T2* mapping protocol. A test-retest study was performed on a subset of the data to examine the reproducibility of choroid plexus volume estimation. A two-way ANOVA test was performed to determine possible differences in choroid plexus volume in young and aged mouse groups across the two distinct MRI protocols. Results: Reproducibility tests showed a low test-retest variability of the manual segmentation pipeline for both MRI protocols. A statistically significant reduction of in vivo choroid plexus volume was found in the aged mouse brain. This finding is concordant with previous histology studies that have observed a reduction in epithelial cell height with ageing across a wide range of species. Conclusions: Here, we present an in vivo investigation of changes to lateral ventricle choroid plexus volume in the mouse brain utilising a manual segmentation approach based on two bespoke MRI protocols designed for time-efficient high resolution imaging of the choroid plexus. We provide evidence for a reduction in choroid plexus volume in the aged brain. This research provides insight for studies utilising MRI measurements of choroid plexus volume as a biomarker of age-related neurologic conditions as it indicates that the ageing process itself does not result in hypertrophy of the choroid plexus.

Neuronal responses to TMS depend not only on the magnitude of the induced E-field but also on various physiological factors. In this study, we incorporated a novel average response model that efficiently estimates the firing threshold of neurons based on their orientation relative to the applied E-field, thereby advancing TMS mapping for motor function. Methods: We conducted a regression-based TMS mapping experiment with fourteen subjects to localize cortical origins of motor evoked potential (MEP) on the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. Firing thresholds were estimated for excitatory neurons in cortical layers 2/3 and 5 via an average response model. Regression was performed between MEPs and three E-field quantities: the magnitude (magnitude model), the normal component (cosine model), and the effective E-field, which scales the E-field magnitude based on the firing thresholds specific to the neuronal orientation (neuron model). To validate, we applied TMS to ten subjects with optimized coil placements based on these three models to determine which model could yield the highest MEPs. Results: The magnitude and neuron models performed similarly, while the cosine model showed lower explained variance in regression results, required more TMS trials for stable mapping, and yielded the lowest MEP in the validation. Conclusion: This study is the first to advance TMS modeling by incorporating neuron-specific factors at the individual level. Results show that on the motor cortex, the magnitude model is, as expected, a good approximation of cortical TMS effects as it shows similar results as the neuron model. In contrast, the classic cosine model exhibited lower performance and required more TMS trials for stable results, and is not recommended for future studies.

">SENSITIVITY OF MEDIAL/LATERAL BALANCE CONTROL TO VISUAL DISTURBANCES WHILE WALKING IN YOUNG AND OLDER ADULTS</a></h4>

              
                Humans integrate multiple sources of sensory information to estimate body orientation in space. Balance control experiments while standing provide evidence that the contributions of these sensory channels change under different conditions in a process called sensory reweighting. This study aims to address whether there is evidence for sensory reweighting while walking and explores age-related differences in medial/lateral balance control under visually perturbing walking conditions. Thirty young adults (18-35 years) and thirty older adults (55-79 years) walked on a self-paced treadmill within a virtual environment that delivered frontal plane multi-sine visual disturbances at three amplitudes (6{degrees}, 10{degrees}, and 15{degrees}). Frequency response functions were used to quantify visual sensitivity to balance disturbances, while spatiotemporal gait parameters (e.g., step width, step-width variability) were measured to assess balance control. Visual sensitivity decreased in both populations with increasing stimulus amplitude, analogous to the sensory reweighting hypothesis in balance control while standing. Despite the decrease in visual sensitivity, the compensatory upweighting of other sensory systems was not observed through measurements of remnant sway. Older adults exhibited higher visual sensitivity at all amplitudes compared to young adults, indicating a more sensitive response to visual disturbances to balance control. Both groups showed increases in step width and step width variability with higher visual amplitudes, with older adults demonstrating more pronounced effects. Weak correlations existed between changes in visual sensitivity and changes in step width and step width variability suggesting a limited interaction between sensory reweighting and gait stability.

">Approach-Avoidance Bias in Virtual and Real-World Simulations: Insights from a Systematic Review of Experimental Setups</a></h4>

              
                Background: Approach and avoidance bias (AAB) describes automatic behavioral tendencies to react toward environmental stimuli regarding their emotional valence. Traditional setups have provided evidence but often lack ecological validity. The study of the AAB in naturalistic contexts has recently increased, revealing significant methodological challenges. This systematic review evaluates the use of virtual reality (VR) and real-world setups to study the AAB, summarizing methodological innovations and challenges. Methods: We systematically reviewed peer-reviewed articles employing VR and real-world setups to investigate the AAB. We analyzed experimental designs, stimuli, response metrics, and technical aspects to assess their alignment with research objectives and identify limitations. Results: This review included 21 studies revealing diverse methodologies, stimulus types, and novel behavioral responses, highlighting significant variability in design strategies and methodological coherence. Several studies used traditional reaction time measures yet varied in their application of VR technology and participant interaction paradigms. Some studies showed discrepancies between simulated and natural bodily actions, while others showcased more integrated approaches that preserved their integrity. Only a minority of studies included control conditions or acquired (neuro)physiological data. Conclusions: VR offers a potential ecological setup for studying the AAB, enabling dynamic and immersive interactions. Our results underscore the importance of establishing a coherent framework for investigating the AAB tendencies using VR. Addressing the foundational challenges of developing baseline principles that guide VR-based designs to study the AAB within naturalistic contexts is essential for advancing the AAB research and application. This will ultimately contribute to more reliable and reproducible experimental paradigms and develop effective interventions that help individuals recognize and change their biases, fostering more balanced behaviors.

">Eye movements organize excitability state, information coding and network connectivity in the human hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Natural vision is an active sensing process that entails frequent eye movements to sample the environment. Nonetheless vision is often studied using passive viewing with eye position held constant. Using closed-loop eye-tracking, with saccade-contingent stimulation and simultaneous intracranial recordings in surgical epilepsy patients, we tested the critical role of eye movement signals during natural visual processing in the hippocampus and hippocampal-amygdala circuit. Prior work shows that saccades elicit phase reset of ongoing neural excitability fluctuations across a broad array of cortical and subcortical areas. Here we show that saccade-related reset systematically modulates neuronal ensemble responses to visual input, enables phase-coding of information across the saccade-fixation cycle and modulates network connectivity between hippocampus and amygdala. The saccade-fixation cycle thus emerges as a fundamental sampling unit, organizing a range of neural operations including input representation, network connectivity and information coding.

">Early-life adversity mediates a thalamo-amgydalar circuit dysfunction underlying chronic pain and anxiety</a></h4>

              
                Childhood adversity increases the risk of developing a vicious cycle of chronic pain and comorbid anxious avoidance, yet the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigated the role of a brain circuit from the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) to the central amygdala (CeA) in mediating hyperalgesia and comorbid anxiety following early life stress. Using a vulnerability-stress model, we exposed both male and female mice to early social isolation (vulnerability) followed by nerve injury (stress) and showed increased hyperalgesia and anxious avoidance behavior in nerve-injured female mice following early adversity. Chemogenetic, electrophysiological, and optophysiological analyses revealed a causal contribution of a hyperexcitable PVT-CeA circuit dysfunction to chronic hyperalgesia and anxiety in nerve-injured female mice after early life stress. Our findings reveal a neural mechanism linking childhood adversity to chronic pain and anxiety, and suggest that reprogramming this pathway may reverse the impact of childhood adversity.

">Non-ionotropic signaling through the NMDA receptor GluN2B carboxy terminal domain drives morphological plasticity of dendritic spines and reverses fragile X phenotypes in mouse hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                It is well known that activation of NMDA receptors (NMDAR) can trigger long-term synaptic depression (LTD) and that a morphological correlate of this functional plasticity is spine retraction and elimination. Recent studies have led to the surprising conclusion that NMDA-induced spine shrinkage proceeds independently of ion flux and requires the initiation of de novo protein synthesis, highlighting an unappreciated contribution of mRNA translation to non-ionotropic NMDAR signaling. Here we used NMDA-induced spine shrinkage in slices of mouse hippocampus as a readout to investigate this novel modality of synaptic transmission. By using subtype selective pharmacological and genetic tools, we find that structural plasticity is dependent on the ligand binding domain (LBD) of GluN2B-containing NMDARs and that metabotropic signaling occurs via the GluN2B carboxy terminal domain (CTD). Disruption of signaling by replacing the GluN2B CTD with the GluN2A CTD leads to an increase in spine density, dysregulated basal protein synthesis, exaggerated mGluR-LTD, and epileptiform activity reminiscent of phenotypes observed in the Fmr1 knockout (KO) model of fragile X syndrome. By crossing the Fmr1 KO mice with animals in which the GluN2A CTD has been replaced with the GluN2B CTD, we observe a correction of these core fragile X phenotypes. These findings suggest that non-ionotropic NMDAR signaling through GluN2B may represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of fragile X and related causes of intellectual disability and autism.

	<p>Background: It is known that being the adult child of a parent with an alcohol use disorder (ACoA) can confer a wide variety of increased health and psychological risks, including higher rates of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Additionally, ACoAs are at greater risk of developing alcohol/substance use disorders (AUDs/SUDs) than individuals from families without a history of AUDs. Methods: ACoA individuals with risky hazardous alcohol use (n = 14) and those not engaged in hazardous use (n = 14) were compared to a group of healthy controls. We examined structural brain differences and applied machine learning algorithms to predict biological brain and DNA methylation ages to investigate differences and determine any accelerated aging between these groups. Results: Hazardous and non-hazardous ACoA groups had lower predicted brain ages than the healthy control group (n = 100), which may result from neuro-developmental differences between ACoA groups and controls. Within specific brain regions, we observed decreased cortical volume within bilateral pars orbitalis and frontal poles, and the left middle temporal gyrus and entorhinal cortex within the hazardous alcohol ACoA group. When looking at the epigenetic aging data, the hazardous ACoA participants had increased predicted epigenetic age difference scores compared to the control group (n = 34) and the non-hazardous ACoA participant groups. Conclusions: The results demonstrate a decreased brain age in the ACoAs compared to control, concurrent with increased epigenetic age specifically in the hazardous ACoA group, laying the foundation for future research to identify individuals with an increased susceptibility to developing hazardous alcohol use. Together, these results provide a better understanding of the associations between epigenetic factors, brain structure, and alcohol use disorders.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Empathy for pain enhances our ability to perceive pain and recognize potential dangers. Empathic bias occurs when members of the in-group evoke more intense empathic responses compared to out-group members. In the process of interacting with peers, children develop peer status and spontaneously form peer groups. The present study examined how peer status affects pain empathy in mid-childhood individuals. Methods: A behavior and an event-related potential (ERP) study were conducted. Participants were exposed to pictures of different peers in painful or non-painful situations and completed the pain and unpleasantness rating tasks. Four types of peers were included: popular, rejected, neglected and unfamiliar peers. Results: The behavioral results suggested that the influence of peer status on cognitive empathy is more salient, and the empathic response to unfamiliar peers is higher than neglecting and rejecting peers. The ERP results indicated that larger P3 and LPP amplitude were observed in the painful stimulus condition than in the non-painful stimulus condition. The findings also showed that the popular peers elicited larger LPP amplitude than other peers. The LPP response to unfamiliar peers was larger than to neglected peers. Conclusions: All these results demonstrated that mid-childhood individuals showed empathic bias to in-group members, but it was influenced by peer status in the cognitive processes of pain empathy.</p>

	<p>Objective: The etiology of multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is still debated, which is an obstacle to assessing treatment options. An analysis of the scientific literature combined with the clinical experience can suggest some avenues. Methods: The etiology of MCS and its underlying mechanisms were reviewed from the scientific literature to identify the main factors contributing to its development. The results of the studies involving biomarkers and cerebral imaging techniques on MCS subjects were compared with those performed on subjects having the comorbidities of MCS. From the scientific literature and the experience in a clinical setting in occupational and environmental medicine, distinct types of MCS were looked for, with the application of the underlying mechanisms. The potential effectiveness of available treatments was also reviewed. Results: Among many factors, unresolved emotional traumas causing chronic and acute stress reactions play an important role in the development of MCS and can be the basis for effective treatment. We identified three types of clinical presentations, called the accidental type, following a toxic exposure causing an associated emotional trauma, the associative type, following a repeated innocuous exposure in a threatening context, and the developmental type, following a traumatic childhood/adolescence causing hypervigilance and chronic stress/trauma-related disorders. We presented real cases to illustrate these types and the mechanisms behind their development, as well as effective resolution. Conclusions: MCS and its comorbidities could be treated effectively when the underlying emotional trauma(s) are targeted using trauma-focused psychotherapy and other therapies. Diagnostic criteria, principles of treatment and prevention, and avenues for research were derived from this analysis.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Dementia is a syndrome which involves cognitive and motor problems such as memory and motor control that impacts the individuals&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life. In mental imagery (MI) technique, motor acts are mentally rehearsed without any overt body movements. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of MI on the quality of life, cognitive, and emotional status of older adults with an early stage of dementia. Methods: The present randomized controlled trial consisted of 160 participants. The sample from an Athens Day Care Center of the Alzheimer Association was randomized to (a) the MI and exercise group (intervention group, n = 55), (b) the only exercise group (1st control group, n = 52), and (c) the neither MI nor exercise group (2nd control group, n = 53). Participants engaged in a total of 24 physiotherapy sessions, each lasting approximately 45 min, scheduled twice weekly over a 12-week period. They performed three assessments: (a) one week prior to the program, (b) one and a half months, and (c) after the program. The intervention group performed a 30 min MI with exercise program content immediately following every physiotherapy exercise session. Walking While Talking Test (WWITT), the Euro-Qol 5-Dimensions 5-Level of severity scale (Euro-Qol 5D-5L scale), the Short-Form of Geriatric Depression Scale (SF-GDS), and the Short Anxiety Screening Test (SAST) were used to assess cognitive status, emotional status, and quality of life. Results: A total of 160 participants (43 men, 117 women, with MMSE M = 23.20 SD = 0.15) took part in this study in which most reported holding a university degree (n = 77), were married (n = 101), and had loss of memory as the 1st symptom of dementia (n= 117). The Friedman test revealed statistically significant differences across the three groups on (a) the WWITTmistakes (X2 = 14.95, df = 2, p = 0.001) and WWITTtime (X2 = 13.35, df = 2, p = 0.01), (b) the total Euro-Qol 5D-5L scale (X2 = 11.87.62, df = 2, p = 0.003) and quality of life on the measuring day (X2 = 25.59, df = 2, p = 0.00), (c) the SF-GDS (X2 = 6.54, df = 2, p = 0.038), and (d) the SAST (X2 = 39.907.62, df = 2, p = 0.00). The Friedman test with post hoc Wilcoxon analysis revealed that the mean scores for the intervention group and the 1st control were significantly better than the 2nd control group in many dependent variables. Conclusions: The results indicate that incorporating MI can positively influence cognitive status, emotional status, and the quality of life in older adults diagnosed with early-stage dementia.</p>

">A simple neural circuit model explains diverse types of integration kernels in perceptual decision-making</a></h4>

              
                The ability to accumulate evidence over time for deliberate decision is essential for both humans and animals. Decades of decision-making research have documented various types of integration kernels that characterize how evidence is temporally weighted. While numerous normative models have been proposed to explain these kernels, there remains a gap in circuit models that account for the complexity and heterogeneity of single neuron activities. In this study, we sought to address this gap by using low-rank neural network modeling in the context of a perceptual decision-making task. Firstly, we demonstrated that even a simple rank-one neural network model yields diverse types of integration kernels observed in human data--including primacy, recency, and non-monotonic kernels--with a performance comparable to state-of-the-art normative models such as the drift diffusion model and the divisive normalization model. Moreover, going beyond the previous normative models, this model enabled us to gain insights at two levels. At the collective level, we derived a novel explicit mechanistic expression that explains how these kernels emerge from a neural circuit. At the single neuron level, this model exhibited heterogenous single neuron response kernels, resembling the diversity observed in neurophysiological recordings. In sum, we present a simple rank-one neural circuit that reproduces diverse types of integration kernels at the collective level while simultaneously capturing complexity of single neuron responses observed experimentally.

	<p>(1) Background: Cognitive failures, including lapses in attention, memory, and executive functioning, can negatively affect daily performance and well-being. Negative and positive affectivity have been implicated in cognitive functioning, yet their relationship with cognitive failures remains underexplored. This study investigates the impact of positive and negative affect on cognitive failures, using daily diary methods to examine both within-person and between-person associations in a sample of younger adults from Singapore and adults across the lifespan from the United States (US). (2) Methods: Participants (Singapore: N = 253, US: N = 1726) completed daily diaries over seven (Singapore) or eight (US) consecutive days. Multilevel modelling was used to analyse both within- and between-person relationships between affect and cognitive failures, controlling for demographic and socioeconomic variables. (3) Results: In both the Singapore and US samples, negative affect was consistently positively associated with cognitive failures at both levels (SG within-person: &amp;amp;beta; = 0.21, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; SG between-person: &amp;amp;beta; = 0.58, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; US within-person: &amp;amp;beta; = 0.08, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; US between-person: &amp;amp;beta; = 0.28, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), supporting the influence of negative affective experiences on cognitive lapses. However, positive affect showed no significant associations with daily cognitive failures in the Singapore sample (within-person: &amp;amp;beta; = 0.01, p = 0.683; between-person: &amp;amp;beta; = &amp;amp;minus;0.04, p = 0.484) and only a between-person negative association in the US sample (within-person: &amp;amp;beta; = 0.02, p = 0.157; between-person: &amp;amp;beta; = &amp;amp;minus;0.11, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). (4) Conclusion: These findings suggest that positive and negative affect differentially influence individual differences and intra-individual changes in daily cognitive failures among both younger and older adults.</p>

	<p>Background: Auditory&amp;amp;ndash;tactile integration is an important research area in multisensory integration. Especially in special environments (e.g., traffic noise and complex work environments), auditory&amp;amp;ndash;tactile integration is crucial for human response and decision making. We investigated the influence of attention on the temporal course and spatial distribution of auditory&amp;amp;ndash;tactile integration. Methods: Participants received auditory stimuli alone, tactile stimuli alone, and simultaneous auditory and tactile stimuli, which were randomly presented on the left or right side. For each block, participants attended to all stimuli on the designated side and detected uncommon target stimuli while ignoring all stimuli on the other side. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded via 64 scalp electrodes. Integration was quantified by comparing the response to the combined stimulus to the sum of the responses to the auditory and tactile stimuli presented separately. Results: The results demonstrated that compared to the unattended condition, integration occurred earlier and involved more brain regions in the attended condition when the stimulus was presented in the left hemispace. The unattended condition involved a more extensive range of brain regions and occurred earlier than the attended condition when the stimulus was presented in the right hemispace. Conclusions: Attention can modulate auditory&amp;amp;ndash;tactile integration and show systematic differences between the left and right hemispaces. These findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of auditory&amp;amp;ndash;tactile information processing in the human brain.</p>

	<p>Objective: This study aimed to explore longitudinal relationships between neurophysiological biomarkers and upper limb motor function recovery in stroke patients, focusing on electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) metrics. Methods: This longitudinal cohort study analyzed neurophysiological, clinical, and demographic data from 102 stroke patients enrolled in the DEFINE cohort. We investigated the associations between baseline and post-intervention changes in the EEG theta/alpha ratio (TAR) and TMS metrics with upper limb motor functionality, assessed using the outcomes of five tests: the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Handgrip Strength Test (HST), Pinch Strength Test (PST), Finger Tapping Test (FTT), and Nine-Hole Peg Test (9HPT). Results: Our multivariate models identified that a higher baseline TAR in the lesioned hemisphere was consistently associated with poorer motor outcomes across all five assessments. Conversely, a higher improvement in the TAR was positively associated with improvements in FMA and 9HPT. Additionally, an increased TMS motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude in the non-lesioned hemisphere correlated with greater FMA-diff, while a lower TMS Short Intracortical Inhibition (SICI) in the non-lesioned hemisphere was linked to better PST improvements. These findings suggest the potential of the TAR and TMS metrics as biomarkers for predicting motor recovery in stroke patients. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the significance of the TAR in the lesioned hemisphere as a predictor of motor function recovery post-stroke and also a potential signature for compensatory oscillations. The observed relationships between the TAR and motor improvements, as well as the associations with TMS metrics, underscore the potential of these neurophysiological measures in guiding personalized rehabilitation strategies for stroke patients.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Chronic pain is a highly debilitating condition that differs by type, prevalence, and severity between men and women. To uncover the molecular underpinnings of these differences, it is critical to analyze the transcriptomes of spinal cord pain-processing networks for both sexes. Despite several recently published single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) studies on the function and composition of the mouse spinal cord, a gene expression analysis investigating the differences between males and females has yet to be performed. Here, we combined data from three different large-scale snRNA-seq studies, which used sex-identified adult mice. Using SeqSeek, we classified more than 37,000 unique viable cells within predicted cell types with the use of machine learning. We then utilized DESeq2 to identify significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between males and females in a variety of cell populations, including superficial dorsal horn (SDH) neurons. We found a large number of DEGs between males and females in all cells, in neurons, and in SDH neurons of the mouse spinal cord, with a greater level of differential expression in inhibitory SDH neurons compared to excitatory SDH neurons. The results of these analyses are available on an open-source web-app: <a target="_blank"

Lastly, we used gene set enrichment analysis to identify sex-enriched pathways from our previously identified DEGs. Through this, we have identified specific genetic players within the rodent spinal cord that diverge between males and females, which may underlie reported sex differences in spinal nociceptive mechanisms and pain processing.</p>

                Zhou et al. show that high environmental temperature triggers a preventive immune response in C. elegans via the ER UPR, distinct from pathogen invasion requiring the mitochondrial UPR. This activation leads to ribosome biogenesis suppression and oleic acid accumulation, subsequently activating the PMK-1/p38 pathway and highlighting ER-nucleolus crosstalk in innate immunity and lifespan.

	<p>Objectives: Dementia is becoming a major health problem in the world, and chronic brain ischemia is an established important risk factor in predisposing this disease. Astrocytes, as one major part of the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB), are activated during chronic cerebral blood flow hypoperfusion. Reactive astrocytes have been classified into phenotype pro-inflammatory type A1 or neuroprotective type A2. However, the specific subtype change of astrocyte and the mechanisms of chronic brain ischemia are still unknown. Methods: In order to depict the phenotype changes and their possible roles during this process, a rat bilateral common carotid artery occlusion model (BCAO) was employed in the present study. Meanwhile, the signaling pathways that possibly regulate these changes were investigated as well. Results: After four-week occlusion, astrocytes in the cortex of BCAO rats were shown to be the A2 phenotype, identified by the significant up-regulation of S100a10 accompanied by the down-regulation of Connexin 43 (CX43) protein. Next, we established in vitro hypoxia models, which were set up by stimulating primary astrocyte cultures from rat cortex with cobalt chloride, low glucose, or/and fibrinogen. Consistent with in vivo data, the cultured astrocytes also transformed into the A2 phenotype with the up-regulation of S100a10 and the down-regulation of CX43. In order to explore the mechanism of CX43 protein changes, C6 astrocyte cells were handled in both hypoxia and low-glucose stimulus, in which decreased pERK and pJNK expression were found. Conclusions: In conclusion, our data suggest that in chronic cerebral ischemia conditions, the gradual ischemic insults could promote the transformation of astrocytes into A2 type instead of A1 type, and the phosphorylation of CX43 was negatively regulated by the phosphorylation of ERK and JNK. Also, our data could provide some new evidence of how to leverage the endogenous astrocytes phenotype changes during CNS injury by promoting them to be &amp;amp;ldquo;protector&amp;amp;rdquo; and not &amp;amp;ldquo;culprit&amp;amp;rdquo;.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interfaces (BCIs) are a rapidly developing technology that captures and transmits brain signals to external sources, allowing the user control of devices such as prosthetics. BCI technology offers the potential to restore physical capabilities in the body and change how we interact and communicate with computers and each other. While BCI technology has existed for decades, recent developments have caused the technology to generate a host of ethical issues and discussions in both academic and public circles. Given that media representation has the potential to shape public perception and policy, it is necessary to evaluate the space that these issues take in public discourse. Methods: We conducted a rapid review of media articles in English discussing ethical issues of BCI technology from 2013 to 2024 as indexed by LexisNexis. Our searches yielded 675 articles, with a final sample containing 182 articles. We assessed the themes of the articles and coded them based on the ethical issues discussed, ethical frameworks, recommendations, tone, and application of technology. Results: Our results showed a marked rise in interest in media articles over time, signaling an increased focus on this topic. The majority of articles adopted a balanced or neutral tone when discussing BCIs and focused on ethical issues regarding privacy, autonomy, and regulation. Conclusions: Current discussion of ethical issues reflects growing news coverage of companies such as Neuralink, and reveals a mounting distrust of BCI technology. The growing recognition of ethical considerations in BCI highlights the importance of ethical discourse in shaping the future of the field.</p>

	<p>Background: Currently, there is a need for approaches to understand and manage the multidimensional autism spectrum and quantify its heterogeneity. The diagnosis is based on behaviors observed in two key dimensions, social communication and repetitive, restricted behaviors, alongside the identification of required support levels. However, it is now recognized that additional modifiers, such as language abilities, IQ, and comorbidities, are essential for a more comprehensive assessment of the complex clinical presentations and clinical trajectories in autistic individuals. Different approaches have been used to identify autism subgroups based on the genetic and clinical heterogeneity, recognizing the importance of autistic behaviors and the assessment of modifiers. While valuable, these methods are limited in their ability to evaluate a specific individual in relation to a normative reference sample of autistic individuals. A quantitative score based on axes of phenotypic variability could be useful to compare individuals, evaluate the homogeneity of subgroups, and follow trajectories of an individual or a specific group. Here we propose an approach by (i) combining measures of phenotype variability that contribute to clinical presentation and could impact different trajectories in autistic persons and (ii) using it with normative modeling to assess the clinical heterogeneity of a specific individual. Methods: Using phenotypic data available in a comprehensive reference sample, the Simons Simplex Collection (n = 2744 individuals), we performed principal component analysis (PCA) to find components of phenotypic variability. Features that contribute to clinical heterogeneity and could impact trajectories in autistic people were assessed by the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Cognitive assessment was estimated by the Total Intelligence Quotient (IQ). Results: Three PCs embedded 72% of the normative sample variance. PCA-projected dimensions supported normative modeling where a multivariate normal distribution was used to calculate percentiles. A Multidimensional General Functionality Score (MGFS) to evaluate new prospective single subjects was developed based on percentiles. Conclusions: Our approach proposes a basis for comparing individuals, or one individual at two or more times and evaluating homogeneity in phenotypic clinical presentation and possibly guides research sample selection for clinical trials.</p>

                <p>Increasing data suggest a crucial relationship between glycolipid metabolic disorder and neuropsychiatric injury. The aim of this study is to investigate the behavioral performance changes and neuropathological injuries in mice challenged with high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ). The glucose metabolism indicators and behavioral performance were detected. The mRNA expression of IL-1&beta;, IL-6, TNF-&alpha;, ocln, zo-1, and clnds and protein expression of APP, p-Tau, p-IRS1, p-AKT, p-ERK, and TREM1/2 were measured. The fluorescence intensities of MAP-2, NeuN, APP, p-Tau, GFAP, and IBA-1 were observed. The results showed that combination of HFD and STZ/I.P. could induce glucose metabolic turmoil and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neuropsychiatric dysfunction in mice, as indicated by the increased concentrations of fasting blood glucose and impaired learning and memory ability. Moreover, the model mice presented increased levels of APP, p-Tau, p-IRS1, TREM2, IL-1&beta;, IL-6, TNF-&alpha;, ocln, zo-1, and clnds; decreased levels of p-AKT, p-ERK, and TREM1; and neuron damage and the hyperactivation of astrocytes and microglia in the hippocampus as compared with control mice. Only male mice were used in this study. Although AD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are distinct pathologies, our results suggested that combination of HFD and STZ/I.P., a widely used T2DM modeling method, could successfully induce AD-like behavioral impairments and neuropathological injuries in mice; the mechanism might be involved with neuroinflammation and its associated dysfunction of IRS1/AKT/ERK signaling pathway. Our findings further support the potential overlap between T2DM and AD pathophysiology, providing insight into the mechanisms underlying the comorbidity of these diseases.</p>

                <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication, cognitive rigidity, and atypical sensory processing. Recent studies suggest that the basal ganglia, specifically the striatum (NSt), plays an important role in ASD. While striatal interneurons, including cholinergic (ChAT<sup>+</sup>) and parvalbumin-positive (PV<sup>+</sup>) GABAergic neurons, have been described to be altered in animal models of ASD, their specific contribution remains elusive. Here, we combined behavioral, anatomical, and electrophysiological quantifications to explore if interneuron balance could be implicated in atypical sensory processing in cortical and striatal somatosensory regions of rats subjected to a valproic acid (VPA) model of ASD. We found that VPA animals showed a significant decrease in the number of ChAT<sup>+</sup> and PV<sup>+</sup> cells in multiple regions (including the sensorimotor region) of the NSt. We also observed significantly different sensory-evoked responses at the single-neuron and population levels in both striatal and cortical regions, as well as corticostriatal interactions. Therefore, selective elimination of striatal PV<sup>+</sup> neurons only partially recapitulated the effects of VPA, indicating that the mechanisms behind the VPA phenotype are much more complex than the elimination of a particular neural subpopulation. Our results indicate that VPA exposure induced significant histological changes in ChAT<sup>+</sup> and PV<sup>+</sup> cells accompanied by atypical sensory-evoked corticostriatal population dynamics that could partially explain the sensory processing differences associated with ASD.</p>

                <p>by Karim G. Habashy, Benjamin D. Evans, Dan F. M. Goodman, Jeffrey S. Bowers</p>

Brains have evolved diverse neurons with varying morphologies and dynamics that impact temporal information processing. In contrast, most neural network models use homogeneous units that vary only in spatial parameters (weights and biases). To explore the importance of temporal parameters, we trained spiking neural networks on tasks with varying temporal complexity, holding different parameter subsets constant. We found that adapting conduction delays is crucial for solving all test conditions under tight resource constraints. Remarkably, these tasks can be solved using only temporal parameters (delays and time constants) with constant weights. In more complex spatio-temporal tasks, an adaptable bursting parameter was essential. Overall, allowing adaptation of both temporal and spatial parameters enhances network robustness to noise, a vital feature for biological brains and neuromorphic computing systems. Our findings suggest that rich and adaptable dynamics may be the key for solving temporally structured tasks efficiently in evolving organisms, which would help explain the diverse physiological properties of biological neurons.

                <p>by Pengyu Liu, Jacob Lusk, Nataša Jonoska, Mariel Vázquez</p>

R-loops are a class of non-canonical nucleic acid structures that typically form during transcription when the nascent RNA hybridizes the DNA template strand, leaving the non-template DNA strand unpaired. These structures are abundant in nature and play important physiological and pathological roles. Recent research shows that DNA sequence and topology affect R-loops, yet it remains unclear how these and other factors contribute to R-loop formation. In this work, we investigate the link between nascent RNA folding and the formation of R-loops. We introduce tree-polynomials, a new class of representations of RNA secondary structures. A tree-polynomial representation consists of a rooted tree associated with an RNA secondary structure together with a polynomial that is uniquely identified with the rooted tree. Tree-polynomials enable accurate, interpretable and efficient data analysis of RNA secondary structures without pseudoknots. We develop a computational pipeline for investigating and predicting R-loop formation from a genomic sequence. The pipeline obtains nascent RNA secondary structures from a co-transcriptional RNA folding software, and computes the tree-polynomial representations of the structures. By applying this pipeline to plasmid sequences that contain R-loop forming genes, we establish a strong correlation between the coefficient sums of tree-polynomials and the experimental probability of R-loop formation. Such strong correlation indicates that the pipeline can be used for accurate R-loop prediction. Furthermore, the interpretability of tree-polynomials allows us to characterize the features of RNA secondary structure associated with R-loop formation. In particular, we identify that branches with short stems separated by bulges and interior loops are associated with R-loops.

In the era of precision medicine, it is necessary to understand heterogeneity among patients with complex diseases to improve personalized prevention and management strategies. Here, we introduce ClustAll, a Bioconductor package designed for unsupervised patient stratification using clinical data. ClustAll is based on the previously validated methodology ClustAll, a clustering framework that effectively handles intricacies in clinical data, including mixed data types, missing values, and collinearity. Additionally, ClustAll stands out in its ability to identify multiple patient stratifications within the same population while ensuring their robustness.

Mosquito-related diseases pose a significant threat to global public health, necessitating efficient and accurate mosquito classification for effective surveillance and control. This work presents an innovative approach to mosquito classification by leveraging state-of-the-art vision transformers and open-set learning techniques. A novel framework has been introduced that integrates Transformer-based deep learning models with comprehensive data augmentation and preprocessing methods, enabling robust and precise identification of ten mosquito species. The Swin Transformer model achieves the best performance for traditional closed-set learning with 99.60% accuracy and 0.996 F1 score. The lightweight MobileViT technique attains an almost equivalent accuracy of 98.90% with significantly reduced parameters and model complexities. Next, the applied deep learning models’ adaptability and generalizability in a static environment have been enhanced by using new classes of data samples during the inference stage that have not been included in the training set. The proposed framework’s ability to handle unseen classes like insects similar to mosquitoes, even humans, through open-set learning further enhances its practical applicability employing the OpenMax technique and Weibull distribution. The traditional CNN model, Xception, outperforms the latest transformer with higher accuracy and F1 score for open-set learning. The study’s findings highlight the transformative potential of advanced deep-learning architectures in entomology, providing a strong groundwork for future research and development in mosquito surveillance and vector control. The implications of this work extend beyond mosquito classification, offering valuable insights for broader ecological and environmental monitoring applications.

                <p>by Emine Celiker, Charlie Woodrow, Òscar Guadayol, Leonidas-Romanos Davranoglou, Christian M. Schlepütz, Beth Mortimer, Graham K. Taylor, Stuart Humphries, Fernando Montealegre-Z</p>

Mammalian hearing operates on three basic steps: 1) sound capturing, 2) impedance conversion, and 3) frequency analysis. While these canonical steps are vital for acoustic communication and survival in mammals, they are not unique to them. An equivalent mechanism has been described for katydids (Insecta), and it is unique to this group among invertebrates. The katydid inner ear resembles an uncoiled cochlea, and has a length less than 1 mm. Their inner ears contain a hearing organ, <i>crista acustica</i>, which holds tonotopically arranged sensory cells for frequency mapping via travelling waves. The <i>crista acustica</i> is located on a curved triangular surface formed by the dorsal wall of the ear canal. While empirical recordings show tonotopic vibrations in the katydid inner ear for frequency analysis, the biophysical mechanism leading to tonotopy remains elusive due to the small size and complexity of the hearing organ. In this study, robust numerical simulations are developed for an <i>in silico</i> investigation of this process. Simulations are based on the precise katydid inner ear geometry obtained by synchrotron-based micro-computed tomography, and empirically determined inner ear fluid properties for an accurate representation of the underlying mechanism. We demonstrate that the triangular structure below the hearing organ drives the tonotopy and travelling waves in the inner ear, and thus has an equivalent role to the mammalian basilar membrane. This reveals a stronger analogy between the inner ear basic mechanical networks of two organisms with ancient evolutionary differences and independent phylogenetic histories.

                <p>by Victor Geadah, Stefan Horoi, Giancarlo Kerg, Guy Wolf, Guillaume Lajoie</p>

Neurons in the brain have rich and adaptive input-output properties. Features such as heterogeneous f-I curves and spike frequency adaptation are known to place single neurons in optimal coding regimes when facing changing stimuli. Yet, it is still unclear how brain circuits exploit single-neuron flexibility, and how network-level requirements may have shaped such cellular function. To answer this question, a multi-scaled approach is needed where the computations of single neurons and neural circuits must be considered as a complete system. In this work, we use artificial neural networks to systematically investigate single-neuron input-output adaptive mechanisms, optimized in an end-to-end fashion. Throughout the optimization process, each neuron has the liberty to modify its nonlinear activation function parametrized to mimic f-I curves of biological neurons, either by learning an individual static function or via a learned and shared adaptation mechanism to modify activation functions in real-time during a task. We find that such adaptive networks show much-improved robustness to noise and changes in input statistics. Using tools from dynamical systems theory, we analyze the role of these emergent single-neuron properties and argue that neural diversity and adaptation play an active regularization role, enabling neural circuits to optimally propagate information across time. Finally, we outline similarities between these optimized solutions and known coding strategies found in biological neurons, such as gain scaling and fractional order differentiation/integration.

                <p>by Jorin Overwiening, Federico Tesler, Domenico Guarino, Alain Destexhe</p>

The thalamus is the brain’s central relay station, orchestrating sensory processing and cognitive functions. However, how thalamic function depends on internal and external states, is not well understood. A comprehensive understanding would necessitate the integration of single cell dynamics with their collective behavior at population level. For this we propose a biologically realistic mean-field model of the thalamus, describing thalamocortical relay neurons (TC) and thalamic reticular neurons (RE). We perform a multi-scale study of thalamic responsiveness and its dependence on cell and brain states. Building upon existing single-cell experiments we show that: (1) Awake and sleep-like states can be defined via the absence/presence of the neuromodulator acetylcholine (ACh), which controls bursting in TC and RE. (2) Thalamic response to sensory stimuli is linear in awake state and becomes nonlinear in sleep state, while cortical input generates nonlinear response in both awake and sleep state. (3) Stimulus response is controlled by cortical input, which suppresses responsiveness in awake state while it ‘wakes-up’ the thalamus in sleep state promoting a linear response. (4) Synaptic noise induces a global linear responsiveness, diminishing the difference in response between thalamic states. Finally, the model replicates spindle oscillations within a sleep-like state, exhibiting a qualitative change in activity and responsiveness. The development of this thalamic mean-field model provides a new tool for incorporating detailed thalamic dynamics in large scale brain simulations.

                <p>by Tina Lenče, Johannes Sulzer, Kilian Andress, Anne-Sophie Gribling-Burrer, Vanessa Lamm-Schmidt, Lars Barquist, Redmond P. Smyth, Franziska Faber</p>

Bacterial noncoding RNAs fulfill a variety of cellular functions as catalysts, as scaffolds in protein complexes or as regulators of gene expression. They often exhibit complex tertiary structures that are a key determinant of their biochemical function. Here, we characterize the structured “<i>raiA</i> motif” RNA from <i>Clostridioides difficile</i>, which is conserved in more than 2,500 bacterial species from the phyla Bacillota and Actinomycetota. We show that its transcript abundance and stability in exponentially growing bacteria rivals that of ribosomal RNAs. Deletion of the “<i>raiA</i> motif” RNA is associated with delayed transition into stationary phase, and changes in stationary phase pathways such as spore formation, hence we rename it ModT (modulator of transition phase). Mechanistically, we show that ModT-mediated changes in cellular cyclic di-GMP levels are linked to the pronounced sporulation defect in the <i>modT</i> mutant. Importantly, we show that expression profiles and isoform patterns of ModT are conserved in <i>Clostridium perfringens</i> and <i>Paeniclostridium sordellii</i>, and that these orthologs can functionally complement ModT in <i>C</i>. <i>difficile</i>. Chemical structure probing of ModT in vivo reveals dynamic refolding and provides initial evidence for a potential association of ModT with proteins. In summary, our findings indicate that ModT fulfills a conserved role in regulating growth transitions in bacteria and provide a crucial step towards delineating its molecular mechanism.

                Background Aromatic hydrocarbons such as Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene and Xylene (BTEX), give us an environmental challenge. They can be degraded by strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, through emulsification (rhl genes) and biodegradation processes. The BTEX tolerance genes (mlaABCD) may be present in it. The aim of this research was to evaluate, through comparative genomics, the genes of the rhl and mla systems in six strains isolated from hydrocarbon polluted environments. Methods This study examines six Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from hydrocarbon-contaminated sites in Peru. Each strain shows capabilities like hydrocarbon degradation and heavy metal tolerance. After DNA extraction, sequencing, and quality-controlled assembly, functional genome annotation was performed using BAKTA. Comparative analysis included high-quality Pseudomonas genomes from RefSeq, with ANI metrics to assess genetic similarity. A phylogenetic tree, built from core gene alignment, reveals evolutionary connections and was visualized with iTOL. Results Results showed that all strains had a double copy of the rhlB gene, arranged in the same organization, with rhlABRI genes always adjacent in a 3′-5′ direction. However, rhlG varied in position and orientation among strains, often near rhlC. The C1BHIC5 strain had only one copy of the rhlB gene, and the 3′ – 5 orientation of the rhlG gene was the exception. Most strains had two copies of mlaA, mlaFEDC, and mlaEFD genes for toluene tolerance, with diverse orientations across strains. High synteny was noted within mla gene blocks. Compared to Pseudomonas putida, where mla genes are positioned between murA and ppcD with an additional toluene tolerance gene (ttg2D), strains of P. aeruginosa strains display a similar yet distinct gene arrangement. Conclusions In conclusion, the presence of the rhlABC genes in all the strains analyzed and the BTEX tolerance genes allowed us to understand the great ability of P. aeruginosa to survive in polluted environments.

                Introduction We examined the predictors of tobacco smoking initiation considering factors such as age, gender, pocket money, exposure to smoke in public outdoor places, anti-tobacco media, smoking parents, smoking teachers, and smoking friends among adolescents in Indonesia. Methods Using data from the 2014–2019 National Youth Tobacco Survey grades 7–12, data from 9,655 teenagers were analyzed. The research used the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) questionnaire. The analysis used univariate, chi-square and logistic regression with the STATA application version 15. Results In total, 9655 adolescent respondents participated. Multivariate tests indicated that teenagers aged 13-15 years (AOR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.08-1.66) and teenagers aged> 15 years (AOR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.25-2.17), teenagers who were male (AOR: 13.99, 95% CI: 11.11-17.63), teenagers who were exposed to cigarette smoke in public places outside the room (AOR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.74-2.29), teenagers who had never seen anti-tobacco messages in the mass media (AOR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.02-1.48), Teenagers who had parents who smoke (AOR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.08-1.46), teenagers who saw teachers smoking in the school area (AOR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.18-1.71), and teenagers who accepted offers of cigarettes from friends (AOR: 15.11, 95% CI: 10.33-22.11). Conclusion The initiation of tobacco smoking among teenagers in Indonesia can be predicted by various factors such as age, gender, exposure to smoke in outdoor public places, exposure to anti-tobacco media, and influence of parents, teachers, and friends.

                Background In broiler farming, vaccination against Newcastle disease (ND) is essential. Nonetheless, during the post-vaccination phase, production may be negatively impacted by mycotoxin contamination in feed. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of toxin binders on antibody titer and large intestine histopathology after ND vaccination in broiler with aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and ochratoxin A (OTA) toxication. Methods A total of 20 broilers were randomly assigned into 4 groups with 5 replications i.e. (C-) broiler groups with basal feed, (C+) broiler groups with AFB1 and OTA feed contamination, (T1) and (T2) broiler groups with exposed AFB1, OTA, and toxin binders as feed additives with dose 1.1 g/kg and 1.6 g/kg feed, respectively. ND vaccination was carried out on day 7 and 21. Antibody titers were evaluated from serum samples of broiler on days 14, 28, and 35 for further hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. Histopathology of the cecum and colon organs was evaluated using HE staining on day 36. HI test and histological scoring were analyzed using the One-Way ANOVA, followed by Duncan’s test with a p < 0.05 in SPSS v.26 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results As a result, histopathological improvement of the cecum and colon was reported based on mucosal rupture, hemorrhage and necrosis on day 35. An increase in the mean antibody titer compared to days 14 and 28 was observed on day 35, with significant changes observed in serum samples based on the C+ group, which was significantly different from the C- and T2 groups (p < 0.05). Conclusions This study revealed that toxin binder dose of 1.6 g/kg can increase antibody titer and histopathology of cecum and colon in broiler chickens after ND vaccination fed with mycotoxin-contaminated feed.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The hypothesis that the hippocampal theta rhythm consists of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) was critical for understanding the theta rhythm. The dominant views in the early 1980s were that intracellularly recorded theta consisted of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) with little participation by IPSPs, and that IPSPs generated a closed monopolar field in the hippocampus. I (Leung) conceived of a new model for generation of the hippocampal theta rhythm, with theta-rhythmic IPSPs as an essential component, and thus sought to reinvestigate the relation between theta and IPSPs quantitatively with intracellular and extracellular recordings. The intracellular recordings were performed by Leung and Yim in the laboratory of Kris Krnjević at McGill University. Using protocols of passing steady-state holding currents and injection of chloride ions, the intracellular theta and IPSP in a CA1 neuron typically showed the same reversal potential and correlated change in amplitude. Low-intensity stimulation of the alveus evoked an antidromic action potential in CA1 neurons, identifying them as pyramidal cells with output axons in the alveus, which then activated a feedback IPSP with almost no excitatory component. Theta-rhythmic somatic inhibition, together with phase-shifted theta-rhythmic distal apical dendritic excitation were proposed as the two dipoles that generate a gradual extracellular theta phase shift in the CA1 apical dendritic layer. The distal apical excitation driven by the entorhinal cortex was proposed to be atropine-resistant and dominated during walking in rats. Other than serving a conventional role in limiting excitation, rhythmic proximal inhibition and distal dendritic excitation provide varying phasic modulation along the soma-dendritic axis of pyramidal cells, resulting in theta phase-dependent synaptic plasticity and gamma oscillations, which are likely involved in cognitive processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23665?af=R">Pursuing Synaptic Plasticity From Cortex to LTP in the Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Here I describe how an interest in synaptic plasticity took me from a PhD at McGill, where I worked on activity-dependent plasticity in the responses of single units in the association cortex of anesthetized cats, to a collaboration with Terje Lømo in Per Andersen's laboratory in Oslo in 1968–9. There we followed up on Lømo's discovery of LTP, published as an abstract in 1966, to produce the first detailed description of the phenomenon. Later, in London, Tony Gardner-Medwin and I showed that LTP lasting for days could be obtained in the awake rabbit. The two papers were published together in the <i>Journal of Physiology</i> in 1973. I relate how difficulties in replicating our results in English rabbits, and the failure of the first attempts to obtain LTP in slices of the dentate gyrus, led to my abandoning work on LTP for a few years, returning to the fray in the late 1970s through a collaboration with Graham Goddard at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada.</p>

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Swelling, stiffness, and pain in synovial joints are primary hallmarks of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Hyperactivity of nociceptors and excessive release of inflammatory factors and pain mediators play a crucial role, with emerging data suggesting extensive remodelling and plasticity of joint innervations. Herein, we review structural, functional, and molecular alterations in sensory and autonomic axons wiring arthritic joints and revisit mechanisms implicated in the sensitization of nociceptors, leading to chronic pain. Sprouting and reorganization of sensory and autonomic fibers with the invasion of ectopic branches into surrounding inflamed tissues are associated with the upregulation of pain markers. These changes are frequently complemented by a phenotypic switch of sensory and autonomic profiles and activation of silent axons, inferring homeostatic adjustments and reprogramming of innervations. Identifying critical molecular players and neurobiological mechanisms underpinning the rewiring and sensitization of joints is likely to elucidate causatives of neuroinflammation and chronic pain, assisting in finding new therapeutic targets and opportunities for interventions.

HsTMC1/2 are activated by mechanical stimuli and function as pore-forming ion channels, supporting their roles as mechanotransduction channels in hair cells.

                Early host defense eliminates many viruses before infections are established while clearing others so they remain subclinical or cause only mild disease. Paludan et al. put forward a criteria-based working hypothesis proposing “microbe- and inflammation-restricting mechanisms” as central mediators of the early cellular host defense against virus infections.

                Zhang et al. reveal that TBK1 is succinylated at K38, K154, and K692, inhibiting the activation of NF-κB and IRF signaling pathways in macrophages during sepsis. This process is regulated by the desuccinylase SIRT5, highlighting a potential strategy for negatively regulating macrophage-related inflammatory responses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98584">Caspar specifies primordial germ cell count and identity in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Repurposing of pleiotropic factors during execution of diverse cellular processes has emerged as a regulatory paradigm. Embryonic development in metazoans is controlled by maternal factors deposited in the egg during oogenesis. Here, we explore maternal role(s) of Caspar (Casp), the <i>Drosophila</i> orthologue of human Fas-associated factor-1 (FAF1) originally implicated in host-defense as a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling. Maternal loss of either Casp or it’s protein partner, transitional endoplasmic reticulum 94 (TER94) leads to partial embryonic lethality correlated with aberrant centrosome behavior, cytoskeletal abnormalities, and defective gastrulation. Although ubiquitously distributed, both proteins are enriched in the primordial germ cells (PGCs), and in keeping with the centrosome problems, mutant embryos display a significant reduction in the PGC count. Moreover, the total number of pole buds is directly proportional to the level of Casp. Consistently, it’s ‘loss’ and ‘gain’ results in respective reduction and increase in the Oskar protein levels, the master determinant of PGC fate. To elucidate this regulatory loop, we analyzed several known components of mid-blastula transition and identify the translational repressor Smaug, a zygotic regulator of germ cell specification, as a potential critical target. We present a detailed structure-function analysis of Casp aimed at understanding its novel involvement during PGC development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90296">Projection neurons are necessary for the maintenance of the mouse olfactory circuit</a></h4>

              
                The assembly and maintenance of neural circuits is crucial for proper brain function. Although the assembly of brain circuits has been extensively studied, much less is understood about the mechanisms controlling their maintenance as animals mature. In the olfactory system, the axons of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) expressing the same odor receptor converge into discrete synaptic structures of the olfactory bulb (OB) called glomeruli, forming a stereotypic odor map. The OB projection neurons, called mitral and tufted cells (M/Ts), have a single dendrite that branches into a single glomerulus, where they make synapses with OSNs. We used a genetic method to progressively eliminate the vast majority of M/T cells in early postnatal mice, and observed that the assembly of the OB bulb circuits proceeded normally. However, as the animals became adults the apical dendrite of remaining M/Ts grew multiple branches that innervated several glomeruli, and OSNs expressing single odor receptors projected their axons into multiple glomeruli, disrupting the olfactory sensory map. Moreover, ablating the M/Ts in adult animals also resulted in similar structural changes in the projections of remaining M/Ts and axons from OSNs. Interestingly, the ability of these mice to detect odors was relatively preserved despite only having 1–5% of projection neurons transmitting odorant information to the brain, and having highly disrupted circuits in the OB. These results indicate that a reduced number of projection neurons does not affect the normal assembly of the olfactory circuit, but induces structural instability of the olfactory circuitry of adult animals.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93764">Cell-autonomous timing drives the vertebrate segmentation clock’s wave pattern</a></h4>

              
                Rhythmic and sequential segmentation of the growing vertebrate body relies on the segmentation clock, a multi-cellular oscillating genetic network. The clock is visible as tissue-level kinematic waves of gene expression that travel through the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and arrest at the position of each forming segment. Here, we test how this hallmark wave pattern is driven by culturing single maturing PSM cells. We compare their cell-autonomous oscillatory and arrest dynamics to those we observe in the embryo at cellular resolution, finding similarity in the relative slowing of oscillations and arrest in concert with differentiation. This shows that cell-extrinsic signals are not required by the cells to instruct the developmental program underlying the wave pattern. We show that a cell-autonomous timing activity initiates during cell exit from the tailbud, then runs down in the anterior-ward cell flow in the PSM, thereby using elapsed time to provide positional information to the clock. Exogenous FGF lengthens the duration of the cell-intrinsic timer, indicating extrinsic factors in the embryo may regulate the segmentation clock via the timer. In sum, our work suggests that a noisy cell-autonomous, intrinsic timer drives the slowing and arrest of oscillations underlying the wave pattern, while extrinsic factors in the embryo tune this timer’s duration and precision. This is a new insight into the balance of cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms driving tissue patterning in development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96691">Estradiol elicits distinct firing patterns in arcuate nucleus kisspeptin neurons of females through altering ion channel conductances</a></h4>

              
                Hypothalamic kisspeptin (Kiss1) neurons are vital for pubertal development and reproduction. Arcuate nucleus Kiss1 (Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>) neurons are responsible for the pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). In females, the behavior of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, expressing Kiss1, neurokinin B (NKB), and dynorphin (Dyn), varies throughout the ovarian cycle. Studies indicate that 17β-estradiol (E2) reduces peptide expression but increases <i>Slc17a6</i> (<i>Vglut2</i>) mRNA and glutamate neurotransmission in these neurons, suggesting a shift from peptidergic to glutamatergic signaling. To investigate this shift, we combined transcriptomics, electrophysiology, and mathematical modeling. Our results demonstrate that E2 treatment upregulates the mRNA expression of voltage-activated calcium channels, elevating the whole-cell calcium current that contributes to high-frequency burst firing. Additionally, E2 treatment decreased the mRNA levels of canonical transient receptor potential (TPRC) 5 and G protein-coupled K<sup>+</sup> (GIRK) channels. When <i>Trpc5</i> channels in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons were deleted using CRISPR/SaCas9, the slow excitatory postsynaptic potential was eliminated. Our data enabled us to formulate a biophysically realistic mathematical model of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, suggesting that E2 modifies ionic conductances in these neurons, enabling the transition from high-frequency synchronous firing through NKB-driven activation of TRPC5 channels to a short bursting mode facilitating glutamate release. In a low E2 milieu, synchronous firing of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons drives pulsatile release of GnRH, while the transition to burst firing with high, preovulatory levels of E2 would facilitate the GnRH surge through its glutamatergic synaptic connection to preoptic Kiss1 neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93168">Ciliary length regulation by intraflagellar transport in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                How cells regulate the size of their organelles remains a fundamental question in cell biology. Cilia, with their simple structure and surface localization, provide an ideal model for investigating organelle size control. However, most studies on cilia length regulation are primarily performed on several single-celled organisms. In contrast, the mechanism of length regulation in cilia across diverse cell types within multicellular organisms remains a mystery. Similar to humans, zebrafish contain diverse types of cilia with variable lengths. Taking advantage of the transparency of zebrafish embryos, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into intraflagellar transport (IFT), an essential process for ciliogenesis. By generating a transgenic line carrying Ift88-GFP transgene, we observed IFT in multiple types of cilia with varying lengths. Remarkably, cilia exhibited variable IFT speeds in different cell types, with longer cilia exhibiting faster IFT speeds. This increased IFT speed in longer cilia is likely not due to changes in common factors that regulate IFT, such as motor selection, BBSome proteins, or tubulin modification. Interestingly, longer cilia in the ear cristae tend to form larger IFT compared to shorter spinal cord cilia. Reducing the size of IFT particles by knocking down Ift88 slowed IFT speed and resulted in the formation of shorter cilia. Our study proposes an intriguing model of cilia length regulation via controlling IFT speed through the modulation of the size of the IFT complex. This discovery may provide further insights into our understanding of how organelle size is regulated in higher vertebrates.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98081">A human forebrain organoid model reveals the essential function of GTF2IRD1-TTR-ERK axis for the neurodevelopmental deficits of Williams syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Williams syndrome (WS; OMIM#194050) is a rare disorder, which is caused by the microdeletion of one copy of 25–27 genes, and WS patients display diverse neuronal deficits. Although remarkable progresses have been achieved, the mechanisms for these distinct deficits are still largely unknown. Here, we have shown that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in WS forebrain organoids display abnormal proliferation and differentiation capabilities, and synapse formation. Genes with altered expression are related to neuronal development and neurogenesis. Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis revealed 13 clusters in healthy control and WS organoids. WS organoids show an aberrant generation of excitatory neurons. Mechanistically, the expression of transthyretin (TTR) are remarkably decreased in WS forebrain organoids. We have found that GTF2IRD1 encoded by one WS associated gene <i>GTF2IRD1</i> binds to <i>TTR</i> promoter regions and regulates the expression of <i>TTR</i>. In addition, exogenous TTR can activate ERK signaling and rescue neurogenic deficits of WS forebrain organoids. <i>Gtf2ird1</i>-deficient mice display similar neurodevelopmental deficits as observed in WS organoids. Collectively, our study reveals critical function of GTF2IRD1 in regulating neurodevelopment of WS forebrain organoids and mice through regulating TTR-ERK pathway.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96821">Amoeboid cells undergo durotaxis with soft end polarized NMIIA</a></h4>

              
                Cell migration towards stiff substrates has been coined as durotaxis and implicated in development, wound healing, and cancer, where complex interplays between immune and non-immune cells are present. Compared to the emerging mechanisms underlying the strongly adhesive mesenchymal durotaxis, little is known about whether immune cells - migrating in amoeboid mode - could follow mechanical cues. Here, we develop an imaging-based confined migration device with a stiffness gradient. By tracking live cell trajectory and analyzing the directionality of T cells and neutrophils, we observe that amoeboid cells can durotax. We further delineate the underlying mechanism to involve non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) polarization towards the soft-matrix-side but may not require differential actin flow up- or down-stiffness gradient. Using the protista <i>Dictyostelium</i>, we demonstrate the evolutionary conservation of amoeboid durotaxis. Finally, these experimental phenomena are theoretically captured by an active gel model capable of mechanosensing. Collectively, these results may shed new lights on immune surveillance and recently identified confined migration of cancer cells, within the mechanically inhomogeneous tumor microenvironment or the inflamed fibrotic tissues.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/86978">Key epigenetic and signaling factors in the formation and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier</a></h4>

              
                The blood-brain barrier (BBB) controls the movement of molecules into and out of the central nervous system (CNS). Since a functional BBB forms by mouse embryonic day E15.5, we reasoned that gene cohorts expressed in CNS endothelial cells (EC) at E13.5 contribute to BBB formation. In contrast, adult gene signatures reflect BBB maintenance mechanisms. Supporting this hypothesis, transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct cohorts of EC genes involved in BBB formation and maintenance. Here, we demonstrate that epigenetic regulator’s histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) control EC gene expression for BBB development and prevent Wnt/β-catenin (Wnt) target genes from being expressed in adult CNS ECs. Low Wnt activity during development modifies BBB genes epigenetically for the formation of functional BBB. As a Class-I HDAC inhibitor induces adult CNS ECs to regain Wnt activity and BBB genetic signatures that support BBB formation, our results inform strategies to promote BBB repair.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93518">Fluid mechanics of luminal transport in actively contracting endoplasmic reticulum</a></h4>

              
                The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the largest cellular compartment, harbours the machinery for the biogenesis of secretory proteins and lipids, calcium storage/mobilisation, and detoxification. It is shaped as layered membranous sheets interconnected with a network of tubules extending throughout the cell. Understanding the influence of the ER morphology dynamics on molecular transport may offer clues to rationalising neuro-pathologies caused by ER morphogen mutations. It remains unclear, however, how the ER facilitates its intra-luminal mobility and homogenises its content. It has been recently proposed that intra-luminal transport may be enabled by active contractions of ER tubules. To surmount the barriers to empirical studies of the minuscule spatial and temporal scales relevant to ER nanofluidics, here we exploit the principles of viscous fluid dynamics to generate a theoretical physical model emulating in silico the content motion in actively contracting nanoscopic tubular networks. The computational model reveals the luminal particle speeds, and their impact in facilitating active transport, of the active contractile behaviour of the different ER components along various time–space parameters. The results of the model indicate that reproducing transport with velocities similar to those reported experimentally in single-particle tracking would require unrealistically high values of tubule contraction site length and rate. Considering further nanofluidic scenarios, we show that width contractions of the ER’s flat domains (perinuclear sheets) generate local flows with only a short-range effect on luminal transport. Only contractions of peripheral sheets can reproduce experimental measurements, provided they are able to contract fast enough.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98016">CCDC113 stabilizes sperm axoneme and head-tail coupling apparatus to ensure male fertility</a></h4>

              
                The structural integrity of the sperm is crucial for male fertility, defects in sperm head-tail linkage and flagellar axoneme are associated with acephalic spermatozoa syndrome (ASS) and the multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF). Notably, impaired head-tail coupling apparatus (HTCA) often accompanies defects in the flagellum structure, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain elusive. Here, we identified an evolutionarily conserved coiled-coil domain-containing (CCDC) protein, CCDC113, and found the disruption of CCDC113 produced spermatozoa with disorganized sperm flagella and HTCA, which caused male infertility. Further analysis revealed that CCDC113 could bind to CFAP57 and CFAP91, and function as an adaptor protein for the connection of radial spokes, nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), and doublet microtubules (DMTs) in the sperm axoneme. Moreover, CCDC113 was identified as a structural component of HTCA, collaborating with SUN5 and CENTLEIN to connect sperm head to tail during spermiogenesis. Together, our studies reveal that CCDC113 serve as a critical hub for sperm axoneme and HTCA stabilization in mice, providing insights into the potential pathogenesis of infertility associated with human <i>CCDC113</i> mutations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98250">Single-cell transcriptomics of vomeronasal neuroepithelium reveals a differential endoplasmic reticulum environment amongst neuronal subtypes</a></h4>

              
                Specialized chemosensory signals elicit innate social behaviors in individuals of several vertebrate species, a process that is mediated via the accessory olfactory system (AOS). The AOS comprising the peripheral sensory vomeronasal organ has evolved elaborate molecular and cellular mechanisms to detect chemo signals. To gain insight into the cell types, developmental gene expression patterns, and functional differences amongst neurons, we performed single-cell transcriptomics of the mouse vomeronasal sensory epithelium. Our analysis reveals diverse cell types with gene expression patterns specific to each, which we made available as a searchable web resource accessed from <a href="https://www.scvnoexplorer.com">https://www.scvnoexplorer.com</a>. Pseudo-time developmental analysis indicates that neurons originating from common progenitors diverge in their gene expression during maturation with transient and persistent transcription factor expression at critical branch points. Comparative analysis across two of the major neuronal subtypes that express divergent GPCR families and the G-protein subunits Gnai2 or Gnao1, reveals significantly higher expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associated genes within Gnao1 neurons. In addition<b>,</b> differences in ER content and prevalence of cubic membrane ER ultrastructure revealed by electron microscopy, indicate fundamental differences in ER function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101269">Human birth tissue products as a non-opioid medicine to inhibit post-surgical pain</a></h4>

              
                Pain after surgery causes significant suffering. Opioid analgesics cause severe side effects and accidental death. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop non-opioid therapies for managing post-surgical pain. Local application of Clarix Flo (FLO), a human amniotic membrane (AM) product, attenuated established post-surgical pain hypersensitivity without exhibiting known side effects of opioid use in mice. This effect was achieved through direct inhibition of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons via CD44-dependent pathways. We further purified the major matrix component, the heavy chain-hyaluronic acid/pentraxin 3 (HC-HA/PTX3) from human AM that has greater purity and water solubility than FLO. HC-HA/PTX3 replicated FLO-induced neuronal and pain inhibition. Mechanistically, HC-HA/PTX3-induced cytoskeleton rearrangements to inhibit sodium current and high-voltage activated calcium current on nociceptive DRG neurons, suggesting it is a key bioactive component mediating pain relief. Collectively, our findings highlight the potential of naturally derived biologics from human birth tissues as an effective non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain. Moreover, we unravel the underlying neuronal mechanisms of pain inhibition induced by FLO and HC-HA/PTX3.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90419">Genetic inactivation of zinc transporter SLC39A5 improves liver function and hyperglycemia in obesogenic settings</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have revealed a role for zinc in insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. Randomized placebo-controlled zinc supplementation trials have demonstrated improved glycemic traits in patients with type II diabetes (T2D). Moreover, rare loss-of-function variants in the zinc efflux transporter <i>SLC30A8</i> reduce T2D risk. Despite this accumulated evidence, a mechanistic understanding of how zinc influences systemic glucose homeostasis and consequently T2D risk remains unclear. To further explore the relationship between zinc and metabolic traits, we searched the exome database of the Regeneron Genetics Center-Geisinger Health System DiscovEHR cohort for genes that regulate zinc levels and associate with changes in metabolic traits. We then explored our main finding using in vitro and in vivo models. We identified rare loss-of-function (LOF) variants (MAF &lt;1%) in <i>Solute Carrier Family 39, Member 5</i> (<i>SLC39A5</i>) associated with increased circulating zinc (p=4.9 × 10<sup>-4</sup>). Trans-ancestry meta-analysis across four studies exhibited a nominal association of <i>SLC39A5</i> LOF variants with decreased T2D risk. To explore the mechanisms underlying these associations, we generated mice lacking <i>Slc39a5. Slc39a5<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice display improved liver function and reduced hyperglycemia when challenged with congenital or diet-induced obesity. These improvements result from elevated hepatic zinc levels and concomitant activation of hepatic AMPK and AKT signaling, in part due to zinc-mediated inhibition of hepatic protein phosphatase activity. Furthermore, under conditions of diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), <i>Slc39a5<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice display significantly attenuated fibrosis and inflammation. Taken together, these results suggest SLC39A5 as a potential therapeutic target for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) due to metabolic derangements including T2D.

	<p>The current standard of care for brain tumor management includes maximal safe surgical resection followed by concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Recent advances in image-guided surgical techniques have enhanced the precision of tumor resections, yet there remains a critical need for innovative technologies to further improve patient outcomes. Techniques such as fluorescence image-guided neurosurgery in combination with stereotactic radiosurgery have improved outcomes for patients with brain tumors. In this article for Brain Science&amp;amp;rsquo;s Special Issue Recent Advances in Translational Neuro-Oncology, we review the use of image-guided neurosurgery and stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of brain tumors. In addition, we summarize the emerging use of theranostic nanoparticles for the delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic technologies to enable the neurosurgeon to perform more precise surgical resections in the operating room, to specifically target the delivery of existing and novel treatments to tumor cells, and to augment the efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery. These innovative translational tools will allow neurosurgeons, neuro-oncologists, and radiation oncologists to go &amp;amp;ldquo;beyond the knife&amp;amp;rdquo; to improve the survival of brain tumor patients.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: A multimodal brain age estimation model could provide enhanced insights into brain aging. However, effectively integrating multimodal neuroimaging data to enhance the accuracy of brain age estimation remains a challenging task. Methods: In this study, we developed an innovative data fusion technique employing a low-rank tensor fusion algorithm, tailored specifically for deep learning-based frameworks aimed at brain age estimation. Specifically, we utilized structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to extract spatial&amp;amp;ndash;temporal brain features with different properties. These features were fused using the low-rank tensor algorithm and employed as predictors for estimating brain age. Results: Our prediction model achieved a desirable prediction accuracy on the independent test samples, demonstrating its robust performance. Conclusions: The results of our study suggest that the low-rank tensor fusion algorithm has the potential to effectively integrate multimodal data into deep learning frameworks for estimating brain age.</p>
