     alt="Innovative treatments for epilepsy: Venom peptides, cannabinoids, and neurostimulation"/>
<p>This article reviews the most innovative treatments for epilepsy, given the great percentage of drug resistant patients. The topics addressed include neuromodulation, peptides derived from animal venoms, cannabinoids and nanoparticles.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Antiepileptic drugs have been successfully treating epilepsy and providing individuals sustained seizure freedom. However, about 30% of the patients with epilepsy present drug resistance, which means they are not responsive to the pharmacological treatment. Considering this, it becomes extremely relevant to pursue alternative therapeutic approaches, in order to provide appropriate treatment for those patients and also improve their quality of life. In the light of that, this review aims to discuss some innovative options for the treatment of epilepsy, which are currently under investigation, addressing strategies that go from therapeutic compounds to clinical procedures. For instance, peptides derived from animal venoms, such as wasps, spiders, and scorpions, demonstrate to be promising antiepileptic molecules, acting on a variety of targets. Other options are cannabinoids and compounds that modulate the endocannabinoid system, since it is now known that this network is involved in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Furthermore, neurostimulation is another strategy, being an alternative clinical procedure for drug-resistant patients who are not eligible for palliative surgeries.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: ADHD is recognized as one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders. The worldwide prevalence of ADHD is estimated at 5.3%; however, estimates vary as a function of a number of factors, including diagnostic methods, age, sex and geographical location. A review of studies is needed to clarify the epidemiology of ADHD in Canada. (2) Methods: A search strategy was created in PubMed and adapted for MEDLINE and PsycINFO. Papers were included if they examined diagnosed ADHD prevalence and/or incidence rates in any region of Canada, age group and gender. A snowball technique was used to identify additional papers from reference lists, and experts in the field were consulted. (3) Results: Ten papers included in this review reported on prevalence, and one reported on incidence. One study provided an overall prevalence estimate across provinces for adults of 2.9%, and one study provided an overall estimate across five provinces for children and youth of 8.6%. Across age groups (1 to 24 years), incidence estimates ranged from 0.4% to 1.2%, depending on province. Estimates varied by age, gender, province, region and time. (4) Conclusions: The overall Canadian ADHD prevalence estimate is similar to worldwide estimates for adults. Most studies reported on prevalence rather than incidence. Differences in estimates across provinces may reflect the varying number of practitioners available to diagnose and prescribe medication for ADHD across provinces. To achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the epidemiology of ADHD in Canada, a study is needed that includes all provinces and territories, and that considers estimates in relation to age, gender, ethnicity, geographical region, socioeconomic status and access to mental healthcare coverage. Incidence rates need further examination to be determined.</p>

	<p>Toxoplasmosis is one of the most common opportunistic infections, mainly reported in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have also been linked to reactivation of toxoplasmosis due to immunosuppressive treatment, although biologic drugs have seldom been implicated. We present a case of cerebral toxoplasmosis in a 62-year-old female patient with RA after initiation of biologic therapy (adalimumab). The patient had detectable serum IgG antibodies to toxoplasma gondii, was also on chronic treatment with other non-biologic drugs and presented with worsening disorientation, unsteady gait and left hemiparesis. Imaging studies showed a space-occupying lesion in the right basal ganglia with ring-enhancement. Brain biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis and the patient was treated with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for 6 weeks, showing complete recovery on follow-up. A review of the literature yielded other four case reports of cerebral toxoplasmosis implying biologic drugs; however, data concerning toxoplasmosis serologic testing, prophylaxis and treatment in these patients are lacking. Each case must be carefully evaluated prior to treatment and a high-index of suspicion in seropositive patients is warranted. Since the use of biologic drugs is increasing, further research is needed to establish practical guidelines for seropositive patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment.</p>

	<p>Previous studies have found a link between tinnitus and cognitive impairment, even leading to dementia. However, the mechanisms underlying this association are not clear. The purpose of this study was to explore intrinsic network changes in tinnitus and hearing loss patients with cognitive disorders. We included 17 individuals with bilateral idiopathic tinnitus, hearing loss, and cognitive impairment (PA) and 21 healthy controls. We identified resting-state networks (RSNs) and measured intra-network functional connectivity (FC) values via independent component analysis (ICA). We also evaluated correlations between RSNs and clinical characteristics. Compared with the healthy controls, the PA group showed decreased connectivity within the ventral attention network, dorsal attention network (DAN), visual network, left frontoparietal network, right frontoparietal network, sensorimotor network, and increased connectivity within the executive control network. MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) scores were negatively correlated with the FC values for left calcarine within the DAN. We identified abnormal intrinsic connectivity in several brain networks, mainly involving cognitive control, vision, sensorimotor function, and the cerebellum, in tinnitus patients with cognitive impairment. It may be possible to use the FC strength of the left calcarine within the DAN as an imaging marker to predict cognitive impairment in tinnitus patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Robin's Viewer: Using Deep-Learning Predictions to Assist EEG Annotation</a></h4>

              
                Deep learning has been successfully applied to EEG data for sleep staging, epileptic seizure detection, and artifact recognition. However, the performance of automated annotation is not yet sufficient to replace trained annotators in a clinical setting. Therefore, we propose a decision-support-system to help human annotators work faster and more effectively. As a first step towards addressing these challenges, we developed Robin's Viewer (RV) in Python, building on top of the plotting library Plotly and the popular M/EEG analysis toolbox MNE. The goal was to create a platform-independent, interactive web app, which is open-source and supports many common EEG-file formats to facilitate easy integration with a variety of EEG toolboxes. RV includes many common features of other EEG viewers, e.g., a view-slider, marking of bad channels and transient artifacts, and customizable preprocessing. The key feature distinguishing RV from existing EEG viewers is the possibility to visualize output predictions of deep-learning models that are trained to recognize patterns in EEG data. The result is a decision-support-system for scientists and clinicians who can use RV to annotate artifacts, sleep stages, abnormalities, and other classification tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pupil dynamics-derived sleep stage classification of a head-fixed mouse using a recurrent neural network</a></h4>

              
                The standard method for sleep state classification is thresholding amplitudes of electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG), followed by an expert's manual correction. Although popular, the method entails some shortcomings: 1) the time-consuming manual correction by human experts is sometimes a bottleneck hindering sleep studies; 2) EEG electrodes on the skull interfere with wide-field imaging of the cortical activity of a head-fixed mouse under a microscope; 3) invasive surgery to fix the electrodes on the thin skull of a mouse risks brain tissue injury; and 4) metal electrodes for EEG and EMG are difficult to apply to some experiment apparatus such as that for functional magnetic resonance imaging. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a pupil dynamics-based vigilance state classification for a head-fixed mouse using a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, a variant of recurrent neural networks, for multi-class labeling of NREM, REM, and WAKE states. For supervisory hypnography, EEG and EMG recording were performed for a head-fixed mouse, combined with left eye pupillometry using a USB camera and a markerless tracking toolbox, DeepLabCut. Our open-source LSTM model with feature inputs of pupil diameter, location, velocity, and eyelid opening for 10 s at a 10 Hz sampling rate achieved vigilance state estimation with a higher classification performance (macro F1 score, 0.77; accuracy, 86%) than a feed forward neural network. Findings from diverse pupillary dynamics implied subdivision of a vigilance state defined by EEG and EMG. Pupil dynamics-based hypnography can expand the scope of alternatives for sleep stage scoring of head fixed mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multiphoton holographic photostimulation induces potassium-dependent spike silencing in label-free mouse cortex in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Multiphoton microscopy allows measurement of network activity as well as the manipulation of cell type specific or functionally identified neuronal subpopulations with optogenetic holographic stimulation. When neurons co-express an activity reporter (e.g. calcium or voltage-sensitive indicators) and an (excitatory or inhibitory) opsin, such all optical interrogation approaches in vivo allows to draw causal links between function of cell-type specific microcircuits and behaviour. However, the net effects of near-infrared stimulation on network activity per se remain to be adequately investigated in vivo. Here we show that multi-cell holographic photostimulation with near-infrared radiation with total powers to sample used in current literature halves the spike rate of the non-illuminated neurons in label-free mouse cortex in vivo. The effect is not mediated by GABA release, but depends on NIR-dependent gating of potassium channels as it is absent when neurons are intracellularly perfused with the broad potassium channel blocker cesium ions, and are possibly mediated by heating. The phenomenon may contribute to set an upper limit to holographic photostimulation efficacy, calls for the need to control the effects of holographic stimulation protocols per se in label free preparations, and might be of relevance to interpret the therapeutical effects on infrared stimulation in psychiatry and neurology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">circAβ RNA drives the formation and deposition of β-amyloid plaques in the sporadic Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                {beta}-amyloid peptides (A{beta}) play key causal role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanisms of A{beta} biogenesis in sporadic AD are still largely unknown. Moreover, current AD mouse models which overexpress mutated human APP and presenilin proteins can only mimic limited characteristics of familial AD. We recently discovered an alternative A{beta} production pathway from A{beta}175, an A{beta} peptide containing polypeptide translated from circular circA{beta}-a RNA generated via backsplicing of the APP gene transcript. Here, wildtype human circA{beta}-a RNA was overexpressed in wildtype mouse frontal cortex. Results showed that circA{beta}-a overexpression drove intracellular A{beta} accumulation and extensive depositions of neuronal A{beta} plaques in mouse brain in vivo. This recapitulates the critical A{beta} hallmarks of sporadic AD and represents a sporadic AD mouse model. In summary, the causal relationship between circA{beta} RNA overexpression and AD pathology was demonstrated. This novel AD mouse model will accelerate disease-modifying drug development of this detrimental neurodegenerative disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Object representation in a gravitational reference frame</a></h4>

              
                When your head tilts laterally, as in sports, reaching, and resting, your eyes counterrotate less than 20%, and thus eye images rotate, over a total range of about 180deg. Yet, the world appears stable and vision remains normal. We discovered a neural strategy for rotational stability in anterior inferotemporal cortex (IT), the final stage of object vision in primates. We measured object orientation tuning of IT neurons in macaque monkeys tilted +25 and -25deg laterally, producing ~40deg difference in retinal image orientation. Among IT neurons with consistent object orientation tuning, 63% remained stable with respect to gravity across tilts. Gravitational tuning depended on vestibular/somatosensory but also visual cues, consistent with previous evidence that IT processes scene cues for gravity's orientation. In addition to stability across image rotations, an internal gravitational reference frame is important for physical understanding of a world where object position, posture, structure, shape, movement, and behavior interact critically with gravity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Different modality-specific mechanisms mediate perceptual history effects in vision and audition</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual history plays an important role in sensory processing and decision making, shaping how we perceive and judge external objects and events. Indeed, past stimuli can bias what we are currently seeing in an attractive fashion, making a current stimulus to appear more similar to its preceding one than it actually is. Such attractive effects across successive stimuli appear to be ubiquitous, affecting almost every aspect of perception, from very basic visual attributes (i.e., orientation) to more complex features (i.e., face identity), suggesting that they may reflect a fundamental principle of brain processing. However, it is unclear whether the ubiquitous nature of these effects is due to an underlying centralised mechanism mediating all of them, or by the existence of separate mechanisms implemented independently in different perceptual pathways. Here we address this question by assessing the behavioural and neural signature of perceptual history in audition and vision, in the context of time perception. Our results first show a double dissociation between the two modalities, whereby the behavioural effect of perceptual history shows opposite patterns of selectivity for the features and position of the stimuli. Electroencephalography results further support a difference between audition and vision, demonstrating that the signature of perceptual history unfolds according to different dynamics in the two modalities and show different relations with the behavioural effect. Overall, our results suggest that the effect of perceptual history may be mediated by different and at least partially independent mechanisms based on the same computational principle, implemented in different sensory pathways.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">No Free Lunch from Deep Learning in Neuroscience: A Case Study through Models of the Entorhinal-Hippocampal Circuit</a></h4>

              
                Research in Neuroscience, as in many scientific disciplines, is undergoing a renaissance based on deep learning. Unique to Neuroscience, deep learning models can be used not only as a tool but interpreted as models of the brain. The central claims of recent deep learning-based models of brain circuits are that they make novel predictions about neural phenomena or shed light on the fundamental functions being optimized. We show, through the case-study of grid cells in the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit, that one may get neither. We begin by reviewing the principles of grid cell mechanism and function obtained from first-principles modeling efforts, then rigorously examine the claims of deep learning models of grid cells. Using large-scale hyperparameter sweeps and theory-driven experimentation, we demonstrate that the results of such models may be more strongly driven by particular, non-fundamental, and post-hoc implementation choices than fundamental truths about neural circuits or the loss function(s) they might optimize. We discuss why these models cannot be expected to produce accurate models of the brain without the addition of substantial amounts of inductive bias, an informal No Free Lunch result for Neuroscience. Based on first principles work, we provide hypotheses for what additional loss functions will produce grid cells more robustly. In conclusion, caution and consideration, together with biological knowledge, are warranted in building and interpreting deep learning models in Neuroscience.

	<p>Background and Purpose: Recent population-based studies from the US and UK have identified an increase in the occurrence of Guillain&amp;amp;ndash;Barr&amp;amp;eacute; syndrome (GBS) following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. However, the localized variant of GBS might be underestimated due to its rarity and atypical features. We aimed to identify and characterize bilateral facial weakness with distal paresthesia (BFWdp) as a GBS variant following COVID-19 vaccination. Materials and Methods: Relevant studies published during the COVID-19 pandemic were searched and identified in the MEDLINE, Embase, and other databases. Results: This review found that 18 BFWdp cases presented characteristics similar to previous BFWdp cases as defined in the literature: male dominance, frequent albuminocytological dissociation, and acute inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy pattern. In contrast, facial nerve enhancement on brain MRI and antiganglioside antibody positivity were often observed in BFWdp following COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusions: The mechanism of BFWdp following COVID-19 vaccination appears to be somewhat different from that of sporadic BFWdp. Neurological syndromes with rare incidence and difficulty in diagnosis should be considered adverse events of COVID-19 vaccination.</p>

	<p>This study developed a predictive model for cognitive degeneration in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) using a machine learning method. The clinical data, plasma biomarkers, and neuropsychological test results of patients with PD were collected and utilized as model predictors. Machine learning methods comprising support vector machines (SVMs) and principal component analysis (PCA) were applied to obtain a cognitive classification model. Using 32 comprehensive predictive parameters, the PCA-SVM classifier reached 92.3% accuracy and 0.929 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Furthermore, the accuracy could be increased to 100% and the AUC to 1.0 in a PCA-SVM model using only 13 carefully chosen features.</p>

	<p>We investigated the clinical characteristics, neuroimaging findings, and final diagnosis of patients with acute isolated or prominent dysarthria who visited the emergency department (ED) between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2021. Of 2028 patients aged &amp;amp;ge; 18 years with neurologic symptoms treated by a neuro-emergency expert, 75 with acute isolated or predominant dysarthria within 1 week were enrolled. Patients were categorized as having isolated dysarthria (n = 28, 37.3%) and prominent dysarthria (n = 47, 62.7%). The causes of stroke were acute ischemic stroke (AIS) (n = 37, 49.3%), transient ischemic attack (TIA) (n = 14, 18.7%), intracerebral hemorrhage (n = 1, 1.3%), and non-stroke causes (n = 23, 30.7%). The most common additional symptoms were gait disturbance or imbalance (n = 8, 15.4%) and dizziness (n = 3, 13.0%) in the stroke and non-stroke groups, respectively. The isolated dysarthria group had a higher rate of TIA (n = 7, 38.9%), single and small lesions (n = 10, 83.3%), and small-vessel occlusion in Trial of Org 101072 in acute stroke treatment (n = 8, 66.7%). Acute isolated or prominent dysarthria in the ED mostly presented as clinical symptoms of AIS, but other non-stroke and medical causes were not uncommon. In acute dysarthria with ischemic stroke, multiple territorial and small and single lesions are considered a cause.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal SNAP-23 scales hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory</a></h4>

              
                Soluble NSF Attachment protein REceptor (SNARE)-mediated membrane fusion plays a crucial role not only in presynaptic vesicle exocytosis but also in postsynaptic receptor delivery. The latter is considered particularly important for long-term synaptic plasticity and learning and memory, yet underlying mechanisms including the identity of the key SNARE proteins remain elusive. Here, we investigate the role of neuronal Synaptosomal-Associated Protein-23 (SNAP-23) by analyzing pyramidal-neuron specific SNAP-23 conditional knockout (cKO) mice. SNAP-23 immunostaining in postsynaptic spines was effectively decreased in the SNAP-23 cKO hippocampus. Electrophysiological analysis of SNAP-23 deficient neurons using acute hippocampal slices showed normal basal neurotransmission in CA3-CA1 synapses with unchanged AMPA and NMDA currents. Nevertheless, we found theta-burst stimulation induced long-term potentiation (LTP) was vastly diminished in SNAP-23 cKO. Moreover, unlike syntaxin-4 cKO mice in which both basal neurotransmission and LTP decrease manifested changes in a broad set of behavioral tasks, deficits of SNAP-23 cKO is more limited to spatial memory. Our data reveal that neuronal SNAP-23 is selectively crucial for synaptic plasticity and spatial memory without affecting basal glutamate receptor function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Towards Detailed Cortical Maps of the Human Back with Representational Similarity Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cortical reorganization and its potential pathological significance is increasingly studied in chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients. Yet, detailed cortical maps of the healthy human back are lacking. To better understand cortical changes during the development and maintenance of CLBP, a detailed baseline characterization resulting from sensory thoracolumbar afferent input is needed. To this end, a novel pneumatic vibrotactile stimulation method was used to stimulate paraspinal sensory afferents while studying their cortical representations in unprecedented detail. Methods: In 30 young healthy participants, vibrotactile stimulations at 20Hz and 80Hz were applied bilaterally at nine locations along the thoracolumbar axis while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed. A whole-brain searchlight representational similarity analysis (RSA) in combination with different experimental models of paraspinal afferent input was used to investigate the representational organization of the respective neuronal activation patterns. Results: For 80Hz, the organizational structure of the neuronal activation patterns yielded the best fit for a model based on segmental distances between the stimulated paraspinal locations, located bilaterally in the primary (S1) and secondary somatosensory (S2) cortices. For 20Hz, this observation was restricted to the right S1. Conclusions: fMRI during paraspinal vibrotactile stimulation in combination with RSA is a powerful tool that can be used to establish highly detailed cortical maps of the human back. The current findings constitute a promising basis to further explore cortical reorganization and its potential pathological meaning in CLBP patients.

                Background: One characteristic of alcohol use disorder (AUD) is compulsive drinking, or drinking despite negative consequences. When quinine is used to model such aversion resistant drinking, female rodents typically are more resistant to punishment than males. Using an operant response task where C57BL/6J responded for ethanol (EtOH) mixed with quinine, we previously demonstrated that female mice tolerate higher concentrations of quinine in EtOH than males. Here, we aimed to determine if this female vulnerability to aversion resistant drinking behavior is similarly observed when footshock punishment is used. Methods: Male and female C57BL/6J mice were trained to respond for 10% EtOH in an operant task on a fixed ratio 3 schedule. After consistent responding, mice were tested in a punishment session using either a 0.25 mA or 0.35 mA footshock. To assess footshock sensitivity, a subset of mice underwent a flinch, jump, vocalize test in which behavioral responses to increasing amplitudes of footshock (0.05 to 0.95 mA) were assessed. In a separate cohort of mice, males and females were trained to respond for 2.5% sucrose and responses were punished using a 0.25 mA footshock. Results: Males and females continued to respond for 10% EtOH when paired with a 0.25 mA footshock. Females alone continued to respond for EtOH when a 0.35 mA footshock was delivered. Both males and females reduced responding for 2.5% sucrose when punished with a 0.25 mA footshock. Finally, footshock sensitivity in the flinch, jump, vocalize test did not differ by sex. Conclusions: Females continue to respond for 10% EtOH despite a 0.35 mA footshock and this behavior is not due to differences in footshock sensitivity between males and females. These results suggest that female C57BL/6J mice are generally more resistant to punishment in an operant self-administration paradigm. These results add to the literature characterizing aversion resistant alcohol drinking behaviors in females.

                Complete congenital stationary night blindness (cCSNB) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by poor dim light vision, myopia, and nystagmus, that is caused by mutations in genes critical for signal transmission between photoreceptors and depolarizing bipolar cells (DBCs). One such gene, LRIT3, is required for assembly of the post-synaptic signaling complex (signalplex) at the dendritic tips of DBCs, although the number of signalplex components impacted is greater in cone DBCs than in rod bipolar cells. This difference raises the possibility that LRIT3 is expressed both pre- and post-synaptically at cone terminals. Here we show that rAAV-mediated expression of LRIT3 in cones results in robust rescue of cone DBC signalplex components and restores downstream visual function, as measured by the light adapted ERG b-wave and electrophysiological recordings of BCs and RGCs. These data show that LRIT3 successfully restores function to cone DBCs in a trans-synaptic manner, potentially paving the way for therapeutic intervention in LRIT3-associated cCSNB.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Molecular underpinnings of programming by early-life stress and the protective effects of early dietary ω6/ω3 ratio, basally and in response to LPS: hippocampal mRNA-miRNAs integrated approach</a></h4>

              
                Early-life stress (ELS) exposure increases the risk for mental disorders, including cognitive impairments later in life. We have previously demonstrated that a dietary low {omega}6/{omega}3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ratio protects against ELS-induced cognitive impairments. Several studies have implicated the neuroimmune system in the ELS and diet mediated effects, but currently the molecular pathways via which ELS and early diet exert their long-term impact are not yet fully understood. Here we study the effects of ELS and dietary PUFA ratio on hippocampal mRNA and miRNA expression in adulthood, both under basal and inflammatory conditions. Male mice were exposed to chronic ELS by the limiting bedding and nesting material paradigm from postnatal day(P)2 to P9, and provided with a diet containing a high (15:1.1) or low (1.1:1) 6 linoleic acid to 3 alpha-linolenic acid ratio from P2 to P42. At P120, memory was assessed using the object location task. Subsequently, a single lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection was given and 24 hours later hippocampal genome-wide mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) expression was measured using microarray. An integrated miRNA-mRNA analysis revealed that ELS and early diet induced miRNA driven mRNA expression changes into adulthood. Under basal conditions both ELS and the diet affected molecular pathways related to hippocampal plasticity, with a low {omega}6/{omega}3 ratio diet specific activation of molecular pathways associated with improved hippocampal plasticity and learning and memory in mice previously exposed to ELS (e.g., CREB signaling and endocannabinoid neuronal synapse pathway). LPS induced miRNA and mRNA expression was strongly influenced by both ELS and early diet. In mice fed the high {omega}6/{omega}3 diet, LPS increased miRNA expression leading to activation of inflammatory pathways. In contrast, in mice fed the low {omega}6/{omega}3 diet, LPS reduced miRNA expression and altered target mRNA expression ultimately leading to limited activation of inflammatory signaling pathways and inhibition of pathways associated with hippocampal plasticity which was especially apparent in mice previously exposed to ELS. This data provides molecular insights into how the low {omega}6/{omega}3 diet during development could exert its long-lasting beneficial effects on hippocampal plasticity and learning and memory especially in a vulnerable population exposed to stress early in life, providing the basis for the development of intervention strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microglia and astrocytes differentially endocytose exosomes facilitating alpha-Synuclein endolysosomal sorting</a></h4>

              
                Exosomes have emerged as key players in cell-to-cell communication in both physiological and pathological processes in the Central Nervous System (CNS). Thus far, the intracellular pathways involved in uptake and trafficking of exosomes within different cell types of the brain (microglia and astrocytes) are poorly understood. In our study, the endocytic processes and subcellular sorting of exosomes were investigated in primary glial cells, particularly linked with the exosome-associated -synuclein (-syn) transmission. Mouse microglia and astrocytic primary cultures were incubated with DiI-stained mouse brain-derived exosomes. The internalization and trafficking pathways were analysed in cells treated with pharmacological reagents that block the major endocytic pathways. Brain-derived exosomes were internalized by both glial cell types; however, uptake was more efficient in microglia than in astrocytes. Colocalization of exosomes with early and late endocytic markers (Rab5, Lamp1) indicated that exosomes are sorted to endolysosomes for subsequent processing. Treatment with Cytochalasin D, that blocks actin-dependent phagocytosis and/or macropinocytosis, inhibited exosome entry into glial cells, whereas treatment with inhibitors that strip off cholesterol from the plasma membrane, induced uptake, however differentially altered endosomal sorting. Exosome-associated fibrillar -Syn was efficiently internalized and detected in Rab5- and Lamp1- positive compartments within microglia. Our study strongly suggests that exosomes enter glial cells through an actin network-dependent endocytic pathway and are sorted to endolysosomes for subsequent processing. Further, brain-derived exosomes are capable of mediating cell-to-glia transmission of pathological -Syn that is also targeted to the endosomal pathway, suggesting a possible beneficial role in microglia-mediated clearance of toxic protein aggregates, present in numerous neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamics and mechanisms of ERK activation after different protocols that induce long-term facilitation in Aplysia</a></h4>

              
                The mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) isoform extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) is a key kinase involved in the induction of long term synaptic facilitation (LTF) of the Aplysia sensorimotor synapse. Therefore, elucidating the dynamics of ERK activation after LTF-inducing protocols is critical for understanding the mechanisms underlying neuronal and synaptic plasticity. ERK activation has rich dynamic features. After a single stimulus, activation peaks 45-minute later and declines rapidly, but after two stimuli spaced 45 min apart, activation persists (Kopec et al. 2015). However, little is known about possible changes in ERK activation for periods beyond 3 h. Given its key role in long term learning, understanding the dynamics of ERK at 3 h and beyond might provide insights into new protocols that could enhance memory retention. Three different protocols that induce LTF were used to probe the dynamics of ERK activation. The first, termed the Standard protocol, consists of five 5-min pulses of serotonin (5-HT) with regular interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 20 min. The second, termed the Enhanced protocol, consists of five pulses of 5-HT with irregular ISIs identified with the use of computer simulations. This protocol induces greater and longer lasting LTF than the Standard protocol. A third protocol, termed the two-pulse protocol, consists of just two 5 min pulses of 5-HT with an ISI of 45 min. Immunofluorescence revealed complex patterns of ERK activation up to 24 h after 5HT treatment. The Standard and two-pulse protocols led to an immediate increase in active, phosphorylated ERK (pERK), which decayed within 5 h post treatment. A second wave of increased pERK was detected at 18 h post treatment. This late phase was blocked by RpcAMP (an inhibitor of protein kinase A), and by TrkB Fc and TGF {beta} RII F antagonists. The latter two are chimeras that act via receptor sequestration. These results suggest that complex interactions among kinase pathways and growth factor cascades contribute to the late increase of ERK activity after different LTF inducing protocols. Interestingly, ERK activity returned to basal levels 24 h after the Standard or two pulse protocol, but remained elevated 24 h after the Enhanced protocol. This finding may help explain, in part, why the Enhanced protocol is superior to the Standard protocol in inducing long lasting LTF.

                Value-based decision-making involves multiple cortical and subcortical brain areas, but the exact nature of neural activity underlying choice behavior has been difficult to parse out in the human brain. Here, we use intracranial recordings from neurosurgical patients to decode trial-by-trial choice, showing that information related to expressed choices is contained in high frequency bands (gamma, high frequency activity) and is distributed across multiple brain regions, suggesting that distributed processes underlie human decisions under uncertainty. Furthermore, our results show that reward-based choices can be robustly decoded on a trial-by-trial basis from anatomically distributed iEEG signals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Statistical Learning Emerges from Temporally Preparing What Action to Perform Where</a></h4>

              
                Statistical learning is the ability to exploit regularities of our world to predict what will happen when. Recently, we developed the Whac-A-Mole (WAM) paradigm to study whether participants can capitalize upon regularities embedded in complex temporal structures. Although participants were unaware of any regularity in WAM, we found better performance for targets with regular versus irregular intervals. Under the framework of statistical learning, this performance benefit can be understood to arise from distilling these regular intervals and predicting regular target onsets in a manner impossible for irregular targets. Intriguingly, here we instead found that this performance benefit emerges from preparation to a range of other temporal properties that we initially considered to be random. Participants temporally prepared, in parallel, for different actions to perform and locations to attend, without evidence that regular targets were responded to differently than irregular ones. With more time to prepare, participants gave faster and more accurate responses. Using a recent model of temporal preparation, fMTP, we illustrate that such complex temporal adaptation can arise from the memory processes underlying temporal preparation. In a broader sense, our results closely relate to theoretical work showing that statistical learning can emerge from general memory processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Acute IL-6 exposure triggers canonical IL-6R signalling in hiPSC microglia, but not neural progenitor cells.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Exposure to elevated interleukin (IL)-6 levels in utero is consistently associated with increased risk for psychiatric disorders with a putative neurodevelopmental origin, such as schizophrenia (SZ) and autism spectrum condition (ASC). Although rodent models provide causal evidence for this association, we lack a detailed understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms in human model systems. To close this gap, we characterised the response of hiPSC-derived microglia-like cells (MGL) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to IL-6 in monoculture. Results: We observed that human forebrain NPCs did not respond to acute IL-6 exposure in monoculture at both a protein and transcript level due to the absence of IL-6Ra expression and sIL-6Ra secretion. By contrast, acute IL-6 exposure resulted in STAT3 phosphorylation and increased IL-6, JMJD3 and IL-10 expression in MGL, confirming activation of canonical IL-6R signalling. Bulk RNAseq identified 156 upregulated genes (FDR <0.05) in MGL following acute IL-6 exposure, including IRF8, REL, HSPA1A/B and OXTR, which significantly overlapped with an upregulated gene set from post-mortem brain tissue from individuals with schizophrenia. Acute IL-6 stimulation significantly increased MGL motility suggestive of a gain of surveillance function, consistent with gene ontology pathways highlighted from the RNAseq data. Finally, MGLs displayed elevated CCL1, CXCL1, MIP-1A/B, IL-8, IL-13, IL-16, IL-18, MIF and Serpin-E1 secretion post 3h and 24h IL-6 exposure. Conclusion: Our data provide evidence for cell specific effects of acute IL-6 exposure in a human model system and strongly suggest microglia-NPC co-culture models are required to study how IL-6 influences human cortical neural progenitor cell development in vitro.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Persistent effects of acute trauma on Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer</a></h4>

              
                In humans, an acutely traumatic experience can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is often characterized by changes in anxiety and motivation months after trauma. There are few demonstrations of the persistent motivational effects of an acute stressor in rodent approaches to PTSD. In two experiments, we evaluated the persistent effects of a battery of footshocks in one context on appetitive Pavlovian conditioning, instrumental learning, and Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT) in a different context. A battery of footshocks before appetitive training caused deficits in single-outcome PIT in male Long Evans rats. The same battery of footshocks after appetitive training, but before testing had little effect on single-outcome PIT, but there were some qualitative deficits. Although males showed more generalized fear from the aversive to the appetitive context compared to females, there were no effects of shock on sensory-specific PIT in male or female rats. In general females showed less evidence for sensory-specific PIT compared to males, who showed robust sensory-specific PIT, with clear extinction and spontaneous recovery of the sensory-specific PIT effect across test sessions. These findings show that (a) an acute trauma can have persistent effects on general motivational processes and (b) sensory-specific PIT is a useful approach for exploring sex differences in strategies for instrumental learning. We discuss implications for current approaches to stress and motivation in preclinical and clinical studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Psychometric and subcortical neurometric measures of temporal discrimination in rhesus macaques</a></h4>

              
                Temporal envelope fluctuations are abundant in nature and are critical for perception of complex sounds. While psychophysical sinusoidal amplitude modulation (SAM) processing studies have characterized the perception of SAM, and neurophysiological studies report a subcortical transformation from temporal to rate-based code, no studies have characterized this transformation in unanesthetized animals or in nonhuman primates. To address this, we recorded single-unit responses and compared derived neurometric measures in the cochlear nucleus (CN) and inferior colliculus (IC) to psychometric measures of modulation frequency (MF) discrimination in macaques. IC and CN neurons often exhibited tuned responses to SAM in their rate and spike-timing. Neurometric thresholds spanned a large range (2-200 Hz {Delta} MF). The lowest 40% of IC thresholds were less than or equal to psychometric thresholds, regardless of which code was used, while CN thresholds were greater than psychometric thresholds. Discrimination at 10-20 Hz could be explained by indiscriminately pooling 30 units in either structure, while discrimination at higher MFs was best explained by more selective pooling. This suggests that pooled brainstem activity was sufficient for AM discrimination. Psychometric and neurometric thresholds decreased as a function of stimulus duration, but IC and CN thresholds were greater and more variable than behavior at durations less than 500 ms. This slower subcortical temporal integration compared to behavior was consistent with a drift diffusion model which reproduced individual differences in performance and can constrain future neurophysiological studies of temporal integration. These measures provide an account of AM perception at the neurophysiological, computational, and behavioral levels.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluation of an image-derived input function for kinetic modeling of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-binding PET ligands</a></h4>

              
                Development of positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers that bind with high-affinity to 4{beta}2-type nicotinic receptors (4{beta}2Rs) allows for in vivo investigations of the mechanisms underlying nicotine addiction and smoking cessation. One challenge associated with preclinical PET imaging involves the lack of true tissue reference regions free of specific tracer binding in the rodent brain, impeding accurate quantification of the tracer binding potential. Here, we investigate the use of an image-derived arterial input function for kinetic analysis of radiotracer binding in male and female mice. Two radiotracers were explored in this study: 2-[18F]FA85380 (2-FA), which displays similar pKa and binding affinity to the smoking cessation drug varenicline (Chantix), and [18F]Nifene, which displays similar pKa and binding affinity to nicotine. For both radiotracers, time-activity curves of the left ventricle of the heart displayed similar standardized uptake values (SUVs) across wild type mice, mice lacking the {beta}2 subunit for tracer binding, and acute nicotine-treated mice, whereas typical reference tissue SUVs displayed high variation between groups. Binding potential values estimated from a two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) fit of the data with the image-derived input function were significantly higher than estimates from reference tissue-based estimations. Rate constants of radiotracer dissociation were very slow for 2-FA and very fast for Nifene, similar to the in vitro dissociation rates reported for varenicline and nicotine, respectively. We conclude that use of an image-derived input function for kinetic modeling of nicotinic PET ligands improves quantification compared to reference tissue-based methods, and that the chemical properties of 2-FA and Nifene are suitable to study receptor response to nicotine addiction and smoking cessation therapies.

                The olfactory ecto-mesenchymal stem cell (OE-MSC) are mesenchymal stem cells originating from the lamina propria of the nasal mucosa. They have neurogenic and immune-modulatory properties and showed therapeutic potential in animal models of spinal cord trauma, hearing loss, Parkinsons disease, amnesia, and peripheral nerve injury. In this paper we designed a protocol that meet the requirements set by human health agencies to manufacture these stem cells for clinical applications. Once purified, OE-MSCs can be used per se or expanded in order to get the extracellular vesicles (EV) they secrete. A protocol for the extraction of these vesicles was validated and the EV from the OE-MSC were functionally tested on an in vitro model. Nasal mucosa biopsies from three donors were used to validate the manufacturing process of clinical grade OE-MSC. All stages were performed by expert staff of the cell therapy laboratory according to aseptic handling manipulations, requiring grade A laminar airflow. Enzymatic digestion provides more rapidly a high number of cells and is less likely to be contaminated. Foetal calf serum was replaced with human platelet lysate and allowed stronger cell proliferation, with the optimal percentage of platelet lysate being 10%. Cultivated OE-MSCs are sterile, highly proliferative (percentage of CFU-F progenitors was 15,5%) and their maintenance does not induce chromosomal rearrangement (karyotyping and chromosomal microarray analysis were normal). These cells express the usual phenotypic markers of OE-MSC. Purification of the EVs was performed with ultracentrifugation and size exclusion chromatography. Purified vesicles expressed the recognized markers of EVs (Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (MISEV) guidelines) and promoted cell differentiation and neurite elongation in a model of neuroblastoma Neuro2a cell line. We developed a safer and more efficient manufacturing process for clinical-grade olfactory stem cells, these cells can now be used in humans. A phase I clinical trial will begin soon. An efficient protocol for the purification of the OE-MSC EVs have been validated. These EVs exert neurogenic properties in vitro. More studies are needed to understand the exact mechanisms of action of these EVs and prove their efficacy and safety in animal models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tensorial Independent Component Analysis Reveals Social and Reward Networks Associated with Major Depressive Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been associated with changes in functional brain connectivity. Yet, typical analyses of functional connectivity, such as spatial ICA for resting-state data, often ignore sources of between-subject variability, which may be crucial for identifying functional connectivity patterns associated with MDD. Typically, methods like spatial ICA will identify a single component to represent a network like the default mode network (DMN), even if groups within the data show differential DMN coactivation. To address this gap, this project applies a tensorial extension of ICA (tensorial ICA) -- which explicitly incorporates between-subject variability -- to identify functionally connected networks using fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Data from the HCP included individuals with a diagnosis of MDD, a family history of MDD, and healthy controls performing a gambling and social cognition task. Based on evidence associating MDD with blunted neural activation to rewards and social stimuli, we predicted that tensorial ICA would identify networks associated with reduced spatio-temporal coherence and blunted social and reward-based network activity in MDD. Across both tasks, tensorial ICA identified three networks showing decreased coherence in MDD. All three networks included ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), striatum, and cerebellum and showed different activation across the conditions of their respective tasks. However, MDD was only associated with differences in task-based activation in one network from the social task. Additionally, these results suggest that tensorial ICA could be a valuable tool for understanding clinical differences in relation to network activation and connectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Naturalistic language comprehension is supported by alpha and beta oscillations linked to domain-general inhibition and reactivation</a></h4>

              
                Brain oscillations are prevalent in all species and are involved in numerous perceptual operations. Alpha oscillations are thought to facilitate processing through the inhibition of task-irrelevant networks, while beta oscillations are linked to the reactivation of content representations. Can the proposed functional role of alpha and beta oscillations be generalized from low-level operations to higher-level cognitive processes? Here we address this question focusing on naturalistic spoken language processing. Twenty-two (18 female) Dutch native speakers listened to stories in spoken Dutch and French while magnetoencephalography (MEG) was recorded. We used dependency parsing to identify three dependency states at each word, as the number of (1) newly opened dependencies, (2) dependencies that remained open, and (3) resolved dependencies. We then constructed linear forward models to predict alpha and beta power from the dependency features. Results showed that dependency features predict alpha and beta power in language-related regions beyond low-level linguistic features. Left temporal, fundamental language regions are involved in language comprehension in the alpha band, while frontal and parietal, higher-order language regions, and motor regions are mostly involved in the beta band. Critically, alpha and beta band dynamics seem to subserve language comprehension tapping into syntactic structure building and semantic composition by providing low-level mechanistic operations for inhibition and reactivation processes. Overall, this study sheds light on the role of alpha and beta oscillations during naturalistic language processing, providing evidence for the generalizability of these dynamics from perceptual to complex linguistic processes.

                Non-human primates have an important translational value given their close phylogenetic relationship to humans. Studies in these animals remain essential for evaluating efficacy and safety of new therapeutic approaches, particularly in aging primates that display Alzheimer disease (AD) -like pathology. With the objective to improve amyloid-{beta} targeting immunotherapy, we investigated the safety and efficacy of an active immunisation with an A{beta}derivative, K6A{beta}1-30-NH2, in old non-human primates. Thirty-two aged (4-10 year-old) mouse lemurs were enrolled in the study, and received up to four subcutaneous injections of the vaccine in alum adjuvant or adjuvant alone. Even though antibody titres to A{beta} were not high, pathological examination of the mouse lemur brains showed significant reduction in intracellular A{beta} without inflammatory or haemorrhagic changes. Moreover, a trend for cognitive improvement was observed in the vaccinated primates, which was probably linked to A{beta} clearance. This A{beta} derivative vaccine appeared to be safe as a prophylactic measure based on the brain analyses and because it did not appear to have detrimental effects on the general health of these old animals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Novel transient cell clusters provide a possible link between early neural activity and angiogenesis in the neonatal mouse retina</a></h4>

              
                Developing neurons become spontaneously active while growing blood vessels begin to irrigate their surroundings. However, surprising little is known about early interactions between neural activity and angiogenesis. In the neonatal mouse retina, spontaneous waves of impulses sweep across the ganglion cell layer (GCL), just underneath the growing superficial vascular plexus. We discovered clusters of transient auto-fluorescent cells in the GCL, forming an annulus that co-localizes with the frontline of the growing plexus. Blood vessel density is highest within cluster areas, suggesting their involvement in angiogenesis. Once the clusters and blood vessels reach the retinal periphery by the end of the first postnatal week, the clusters disappear, eliminated by microglial phagocytosis. Electrical imaging suggests that they have their own electrophysiological signature. Blocking Pannexin1 (PANX1) hemi-channels with probenecid blocks the waves and the fluorescent clusters disappear following prolonged exposure to the drug. Spontaneous waves initiation points follow a developmental center-to-periphery progression similar to the cluster cells. We suggest that these transient cells are specialized, hyperactive neurons residing in the GCL. They generate spontaneous activity hotspots, thereby triggering waves through purinergic paracrine signaling via PANX1 hemi-channels. The strong activity generated around these hotspots triggers angiogenesis, attracting new blood vessels that provide local oxygen supply. Signaling through PANX-1 attracts microglia that establish contact with these cells, eventually leading to their elimination by phagocytosis. These cluster cells may provide the first evidence that specialized transient neuronal populations guide angiogenesis in the developing CNS through neural activity.

	<p>Background: 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA; GleolanTM, NX Development Corps., Lexington, USA) is approved for fluorescence-guided resections of suspected malignant gliomas. Experience has demonstrated that meningiomas also show fluorescence, which may be a useful surgical adjunct. We present an innovative design for a multi-center, prospective study to determine the clinical safety and potential benefit of fluorescence-guided resection of meningiomas with utmost bias reduction. Methods: All patients with suspected meningioma (all grades) receive GleolanTM 20 mg/kg 2&amp;amp;ndash;4 h prior to surgery supported by fluorescence excitation from a blue light source (Blue400, Zeiss Meditech, Oberkochen, Germany; FL400, Leica Microsystems, Heerbrugg, Switzerland). Surgeons are asked whether a residual tumor can be observed to fluoresce under blue light (BL) after the tumor is no longer recognizable using conventional illumination at the end of surgery. In addition, when faced with tissues of uncertain tissue type (so-called &amp;amp;ldquo;indeterminate&amp;amp;rdquo; tissue), this study records how often surgeons make a correct decision based on fluorescence and how this influences surgical strategy. The primary endpoint is the percentage of patients in whom one of these two benefits are observed. Other endpoints include the diagnostic accuracy of fluorescence compared to white light (WL) versus correlative histology. For bias reduction, pertinent data are derived from surgical videos reviewed by independent reviewers blinded to surgeons&amp;amp;rsquo; assessments of tissue type and fluorescence status. Data will be included from approximately 100 study participants completing the study at approximately 15 centers in the United States, Germany, and Austria. Results: As of May 2022, 88 patients have completed the study. No adverse safety signal has been detected. Conclusions: Preliminary data confirm the feasibility of our study design. Accrual is targeted for completion in the third quarter of 2022.</p>

	<p>Background: Music stimulation is considered a valuable form of intervention in disorders of consciousness (DoC); for instance, verticalization may improve motor and cognitive recovery. Our purpose is to investigate the effects of a novel rehabilitative approach combining robotic verticalization training (RVT) with personalized music stimulation in people with DoC. Methods: Sixteen subjects affected by minimally conscious state due to traumatic brain lesions who attended our Intensive Neuro-Rehabilitation Unit were enrolled in this randomized trial. They received either music robotic verticalization (MRV) using the Erigo device plus a personalized music playlist or only RVT without music stimuli. Each treatment was performed 2 times a week for 8 consecutive weeks in addition to standard neurorehabilitation. Results: We found significant improvements in all patients&amp;amp;rsquo; outcomes in the experimental group (who received MRV): Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), Level of Cognitive Functioning (LCF) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.02), Functional Independence Measure (FIM)(p &amp;amp;lt; 0.03), Functional Communication Scale (FCS) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.007), Trunk Control Test (TCT) (p = 0.05). Significant differences between the two groups were also found in the main outcome measure CRS-R (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) but not for TCT and FIM. Conclusions: Our study supports the safety and effectiveness of RVT with the Erigo device in chronic MCS, and the achievement of better outcomes when RVT is combined with music stimulation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A general theory of multistable systems in pathophysiology [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Despite intensive investigations numerous diseases remain etiologically puzzling and recalcitrant to treatments. A theory is proposed here assuming that these difficulties are due to an unsuitable approach to the mechanisms of life, which is subjugated by an apparent complexity and fails to grasp the uniformity that lays behind. The stability of metabolism, despite the enormous complex of chemical reactions, suggests that reciprocal control is a prerequisite of life. Negative feedback loops have been known for a long time to maintain homeostasis, while more recently, different life processes involved in transitions or changes have been modeled by positive loops giving rise to bistable switches, also including various diseases. The present theory makes a generalization, by assuming that any functional element of a biological system is involved in a positive or a negative feedback loop. Consequently, the theory holds that the starting mechanism of any disease that affects a healthy human can be conceptually reduced to a bistable or multistationary loop system, thus providing a unifying model leading to the discovery of critical therapeutic targets.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Quantification of hypoxic regions distant from occlusions in cerebral penetrating arteriole trees</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yidan Xue, Theodosia Georgakopoulou, Anne-Eva van der Wijk, Tamás I. Józsa, Ed van Bavel, Stephen J. Payne</p>

The microvasculature plays a key role in oxygen transport in the mammalian brain. Despite the close coupling between cerebral vascular geometry and local oxygen demand, recent experiments have reported that microvascular occlusions can lead to unexpected distant tissue hypoxia and infarction. To better understand the spatial correlation between the hypoxic regions and the occlusion sites, we used both <i>in vivo</i> experiments and <i>in silico</i> simulations to investigate the effects of occlusions in cerebral penetrating arteriole trees on tissue hypoxia. In a rat model of microembolisation, 25 μm microspheres were injected through the carotid artery to occlude penetrating arterioles. In representative models of human cortical columns, the penetrating arterioles were occluded by simulating the transport of microspheres of the same size and the oxygen transport was simulated using a Green’s function method. The locations of microspheres and hypoxic regions were segmented, and two novel distance analyses were implemented to study their spatial correlation. The distant hypoxic regions were found to be present in both experiments and simulations, and mainly due to the hypoperfusion in the region downstream of the occlusion site. Furthermore, a reasonable agreement for the spatial correlation between hypoxic regions and occlusion sites is shown between experiments and simulations, which indicates the good applicability of <i>in silico</i> models in understanding the response of cerebral blood flow and oxygen transport to microemboli.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Signal neutrality, scalar property, and collapsing boundaries as consequences of a learned multi-timescale strategy</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Luca Manneschi, Guido Gigante, Eleni Vasilaki, Paolo Del Giudice</p>

We postulate that three fundamental elements underlie a decision making process: perception of time passing, information processing in multiple timescales and reward maximisation. We build a simple reinforcement learning agent upon these principles that we train on a random dot-like task. Our results, similar to the experimental data, demonstrate three emerging signatures. (1) signal neutrality: insensitivity to the signal coherence in the interval preceding the decision. (2) Scalar property: the mean of the response times varies widely for different signal coherences, yet the shape of the distributions stays almost unchanged. (3) Collapsing boundaries: the “effective” decision-making boundary changes over time in a manner reminiscent of the theoretical optimal. Removing the perception of time or the multiple timescales from the model does not preserve the distinguishing signatures. Our results suggest an alternative explanation for signal neutrality. We propose that it is not part of motor planning. It is part of the decision-making process and emerges from information processing on multiple timescales.

                Background: Acute renal transplant rejection is believed to be an immunological phenomenon and is one of the most serious consequences of transplantation as a treatment for end-stage renal illness. In recent decades, numerous research has been conducted to investigate the relationship between cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 +49A/G (CTLA-4 +49A/G) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the likelihood of rejection; nevertheless, the results are still controversial, and inconsistency has been documented among investigations. Consequently, the purpose of the present investigation was to conduct a study on the relation between CTLA-4 +49A/G polymorphism and risk of transplant rejection.  Methods: The study was reported based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Retrospective and prospective analytical randomized control trial (RCTs) published prints from Embase, PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of science were included to the study in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. The search was conducted on February 2nd, 2022, using the search term (cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-antigen-4 OR CTLA-4) AND (gene polymorphism OR single nucleotide polymorphisms OR allele OR alleles OR genotype OR genotypes) AND (renal OR kidney) AND (transplant OR transplantation) AND (acute rejection).  Results: The CTLA-4 G-allele/GG-genotype was more likely to be related to renal transplantation rejection risk. It was found with odds ratio (OR) in overall analysis of G vs. A-allele was 1.22 (95%CI 1.05-1.42; p-value=0.01) and the OR of GG vs. AG+AA-genotype was 1.47 (95%CI 1.14-1.89; p-value=0.003). However, the AA-genotype was not associated with renal transplantation rejection risk. The interesting finding in this study was the association of the SNPs and rejection of renal transplantation was especially found in Asian sub-analysis.  Conclusions: Consequently, the CTLA-4 G-allele/GG-genotype is related to the likelihood of rejection in patients underwent renal transplantation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparison of clinical characteristics and short-term outcomes among COVID-19 patients in a tertiary care center during second wave pandemic in Nepal: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged as a challenging pandemic globally. The clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory failure. In-hospital mortality varies from 18.9% to 20.3%. Old age, male gender, co-morbidities, lower oxygen saturation, lymphopenia, raised C-reactive protein, and d-dimer levels increase the risk of critical illness and death. The objective of this study was to compare the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients and associated outcomes in a tertiary level hospital in Nepal. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary center of Nepal during the peak of the second wave of the pandemic. A non-probabilistic consecutive sampling technique was adopted. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM-SPSS), version-23. Mortality (yes/no) was the primary outcome of interest, and accordingly, the cases were divided into two groups, survivors and non-survivors. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Results: The overall in-hospital mortality was 84 (19.58%), and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality was 36 (58.06%). The death rate was higher in cases presenting with shortness of breath and anorexia. Hypoxemic respiratory failure (16.08%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (8.62%) were the most common complications associated with higher mortality. Patients with older age had higher odds of mortality (adjusted OR, 1.077; p<0.001). The risk of mortality was higher in severe to critically ill patients (adjusted OR, 5.861; p=0.001), and those who were under mechanical ventilation (adjusted OR, 39.059; p<0.001). Likewise, the duration of hospital stay was significantly associated with mortality (adjusted OR, 0.795; p<0.001). Conclusions: The non-survivors of COVID-19 tended to be of older age, severe to critically ill at presentation, require mechanical ventilation, and have a shorter duration of hospital stay, compared to survivors. So, these groups of patients need special care and support during hospital admission.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is ultimately fatal. Currently, millions of Americans are living with AD, and this number is predicted to grow with increases in the aging population. Interestingly, despite the prevalence of AD in human populations, the full AD phenotype has not been observed in any nonhuman primate (NHP) species, and it has been suggested that NHPs are immune to neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.</p>
<p>Here, we review the typical age-related changes and pathologies in humans along with the neuropathologic changes associated with AD, and we place this information in the context of the comparative neuropathology of NHPs. We further propose the use of induced pluripotent stem cell technology as a way of addressing initial molecular processes and changes that occur in neurons and glia (in both humans and NHPs) when exposed to AD-inducing pathology prior to cell death.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">The structure of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels in rod and cone photoreceptors</a></h4>

              
                Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels play a central role in rod and cone photoreceptors of the vertebrate retina. In photoreceptors, light triggers a series of biochemical reactions that ultimately close CNG channels and evoke a brief voltage pulse, a signal that is later passed on to the brain. Malfunction of CNG channels can lead to loss of vision. Thus, understanding their function in atomic and mechanistic detail is important. Because of the complex subunit stoichiometry of these channels, elucidation of their structure has proved challenging.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A computational account of why more valuable goals seem to require more effortful actions</a></h4>

              
                To decide whether a course of action is worth pursuing, individuals typically weigh its expected costs and benefits. Optimal decision-making relies upon accurate effort cost anticipation, which is generally assumed to be performed independently from goal valuation. In two experiments (n = 46), we challenged this independence principle of standard decision theory. We presented participants with a series of treadmill routes randomly associated to monetary rewards and collected both ‘accept’ versus ‘decline’ decisions and subjective estimates of energetic cost. Behavioural results show that higher monetary prospects led participants to provide higher cost estimates, although reward was independent from effort in our design. Among candidate cognitive explanations, they support a model in which prospective cost assessment is biased by the output of an automatic computation adjusting effort expenditure to goal value. This decision bias might lead people to abandon the pursuit of valuable goals that are in fact not so costly to achieve.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Allosteric stabilization of calcium and phosphoinositide dual binding engages several synaptotagmins in fast exocytosis</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic communication relies on the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, which leads to neurotransmitter release. This exocytosis is triggered by brief and local elevations of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> with remarkably high sensitivity. How this is molecularly achieved is unknown. While synaptotagmins confer the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of neurotransmitter exocytosis, biochemical measurements reported Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinities too low to account for synaptic function. However, synaptotagmin's Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity increases upon binding the plasma membrane phospholipid PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and, vice versa, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding increases synaptotagmin's PI(4,5)P<sub>2 </sub>affinity, indicating a stabilization of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dual-bound syt. Here we devise a molecular exocytosis model based on this positive allosteric stabilization and the assumptions that (1.) synaptotagmin Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dual binding lowers the energy barrier for vesicle fusion and that (2.) the effect of multiple synaptotagmins on the energy barrier is additive. The model, which relies on biochemically measured Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PI(4,5)P<sub>2 </sub>affinities and protein copy numbers, reproduced the steep Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependency of neurotransmitter release. Our results indicate that each synaptotagmin dual binding Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> lowers the energy barrier for vesicle fusion by ~5 k<sub>B</sub>T and that allosteric stabilization of this state enables the synchronized engagement of several (typically three) synaptotagmins for fast exocytosis. Furthermore, we show that mutations altering synaptotagmin’s allosteric properties may show dominant-negative effects, even though synaptotagmins act independently on the energy barrier, and that dynamic changes of local PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (e.g. upon vesicle movement) dramatically impact synaptic responses. We conclude that allosterically stabilized Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dual binding enables synaptotagmins to exert their coordinated function in neurotransmission.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">trim-21 promotes proteasomal degradation of CED-1 for apoptotic cell clearance in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                The phagocytic receptor CED-1 mediates apoptotic cell recognition by phagocytic cells, enabling cell corpse clearance in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Whether appropriate levels of CED-1 are maintained for executing the engulfment function remains unknown. Here, we identified the <i>C. elegans</i> E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif containing-21 (TRIM-21) as a component of the CED-1 pathway for apoptotic cell clearance. When the NPXY motif of CED-1 was bound to the adaptor protein CED-6 or the YXXL motif of CED-1 was phosphorylated by tyrosine kinase SRC-1 and subsequently bound to the adaptor protein NCK-1 containing the SH2 domain, TRIM-21 functioned in conjunction with UBC-21 to catalyze K48-linked poly-ubiquitination on CED-1, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. In the absence of TRIM-21, CED-1 accumulated post-translationally and drove cell corpse degradation defects, as evidenced by direct binding to VHA-10. These findings reveal a unique mechanism for the maintenance of appropriate levels of CED-1 to regulate apoptotic cell clearance.

                Systematic analysis of rich behavioral recordings is being used to uncover how circuits encode complex behaviors. Here we apply this approach to embryos. What are the first embryonic behaviors and how do they evolve as early neurodevelopment ensues? To address these questions, we present a systematic description of behavioral maturation for Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. Posture libraries were built using a genetically encoded motion capture suit imaged with light-sheet microscopy and annotated using custom tracking software. Analysis of cell trajectories, postures, and behavioral motifs revealed a stereotyped developmental progression. Early movement is dominated by flipping between dorsal and ventral coiling, which gradually slows into a period of reduced motility. Late-stage embryos exhibit sinusoidal waves of dorsoventral bends, prolonged bouts of directed motion, and a rhythmic pattern of pausing, which we designate slow wave twitch (SWT). Synaptic transmission is required for late-stage motion but not for early flipping nor the intervening inactive phase. A high-throughput behavioral assay and calcium imaging revealed that SWT is elicited by the rhythmic activity of a quiescence-promoting neuron (RIS). Similar periodic quiescent states are seen prenatally in diverse animals and may play an important role in promoting normal developmental outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Septin7 is indispensable for proper skeletal muscle architecture and function</a></h4>

              
                Today septins are considered as the fourth component of the cytoskeleton, with the Septin7 isoform playing a critical role in the formation of higher-order structures. While its importance has already been confirmed in several intracellular processes of different organs, very little is known about its role in skeletal muscle. Here, using Septin7 conditional knockdown (KD) mouse model, the C2C12 cell line, and enzymatically isolated adult muscle fibers, the organization and localization of septin filaments are revealed, and an ontogenesis-dependent expression of Septin7 is demonstrated. KD mice displayed a characteristic hunchback phenotype with skeletal deformities, reduction in in vivo and in vitro force generation, and disorganized mitochondrial networks. Furthermore, knockout of Septin7 in C2C12 cells resulted in complete loss of cell division while KD cells provided evidence that Septin7 is essential for proper myotube differentiation. These and the transient increase in Septin7 expression following muscle injury suggest that it may be involved in muscle regeneration and development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An auto-inhibited state of protein kinase G and implications for selective activation</a></h4>

              
                Cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinases (PKGs) are key mediators of the nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway that regulates biological functions as diverse as smooth muscle contraction, cardiac function, and axon guidance. Understanding how cGMP differentially triggers mammalian PKG isoforms could lead to new therapeutics that inhibit or activate PKGs, complementing drugs that target nitric oxide synthases and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases in this signaling axis. Alternate splicing of PRKG1 transcripts confers distinct leucine zippers, linkers, and auto-inhibitory pseudo-substrate sequences to PKG Iα and Iβ that result in isoform-specific activation properties, but the mechanism of enzyme auto-inhibition and its alleviation by cGMP is not well understood. Here we present a crystal structure of PKG Iβ in which the auto-inhibitory sequence and the cyclic nucleotide binding domains are bound to the catalytic domain, providing a snapshot of the auto-inhibited state. Specific contacts between the PKG Iβ auto-inhibitory sequence and the enzyme active site help explain isoform-specific activation constants and the effects of phosphorylation in the linker. We also present a crystal structure of a PKG I cyclic nucleotide binding domain with an activating mutation linked to Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms and Dissections. Similarity of this structure to wild type cGMP-bound domains and differences with the auto-inhibited enzyme provide a mechanistic basis for constitutive activation. We show that PKG Iβ auto-inhibition is mediated by contacts within each monomer of the native full-length dimeric protein, and using the available structural and biochemical data we develop a model for the regulation and cooperative activation of PKGs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct hyperactive RAS/MAPK alleles converge on common GABAergic interneuron core programs</a></h4>

              
                RAS/MAPK gene dysfunction underlies various cancers and neurocognitive disorders. While the role of RAS/MAPK genes have been well studied in cancer, less is known about their function during neurodevelopment. There are many genes that work in concert to regulate RAS/MAPK signaling, suggesting that if common brain phenotypes could be discovered they could have a broad impact on the many other disorders caused by distinct RAS/MAPK genes. We assessed the cellular and molecular consequences of hyperactivating the RAS/MAPK pathway using three distinct genes in a cell type previously implicated in RAS/MAPK-mediated cognitive changes, cortical GABAergic interneurons. We uncovered a spectrum of GABAergic core programs that are commonly altered in each of the mutants. Notably, hyperactive RAS/MAPK mutants bias developing cortical interneurons towards those that are somatostatin+. The increase in somatostatin+ interneurons could also be induced by elevated neural activity and we show the core RAS/MAPK signaling pathway is one mechanism by which this occurs. Overall, these findings present new insights into how different RAS/MAPK mutations can converge on GABAergic interneurons, which may be important for other RAS/MAPK genes/disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Antiretroviral treatment reveals a novel role for lysosomes in oligodendrocyte maturation</a></h4>

              
                White matter deficits are a common neuropathologic finding in neurologic disorders, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). In HAND, the persistence of white matter alterations despite suppressive antiretroviral (ARV) therapy suggests that ARVs may be directly contributing to these impairments. Here, we report that a frontline ARV, bictegravir (BIC), significantly attenuates remyelination following cuprizone-mediated demyelination, a model that recapitulates acute demyelination, but has no impact on already formed mature myelin. Mechanistic studies in vitro revealed that treatment with BIC leads to significant decrease in mature oligodendrocytes accompanied by lysosomal de-acidification and impairment of lysosomal degradative capacity with no alterations in lysosomal membrane permeability or total lysosome number. Activation of the endolysosomal cation channel TRPML1 prevents both lysosomal de-acidification and impairment of oligodendrocyte differentiation by BIC. Lastly, we show that de-acidification of lysosomes by compounds that raise lysosomal pH is sufficient to prevent maturation of oligodendrocytes. Overall, this study has uncovered a critical role for lysosomal acidification in modulating oligodendrocyte function and has implications for neurologic diseases characterized by lysosomal dysfunction and white matter abnormalities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Canonical Response Parameterization: Quantifying the structure of responses to single-pulse intracranial electrical brain stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Single-pulse electrical stimulation in the nervous system, often called cortico-cortical evoked potential (CCEP) measurement, is an important technique to understand how brain regions interact with one another. Voltages are measured from implanted electrodes in one brain area while stimulating another with brief current impulses separated by several seconds. Historically, researchers have tried to understand the significance of evoked voltage polyphasic deflections by visual inspection, but no general-purpose tool has emerged to understand their shapes or describe them mathematically. We describe and illustrate a new technique to parameterize brain stimulation data, where voltage response traces are projected into one another using a semi-normalized dot product. The length of timepoints from stimulation included in the dot product is varied to obtain a temporal profile of structural significance, and the peak of the profile uniquely identifies the duration of the response. Using linear kernel PCA, a canonical response shape is obtained over this duration, and then single-trial traces are parameterized as a projection of this canonical shape with a residual term. Such parameterization allows for dissimilar trace shapes from different brain areas to be directly compared by quantifying cross-projection magnitudes, response duration, canonical shape projection amplitudes, signal-to-noise ratios, explained variance, and statistical significance. Artifactual trials are automatically identified by outliers in sub-distributions of cross-projection magnitude, and rejected. This technique, which we call "Canonical Response Parameterization" (CRP) dramatically simplifies the study of CCEP shapes, and may also be applied in a wide range of other settings involving event-triggered data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The medial entorhinal cortex is necessary for the stimulus control over hippocampal place fields by distal, but not proximal, landmarks</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental property of place cells in the hippocampus is the anchoring of their firing fields to salient landmarks within the environment. However, it is unclear how such information reaches the hippocampus. In the current experiment, we tested the hypothesis that the stimulus control exerted by distal visual landmarks requires input from the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). Place cells were recorded from mice with ibotenic acid lesions of the MEC (n = 7) and from sham-lesioned mice (n = 6) following 90{degrees} rotations of either distal landmarks or proximal cues in a cue controlled environment. We found that lesions of the MEC impaired the anchoring of place fields to distal landmarks, but not proximal cues. We also observed that, relative to sham-lesioned mice, place cells in animals with MEC lesions exhibited significantly reduced spatial information and increased sparsity. These results support the view that distal landmark information reaches the hippocampus via the MEC, but that proximal cue information can do so via an alternative neural pathway.

                Decision-making involves multiple cognitive processes requiring different aspects of information about the situation at hand. The rodent medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been hypothesized to be central to these abilities. Functional studies have sought to link specific processes to specific anatomical subregions, but past studies of mPFC have yielded controversial results, leaving the precise nature of mPFC function unclear. To settle this debate, we recorded from the full dorso-ventral extent of mPFC in each of 8 rats, as they performed a complex economic decision task. These data revealed four distinct functional domains within mPFC that closely mirrored anatomically-identified subregions, including novel evidence to divide prelimbic cortex into dorsal and ventral components. We found that dorsal aspects of mPFC (ACC, dPL) processed information about active decisions, while ventral aspects (vPL, IL) were more engaged in motivational factors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Systematic delineation of signaling and epigenomic mechanisms underlying microglia inflammatory activity in acute and chronic brain pathologies</a></h4>

              
                Microglia promptly mount an inflammatory response following detection of infectious agents or injuries in the central nervous system. Such function fundamentally depends upon dynamic modulation of gene expression. However, the signaling and epigenomic mechanisms that regulate the transcriptional process underlying microglial inflammatory activity are not well understood. To address this, we used RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq to delineate gene signatures and activity across the repertoire of genomic regulatory elements of microglia engaged in acute and chronic neuroinflammatory activity. Systematic interrogations of the microglial population over time during a systemic inflammatory response revealed a coordinated, sequential activation of multiple gene programs associated with defense response, translation and cell cycling. Activation of these programs occurred in parallel with gain and loss of activity at 4,080 and 3,119 genomic cis-regulatory elements, respectively. Furthermore, computational analyses identified key transcriptional regulators, including Ets, AP-1, C/epb, Nf-kappaB, Irf, Runx, c-Myc and E2f family members, that display differential propensity for activity at gene promoters and promoter-distal cis-regulatory elements. Gene expression analyses also suggested that the transcriptional process likely contribute to the effective activity of numerous transcriptional regulators through the modulation of their mRNA levels. Finally, characterization of CD11c-positive microglia that emerge with chronic demyelinating brain lesions suggested that Egr2, Mef2 members and E-box-binding factors such as Tfeb and Mitf contribute to the enhanced phagosomal activity of this inflammatory subset. Loss-of-function experiments validated that Mef2a in microglia is necessary for the acquisition of the CD11c-positive phenotype. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the inflammatory activity of microglia arises through an intricate, ultimately context-dependent, interplay between signaling pathways, genomic regulatory elements and the transcriptional machinery.

                Ventilation is regulated across many systems, with respiratory rhythm formation occurring in the brainstem but modulated in response to: chemoreception, respiratory muscle afferents, and volitional control. Alterations within any of these systems may result in disruptions of appropriate respiratory control and ultimately, disease. The apolipoprotein (APOE) gene has been studied due to its influence on Alzheimer's disease (AD) development and work in an APOE mouse model recently demonstrated impaired respiratory motor plasticity following spinal cord injury (SCI). Additionally, individuals with AD may co-present with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Despite the prominence of APOE genotype and sex as factors in differing AD and OSA severity, little is known about the impact of these on respiratory control. Using mice expressing two different humanized APOE alleles, we characterized how sex and the presence of E3 or E4 alleles influenced ventilation during baseline (normoxia) and during respiratory challenge. We show that sex and genotype influence breathing under hypoxia, which may have clinical implications in the context of AD and OSA. Additionally, female mice, while responding robustly to hypoxia, were unable to recover to baseline respiratory levels, emphasizing sex differences in disordered breathing and potentially indicative of high metabolic cost.

                Decisions between two alternatives can be influenced by a third irrelevant decoy alternative. Although decoy effects typically depend on the decoy's relative position in a multiattribute choice space, recent studies using risky prospects (i.e., varying in reward and probability) reported a novel 'positive' decoy effect operating on a single value dimension: The higher the expected value of an unavailable (distractor) prospect was, the easier the discrimination between two available target prospects became, especially when their expected value difference was small. Here we ask whether this previously reported distractor effect affords alternative interpretations. Indeed, we find that it occurred because the distractor's expected value covaried positively with the subjective utility difference between the two targets. Looking beyond this covariation, we report a modest negative distractor effect, which in turn could conceivably be attributed to classic multiattribute decoy effects. Our findings clarify the modulatory role of an unavailable distracting option in multiattribute decisions.

                Visual processing is segregated into ON and OFF channels as early as in the retina, and the superficial (output) layers of the primary visual cortex are dominated by neurons preferring dark stimuli. However, it is not clear how the timing of neural processing differs between "darks" and "brights" in general, especially in light of psychophysical evidence; it is also equally not clear how subcortical visual pathways that are critical for active orienting represent stimuli of positive (luminance increments) and negative (luminance decrements) contrast polarity. Here, we recorded from all visually-responsive neuron types in the superior colliculus (SC) of two male rhesus macaque monkeys. We presented a disc (0.51 deg radius) within the response fields (RF's) of neurons, and we varied, across trials, stimulus Weber contrast relative to a gray background. We also varied contrast polarity. There was a large diversity of preferences for darks and brights across the population. However, regardless of individual neural sensitivity, most neurons responded significantly earlier to dark than bright stimuli. This resulted in a dissociation between neural sensitivity and visual response onset latency: a neuron could exhibit a weaker response to a dark stimulus than to a bright stimulus of the same contrast, but it would still have an earlier response to the dark stimulus. Our results highlight an additional candidate visual neural pathway for explaining behavioral differences between the processing of darks and brights, and they demonstrate the importance of temporal aspects in the visual neural code for orienting eye movements.

                The mature mammalian cortex is composed of six architecturally and functionally distinct layers. Two key steps in the assembly of this layered structure are the initial establishment of the glial scaffold and the subsequent migration of post-mitotic neurons to their final position. These processes involve the precise and timely regulation of adhesion and detachment of neural cells from their substrates. Although much is known about the roles of adhesive substrates during neuronal migration and the formation of the glial scaffold, less is understood about how these signals are interpreted and integrated within these neural cells. Here, we provide in vivo evidence that Cas proteins, a family of cytoplasmic adaptors, serve a functional and redundant role during cortical lamination. Cas triple conditional knock-out (Cas TcKO) mice display severe cortical phenotypes that feature cobblestone malformations. Molecular epistasis and genetic experiments suggest that Cas proteins act downstream of transmembrane Dystroglycan and {beta}1-integrin in a radial glial cell-autonomous manner. Overall, these data establish a new and essential role for Cas adaptor proteins during the formation of cortical circuits, and reveal a signaling axis controlling cortical scaffold formation.

                In computational neuroscience, multicompartment models are among the most biophysically realistic representations of single neurons. Constructing such models usually involves the use of the patch-clamp technique to record somatic voltage signals under different experimental conditions. The experimental data are then used to fit the many parameters of the model. While patching of the soma is currently the gold-standard approach to build multicompartment models, several studies have also evidenced a richness of dynamics in dendritic and axonal sections. Recording from the soma alone makes it hard to observe and correctly parameterize the activity of non-somatic compartments. In order to provide a richer set of data as input to multicompartment models, we here investigate the combination of somatic patch-clamp recordings with recordings of high-density micro-electrode arrays (HD-MEAs). HD-MEAs enable the observation of extracellular potentials and neural activity of neuronal compartments at sub-cellular resolution. In this work, we introduce a novel framework to combine patch-clamp and HD-MEA data to construct multicompartment models. We first validate our method on a ground-truth model with known parameters and show that the use of features extracted from extracellular signals, in addition to intracellular ones, yields models enabling better fits than using intracellular features alone. We also demonstrate our procedure using experimental data by constructing cell models from in vitro cell cultures. The proposed multi-modal fitting procedure has the potential to augment the modeling efforts of the computational neuroscience community and to provide the field with neuronal models that are more realistic and can be better validated.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nonlinear Neural Patterns Are Revealed In High Frequency fNIRS Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Vasomotor tone has a direct implication in oxygen transport to neural tissue, and its dynamics are known to be under constant control from feedback loops with visceral signals, such as sympathovagal interactions. Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) offers a nuanced measure of hemoglobin concentration that also comprises high frequencies, though most fNIRS literature studies traditional frequency ranges of hemodynamics (< 0.2 Hz). Linear theory of the hemodynamic response function supports this low frequency band, but we hypothesize that nonlinear effects elicited from the complex system sustaining vasomotor tone presents itself in higher frequencies. To characterize these effects, we investigate how plausible modulation of autoregulatory effects impact aforementioned high frequency components of fNIRS through simulations of mechanistic hemodynamic models. Then, we compare representational similarities between fast (0.2 Hz to 0.6 Hz) and slow (< 0.2 Hz) wave fNIRS to demonstrate that representations acquired through nonlinear analysis are distinct between the frequency bands, whereas when using linear time-domain analysis they are not. Furthermore, by comparing topoplots of significant detectors using nonlinear random vector correlation methods (distance correlation), we demonstrate through a 2nd level group analysis that the median concentrations acquired by fNIRS are independent when analyzing the nonlinearity of their dynamics in their fast and slow component, while they are dependent when utilizing linear time-domain analysis. This study not only provides motivation for researchers to also include higher frequency components in their analysis, but also provides motivation to explore nonlinear effects, e.g. topological entropy. The results of this study motivate future research to explore the nonlinear autoregulatory impacts of regional blood flow and hemoglobin concentrations.

                Homeostatic regulation is essential for neuronal function. Several synaptic mechanisms of homeostatic plasticity have been described, but the functional properties of synapses involved in homeostasis are unknown. We used longitudinal two-photon functional imaging of dendritic spine calcium signals in visual and retrosplenial cortices of awake mice to quantify the sensory deprivation-induced changes in the responses of functionally identified spines. We found that spines whose activity selectively correlated with intrinsic network activity underwent TNF- dependent homeostatic increases in their response amplitudes, but spines identified as responsive to sensory stimulation did not. We observed an increase in the global sensory-evoked responses following sensory deprivation, despite the fact that the identified sensory inputs did not strengthen. Instead, global sensory-evoked responses correlated with the strength of network-correlated inputs. Our results suggest that homeostatic regulation of global responses is mediated through changes to intrinsic network-correlated inputs rather than changes to identified sensory inputs thought to drive sensory processing.

                Fluorescent dyes and genetically encoded fluorescence indicators (GEFI) are common tools for visualizing concentration changes of specific ions and messenger molecules during intra- as well as intercellular communication. Using advanced imaging technologies, fluorescence indicators are a prerequisite for the analysis of physiological molecular signaling. Automated detection and analysis of fluorescence signals requires to overcome several challenges, including correct estimation of fluorescence fluctuations at basal concentrations of messenger molecules, detection and extraction of events themselves as well as proper segmentation of neighboring events. Moreover, event detection algorithms need to be sensitive enough to accurately capture localized and low amplitude events exhibiting a limited spatial extent. Here, we present two algorithms (PBasE and CoRoDe) for accurate baseline estimation of fluorescent detection of messenger molecules and automated detection of fluorescence fluctuations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel subtype of reactive astrocytes critical for HIV associated pain pathogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Pathological pain is common in HIV patients, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive and therapeutic targets for effective treatment have not been identified. Reactive astrocytes are specifically activated in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) of HIV patients with pathological pain and required for the development of HIV-associated pain in mouse models. These findings suggest a key role of reactive astrocytes in HIV-associated pain pathogenesis. However, due to the heterogeneity of reactive astrocytes, the pathogenic subtype is unknown. Using single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) transcriptomic analysis, we identified a novel subtype of HIV-pain associated astrocytes (HIPAs) in the lumbar spinal cord of the HIV -1 gp120 transgenic model. HIPAs were galectin 3 (Gal3)- positive and had transcriptomic signatures of phagocytosis and inflammation; they were also induced in the spinal cord of HIV patients. We showed HIPAs phagocytosed neuronal and synaptic components and were associated with neuronal degeneration. We found that knockout (KO) of Gal3 in gp120 transgenic mice severely diminished HIPAs. Interestingly, the activation of other astrocytes (e.g., homeostatic astrocytes) were also diminished in the Gla3 KO/gp120 transgenic mice. These results indicate that Gal3 is critical for gp120 to induce HIPAs, and that Gal3 may directly or via HIPAs to control the activation of other subtypes of astrocytes. Finally, we showed that the loss of HIPAs caused by Gal3 KO was associated with attenuated neuronal degeneration, neuroinflammation, and pain in gp120 transgenic mice. Collectively, our data suggest that HIPAs are a Gal3-expressing astrocytic subtype that mediates gp120-induced neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in the spinal pain neural circuit during pain pathogenesis and is a potential cell target for treating HIV-associated pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic attention signaling in V4: relation to excitatory/inhibitory cell class and population coupling</a></h4>

              
                Neurons have different roles in attention processing. These roles are determined by a neuron's firing properties, neurotransmitter expression, and functional connectivity. Neurons in the visual cortical area, V4, are reliably engaged by selective attention but exhibit differences in firing rate and correlated variability. It remains unclear what specific neuronal properties shape these attention effects. We identified neurons as fast-spiking (FS) (putative inhibitory) and regular-spiking (RS) (putative excitatory) and investigated their role in anticipatory attention and how this related to their functional connectivity. V4 neurons exhibited a continuum of time-varying attention effects ranging from "restless-weak" neurons at one extreme to "quiet-strong" neurons at another. We found an interdependence between neural attention effects (e.g., restless-weak or quiet-strong), neuron type (FS, RS), and functional connectivity. In particular, we found neurons with restless-weak attention effects were more likely to be RS and have greater population coupling, compared to neurons with other types of attention effects. Also, quiet-strong neurons were more likely to be FS and these FS neurons exhibited higher spike synchrony. From this we propose that time-varying attention effects in a neuronal population depends on the relative involvement of neurons that drive stimulus processing and those that are engaged by intrinsic population activity. These results add important information to our understanding of visual attention circuits at the cellular level.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distributed cortical regions for the recall of people, places and objects</a></h4>

              
                Human medial parietal cortex (MPC) is recruited during multiple cognitive. Previously, we demonstrated regions specific to recall of people or places and proposed that the functional organization of MPC mirrors the category selectivity defining the medial-lateral axis of ventral temporal cortex (VTC). However, prior work considered recall of people and places only and VTC also shows object-selectivity sandwiched between face- and scene-selective regions. Here, we tested a strong prediction of our proposal: like VTC, MPC should show a region specifically recruited during object recall, and its relative cortical position should mirror the one of VTC. While responses during people and place recall showed a striking replication of prior findings, we did not observe any evidence for object-recall effects within MPC, which differentiates it from the spatial organization in VTC. Importantly, beyond MPC, robust recall-effects were observed for people, places, and objects on the lateral surface of the brain. Place-recall effects were present in the angular gyrus, frontal eye fields and peripheral portions of early visual cortex, whereas people-recall selectively drove response in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus. Object-recall effects were largely restricted to a region posterior to left somatosensory cortex, in the vicinity of the supramarginal gyrus. Taken together, these data demonstrate that while there are distributed regions active during recall of people, places and objects, the functional organization of MPC does not mirror the medial-lateral axis of VTC but reflects only the most salient features of that axis - namely representations of people and places.

                Natural scenes statistics have been studied extensively using collections of natural images and sound recordings. These studies have yielded important insights about how the brain might exploit regularities and redundancies in visual and auditory stimuli. In contrast, natural scenes for somatosensation have remained largely unexplored. Here we use three-dimensional scans of natural and human-made objects to quantify natural scene statistics at the scale of the human fingertip. Using measurements of distance, slope, and curvature from the object surfaces, we show that the first order statistics follow similar trends as have been observed for images of natural and human-made environments. In addition, independent component analysis of curvature measurements reveals Gabor-like basis vectors similar to those found in natural images. A simple neural model using these filters showed responses that accurately capture the statistics of responses in primate primary somatosensory cortex.

                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is often more complicated than a single head injury. An extreme example of this point may be military service members who experience a spectrum of exposures over a prolonged period under stressful conditions. Understanding the effects of complex exposures can support proper evaluation and care for patients experiencing persistent symptoms. We designed a longitudinal series of non-invasive procedures in adult mice to evaluate the effects of prolonged mild exposures. We assessed anxiety, depression, and sleep-wake dysfunction as symptoms that can impact long term outcomes after mild TBI. Unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) was generated from a variable sequence of environmental stressors distributed within each of 21 days. Subsequently, mice received a mild blast combined with closed-head mild TBI on five days at 24-hour intervals. TBI components were either five linear force impacts, or a novel alternating repetitive mild TBI (Ar-mTBI) model of linear and rotational (CHIMERA) impacts over five days to produce diffuse pathology. In males and females, UCMS induced anxiety without depressive behavior. Persistent hypersomnia, specifically increased sleep during the active dark period, was found through 6-12 month time points in male mice receiving UCMS with repetitive blast plus TBI events, or surprisingly after UCMS alone. Sleep-wake dysfunction was not found with TBI events alone and was not found in females under any conditions. These results identify prolonged stress and sex differences as important considerations for sleep-wake dysfunction. Furthermore, this reproducible hypersomnia is similar to excessive daytime sleepiness reported in patients, which may inform treatments.

We show that the variation of the contact pressure between the tissue and the measurement probe leads to a coefficient of variation in the measured impedance of under 3%. Its influence can therefore be neglected. Further, we fit the measured impedances to an equivalent circuit model and compare the resistance as well as the cell density of grey and white matter brain tissue based on the model parameters.

                The central circadian clock of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is a network consisting of various neurons and glia. Individual cells have the autonomous molecular machinery of a cellular clock, but their intrinsic periods are considerably variable. Here, we show that arginine vasopressin (AVP) neurons set the ensemble period of the SCN network to control circadian behavior rhythm. Artificial lengthening of cellular periods by deleting casein kinase 1 delta (CK1{delta}) in the whole SCN lengthened the free-running period of behavior rhythm to an extent similar to CK1{delta} deletion specific to AVP neurons. In SCN slices, PER2::LUC reporter rhythms of these mice did not recapitulate the period lengthening. However, in vivo calcium rhythms of both AVP and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) neurons demonstrated lengthened periods similar to the behavioral rhythm upon AVP neuron-specific CK1{delta} deletion. These results indicate that AVP neurons act as the primary determinant of the SCN ensemble period.

                As an active field of research and with the development of state-of-the-art algorithms to analyze EEG datasets, the parametrization of Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis workflows has become increasingly flexible and complex, with a great variety of methodological options and tools to be selected at each step. This high analytical flexibility can be problematic as it can yield to variability in research outcomes. Therefore, growing attention has been recently paid to understand the potential impact of different methodological decisions on the reproducibility of results. In this paper, we aim to examine how sensitive the results of EEG analyses are to variations in preprocessing with different software tools. We reanalyzed the shared EEG data (N=500) from (Williams et al. 2021) using three of the most commonly used EEG software tools: EEGLAB, Brainstorm and FieldTrip. After reproducing the same original preprocessing workflow in each software, the resulting evoked-related potentials (ERPs) were qualitatively and quantitatively compared in order to examine the degree of consistency/discrepancy between softwares. Our findings show a good degree of convergence in terms of the general profile of ERP waveforms, peak latencies and effect size estimates related to specific signal features. However, considerable variability was also observed in the magnitude of the absolute voltage observed with each software package as reflected by the similarity values and observed statistical differences at particular channels and time instants. In conclusion, we believe that this study provides valuable clues to better understand the impact of the software tool on the analysis of EEG results.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activation of Cerebellar Lobule VI PCTH+boxhMed Pathway Selectively blocks METH-induced Conditioned Place Preference in mice</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum is implicated in drug addiction. However, the cerebellar neuronal circuitry underlying addiction, especially classic pathway of Purkinje cells (PCs) to deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN), are largely unknown. Here, tracing experiments showed robust projections from the cerebellar lobule VI tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive PCs (PCTH+) to CaMKII-positive glutamatergic neurons in medial cerebellar nucleus (MedCaMKII), forming PCTH+[boxh]MedCaMKII pathway. Then, mice were subjected to methylamphetamine (METH)-induced conditioned place preference (CPP), showing that METH exposure excited MedCaMKII and inhibited PCTH+. Silencing MedCaMKII by tettox suppressed the formation and expression of METH-induced CPP, but produced serious motor coordination deficits. Chemogenetic activation of lobule VI PCTH+[boxh]Med pathway during METH CPP training blocked the formation and expression of METH-induced CPP without affecting motor coordination, locomotor activity and sucrose reinforcements in mice. Our findings revealed a novel cerebellar lobule VI PCTH+ [boxh]MedCaMKII pathway and pointed out is critical role in encoding METH-preferred behaviors.

	<p>Greater well-being in older adults stems from more effective emotion regulation strategies, highlighting the role of cognitive control. However, cognitive control involves different subsystems, and it is still unclear whether different subsystems have different effects on different emotional information processing. The Dual Mechanisms of Control (DMC) theory postulates that cognitive control can operate in two distinct modes, namely proactive control (a &amp;amp;ldquo;proactive&amp;amp;rdquo; preparatory mode) and reactive control (a &amp;amp;ldquo;reactive&amp;amp;rdquo; wait-and-see mode). This study created an emotional AX-CPT task to explore differences in cognitive control tradeoff between youth and older adults when processing emotional information. The results found that youth had significantly higher error rates on the emotional-neutral sequence than older adults regardless of the valence of emotional information; only in the negative condition did older adults have higher error rates on both the sad-sad and neutral-sad sequences than youth; this phenomenon was not found in the positive condition. The study showed that, in emotional information processing, youth preferred proactive control over older adults; in negative information processing, older adults preferred reactive control strategies over youth; in positive information processing, older adults showed a similar cognitive control pattern to youth, and proactive control was enhanced.</p>

	<p>With the substantial social and medical burden of addiction, there is considerable interest in understanding risk factors that increase the development of addiction. A key feature of alcohol use disorder (AUD) is compulsive alcohol (EtOH) drinking, where EtOH drinking becomes &amp;amp;ldquo;inflexible&amp;amp;rdquo; after chronic intake, and animals, such as humans with AUD, continue drinking despite aversive consequences. Further, since there is a heritable component to AUD risk, some work has focused on genetically-selected, EtOH-preferring rodents, which could help uncover critical mechanisms driving pathological intake. In this regard, aversion-resistant drinking (ARD) takes &amp;amp;gt;1 month to develop in outbred Wistar rats (and perhaps Sardinian-P EtOH-preferring rats). However, ARD has received limited study in Indiana P-rats, which were selected for high EtOH preference and exhibit factors that could parallel human AUD (including front-loading and impulsivity). Here, we show that P-rats rapidly developed compulsion-like responses for EtOH; 0.4 g/L quinine in EtOH significantly reduced female and male intake on the first day of exposure but had no effect after one week of EtOH drinking (15% EtOH, 24 h free-choice paradigm). Further, after 4&amp;amp;ndash;5 weeks of EtOH drinking, males but not females showed resistance to even higher quinine (0.5 g/L). Thus, P-rats rapidly developed ARD for EtOH, but only males developed even stronger ARD with further intake. Finally, rats strongly reduced intake of quinine-adulterated water after 1 or 5 weeks of EtOH drinking, suggesting no changes in basic quinine sensitivity. Thus, modeling ARD in P-rats may provide insight into mechanisms underlying genetic predispositions for compulsive drinking and lead to new treatments for AUDs.</p>

	<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a class of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impaired social interactions and communication skills and repetitive or stereotyped behaviors. Rates of ASD diagnosis continue to rise, with current estimates at 1 in 44 children in the US (Maenner 2021). Epidemiological studies have suggested a link between maternal allergic asthma and an increased likelihood of having a child diagnosed with ASD. However, a lack of robust laboratory models prevents mechanistic research from being carried out. We developed a novel mouse model of maternal asthma-allergy (MAA) and previously reported that offspring from these mothers exhibit behavioral deficits compared to controls. In addition, it was shown that epigenetic regulation of gene expression in microglia was altered in these offspring, including several autism candidate genes. To further elucidate if there is neuroinflammation in the fetus following MAA, we investigated how allergic asthma impacts the maternal environment and inflammatory markers in the placenta and fetal brain during gestation. Female C57Bl/6 mice were primed with ovalbumin (OVA) prior to allergic asthma induction during pregnancy by administering aerosolized ovalbumin or PBS control to pregnant dams at gestational days (GD)9.5, 12.5, and 17.5. Four hours after the final induction, placenta and fetal brains were collected and measured for changes in cytokines using a Luminex bead-based multiplex assay. Placental MAA tissue showed a decrease in interleukin (IL)-17 in male and female offspring. There was a sex-dependent decrease in female monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1). In male placentas, IL-4, C&amp;amp;ndash;X&amp;amp;ndash;C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10)&amp;amp;mdash;also known as interferon &amp;amp;gamma;-induced protein 10 kDa (IP-10)&amp;amp;mdash;and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (RANTES) were decreased. In fetal brains, elevated inflammatory cytokines were found in MAA offspring when compared to controls. Specifically, interferon-gamma (IFN-&amp;amp;gamma;), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin 1&amp;amp;alpha; (IL-1&amp;amp;alpha;), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor &amp;amp;alpha; (TNF&amp;amp;alpha;) were elevated in both males and females. In contrast, a decrease in the cytokine IL-9 was also observed. There were slight sex differences after OVA exposures. Male fetal brains showed elevated levels of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), whereas female brains showed increased keratinocytes-derived chemokine (KC). In addition, IL-1&amp;amp;#120573; and IP-10 in male fetal brains were decreased. Together, these data indicate that repeated exposure to allergic asthma during pregnancy alters cytokine expression in the fetal environment in a sex-dependent way, resulting in homeostatic and neuroinflammatory alterations in the fetal brain.</p>

	<p>Ataxia is a constellation of symptoms that involves a lack of coordination, imbalance, and difficulty walking. Hereditary ataxia occurs when a person is born with defective genes, and this degenerative disorder may progress for several years. There is no effective cure for ataxia, so we need to search for new treatments. Recently, interest in riluzole in the treatment of ataxia has emerged. We conducted this systematic review to analyze the safety and efficacy of riluzole for treating hereditary ataxia in recent clinical trials. We conducted a systematic review using PubMed and Google Scholar as databases in search of this relationship. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) protocols to conduct this study. For inclusion criteria, we included full-text clinical trials on humans written in English and found three clinical trials. We excluded case reports, literature reviews, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses for this analysis. We aimed to evaluate the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) score, the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) score, and the safety of the medication. Two out of the three clinical trials showed statistically significant clinical improvement in the ICARS and SARA scores, while the other trial did not show improvement in the clinical or radiological outcomes. The drug was safe in all clinical trials. Overall, the results of this analysis of riluzole for the treatment of hereditary ataxia are encouraging. Further clinical trials are needed to investigate the efficacy of riluzole on hereditary ataxia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Development of Eight Wireless Automated Cages System with Two Lickometers Each for Rodents</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Drinking behavior has been used in fundamental research to study metabolism, motivation, decision-making and different aspects of health problems, such as anhedonia and alcohol use disorders. In the majority of studies, liquid intake is measured by weighing the bottles before and after the experiment. This method does not tell much about the drinking microstructure, e.g., licking bouts and periods of preference for each liquid, which could be valuable to understand drinking behavior. To improve data acquisition of drinking microstructure, companies have developed lickometer devices that acquire timestamps when animals approach or drink from a specific sipper. Nevertheless, commercially available devices have elevated costs. Here, we present a low-cost alternative for a lickometer system that allows wireless data acquisition of licks from eight cages with two sippers each. We ran a three-phase validation protocol to ensure (1) proper choice of the sensor to detect licks; (2) adaptation of the device to a wireless transmission and realistic <I>in silico</I> tests; and (3) <I>in vivo</I> validation to test the correlation between the amount of licks measured by the lickometer and the bottle weight. The capacitive sensor presented appropriate recall and precision for our device. After adaptation to wireless transmission, the <I>in silico</I> validation demonstrated low reading and transmission errors even when tested in extreme simultaneous licking conditions. Finally, we observed a positive correlation between water or ethanol consumption and lick count, showing that the lickometers can be used for <I>in vivo</I> studies interested in rodent drinking microstructure.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Patient perspectives on home-based rehabilitation exercise and general physical activity after total hip arthroplasty: A qualitative study (PHETHAS-2) [version 4; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Home-based rehabilitation exercise following Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) shows similar outcomes compared to supervised outpatient rehabilitation exercise. Little is known about patients' experiences with home-based rehabilitation, and this study aimed to investigate how patients perceived home-based rehabilitation exercise and general physical activity after THA, focusing on facilitators and barriers. Methods: Semi-structured interviews of qualitative design were conducted with 22 patients who had undergone THA and who had performed home-based rehabilitation exercise. The study took place in a regional hospital in Denmark between January 2018 and May 2019. Data were analyzed using an interpretive thematic analysis approach, with theoretical underpinning from the concept ‘conduct of everyday life’. The study is embedded within the Pragmatic Home-Based Exercise Therapy after Total Hip Arthroplasty-Silkeborg trial (PHETHAS-1). Results: The main theme, ‘wishing to return to the well-known everyday life’, and four subthemes were identified. Generally, participants found the home-based rehabilitation exercise boring but were motivated by the goal of returning to their well-known everyday life and performing their usual general physical activities, though some lacked contact to physiotherapist. Participants enrolled in the PHETHAS-1 study used the enrollment as part of their motivation for doing the exercises.  Both pain and the absence of pain were identified as barriers for doing home-based rehabilitation exercise. Pain could cause insecurity about possible medical complications, while the absence of pain could lead to the rehabilitation exercise being perceived as pointless. Conclusions: The overall goal of returning to the well-known everyday life served as a facilitator for undertaking home-based rehabilitation exercise after THA along with the flexibility regarding time and place for performing exercises. Boring exercises as well as both pain and no pain were identified as barriers to the performance of home-based rehabilitation exercise. Participants were motivated towards performing general physical activities which were part of their everyday life.

                Background: The emergence and spread of antiretroviral drug resistant HIV-1 variants is one of the major factors associated with therapeutic failure in persons living with HIV (PLWH) as it jeopardizes the efforts to reduce the progression to AIDS. Whereas Sanger sequencing is the most appropriate conventional method for HIV drug resistance testing, it has limited capacity to detect low-abundance variants. This study assessed the suitability of next generation sequencing (NGS) to reveal low-abundance HIV-1 drug resistance mutations amongst patients experiencing virological failure at the time of therapy switching in Uganda. Methods: Archived blood samples previously collected from 60 PLWH were used in this study. Briefly HIV viral RNA was extracted and performed targeted NGS of portions of both the HIV protease and reverse transcriptase genes on the illumina MiSeq. For performance comparison, Sanger sequencing was also performed for all the samples targeting the highlighted genes. The sequence data generated was analyzed using HyDRA bioinformatics pipeline, accompanied by the Stanford HIV drug resistance database, to annotate and report drug resistance mutations/variants. Results: Out of the 60 samples, 58 passed preliminary quality control and were considered for subsequent analysis—of which 38/58 (65.5%) registered low-abundance HIV drug resistance variants. Overall, 757 variants from the NGS data and 90 variants from the Sanger data were identified. The most prevalent minority variants included; K65R (65.5%), K14R (63.8%), K45R (63.8%), L63P (63.8%), I15V (63.8%), K70R (60.3%), V77I (60.3%), L283I (60.3%), G16E (58.6%) and L282C (58.6%). Conclusion: An estimated 65.5% of the sampled population harbors low-abundance HIV-1 variants, most of which are associated with virological failure, and consequently antiviral drug resistance. NGS suitably detects drug resistance mutations even at frequencies below 20% of the viral quasi species that are occasionally missed by Sanger sequencing.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Changing the method of consent to increase the numbers of cadaveric donors in Saudi Arabia: the autonomy paradox [version 2; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In Saudi Arabia, the gap between the demand and availability of organs persists, with a total of 13,731 patients who remain on the waiting list in 2019. Family refusal is a major obstacle limiting donation since their consent must be obtained prior to the retrieval of organs. The cause of family refusal is mainly due to the unknown wishes of their loved one to become a donor. This analysis aimed to compare three systems of obtaining consent in terms of effectiveness, respect for personal autonomy, and the cultural role of families in Saudi Arabia to ensure feasibility and effectiveness in increasing the number of donors. Policy alternatives and implications: The consent systems include opt-in (explicit consent), opt-out (presumed consent), and mandated choice systems. The mandated choice policy might be the optimal solution to investigate since it could balance the respect for individual autonomy and the cultural role of families in Saudi Arabia. Conclusions and recommendations: Mandated choice ensures the respect of personal autonomy while influencing the next of kin's decision to donate the organs. Additionally, a recommendation to decision makers is to utilize the Tawakkalna app to send alerts to the next of kin when a user registers as a donor with the user's consent. Moreover, more research should be dedicated to investigating the Saudi public's current culture and perceptions of organ donation to ensure feasibility.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational approach to modeling microbiome landscapes associated with chronic human disease progression</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lu Li, Jiho Sohn, Robert J. Genco, Jean Wactawski-Wende, Steve Goodison, Patricia I. Diaz, Yijun Sun</p>

A microbial community is a dynamic system undergoing constant change in response to internal and external stimuli. These changes can have significant implications for human health. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining longitudinal samples, the study of the dynamic relationship between the microbiome and human health remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a novel computational strategy that uses massive cross-sectional sample data to model microbiome landscapes associated with chronic disease development. The strategy is based on the rationale that each static sample provides a snapshot of the disease process, and if the number of samples is sufficiently large, the footprints of individual samples populate progression trajectories, which enables us to recover disease progression paths along a microbiome landscape by using computational approaches. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed strategy, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline and applied it to a gut microbiome dataset available from a Crohn’s disease study. Our analysis resulted in one of the first working models of microbial progression for Crohn’s disease. We performed a series of interrogations to validate the constructed model. Our analysis suggested that the model recapitulated the longitudinal progression of microbial dysbiosis during the known clinical trajectory of Crohn’s disease. By overcoming restrictions associated with complex longitudinal sampling, the proposed strategy can provide valuable insights into the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of chronic disease and facilitate the shift of the field from descriptive research to mechanistic studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The pursuit of happiness: A reinforcement learning perspective on habituation and comparisons</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rachit Dubey, Thomas L. Griffiths, Peter Dayan</p>

In evaluating our choices, we often suffer from two tragic relativities. First, when our lives change for the better, we rapidly habituate to the higher standard of living. Second, we cannot escape comparing ourselves to various relative standards. Habituation and comparisons can be very disruptive to decision-making and happiness, and till date, it remains a puzzle why they have come to be a part of cognition in the first place. Here, we present computational evidence that suggests that these features might play an important role in promoting adaptive behavior. Using the framework of reinforcement learning, we explore the benefit of employing a reward function that, in addition to the reward provided by the underlying task, also depends on prior expectations and relative comparisons. We find that while agents equipped with this reward function are less happy, they learn faster and significantly outperform standard reward-based agents in a wide range of environments. Specifically, we find that relative comparisons speed up learning by providing an exploration incentive to the agents, and prior expectations serve as a useful aid to comparisons, especially in sparsely-rewarded and non-stationary environments. Our simulations also reveal potential drawbacks of this reward function and show that agents perform sub-optimally when comparisons are left unchecked and when there are too many similar options. Together, our results help explain why we are prone to becoming trapped in a cycle of never-ending wants and desires, and may shed light on psychopathologies such as depression, materialism, and overconsumption.

                <p>by Athira Athira, Daniel Dondorp, Jerneja Rudolf, Olivia Peytral, Marios Chatzigeorgiou</p>

Vertebrate nervous systems can generate a remarkable diversity of behaviors. However, our understanding of how behaviors may have evolved in the chordate lineage is limited by the lack of neuroethological studies leveraging our closest invertebrate relatives. Here, we combine high-throughput video acquisition with pharmacological perturbations of bioamine signaling to systematically reveal the global structure of the motor behavioral repertoire in the <i>Ciona intestinalis</i> larvae. Most of <i>Ciona</i>’s postural variance can be captured by 6 basic shapes, which we term “eigencionas.” Motif analysis of postural time series revealed numerous stereotyped behavioral maneuvers including “startle-like” and “beat-and-glide.” Employing computational modeling of swimming dynamics and spatiotemporal embedding of postural features revealed that behavioral differences are generated at the levels of motor modules and the transitions between, which may in part be modulated by bioamines. Finally, we show that flexible motor module usage gives rise to diverse behaviors in response to different light stimuli.

Cycling of organic carbon in the ocean has the potential to mitigate or exacerbate global climate change, but major questions remain about the environmental controls on organic carbon flux in the coastal zone. Here, we used a field experiment distributed across 28° of latitude, and the entire range of 2 dominant kelp species in the northern hemisphere, to measure decomposition rates of kelp detritus on the seafloor in relation to local environmental factors. Detritus decomposition in both species were strongly related to ocean temperature and initial carbon content, with higher rates of biomass loss at lower latitudes with warmer temperatures. Our experiment showed slow overall decomposition and turnover of kelp detritus and modeling of coastal residence times at our study sites revealed that a significant portion of this production can remain intact long enough to reach deep marine sinks. The results suggest that decomposition of these kelp species could accelerate with ocean warming and that low-latitude kelp forests could experience the greatest increase in remineralization with a 9% to 42% reduced potential for transport to long-term ocean sinks under short-term (RCP4.5) and long-term (RCP8.5) warming scenarios. However, slow decomposition at high latitudes, where kelp abundance is predicted to expand, indicates potential for increasing kelp-carbon sinks in cooler (northern) regions. Our findings reveal an important latitudinal gradient in coastal ecosystem function that provides an improved capacity to predict the implications of ocean warming on carbon cycling. Broad-scale patterns in organic carbon decomposition revealed here can be used to identify hotspots of carbon sequestration potential and resolve relationships between carbon cycling processes and ocean climate at a global scale.

                Background: Academic success of international medical students enrolled in Chinese universities is of great significance, because it directly influences their performance in the license exam and in obtaining a job. Insufficient research has been conducted on academics’ awareness of factors related to teaching that affect their students’ academic success.  Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with academics (N=36) from November 2020 to January 2021 at two medical universities in China. Each interview, lasting between 30 to 70-min, was audiotaped, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis.  Results: The important teaching factors that academics perceived to influence the success of students are: (i) style of pedagogy, (ii) addressing students’ language difficulties and differences, (iii) teaching resources management, (iv) attributes of the academics, (v) supervision and guidance by the academics, (vi) rapport between the academic and student, (vii) linking teaching content to license exams, (viii) classroom discipline management, and (ix) assessment style. Conclusions: University faculties and departments that are involved in teaching international medical students need to ensure that academic staff are provided with ongoing professional development and resources to enhance teaching quality. The nine areas identified above should provide priority topics for such staff training.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Adverse COVID-19 vaccination effects in Finnish patients with Ménière’s disease: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The association between reporting adverse coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination effects and those with a history of audiovestibular difficulties is unknown. The aim of this research is therefore to investigate adverse vaccination effects in adults with a history of Ménière’s disease. Specifically, the incidence of adverse effects, the factors associated with those reporting adverse effects and the relationship between the reporting of audiovestibular and other adverse effects. Methods: A mixed-methods exploratory cross-sectional survey study design was used. Data were collected from 333 members of the Finnish Ménière Association. The survey was designed to obtain demographic information that may be associated with having adverse effects or not, vaccination-specific information and adverse vaccination effects. Both health and audiovestibular adverse events were identified. Data analysis included comparing those reporting and not reporting adverse vaccination effects. Results: The mean age was 63 years with 81% being female. Of the 327 respondents who had one of the COVID-19 vaccinations (Comirnatry/ Pfizer, Astra Zeneca, or Moderna), 203 (62%) reported no adverse effects. The type of or number of vaccinations were not related to the reporting of adverse effects. The most frequently reported adverse effects were injection site tenderness (38%), arm pain (21%), fever (15%) and headaches (15%). Post-vaccination tinnitus and vertigo (both 7%) were the most frequently reported audiovestibular-related symptoms, followed by aural fullness (6%) and hearing loss (4%). Those reporting previous pre-vaccination vertigo were more likely to have post-vaccination vertigo. The presence of post-vaccination tinnitus, hearing loss, and aural fullness, predicted the presence of post-vaccination vertigo. Conclusions: A small proportion of patients with a history of Ménière’s disease may experience adverse post-vaccination effects. Further research is required to explore whether adverse post-vaccination audiovestibular effects are more prevalent in those with a history of otological disorders compared with the general population.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effect of ingestion of red dragon fruit extract on levels of malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase after strenuous exercise in rats (Rattus norvegicus) [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prolonged activation of skeletal muscles causes a decrease in the production of fatigue. Exercise with strenuous intensity causes an increase in Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). An increase in free radicals causes oxidative stress resulting in damage to cell function to mitochondrial dysfunction, and fatigue. This study aimed to determine the antioxidant potential of red dragon fruit (RDF) to delay fatigue due to oxidative stress, which improves cell function in mitochondria. Methods: 25 male rats (Rattus norvegicus) aged three months were divided into five groups: Group K1 was N.A. (No Activity) but drinking and eating; Group K2 performed strenuous exercise without RDF treatment; Groups 3, 4, and 5 (P1, P2 and P3, respectively) performed strenuous exercise and were treated with 75 mg kg-1.bw, 150 mg kg-1.bw, and 300 mg kg-1.bw of RDF extract, respectively. The exercise for the rats involved intense swimming for 20 minutes  a day three time a week for fouweeks.  Malondialdehyde (MDA) dan SOD was measured with the ELISA and histopathology for muscle soleus and lung tissue. Results: Strenuous exercise followed by RDF extract ingestion was compared for fatigue in terms of duration and time; before (24.55±1.38 minute) and after (95.31±7.82 minute) and led to a significant difference of 39% (p<0.01). The study also compared MDA before and after RDF extract ingestion in the K2 vs. the P1 group (p<0.05). At the same time, P2 differed more significantly (p<0.01). This indicated a spread of free radicals and featured histopathological damage of muscle cells. However, ingestion of RDF extract leads to improvement of soleus muscle cells; thus, repairs cell function, delaying fatigue. Conclusion: This study confirmed that strenuous exercise, which causes an increase in ROS, intensifies free radicals with RDF extract ingestion and declines oxidative stress, repairing cell function and delaying fatigue.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Managing the effect of magnetic resonance imaging pulse sequence on radiomic feature reproducibility in the study of brain metastases [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Despite the promise of radiomics studies, their limited reproducibility has hindered meaningful clinical translation. Variability in study designs as well as image acquisition and processing contribute to unreproducible radiomic results. This work’s purpose was to (i) quantitatively compare variability of radiomic features extracted from 2-D spin echo (SE) and 3-D spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) T1-weighted post-contrast magnetic resonance (MR) images of brain metastases acquired within the same patient in a single imaging session, and (ii) provide a framework to inform data acquisition for reproducible radiomics studies. Methods: A retrospective cohort of 29 patients with pathologically-confirmed brain metastases and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR images acquired using 2-D SE and 3-D SPGR sequences within one exam was identified. Metastases were segmented twice by different physicians using semi-automated methods. Radiomic features were extracted using PyRadiomics for 264 preprocessing variable combinations. Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) was computed between features extracted from images acquired by both pulse sequences and different tumor segmentations. Results: We provided general recommendations to improve MR-based radiomic feature reproducibility by clustering and identifying low-concordance features and processing variables. Median CCC between 2-D SE and 3-D SPGR (measuring feature agreement between pulse sequences) was greater for fixed bin count intensity discretization (0.76 versus 0.63) and specific high-concordance features (0.74  versus 0.53). Applying all recommendations improved median CCC from 0.51 to 0.79. Median CCC between contours (measuring feature sensitivity to inter-observer variability) was higher for 2-D SE (0.93 versus 0.86) but improved to 0.93 for 3-D SPGR after low-concordance feature exclusion. Conclusions: The following recommendations are proposed to improve reproducibility: 1) Fixed bin count intensity discretization for all studies, 2) for studies with 2-D and 3-D datasets, excluding high-variability features from downstream analyses, 3) when segmentation is manual or semi-automated, using only 2-D SE images or excluding features susceptible to segmentation variability.

                In this editorial, we identify the key questions requiring further exploration in the sociology of vaccines. In doing so, we discuss the socio-structural forces shaping views towards knowledge about and access to vaccination, trust in vaccines and regulators/decision makers, the associated problem of financial interests in vaccine development and regulation, and global vaccine inequalities. Across the breadth of these issues, we additionally identify a range of theoretical perspectives and conceptual directions that sociologists might utilise when producing innovative empirical, methodological and theoretical research on vaccination relating to risk and uncertainty, conflicts of interest, power and inequality.

                <p>Differences in gut microbiota between Parkinson's disease patients and controls seem to depend on multiple—frequently unmeasured—confounders. Monozygotic twins offer a unique model for controlling several factors responsible for interpersonal variation in gut microbiota. Fecal samples from 20 monozygotic twin pairs (n = 40) discordant for Parkinson's disease were studied (metagenomic shotgun analysis). Paired data analysis detected minimal differences in bacterial taxa abundance at species level (<i>Bacteroides pectinophilus</i> [<i>p</i> = 0.037], <i>Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum</i> [<i>p</i> = 0.050], and <i>Bifidobacterium catenulatum</i> [<i>p</i> = 0.025]) and in predicted metabolic pathways (<i>primary bile acid biosynthesis</i> [<i>p</i> = 0.037]). Additional studies are warranted to understand the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Productivity of mother pigs is lower, and mortality greater, in countries that still confine them in gestation crates [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: For decades, pig farmers have used gestation crates to confine pregnant sows. Gestation crates physically restrain sows for most of their life, preventing them from walking or turning around. Growing concern about animal welfare has been pressuring the industry for change, with recent legislation in several countries restricting the use of crates. Still, the notion that gestation crates negatively affect sow welfare has been challenged by producers in regions where crates are still used, who argue that, by facilitating health monitoring and preventing aggression, crates lead to lower sow mortality and higher piglet outputs per sow. We test whether these claims are valid by comparing these parameters across countries with different housing systems. Methods: We use publicly available data from InterPig, a network of pig production economists in 17 countries that provides harmonized methods for meaningful comparisons of production and cost indicators. We focus on the last five years (2015-2019) of data available. Annual sow mortality and the number of pigs sold per sow were compared among (1) countries where gestation crates are the norm (CRATE), (2) countries where gestation crates are restricted to four weeks after insemination (RESTRICTED), and (3) countries where gestation crates are banned (BANNED). Results: Sow mortality was significantly higher (F2,85=5.03;P=0.009), and annual pig production per sow significantly lower (F2,85=5.99;P=0.004), in the CRATE than in the RESTRICTED group. Conclusions: Claims of higher mortality and reduced productivity per sow in crate-free systems are not substantiated by this industry-validated dataset. While many factors differ among the country groups (e.g., genetics, nutrition, climate), the observation that factors other than crating have a greater influence on performance challenges claims of an overall negative effect of loose housing on the parameters investigated. This evidence should be considered in policies affecting the welfare of breeding pigs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Key concepts for informed health choices: Where’s the evidence? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Informed Health Choices (IHC) Key Concepts is a framework that provides a basis for developing educational resources and evaluating people’s ability to think critically about health actions. We developed the original Key Concepts framework by reviewing texts and checklists for the public, journalists, and health professionals and collecting structured feedback from an international advisory group. We revised the original 2015 framework yearly from 2016 to 2018 based on feedback and experience using the framework. The objectives of this paper are to describe the development of the framework since 2018 and summarise their basis. Methods: For the 2019 version, we responded to feedback on the 2018 version. For the current 2022 version, in addition to responding to feedback on the 2019 version, we reviewed the evidence base for each of the concepts. Whenever possible, we referenced systematic reviews that provide a basis for a concept. We screened all Cochrane methodology reviews and searched Epistemonikos, PubMed, and Google Scholar for methodology reviews and meta-epidemiological studies. Results: The original framework included 32 concepts in six groups. The 2019 version and the current 2022 version include 49 concepts in the same three main groups that we have used since 2016. There are now 10 subgroups or higher-level concepts. For each concept, there is an explanation including one or more examples, the basis for the concept, and implications. Over 600 references are cited that support the concepts, and over half of the references are systematic reviews. Conclusions: There is a large body of evidence that supports the IHC key concepts and we have received few suggestions for changes since 2019.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Sapporo: A workflow execution service that encourages the reuse of workflows in various languages in bioinformatics [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The increased demand for efficient computation in data analysis encourages researchers in biomedical science to use workflow systems. Workflow systems, or so-called workflow languages, are used for the description and execution of a set of data analysis steps. Workflow systems increase the productivity of researchers, specifically in fields that use high-throughput DNA sequencing applications, where scalable computation is required. As systems have improved the portability of data analysis workflows, research communities are able to share workflows to reduce the cost of building ordinary analysis procedures. However, having multiple workflow systems in a research field has resulted in the distribution of efforts across different workflow system communities. As each workflow system has its unique characteristics, it is not feasible to learn every single system in order to use publicly shared workflows. Thus, we developed Sapporo, an application to provide a unified layer of workflow execution upon the differences of various workflow systems. Sapporo has two components: an application programming interface (API) that receives the request of a workflow run and a browser-based client for the API. The API follows the Workflow Execution Service API standard proposed by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health. The current implementation supports the execution of workflows in four languages: Common Workflow Language, Workflow Description Language, Snakemake, and Nextflow. With its extensible and scalable design, Sapporo can support the research community in utilizing valuable resources for data analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Synaptic-like axo-axonal transmission from striatal cholinergic interneurons onto dopaminergic fibers</a></h4>

              
                Dopaminergic axons express nicotinic receptors that modulate and evoke neurotransmitter release. Using direct recordings from dopaminergic axons, Kramer et al. reveal the presence of spontaneous synaptic-like nicotinic axonal EPSPs capable of generating spontaneous axonal action potentials. These findings demonstrate the mechanisms underlying nicotinic-receptor-mediated membrane-potential signaling in dopaminergic axons.
