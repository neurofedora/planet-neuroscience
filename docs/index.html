              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16940">Can deep neural networks learn biological vision?</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.16940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) once showed increasing alignment with primate neural responses as they improved on computer vision benchmarks. This trend raised the exciting possibility that better models of biological vision would come as a byproduct of the deep learning revolution in artificial intelligence. However, the trend has reversed over recent years as DNNs have scaled to human or superhuman recognition accuracy, a divergence that may stem from modern DNNs learning to rely on different visual features than primates to solve tasks. Where will better computational models of biological vision come from? We propose that vision science must break from artificial intelligence to develop algorithms that are designed with biological visual systems in mind instead of internet data benchmarks. We predict that the next generation of deep learning models of biological vision will be trained with data diets, training routines, and objectives that are closer to those that shape human vision than those that are in use today.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17491">On the robustness of the emergent spatiotemporal dynamics in biophysically realistic and phenomenological whole-brain models at multiple network resolutions</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.17491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human brain is a complex dynamical system which displays a wide range of macroscopic and mesoscopic patterns of neural activity, whose mechanistic origin remains poorly understood. Whole-brain modelling allows us to explore candidate mechanisms causing the observed patterns. However, it is not fully established how the choice of model type and the networks' resolution influence the simulation results, hence, it remains unclear, to which extent conclusions drawn from these results are limited by modelling artefacts. Here, we compare the dynamics of a biophysically realistic, linear-nonlinear cascade model of whole-brain activity with a phenomenological Wilson-Cowan model using three structural connectomes based on the Schaefer parcellation scheme with 100, 200, and 500 nodes. Both neural mass models implement the same mechanistic hypotheses, which specifically address the interaction between excitation, inhibition, and a slow adaptation current, which affects the excitatory populations. We quantify the emerging dynamical states in detail and investigate how consistent results are across the different model variants. Then we apply both model types to the specific phenomenon of slow oscillations, which are a prevalent brain rhythm during deep sleep. We investigate the consistency of model predictions when exploring specific mechanistic hypotheses about the effects of both short- and long-range connections and of the antero-posterior structural connectivity gradient on key properties of these oscillations. Overall, our results demonstrate that the coarse-grained dynamics are robust to changes in both model type and network resolution. In some cases, however, model predictions do not generalize. Thus, some care must be taken when interpreting model results.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01107">Brain Morphology Normative modelling platform for abnormality and Centile estimation: Brain MoNoCle</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2406.01107v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Normative models of brain structure estimate the effects of covariates such as age and sex using large samples of healthy controls. These models can then be applied to e.g. smaller clinical cohorts to distinguish disease effects from other covariates. However, these advanced statistical modelling approaches can be difficult to access, and processing large healthy cohorts is computationally demanding. Thus, accessible platforms with pre-trained normative models are needed.
  We present such a platform for brain morphology analysis as an open-source web application https://cnnplab.shinyapps.io/BrainMoNoCle/, with six key features: (i) user-friendly web interface, (ii) individual and group outputs, (iii) multi-site analysis, (iv) regional and whole-brain analysis, (v) integration with existing tools, and (vi) featuring multiple morphology metrics.
  Using a diverse sample of 3,276 healthy controls across 21 sites, we pre-trained normative models on various metrics. We validated the models with a small sample of individuals with bipolar disorder, showing outputs that aligned closely with existing literature only after applying our normative modelling. Using a cohort of people with temporal lobe epilepsy, we showed that individual-level abnormalities were in line with seizure lateralisation. Finally, with the ability to investigate multiple morphology measures in the same framework, we found that biological covariates are better explained in specific morphology measures, and for applications, only some measures are sensitive to the disease process.
  Our platform offers a comprehensive framework to analyse brain morphology in clinical and research settings. Validations confirm the superiority of normative models and the advantage of investigating a range of brain morphology metrics together.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12352">Deep Generative Model-Based Generation of Synthetic Individual-Specific Brain MRI Segmentations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.12352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To the best of our knowledge, all existing methods that can generate synthetic brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for a specific individual require detailed structural or volumetric information about the individual's brain. However, such brain information is often scarce, expensive, and difficult to obtain. In this paper, we propose the first approach capable of generating synthetic brain MRI segmentations -- specifically, 3D white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) segmentations -- for individuals using their easily obtainable and often readily available demographic, interview, and cognitive test information. Our approach features a novel deep generative model, CSegSynth, which outperforms existing prominent generative models, including conditional variational autoencoder (C-VAE), conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN), and conditional latent diffusion model (C-LDM). We demonstrate the high quality of our synthetic segmentations through extensive evaluations. Also, in assessing the effectiveness of the individual-specific generation, we achieve superior volume prediction, with mean absolute errors of only 36.44mL, 29.20mL, and 35.51mL between the ground-truth WM, GM, and CSF volumes of test individuals and those volumes predicted based on generated individual-specific segmentations, respectively.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17222">Optimal Distribution of Solutions for Crowding Distance on Linear Pareto Fronts of Two-Objective Optimization Problems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.17222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characteristics of an evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithm can be explained using its best solution set. For example, the best solution set for SMS-EMOA is the same as the optimal distribution of solutions for hypervolume maximization. For NSGA-III, if the Pareto front has intersection points with all reference lines, all of those intersection points are the best solution set. For MOEA/D, the best solution set is the set of the optimal solution of each sub-problem. Whereas these EMO algorithms can be analyzed in this manner, the best solution set for the most well-known and frequently-used EMO algorithm NSGA-II has not been discussed in the literature. This is because NSGA-II is not based on any clear criterion to be optimized (e.g., hypervolume maximization, distance minimization to the nearest reference line). As the first step toward the best solution set analysis for NSGA-II, we discuss the optimal distribution of solutions for the crowding distance under the simplest setting: the maximization of the minimum crowding distance on linear Pareto fronts of two-objective optimization problems. That is, we discuss the optimal distribution of solutions on a straight line. Our theoretical analysis shows that the uniformly distributed solutions are not the best solution set. However, it is also shown by computational experiments that the uniformly distributed solutions (except for the duplicated two extreme solutions at each edge of the Pareto front) are obtained from a modified NSGA-II with the ($\mu$ + 1) generation update scheme.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17346">Dual-Individual Genetic Algorithm: A Dual-Individual Approach for Efficient Training of Multi-Layer Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.17346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an enhanced Genetic Algorithm technique called Dual-Individual Genetic Algorithm (Dual-Individual GA), which optimizes neural networks for binary image classification tasks, such as cat vs. non-cat classification. The proposed method employs only two individuals for crossover, represented by two parameter sets: Leader and Follower. The Leader focuses on exploitation, representing the primary optimal solution at even-indexed positions (0, 2, 4, ...), while the Follower promotes exploration by preserving diversity and avoiding premature convergence, operating at odd-indexed positions (1, 3, 5, ...). Leader and Follower are modeled as two phases or roles. The key contributions of this work are threefold: (1) a self-adaptive layer dimension mechanism that eliminates the need for manual tuning of layer architectures; (2) generates two parameter sets, leader and follower parameter sets, with 10 layer architecture configurations (5 for each set), ranked by Pareto dominance and cost. post-optimization; and (3) demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional gradient-based methods. Experimental results show that the Dual-Individual GA achieves 99.04% training accuracy and 80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.034) on a three-layer network with architecture [12288, 17, 4, 1], outperforming a gradient-based approach that achieves 98% training accuracy and 80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.092) on a four-layer network with architecture [12288, 20, 7, 5, 1]. These findings highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in optimizing neural networks.

                arXiv:2504.17455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The train timetabling problem in liberalized railway markets represents a challenge to the coordination between infrastructure managers and railway undertakings. Efficient scheduling is critical in maximizing infrastructure capacity and utilization while adhering as closely as possible to the requests of railway undertakings. These objectives ultimately contribute to maximizing the infrastructure manager's revenues. This paper sets out a modular simulation framework to reproduce the dynamics of deregulated railway systems. Ten metaheuristic algorithms using the MEALPY Python library are then evaluated in order to optimize train schedules in the liberalized Spanish railway market. The results show that the Genetic Algorithm outperforms others in revenue optimization, convergence speed, and schedule adherence. Alternatives, such as Particle Swarm Optimization and Ant Colony Optimization Continuous, show slower convergence and higher variability. The results emphasize the trade-off between scheduling more trains and adhering to requested times, providing insights into solving complex scheduling problems in deregulated railway systems.

                arXiv:2504.17489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last few decades, European rail transport has undergone major changes as part of the process of liberalization set out in European regulations. In this context of liberalization, railway undertakings compete with each other for the limited infrastructure capacity available to offer their rail services. The infrastructure manager is responsible for the equitable allocation of infrastructure between all companies in the market, which is essential to ensure the efficiency and sustainability of this competitive ecosystem. In this paper, a methodology based on Jain, Gini and Atkinson equity metrics is used to solve the rail service allocation problem in a liberalized railway market, analyzing the solutions obtained. The results show that the proposed methodology and the equity metrics used allow for equitable planning in different competitiveness scenarios. These results contrast with solutions where the objective of the infrastructure manager is to maximize its own profit, without regard for the equitable allocation of infrastructure. Therefore, the computational tests support the methodology and metrics used as a planning and decision support tool in a liberalized railway market.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the problem of evolving Boolean functions of odd sizes with high nonlinearity, a property of cryptographic relevance. Despite its simple formulation, this problem turns out to be remarkably difficult. We perform a systematic evaluation by considering three solution encodings and four problem instances, analyzing how well different types of evolutionary algorithms behave in finding a maximally nonlinear Boolean function. Our results show that genetic programming generally outperforms other evolutionary algorithms, although it falls short of the best-known results achieved by ad-hoc heuristics. Interestingly, by adding local search and restricting the space to rotation symmetric Boolean functions, we show that a genetic algorithm with the bitstring encoding manages to evolve a $9$-variable Boolean function with nonlinearity 241.

                arXiv:2504.17751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of image recognition, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have achieved performance comparable to conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). In such applications, SNNs essentially function as traditional neural networks with quantized activation values. This article focuses on an another alternative perspective,viewing SNNs as binary-activated recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential modeling tasks.From this viewpoint, current SNN architectures face several fundamental challenges in sequence modeling: (1) Traditional models lack effective memory mechanisms for long-range sequence modeling; (2) The biological-inspired components in SNNs (such as reset mechanisms and refractory period applications) remain theoretically under-explored for sequence tasks; (3) The RNN-like computational paradigm in SNNs prevents parallel training across different timesteps.To address these challenges, this study conducts a systematic analysis of the fundamental mechanisms underlying reset operations and refractory periods in binary-activated RNN-based SNN sequence models. We re-examine whether such biological mechanisms are strictly necessary for generating sparse spiking patterns, provide new theoretical explanations and insights, and ultimately propose the fixed-refractory-period SNN architecture for sequence modeling.

                arXiv:2504.17578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research in Cooperative Coevolution~(CC) have achieved promising progress in solving large-scale global optimization problems. However, existing CC paradigms have a primary limitation in that they require deep expertise for selecting or designing effective variable decomposition strategies. Inspired by advancements in Meta-Black-Box Optimization, this paper introduces LCC, a pioneering learning-based cooperative coevolution framework that dynamically schedules decomposition strategies during optimization processes. The decomposition strategy selector is parameterized through a neural network, which processes a meticulously crafted set of optimization status features to determine the optimal strategy for each optimization step. The network is trained via the Proximal Policy Optimization method in a reinforcement learning manner across a collection of representative problems, aiming to maximize the expected optimization performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LCC not only offers certain advantages over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of optimization effectiveness and resource consumption, but it also exhibits promising transferability towards unseen problems.

                arXiv:2212.11478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Makespan Scheduling problem is an extensively studied NP-hard problem, and its simplest version looks for an allocation approach for a set of jobs with deterministic processing times to two identical machines such that the makespan is minimized. However, in real life scenarios, the actual processing time of each job may be stochastic around the expected value with a variance, under the influence of external factors, and the actual processing times of these jobs may be correlated with covariances. Thus within this paper, we propose a chance-constrained version of the Makespan Scheduling problem and investigate the theoretical performance of the classical Randomized Local Search and (1+1) EA for it. More specifically, we first study two variants of the Chance-constrained Makespan Scheduling problem and their computational complexities, then separately analyze the expected runtime of the two algorithms to obtain an optimal solution or almost optimal solution to the instances of the two variants. In addition, we investigate the experimental performance of the two algorithms for the two variants.

Abstract: Preliminary attempts at incorporating the critical role of astrocytes - cells that constitute more than 50\% of human brain cells - in brain-inspired neuromorphic computing remain in infancy. This paper seeks to delve deeper into various key aspects of neuron-synapse-astrocyte interactions to mimic self-attention mechanisms in Transformers. The cross-layer perspective explored in this work involves bioplausible modeling of Hebbian and presynaptic plasticities in neuron-astrocyte networks, incorporating effects of non-linearities and feedback along with algorithmic formulations to map the neuron-astrocyte computations to self-attention mechanism and evaluating the impact of incorporating bio-realistic effects from the machine learning application side. Our analysis on sentiment and image classification tasks (IMDB and CIFAR10 datasets) highlights the advantages of Astromorphic Transformers, offering improved accuracy and learning speed. Furthermore, the model demonstrates strong natural language generation capabilities on the WikiText-2 dataset, achieving better perplexity compared to conventional models, thus showcasing enhanced generalization and stability across diverse machine learning tasks.

                arXiv:2411.16206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extending Bayesian optimization to batch evaluation can enable the designer to make the most use of parallel computing technology. However, most of current batch approaches do not scale well with the batch size. That is, their performances deteriorate dramatically as the batch size increases. To address this issue, we propose a simple and efficient approach to extend Bayesian optimization to large-scale batch evaluation in this work. Different from existing batch approaches, the idea of the new approach is to draw a batch of axis-aligned subspaces of the original problem and select one acquisition point from each subspace. To achieve this, we propose the expected subspace improvement criterion to measure the amount of the improvement that a candidate point can achieve within a certain axis-aligned subspace. By optimizing these expected subspace improvement functions simultaneously, we can get a batch of query points for parallel evaluation. Numerical experiments show that our proposed approach can speedup the convergence significantly when compared with the sequential Bayesian optimization algorithm, and performs very competitively when compared with seven batch Bayesian optimization algorithms. A Matlab implementation of the proposed approach is available at https://github.com/zhandawei/Expected_Subspace_Improvement_Batch_Bayesian_Optimization.

What started as a union to understand the fundamental optical and electrical properties of semiconductors has been split by divergent interests. While the partnership has produced revolutionary changes in the way that information is processed and consumed by an increasingly interconnected society, now the two disciplines rarely speak to one another. As the years have passed, condensed matter physics has become enamored with delicate electronic effects in increasingly complex materials and geometries to the detriment of realistic applications. Meanwhile, device engineering has remained steadfastly focused on room-temperature performance and overall efficiency, prizing incremental improvement over potential disruptive advances using alternative materials and physics. Recent advances in topological electronic systems—in particular those exploiting Chern insulators—while elegant, prompt a necessary reexamination of the device engineering needs and the associated metrics with the goal of establishing a commonality within the blooming field of topological electronics. The purpose of this Comment is to initiate such a reexamination in the hopes that, with a better understanding of future device needs, perhaps the two areas may reunite to usher in the next electronic revolution via the use of topological phenomena.

                <p>Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons are characterized by specific morphological and electrophysiological properties. First, in ~90% of the cases, their axon arises from an axon-bearing dendrite (ABD) at highly variable distances from the soma. Second, they display a highly regular pattern of spontaneous activity (aka pacemaking) and a broad action potential (AP) that faithfully back-propagates through the entire dendritic arbor. In previous studies (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B30">Moubarak et al., 2019</cross-ref>;   <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B31">Moubarak et al., 2022</cross-ref>), we demonstrated that the presence of a high density of sodium current in the ABD and the complexity of this dendrite played a critical role in the robustness of pacemaking and setting the half-width of the AP. In the current study, we investigated the postnatal development of both morphology and AP shape in SNc DA neurons in order to determine when and how the mature electrophysiological phenotype of these neurons was achieved. To do so, we performed electrophysiological recordings of SNc DA neurons at four postnatal ages (P3, P7, P14, P21) and fully reconstructed their dendritic and proximal axon morphology. Our results show that several morphological parameters, including the length of the ABD, display abrupt changes between P7 and P14, such that a mature morphology is reached by P14. We then showed that AP shape followed a similar timecourse. Using realistic multicompartment Hodgkin&ndash;Huxley modeling, we then demonstrated that the rapid morpho-electrical maturation of SNc DA neurons likely arises from synergistic increases in dendritic length and in somatodendritic sodium channel density.</p>

                <p>What the basal ganglia do is an oft-asked question; answers range from the selection of actions to the specification of movement to the estimation of time. Here, I argue that <I>how</I> the basal ganglia do what they do is a less-asked but equally important question. I show that the output regions of the basal ganglia create a stringent computational bottleneck, both structurally, because they have far fewer neurons than do their target regions, and dynamically, because of their tonic, inhibitory output. My proposed solution to this bottleneck is that the activity of an output neuron is setting the weight of a basis function, a function defined by that neuron&rsquo;s synaptic contacts. I illustrate how this may work in practice, allowing basal ganglia output to shift cortical dynamics and control eye movements via the superior colliculus. This solution can account for troubling issues in our understanding of the basal ganglia: why we see output neurons increasing their activity during behavior, rather than only decreasing as predicted by theories based on disinhibition, and why the output of the basal ganglia seems to have so many codes squashed into such a tiny region of the brain.</p>

                Heavy metal contamination has gradually become a highly significant global issue due to its continual existence in the environment and bioaccumulation in the ecosystems, posing deleterious risks to human health. This review aims to investigate the sources, pathways, and toxicological impacts of heavy metals such as cadmium, lead, mercury, and arsenic, elucidating their health consequences and plausible mitigation strategies. Furthermore, the review explores the dual origins of heavy metal contamination; natural geological processes and anthropogenic activities such as industrial emissions, mining, and agricultural practices. These heavy metals seep into soil, water, and food chains, leading to bioaccumulation, bio-magnification and causing significant health risks, including cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and reproductive toxicity. Additionally, the addition of indigenous case studies from Nigeria, such as lead poisoning in Zamfara State and contamination in the Great Kwa River of Cross Rivers State underscores the disproportionate impact of heavy metal pollution in developing nations. These case studies reveal the socio-economic and environmental dimensions of the issue, providing a contextual understanding of region-specific vulnerabilities and health outcomes. To address these problems, the review evaluates already existing mitigation strategies, including chelation therapy and phytoremediation, while proposing sustainable, cost-effective solutions for reducing exposure and mitigating impacts. It emphasizes the importance of integrative approaches involving policy, community engagement, and technological innovations to fight heavy metal contamination effectively. In conclusion, this seminar contributes to the understanding of heavy metal toxicity, giving and showcasing very much important insights into the sources and health implications of contamination. By integrating theoretical perspectives with practical solutions, this review provides a robust framework for informing policy makers and advancing sustainable environmental management practices.

                Background Natural products databases are well-structured data sources that offer new molecular development opportunities in drug discovery, agrochemistry, food, cosmetics, and several other research disciplines or chemical industries. The crescent world’s interest in the development of these databases is related to the exploration of chemical diversity in geographical regions with rich biodiversity. Methods In this work, we introduce and discuss Nat-UV DB, the first natural products database from a coastal zone of Mexico. We discuss its construction, curation, and chemoinformatic characterization of their content, and chemical space coverage compared with other compound databases, like approved drugs, and other Mexican (BIOFACQUIM and UNIIQUIM databases) and the Latin American natural products database (LaNAPDB). Results Nat-UV DB comprises 227 compounds that contain 112 scaffolds, of which 52 are not present in previous natural product databases. The compounds present in Nat-UV DB have a similar size, flexibility, and polarity to previously reported natural products and approved drug datasets. Conclusions Nat-UV DB compounds have a higher structural and scaffold diversity than the approved drugs, but they have low structural and scaffold diversity in contrast with other natural products in the reference datasets. This database serves as a valuable addition to the global natural products landscape, bridging gaps in exploring biodiversity-rich regions.

                Objectives In an increasingly interconnected world, the effectiveness of health security (HeS) is pivotal in shaping informed health policies and enhancing public health outcomes. This study aims to analyses HeS in 27 non-EU European countries, identifying key priorities and trends, benchmarking against African and Eastern Mediterranean regions (EMR), and ranking and clustering health security performance to inform targeted interventions. Methods Utilizing 2019, 2021, and aggregated 2017–2021 data from six Global Health Security Index indicators, this study applied an integrated Entropy-CoCoSo-K-means framework. The Entropy method was employed to identify health security (HeS) priorities and trends in Non-EU countries, enabling cross-regional comparisons with African and EMR regions to highlight priority shifts and disparities. The Entropy-CoCoSo (Combined Compromise Solution) model generated dynamic rankings, while K-means clustering categorized countries into five risk clusters (high to dangerous). This integration facilitated cross-national dynamic rankings and cluster analyses, informing targeted interventions across Non-EU countries. Results Entropy analysis reveals that detection and reporting emerged as the most critical indicator (weight: 0.388), reflecting disparities in surveillance. The risk environment remains minimally influential (0.067), highlighting consistent vulnerabilities to external threats. Compliance with norms shows a sharp rise (0.091 → 0.123), indicating emerging regulatory gaps or uneven adherence to health standards post-2019. Cross-regional comparisons highlighted a focus on detection and reporting in non-EU countries versus an emphasis on prevention in Africa and healthcare infrastructure prioritization in the EMR. Ranking and clustering revealed stark disparities: Armenia, Norway, and the UK consistently ranked “High,” In contrast, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Tajikistan (Cluster 5: “Dangerous”) exhibited systemic weaknesses. Conclusion This study underscores the need for tailored policies to address non-EU Europe’s evolving HeS challenges. Harmonizing surveillance systems, scaling preventive measures, and bridging compliance gaps are critical. Regional collaboration and resource reallocation to low-performing nations are essential to mitigate disparities.

                Background With rapid industrialization, urbanization, and population explosion in sub-Saharan Africa including Uganda, the population has experienced increased exposure to environmental lead subsequently causing extreme (>50μg/dL) and elevated (< 50μg/dL) blood lead levels. For example, means (Blood Lead levels) of 332μg/dL, 120μg/dL, 25μg/dL,11μg/dL, and 10μg/dL in children under 18 years of age in Nigeria, DR Congo, South Africa, Sudan, and Uganda respectively are reported. Susceptibility to lead toxicity correlates with one’s nutrition status, age, and genetics. This study expounded susceptibility to lead toxicity by relating blood lead levels, delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) enzyme activity, and genetic variations of proteins that code for ALAD in urban children of Uganda aged between 6 and 60 months. Methods A total of 198 blood samples from randomly selected participants, children residing in the Katanga slum of Kampala, Uganda, were analyzed in duplicates for blood lead levels (BLL) on an atomic absorption spectrophotometer, Hemoglobin (Hb) levels, and ALAD enzyme activity were analyzed on a spectrophotometer before DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction, and restriction fragment length digestion for ALAD polymorphism. The results are presented below. Results Geometric means of BLL (10.55μg/dL, SD = 7.4), Hb (7.85g/dL, SD = 1.3) and ALAD enzyme activity (37.15 units/L BLL, S. D = 9.7), corresponded to samples that coded for ALAD1 allele (99.5%) compared to the 0.5% that coded for ALAD2 with BLL (14.5μg/ dL, SD = 4.7), Hb (6.1 g/dL), ALAD enzyme activity (33.8 units/L, SD=1.45). There was a significant relationship with a negative linear correlation between BLL, Hb (status, and ALAD enzyme activity in the three isozymes (ALAD1-1, ALAD1-2, and ALAD2-2) in the strength of ALAD1-1 (r = 0.42, p-value = 0.02) ˂ ALAD1-2 (r = 0.62, effective size = 0.43, p-value = ˂ 0.001) ˂ ALAD2-2 (r = 0.67, effective size = 0.86, p-value = ˂ 0.001).

                Dental implants provide a reliable treatment option for completely or partially edentulous patients. In case of a membrane perforation, the gap can be closed using a piece of resorbable collagen membrane or by suturing the Schneiderian membrane using a resorbable suture. The present study shows a new development in this technique, which involves modifying the design of the absorbable membrane and using pins to fix the membrane. This study concluded that the novel design of the collagen membrane and its fixation with the pins led to greater stability of the bone graft and led to subsequent bone gain that enables dental implantation. Still, this technique requires a histological study to determine the nature of the bone formed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-461/v1?src=rss">Investigating the effects of Orthosiphon stamineus on blood glucose regulation via pancreatic endocrine and exocrine functions in Type 3c Diabetes Mellitus Wistar Bonn/Kobori (WBN/Kob) pancreatitis rat model. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Type 3c diabetes mellitus (T3cDM) is a subtype that develops following pancreatic diseases, such as pancreatitis, impairing both exocrine and endocrine functions. Its management is challenging owing to exocrine enzyme deficiencies. Although plants have long been used for diabetes treatment, research on their role in T3cDM, particularly in exocrine enzymes, remains limited. The exact mechanisms by which enzymes and hormones interact remain unclear. Thus, this study aims to explore the role of Orthosiphon stamineus (OS) in glucose regulation by exploring both pancreatic endocrine and exocrine functions in the T3cDM Wistar Bonn/Kobori (WBN/Kob) pancreatitis rat model. Methods This protocol describes a planned, single-blind, randomized, controlled study conducted on animals to determine the efficacy of OS in regulating exocrine and endocrine pancreatic functions in a pancreatitis-induced WBN/Kob rat model. The groups will consist of control and different treatment groups. The duration of treatment is one month. A glucose tolerance test will be conducted orally before and after OS treatment. Blood glucose and insulin levels will be collected at different time points. Exocrine enzymes (amylase, lipase, and trypsinogen) and endocrine hormones (insulin, glucagon, ghrelin, pancreatic polypeptide, and somatostatin) will be measured in the serum. Hemoglobin A1c and lipid-soluble vitamins will also be evaluated. Results This pre-clinical study aims to explore pancreatic endocrine hormones and exocrine functions in response to OS treatment in rats with T3cDM pancreatitis. Body weight, diarrhea, and any adverse effects will be assessed as the secondary outcomes. Statistical analysis will be conducted to determine the significance of differences between the two groups. Conclusion This study protocol examines the efficacy of OS in addressing both exocrine and endocrine pancreatic dysfunction, ultimately aiding in blood glucose regulation. The findings of this study may help improve the health strategies of T3cDM patients and enhance patient outcomes.

                <p>by Luis A. Álvarez-García, Wolfram Liebermeister, Ian Leifer, Hernán A. Makse</p>

Symmetry principles play an important role in geometry, and physics, allowing for the reduction of complicated systems to simpler, more comprehensible models that preserve the system’s features of interest. Biological systems are often highly complex and may consist of a large number of interacting parts. Using symmetry fibrations, the relevant symmetries for biological “message-passing” networks, we introduce a scheme, called Complexity Reduction by Symmetry or CoReSym, to reduce the gene regulatory networks of <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> bacteria to core networks in a way that preserves the dynamics and uncovers the computational capabilities of the network. Gene nodes in the original network that share isomorphic input trees are collapsed by the fibration into equivalence classes called fibers, whereby nodes that receive signals with the same “history” belong to one fiber and synchronize. Then we reduce the networks to its minimal computational core via k-core decomposition. This computational core consists of a few strongly connected components or “signal vortices,” in which signals can cycle through. While between them, these “signal vortices” transmit signals in a feedforward manner. These connected components perform signal processing and decision making in the bacterial cell by employing a series of genetic toggle-switch circuits that store memory, plus oscillator circuits. These circuits act as the central computation device of the network, whose output signals then spread to the rest of the network. Our reduction method opens the door to narrow the vast complexity of biological systems to their minimal parts in a systematic way by using fundamental theoretical principles of symmetry.

                <p>by Basile Confavreux, Everton J. Agnes, Friedemann Zenke, Henning Sprekeler, Tim P. Vogels</p>

Synaptic plasticity is a key player in the brain’s life-long learning abilities. However, due to experimental limitations, the mechanistic link between synaptic plasticity rules and the network-level computations they enable remain opaque. Here we use evolutionary strategies (ES) to meta learn local co-active plasticity rules in large recurrent spiking networks with excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons, using parameterizations of increasing complexity. We discover rules that robustly stabilize network dynamics for all four synapse types acting in isolation (E-to-E, E-to-I, I-to-E and I-to-I). More complex functions such as familiarity detection can also be included in the search constraints. However, our meta learning strategy begins to fail for co-active rules of increasing complexity, as it is challenging to devise loss functions that effectively constrain network dynamics to plausible solutions <i>a priori</i>. Moreover, in line with previous work, we can find multiple degenerate solutions with identical network behaviour. As a local optimization strategy, ES provides one solution at a time and makes exploration of this degeneracy cumbersome. Regardless, we can glean the interdependecies of various plasticity parameters by considering the covariance matrix learned alongside the optimal rule with ES. Our work provides a proof of principle for the success of machine-learning-guided discovery of plasticity rules in large spiking networks, and points at the necessity of more elaborate search strategies going forward.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012391">Efficient discovery of frequently co-occurring mutations in a sequence database with matrix factorization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michael Robert Kolar, Debasis Mitra, Valerie Kobzarenko</p>

We have developed a robust method for efficiently tracking multiple co-occurring mutations in a sequence database. Evolution often hinges on the interaction of several mutations to produce significant phenotypic changes that lead to the proliferation of a variant. However, identifying numerous simultaneous mutations across a vast database of sequences poses a significant computational challenge. Our approach leverages a matrix factorization technique to automatically and efficiently pinpoint subsets of positions where co-mutations occur, appearing in a substantial number of sequences within the database. We validated our method using SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domains, comprising approximately seven hundred thousand sequences of the Spike protein, demonstrating superior performance compared to a reasonably exhaustive brute-force method. Furthermore, we explore the biological significance of the identified <i>co-mutational positions</i> (CMPs) and their potential impact on the virus’s evolution and functionality, identifying key mutations in Delta and Omicron variants. This analysis underscores the significant role of identified CMPs in understanding the evolutionary trajectory. By tracking the “birth" and “death" of CMPs, we can elucidate the persistence and impact of specific groups of mutations across different viral strains, providing valuable insights into the virus’ adaptability and thus, possibly aiding vaccine design strategies.

                <p>by Juliana Zimmermann, Clara Boudriot, Christiane Eipert, Gabriel Hoffmann, Rachel Nuttall, Viktor Neumaier, Moritz Bonhoeffer, Sebastian Schneider, Lena Schmitzer, Jan Kufer, Stephan Kaczmarz, Dennis M Hedderich, Andreas Ranft, Daniel Golkowski, Josef Priller, Claus Zimmer, Rüdiger Ilg, Gerhard Schneider, Christine Preibisch, Christian Sorg, Benedikt Zott</p>

In the mammalian brain, the directed motion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-flux) is instrumental in the distribution and removal of solutes. Changes in total cerebral blood volume (CBV) have been hypothesized to drive CSF-flux. We tested this hypothesis in two multimodal brain imaging experiments in healthy humans, in which we drove large changes in total CBV by neuronal burst-suppression under anesthesia or by transient global vasodilation in a hypercapnic challenge. We indirectly monitored CBV changes with a high temporal resolution based on associated changes in total brain volume by functional MRI (fMRI) and measured cerebral blood flow by arterial spin-labeling. Relating CBV-sensitive signals to fMRI-derived measures of macroscopic CSF flow across the basal cisternae, we demonstrate that increasing total CBV extrudes CSF from the skull and decreasing CBV allows its influx. Moreover, CSF largely stagnates when CBV is stable. Together, our results establish the direct coupling between total CBV changes and CSF-flux.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003137">Normal locomotion in zebrafish lacking the sodium channel NaV1.4 suggests that the need for muscle action potentials is not universal</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chifumi Akiyama, Souhei Sakata, Fumihito Ono</p>

Extensive studies over decades have firmly established the concept that action potentials (APs) in muscles are indispensable for muscle contraction. To re-examine the significance of APs, we generated zebrafish lacking APs by editing the <i>scn4aa</i> and <i>scn4ab</i> genes, which together encode NaV1.4 (NaVDKO), using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Surprisingly, the escape response of NaVDKOs to tactile stimuli, both in the embryonic and adult stages, was indistinguishable from that of wild-type (WT) fish. Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging using the calcium indicator protein GCaMP revealed that myofibers isolated from WT fish could be excited by the application of acetylcholine (ACh), even in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) indicating that NaVs are dispensable for skeletal muscle contraction in zebrafish. Mathematical simulations showed that the end-plate potential was able to elicit a change in membrane potential large enough to activate the dihydropyridine receptors of the entire muscle fiber owing to the small fiber size and the disseminated distribution of neuromuscular synapses in both adults and embryos. Our data demonstrate that NaVs are not essential for muscle contraction in zebrafish and that the physiological significance of NaV1.4 in muscle is not uniform across vertebrates.

                Background Since the building sector contributes significantly to carbon emissions, using sustainable materials is more crucial than ever. Mycelium is investigated in this study as a natural substitute for conventional insulation materials like rock wool and XPS. Its thermal performance has been evaluated in a residential building in New Cairo, Egypt, using Design-Builder simulations, paying particular attention to U-values, discomfort hours, PPD-PMV, and energy consumption. The results demonstrate that mycelium is environmentally safe, biodegradable, and provides insulation that is comparable to XPS. This demonstrates its promise as a sustainable option for building in the future. Methods This research uses Design-Builder software version 7.3.0.046 integrated with Energy-Plus to simulate the thermal conductivity of mycelium compared to two of the most frequently utilized traditional materials for insulation in Egypt, in Janna Compound, New Cairo. The analysis examines energy consumption, thermal comfort, Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), and Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfaction (PPD%). The study provides a comparative evaluation of mycelium insulation compared to traditional materials like XPS and Rockwool. Results According to the simulation results, mycelium insulation performs comparably to XPS regarding U-values, discomfort hours, PPD-PMV, and energy consumption. Specifically, mycelium achieved a 0.323 U-value, reduced discomfort hours percentage to 16.9%, and achieved a ratio of energy reduction of 15.8% compared to the base case. These results demonstrate how mycelium has the potential to compete with traditional insulation materials while offering significant sustainability advantages, such as biodegradability and a lower carbon footprint. Conclusion In Janna Compound, New Cairo, the research shows how mycelium insulation can improve thermal comfort and save energy usage. It performs similarly to XPS but has more positive environmental effects. These results support the integration of mycelium into Egypt’s sustainable housing practices, providing key insights for architects, developers, and policymakers focused on energy-efficient and sustainable urban development.

                Background Pilot errors accounted for 80% of accidents and 50% of serious incidents. The Human Factor Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) allows the identification of pilot preconditions as an imminent layer of error. This study aimed to analyze the correlation between internal and external risk factors and pilot preconditions in Indonesia. Methods A cross-sectional study design with purposive sampling, directed to male pilots who had flight duty in the past seven days, underwent medical examination at the Aviation Medical Center, Jakarta, August 12–16, 2024. The data were collected through a self-report questionnaire, Trail Making Test A and B, laboratory tests (plasma lipid, fasting blood glucose), and physical measurements (height, weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure). The independent variables included internal (Age, Burnout, Metabolic Syndrome parameters) and external (Flight Time, Duty Time, Unscheduled Flight Duty, Number of Sectors, Sleep Duration). The dependent variables were pilot preconditions based on the HFACS. Results A total of 122 participants participated in this study. Among them, 28.7% had an unscheduled flight duty in the last 30 d. Significant correlations were found between Adverse Mental State and HDL-cholesterol (95%CI=1.52 – 5.80), Adverse Physiological State and Burnout [personal (95%CI=0.005–0,04), work-related (95%CI=0.009–0.042)], Physical Mental Limitation and Fasting Blood Glucose (95%CI =(-0.479)–(-0.071)), and Number of Sectors (95%CI=0.022–3.001). For Personal Readiness (PR), a significant correlation was found between PR-psychological demand and Flight-Time One Year (95%CI=(0.000 – 0.001), Sleep Duration (95%CI =(-0.137)–(-0.013)), Waist Circumference (95%CI =(-0.014)–(-0.002)), PR-Social Support and Sleep Duration (95%IK=0.018–0.207), and Client-Related Burnout (95%IK =(-0.011)–(-0.002)). Conclusions The internal factors that correlated with pilot preconditions in Indonesia were waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, personal burnout, work, and client-related burnout. External factors that correlated with pilot preconditions were the number of sectors, Flight-Time One Year and Sleep duration. These findings emphasize the need to address both physical and mental health aspects of pilots to enhance aviation safety.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-457/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Management of Terminal Myelocystocele in a Neonate: A Case Report and Review of Clinical Considerations [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Terminal myelocystocele (TMC) is a rare, skin-covered congenital spinal anomaly characterized by turbulent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage, an elongated caudal spinal cord, terminal cystic dilation, and an intact dura mater. TMC is frequently associated with other congenital abnormalities affecting the anorectal, genitourinary, and vertebral systems, which necessitates careful clinical and radiological differentiation from other skin-covered spinal dysraphisms. We report a case of a two-week-old male neonate, born to a 19-year old primigravida mother, who presented with a large swelling in the lower back. Prenatal anatomical ultrasound at 20 weeks’ gestation had revealed sacrococcygeal anomalies. Postnatal spinal MRI demonstrated a well-defined, multi-lobulated sacrococcygeal cystic lesion with internal septations originating from an anterior sacral defect. Based on the imaging findings, differential diagnoses included a pure cystic sacrococcygeal teratoma and TMC. Surgical excision of the lesion was undertaken through two inverted V-shaped incisions along the caudal region. Following 8-months outpatient follow up, the infant did not demonstrate any neurological impairments. The potential for cyst expansion in TMC represents a significant clinical consideration, as it may indicate rapid neurological decline.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-456/v1?src=rss">Application of digital health technologies to substance use reduction among students in higher education institutions: A scoping review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Substance use among college and university students is associated with significant health issues, academic struggles, and premature death. This scoping review explores the potential of digital health interventions, including internet-based and mobile platforms, to reduce substance use. A comprehensive search across databases such as PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Google Scholar identified 11 eligible studies conducted across seven countries between 2013 and 2025. These studies focused primarily on alcohol use and included digital health tools like instant messaging, Telegram applications, text messaging, and web-based interventions. The results suggest that digital health technologies can effectively motivate college students in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to reduce or abstain from psychoactive substance use. However, there is a notable research gap in evaluating the effectiveness and feasibility of these tools, especially mobile text messaging, which remains one of the most widely used methods in LMICs. The review highlights the need for further research, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses, to better understand the impact of digital health interventions on substance use reduction and to develop evidence-based programs for behavior change.

     alt="Absolute Number of Thalamic Parafascicular and Striatal Cholinergic Neurons, and the Three-Dimensional Spatial Array of Striatal Cholinergic Neurons, in the Sprague-Dawley Rat"/>
<p>The absolute numbers of thalamic parafascicular (PFN) neurons and striatal cholinergic interneurons (CIN) were estimated in rats using unbiased stereological methods. Spatial statistical analysis of the three-dimensional distribution revealed that the large, mostly CIN were randomly positioned with no evidence of clustering.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The absolute number of neurons and their spatial distribution yields important information about brain function and species comparisons. We studied thalamic parafascicular neurons and striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) because the parafascicular neurons are the main excitatory input to the striatal CINs. This circuit is of increasing interest due to research showing its involvement in specific types of learning and behavioral flexibility. In the Sprague-Dawley rat, the absolute number of thalamic parafascicular neurons and striatal CINs is unknown. They were estimated in this study using modern stereological counting methods. From each of six young adult rats, complete sets of serial 40 µm glycol methacrylate sections were used to quantify neuronal numbers in the right parafascicular nucleus (PFN). From each of five young adult rats, complete sets of serial 20 µm frozen sections were immunostained and used to quantify cholinergic neuronal numbers in the right striatum. The spatial distribution, in three dimensions, of striatal CINs was also determined from exhaustive measurement of the <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i> coordinates of each large interneuron in 40 µm glycol methacrylate sections in sampled sets of five consecutive serial sections from each of two rats. Statistical analysis of spatial distribution was conducted by comparing observed three-dimensional data with computer models of 10,000 pseudorandom distributions, using measures of nearest neighbor distance and Ripley's <i>K</i>-function for inhomogeneous samples. We found that the right PFN consisted, on average, of 30,073 neurons (with a coefficient of variation of 0.11). The right striatum consisted, on average, of 10,778 CINs (0.14). The statistical analysis of spatial distribution showed no evidence of clustering of striatal CINs in three dimensions in the rat striatum, consistent with previous findings in the mouse striatum. The results provide important data for the transfer of information through the PFN and striatum, species comparisons, and computer modeling.</p>

                <img src="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/38bd6276-fdb9-4f99-82ce-a55f9084791c/cne70053-gra-0001-m.png"
     alt="Pax6 and Pax7 in the Central Nervous System of Cladistian Fishes: A Comprehensive Expression Analysis"/>
<p>The Pax6 and Pax7 expression patterns in cladistian fishes showed a high degree of conservation with all vertebrates studied, particularly in the forebrain and midbrain, and some exclusive features, such as the almost total absence of Pax6 in the adult pallium, with the exception of the putative pallial amygdala.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Among actinopterygian fishes, cladistians stand as the more basal extant species in the group, holding a key phylogenetic position close to the common ancestor of Osteichthyes. Despite the recent publication of studies regarding the neurochemical organization of their central nervous system (CNS), there is still a significant lack of genoarchitectonic data that may prove essential to fully understand the patterning of the brain of these fishes. The paired box genes Pax6 and Pax7 are known to determine several boundaries in the CNS and are indispensable, for instance, for the survival of neurons and the change from cell proliferation to cell differentiation. By means of immunohistofluorescence methods, we analyzed the expression patterns of the transcription factors Pax6 and Pax7 in the CNS of three representative species of cladistian fishes, with a particular focus on their evolutionary implications. Thus, conserved Pax6 immunoreactive cell groups were present in the olfactory bulb, subpallial areas, the prethalamus, the basal prosomere 3, the pretectum, the mesencephalic tegmentum, the cerebellum, the basal rhombencephalon, the spinal cord, and the retina. A number of exclusive features were identified, including the almost total absence of expression in the pallium, which was observed only in cladistians, and its absence in the hypothalamus, which is a primitive anamniote trait. Likewise, the Pax7 expression pattern was generally conserved, with traits like the absence of labeling in the telencephalon and the expression in the retromamillary hypothalamic domain, the basal prosomere 3, the pretectum, the optic tectum, and the alar part of the first rhombomere. Additionally, no Pax7 labeling was detected in the spinal cord, comprising a specific cladistian feature.</p>

It also induces phenotypes commonly observed in patients, such as immune activation, metabolomic changes, and reduced skin innervation.

                Zhang et al. show that deficiency of the myeloid-lineage-specific membrane protein LRRC25 in the tumor microenvironment suppresses growth of multiple murine tumor models. This effect is mediated by reprogramming polarization of TAMs toward an anti-tumor phenotype and thereby enhancing infiltration and activation of CD8+T cells.

                Trypanosoma and Leishmania infections cause devastating neglected tropical diseases. These parasites harbor peroxisome-related organelles called glycosomes, which are essential for their survival. Krishna et al. established an inventory of glycosomal membrane proteins. They identified several proteins, including PEX15, which is essential for glycosome biogenesis and parasite survival.

                Brains of aging mice harbor rare monocyte-derived microglia (MoMg) that are transcriptomically indistinguishable from yolk-sac-derived cells. MoMg are targets of clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and, hence, could be a liability. Indeed, Kim et al. show in a mouse model that when harboring a CH-associated DNMT3a variant, MoMg cause motoric deficits.

                Zaidi et al. demonstrate that the loss of neurofibromin in macrophages enhances glucose uptake via membrane-bound GLUT1 in an Akt2-dependent manner, leading to increased glycolysis. This metabolic shift promotes a phenotypic switch from reparative to inflammatory macrophages, resulting in sustained inflammation and pathological neovascularization in retina and human NF1 tumors.

                Neurons fail to express Hsp70 protein during heat shock. Seluzicki et al. reveal that neuronal adaptation to heat shock accompanies a brake on mRNA translation, slowed elongating ribosomes, phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor-2, and suppressed integrated stress response. If recovered within 1 h, translation is restored, and neurons survive.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100731">A host enzyme reduces metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) by inactivating intestinal lipopolysaccharide</a></h4>

              
                The incidence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has been increasing worldwide. Since gut-derived bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) can travel via the portal vein to the liver and play an important role in producing hepatic pathology, it seemed possible that (1) LPS stimulates hepatic cells to accumulate lipid, and (2) inactivating LPS can be preventive. Acyloxyacyl hydrolase (AOAH), the eukaryotic lipase that inactivates LPS and oxidized phospholipids, is produced in the intestine, liver, and other organs. We fed mice either normal chow or a high-fat diet for 28 weeks and found that <i>Aoah<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice accumulated more hepatic lipid than did <i>Aoah<sup>+/+</sup></i> mice. In young mice, before increased hepatic fat accumulation was observed, <i>Aoah<sup>-/-</sup></i> mouse livers increased their abundance of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, and the expression of its target genes that promote fatty acid synthesis. <i>Aoah<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice also increased hepatic expression of <i>Cd36</i> and <i>Fabp3</i>, which mediate fatty acid uptake, and decreased expression of fatty acid-oxidation-related genes <i>Acot2</i> and <i>Ppara</i>. Our results provide evidence that increasing AOAH abundance in the gut, bloodstream, and/or liver may be an effective strategy for preventing or treating MASLD.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100287">Stimulus representation in human frontal cortex supports flexible control in working memory</a></h4>

              
                When holding visual information temporarily in working memory (WM), the neural representation of the memorandum is distributed across various cortical regions, including visual and frontal cortices. However, the role of stimulus representation in visual and frontal cortices during WM has been controversial. Here, we tested the hypothesis that stimulus representation persists in the frontal cortex to facilitate flexible control demands in WM. During functional MRI, participants flexibly switched between simple WM maintenance of visual stimulus or more complex rule-based categorization of maintained stimulus on a trial-by-trial basis. Our results demonstrated enhanced stimulus representation in the frontal cortex that tracked demands for active WM control and enhanced stimulus representation in the visual cortex that tracked demands for precise WM maintenance. This differential frontal stimulus representation traded off with the newly-generated category representation with varying control demands. Simulation using multi-module recurrent neural networks replicated human neural patterns when stimulus information was preserved for network readout. Altogether, these findings help reconcile the long-standing debate in WM research, and provide empirical and computational evidence that flexible stimulus representation in the frontal cortex during WM serves as a potential neural coding scheme to accommodate the ever-changing environment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101075">Stabilization of GTSE1 by cyclin D1–CDK4/6-mediated phosphorylation promotes cell proliferation with implications for cancer prognosis</a></h4>

              
                In healthy cells, cyclin D1 is expressed during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, where it activates CDK4 and CDK6. Its dysregulation is a well-established oncogenic driver in numerous human cancers. The cancer-related function of cyclin D1 has been primarily studied by focusing on the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (RB) gene product. Here, using an integrative approach combining bioinformatic analyses and biochemical experiments, we show that GTSE1 (G-Two and S phases expressed protein 1), a protein positively regulating cell cycle progression, is a previously unrecognized substrate of cyclin D1–CDK4/6 in tumor cells overexpressing cyclin D1 during G1 and subsequent phases. The phosphorylation of GTSE1 mediated by cyclin D1–CDK4/6 inhibits GTSE1 degradation, leading to high levels of GTSE1 across all cell cycle phases. Functionally, the phosphorylation of GTSE1 promotes cellular proliferation and is associated with poor prognosis within a pan-cancer cohort. Our findings provide insights into cyclin D1’s role in cell cycle control and oncogenesis beyond RB phosphorylation.

                <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (PA) is an opportunistic, frequently multidrug-resistant pathogen that can cause severe infections in hospitalized patients. Antibodies against the PA virulence factor, PcrV, protect from death and disease in a variety of animal models. However, clinical trials of PcrV-binding antibody-based products have thus far failed to demonstrate benefit. Prior candidates were derivations of antibodies identified using protein-immunized animal systems and required extensive engineering to optimize binding and/or reduce immunogenicity. Of note, PA infections are common in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF), who are generally believed to mount normal adaptive immune responses. Here, we utilized a tetramer reagent to detect and isolate PcrV-specific B cells in pwCF and, via single-cell sorting and paired-chain sequencing, identified the B cell receptor (BCR) variable region sequences that confer PcrV-specificity. We derived multiple high affinity anti-PcrV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from PcrV-specific B cells across three donors, including mAbs that exhibit potent anti-PA activity in a murine pneumonia model. This robust strategy for mAb discovery expands what is known about PA-specific B cells in pwCF and yields novel mAbs with potential for future clinical use.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93781">Accelerated signal propagation speed in human neocortical dendrites</a></h4>

              
                Human-specific cognitive abilities depend on information processing in the cerebral cortex, where the neurons are significantly larger and their processes longer and sparser compared to rodents. We found that, in synaptically connected layer 2/3 pyramidal cells (L2/3 PCs), the delay in signal propagation from soma to soma is similar in humans and rodents. To compensate for the longer processes of neurons, membrane potential changes in human axons and/or dendrites must propagate faster. Axonal and dendritic recordings show that the propagation speed of action potentials (APs) is similar in human and rat axons, but the forward propagation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and the backward propagation of APs are 26 and 47% faster in human dendrites, respectively. Experimentally-based detailed biophysical models have shown that the key factor responsible for the accelerated EPSP propagation in human cortical dendrites is the large conductance load imposed at the soma by the large basal dendritic tree. Additionally, larger dendritic diameters and differences in cable and ion channel properties in humans contribute to enhanced signal propagation. Our integrative experimental and modeling study provides new insights into the scaling rules that help maintain information processing speed albeit the large and sparse neurons in the human cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101011">Molecular mapping and functional validation of GLP-1R cholesterol binding sites in pancreatic beta cells</a></h4>

              
                G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are integral membrane proteins which closely interact with their plasma membrane lipid microenvironment. Cholesterol is a lipid enriched at the plasma membrane with pivotal roles in the control of membrane fluidity and maintenance of membrane microarchitecture, directly impacting on GPCR stability, dynamics, and function. Cholesterol extraction from pancreatic beta cells has previously been shown to disrupt the internalisation, clustering, and cAMP responses of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a class B1 GPCR with key roles in the control of blood glucose levels via the potentiation of insulin secretion in beta cells and weight reduction via the modulation of brain appetite control centres. Here, we unveil the detrimental effect of a high cholesterol diet on GLP-1R-dependent glucoregulation in vivo, and the improvement in GLP-1R function that a reduction in cholesterol synthesis using simvastatin exerts in pancreatic islets. We next identify and map sites of cholesterol high occupancy and residence time on active <i>vs</i> inactive GLP-1Rs using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (cgMD) simulations, followed by a screen of key residues selected from these sites and detailed analyses of the effects of mutating one of these, Val229, to alanine on GLP-1R-cholesterol interactions, plasma membrane behaviours, clustering, trafficking and signalling in INS-1 832/3 rat pancreatic beta cells and primary mouse islets, unveiling an improved insulin secretion profile for the V229A mutant receptor. This study (1) highlights the role of cholesterol in regulating GLP-1R responses in vivo; (2) provides a detailed map of GLP-1R - cholesterol binding sites in model membranes; (3) validates their functional relevance in beta cells; and (4) highlights their potential as locations for the rational design of novel allosteric modulators with the capacity to fine-tune GLP-1R responses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97614">Cerebellar Purkinje cells control posture in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio)</a></h4>

              
                Cerebellar dysfunction leads to postural instability. Recent work in freely moving rodents has transformed investigations of cerebellar contributions to posture. However, the combined complexity of terrestrial locomotion and the rodent cerebellum motivate new approaches to perturb cerebellar function in simpler vertebrates. Here, we adapted a validated chemogenetic tool (TRPV1/capsaicin) to describe the role of Purkinje cells — the output neurons of the cerebellar cortex — as larval zebrafish swam freely in depth. We achieved both bidirectional control (activation and ablation) of Purkinje cells while performing quantitative high-throughput assessment of posture and locomotion. Activation modified postural control in the pitch (nose-up/nose-down) axis. Similarly, ablations disrupted pitch-axis posture and fin-body coordination responsible for climbs. Postural disruption was more widespread in older larvae, offering a window into emergent roles for the developing cerebellum in the control of posture. Finally, we found that activity in Purkinje cells could individually and collectively encode tilt direction, a key feature of postural control neurons. Our findings delineate an expected role for the cerebellum in postural control and vestibular sensation in larval zebrafish, establishing the validity of TRPV1/capsaicin-mediated perturbations in a simple, genetically tractable vertebrate. Moreover, by comparing the contributions of Purkinje cell ablations to posture in time, we uncover signatures of emerging cerebellar control of posture across early development. This work takes a major step towards understanding an ancestral role of the cerebellum in regulating postural maturation.

                Macrophages are crucial in the body’s inflammatory response, with tightly regulated functions for optimal immune system performance. Our study reveals that the RAS–p110α signalling pathway, known for its involvement in various biological processes and tumourigenesis, regulates two vital aspects of the inflammatory response in macrophages: the initial monocyte movement and later-stage lysosomal function. Disrupting this pathway, either in a mouse model or through drug intervention, hampers the inflammatory response, leading to delayed resolution and the development of more severe acute inflammatory reactions in live models. This discovery uncovers a previously unknown role of the p110α isoform in immune regulation within macrophages, offering insight into the complex mechanisms governing their function during inflammation and opening new avenues for modulating inflammatory responses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105576">Pyruvate and related energetic metabolites modulate resilience against high genetic risk for glaucoma</a></h4>

              
                A glaucoma polygenic risk score (PRS) can effectively identify disease risk, but some individuals with high PRS do not develop glaucoma. Factors contributing to this resilience remain unclear. Using 4,658 glaucoma cases and 113,040 controls in a cross-sectional study of the UK Biobank, we investigated whether plasma metabolites enhanced glaucoma prediction and if a metabolomic signature of resilience in high-genetic-risk individuals existed. Logistic regression models incorporating 168 NMR-based metabolites into PRS-based glaucoma assessments were developed, with multiple comparison corrections applied. While metabolites weakly predicted glaucoma (Area Under the Curve = 0.579), they offered marginal prediction improvement in PRS-only-based models (p=0.004). We identified a metabolomic signature associated with resilience in the top glaucoma PRS decile, with elevated glycolysis-related metabolites—lactate (p=8.8E-12), pyruvate (p=1.9E-10), and citrate (p=0.02)—linked to reduced glaucoma prevalence. These metabolites combined significantly modified the PRS-glaucoma relationship (P<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.011). Higher total resilience metabolite levels within the highest PRS quartile corresponded to lower glaucoma prevalence (Odds Ratio<sub>highest vs. lowest total resilience metabolite quartile</sub>=0.71, 95% Confidence Interval = 0.64–0.80). As pyruvate is a foundational metabolite linking glycolysis to tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism and ATP generation, we pursued experimental validation for this putative resilience biomarker in a human-relevant <i>Mus musculus</i> glaucoma model. Dietary pyruvate mitigated elevated intraocular pressure (p=0.002) and optic nerve damage (p&lt;0.0003) in <i>Lmx1b<sup>V265D</sup></i> mice. These findings highlight the protective role of pyruvate-related metabolism against glaucoma and suggest potential avenues for therapeutic intervention.

">Hebb's Vision: The Structural Underpinnings of Hebbian Assemblies</a></h4>

              
                In 1949, Donald Hebb proposed that groups of neurons that activate stereotypically form the organizational building blocks of perception, cognition, and behavior. He theorized that repeated activations induce the structural changes needed to group neurons in these assemblies. Despite Hebb's enduring influence, testing his predictions at relevant scales has been technically challenging. Here, we test the theory using a novel, large-scale dataset featuring in vivo calcium fluorescence imaging of neural activity with postmortem electron microscopy (EM) for detailed reconstruction of neurons from the same volume of mouse visual neocortex. A coregistration process matches EM-reconstructed neurons to their recorded fluorescence traces. From these traces, we extract neural assemblies from higher-order correlations in neural activity. We find multiple assemblies, many with overlapping neurons, and some neurons that do not participate in any assembly. We then show that these assemblies exhibit properties consistent with Hebb's theory, including more reliable responses to repeated natural movie inputs than size-matched random ensembles and superior decoding of visual stimuli. Using coregistration to probe structural correlates, we find that neurons that participate in assemblies are significantly more integrated into the structural network than those that do not. Contrary to Hebb's original prediction, we do not observe a marked increase in the strength of monosynaptic excitatory connections between cells participating in the same assembly. However, we find significantly stronger indirect feed-forward inhibitory connections targeting cells in other assemblies. Intuitively, the delineation of assemblies can be realized either by internal excitation or external inhibition. Our findings support the latter mechanism. These results show the utility of assemblies in perception and provide a structural underpinning. They lay the foundation for future studies looking at the utility of assemblies in cognition and behavior, as well as the mechanisms for the formation and maintenance of such assemblies.

                Oscillatory activities and network dynamics are fundamental to sensorimotor processing, motor control, and cognitive functions. Capturing the fast cortical dynamics underlying sensorimotor behaviors demands temporal resolution beyond conventional imaging methods. We employed pan-cortical JEDI-1P voltage imaging of layer 2/3 activity in a skilled reaching task to reveal previously inaccessible rapid networks dynamics. Our approach uncovered distinct spectral signatures including reward-related gamma oscillations in M2, global low-frequency suppression during movement execution, and 8 Hz large-amplitude oscillations in sensorimotor cortex during task disengagement. Using independent component analysis, we were able to separate multiplexed functional networks with fast temporal features shared among sensorimotor regions and slower dynamics such as a global preparatory ramp. These distributed activity patterns successfully predicted both sensorimotor parameters and trial outcomes. Our study bridges critical gaps in understanding rapid temporal organization of cortical networks during complex behaviors, revealing how fast neural dynamics coordinate to produce motor actions across distributed cortical regions.

">Early synaptic changes and reduced brain connectivity in PD-like mice with depressive phenotype</a></h4>

              
                Anxiety and depression are common in Parkinson's disease (PD), affecting quality of life. Aggregates of -synuclein (-Syn) are found in serotonergic (5-HT) raphe nuclei early in the disease, but their relationship to brain changes is unclear. We investigated synaptic plasticity, neuronal activity, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based brain connectivity in a PD-like mouse model with depressive phenotype. AAV-induced human -Syn accumulation in raphe 5-HT neurons causes progressive synaptic pathology in interconnected brain regions. This is marked by lower MAP-2, PSD95 and higher SV2A, VAMP2, which are key to synaptic structure and function, as confirmed in human brain tissue samples. Abnormalities in Egr-1-dependent neuronal activity and region-specific differences in resting-state functional brain activity were also detected eight weeks post-AAV infusion, before neurodegeneration. This provides evidence for synaptic and fMRI markers associated with -Syn pathology in emotional brain circuits, and has translational importance for identifying PD patients at risk for depression.

">Dopamine Dynamics in the Nucleus Accumbens Reflect Confidence in Detecting the Occurrence and Non-Occurrence of Visual Signals in Perceptual Decision-Making</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine (DA) is critically involved in processes such as reward anticipation, attention, and decision-making. The present study examined the temporal dynamics of phasic DA transients in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) during a visual decisional task based on signal detection theory, using the fluorescent DA sensor dLight1.3b. During the decision-making phase, DA transients in the NAcC encoded real-time outcome expectancy, apparently reflecting the confidence of rats in their choices. Reward prediction errors (RPEs) emerged following reward delivery and omission and were amplified under conditions of increased uncertainty, produced either by degrading the visual target or introducing interfering distraction. Moreover, DA transients were elicited on both visual signal and no-signal trials. These findings demonstrate that DA fluctuations in the NAcC reflect the RPE that incorporates confidence and levels of uncertainty, emphasizing an involvement of nucleus accumbens DA in adaptive decision-making.

">Tracking neural representations of attended and unattended features in multisensory working memory over time</a></h4>

              
                Working memory supports goal-directed behavior by maintaining task-relevant information. However, a growing number of studies shows that even task-irrelevant features are automatically encoded and can interfere with the recall of task-relevant information. While this phenomenon is well documented in unisensory contexts, it remains unclear whether and how task-irrelevant information persists in multisensory working memory. We examine the role of cross-modal binding by tracking the dynamic neural representation of audio-visual objects under varying selective attention conditions, using an EEG-based audio-visual delayed-match-to-sample task. Participants attended to either auditory or visual features (selective attention), or to both features (conjunction) of two sequential audio-visual items and subsequently compared those task-relevant features to an audio-visual probe. Further, to investigate the influence of bottom-up factors on cross-modal binding, we manipulated spatial congruency by presenting both features from either the same (i.e., in the center) or from disparate positions. Behaviorally, task-irrelevant features interfered with performance even under selective attention, consistent with automatic cross-modal binding and encoding into working memory. This interference was even stronger with spatially disparate presentation, suggesting that bottom-up attentional dynamics strengthen cross-modal bindings and their subsequent storage. Condition-level representational similarity analysis (RSA) showed that EEG activity patterns under selective attention more closely resembled those of conjunction trials than unisensory trials, indicating that task-irrelevant features were incorporated into multisensory object-level representations. This conjunction-similarity persisted in attend-visual trials, but declined over time in attend-auditory trials, reflecting partial filtering of task-irrelevant orientations. Crucially, activity patterns never shifted fully towards an auditory-only profile, indicating that irrelevant visual features were not fully excluded. In addition, feature-level RSA corroborated that both sound frequency-specific and orientation-specific information were present in EEG activity patterns, irrespective of the attended modality. Overall, these results demonstrate the persistence of task-irrelevant information in multisensory working memory and offer critical insights into how attentional processes shape its representational architecture.

">Characterization of Human Anterior Neural Organoids as a Model for Investigating Cohen Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Neural organoids display three-dimensional (3D) structures that resemble in vivo neural architectures. Previously, we developed a novel two-dimensional (2D) neural induction-based protocol for culturing spinal cord organoids, enabling size control and recapitulating neural tube morphogenesis. In this study, we evaluated the application of this concept to induce the anterior regions of the brain and generate human anterior neural organoids (hANOs). By inducing neuroepithelial (NE) cells in 2D and re-aggregating them led to tube-forming morphogenesis similar to that posterior spinal cord induction. The transcriptome profiles of these hANOs resembled the frontal cortex of 20 weeks post-conception (PCW) human embryos. Using this hANOs protocol, we investigated microcephaly phenotypes associated with Cohen syndrome (CS), caused by biallelic loss-of-function variants in VPS13B gene. Deleting VPS13B in human pluripotent stem cells resulted in Golgi dispersion and growth retardation onset in mutant hANOs, akin to CS patients with postnatal microcephaly. This delay is partly linked to reduced neuronal growth. Additionally, mature CS organoids showed enhanced hyper-excitability associated with an excitatory/inhibitory imbalance. In conclusion, this protocol is suitable for studying microcephaly phenotypes from human genetic mutations due to its simplicity and scalability.

">Activity deprivation modulates the Shank3/Homer1/mGluR5 signaling pathway to enable synaptic upscaling</a></h4>

              
                Shank3 is an autism spectrum disorder-associated postsynaptic scaffold protein that links glutamate receptors to trafficking and signaling networks within the postsynaptic density. Shank3 is required for synaptic scaling (Tatavarty et al., 2020), a form of homeostatic plasticity that bidirectionally modulates post-synaptic strength in the right direction to stabilize neuronal activity. Shank3 undergoes activity-dependent phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at S1586/S1615, and dephosphorylation at these sites is critical for enabling synaptic upscaling (Wu et al., 2022). Here, we probe the molecular machinery downstream of Shank3 dephosphorylation that allows for synaptic upscaling. We first show that a phosphomimetic mutant of Shank3 has reduced binding ability and interaction with long-form Homer1, a postsynaptic protein also crucial for scaling, and a known binding partner of Shank3. Since metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) has been shown to associate with Shank3 through long-form Homer1, we manipulated mGluR5 signaling with either noncompetitive or competitive inhibitors and found that only competitive inhibition (which targets agonist-dependent signaling) impairs synaptic upscaling. Further, we found that mGluR5 activation rescues synaptic upscaling in the presence of phosphomimetic Shank3, thus is downstream of Shank3 phosphorylation. Finally, we identify necessary signaling pathways downstream of group I mGluR. Taken together, these data show that activity-dependent dephosphorylation of Shank3 remodels the Shank3/Homer1/mGluR signaling pathway to favor agonist-dependent mGluR signaling, which is necessary to enable synaptic upscaling. More broadly, because downscaling depends on agonist-independent mGluR5 signaling, these findings demonstrate that synaptic up and downscaling rely on distinct functional configurations of the same signaling elements.

">Complementary cortical and striatal encoding of locomotor preparation and performance</a></h4>

              
                Cortical and striatal circuits play an important role in motor planning and execution, and encode movement-related information. While neural dynamics in these areas show substantial similarities, possibly reflecting shared information content, studies directly comparing the cortical and striatal encoding of locomotor preparation and performance have been lacking. Here we contrasted the neural coding properties of mouse primary motor and medial prefrontal cortex, as well as dorsolateral and dorsomedial striatum, prior to and during bouts of self-initiated walking. All four areas contained cells active during both the preparatory and performance periods of locomotion. However, the decoding of behaviorally relevant information using population-level activity revealed significant regional variations. Specifically, dorsomedial striatum more accurately encoded the preparatory period prior to walking, while primary motor cortex more accurately encoded rhythmic limb kinematics during walking. Together, this work provides evidence for a complementary neural coding scheme for locomotor preparation and performance in cortical and striatal circuits.

">Large Language Models Reveal the Neural Tracking of Linguistic Context in Attended and Unattended Multi-Talker Speech</a></h4>

              
                Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong alignment with contextualized semantic encoding in the brain, offering a new avenue for studying language processing. However, natural speech often occurs in multi-talker environments, which remain underexplored. We investigated how auditory attention modulates context tracking using electrocorticography (ECoG) and stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) from three epilepsy patients in a two-conversation "cocktail party" paradigm. LLM embeddings were used to predict brain responses to attended and unattended speech streams. Results show that LLMs reliably predict brain activity for the attended stream, and notably, contextual features from the unattended stream also contribute to prediction. Importantly, the brain appears to track shorter-range context in the unattended stream compared to the attended one. These findings reveal that the brain processes multiple speech streams in parallel, modulated by attention, and that LLMs can be valuable tools for probing neural language encoding in complex auditory settings.

">Activation of complement protein C3 depicts the dynamic tissue damage of the cochlea after noise trauma.</a></h4>

              
                Hearing loss is characterized by dysfunction and pathological changes of the cochlea, including the loss of sensory hair cells and connected synapses. Growing evidence has revealed that the immune system plays critical roles in shaping cochlear responses to tissue injury and the clearance of damaged cells under pathological conditions such as noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). However, the underlying mechanisms that regulate this process remain unclear. As a crucial part of the innate immune system, the complement system is widely known to respond to tissue damage and help remove cellular debris. Such functions are yet to be fully explored in the auditory system, especially in the cochlea. Among various complement factors, the activation of complement protein C3 is an essential functional hub of the complement cascade, resulting in the phagocytosis of dead or dying cells. In this study, we sought to investigate whether C3 exists in the cochlea and what roles it might play upon noise injury. To test this, we studied C3 activation using immunohistochemistry in the cochleae of various mouse models that were noise exposed to an octave band noise (8-16 kHz) for two hours at 112 dB SPL. Mice were sacrificed at various post exposure times to examine cochlear pathology. We found damage dependent C3 activity in the organ of Corti in mice after noise exposure (NE), especially in damaged outer hair cell (OHC) area. Specifically, C3 opsonized damaged cellular structures include degenerating OHCs, OHC debris, ribbon synapses, and efferent synaptic boutons, and the temporal dynamics of the opsonization closely resemble the timing of cochlear tissue damages post exposure. Unexpectedly, C3-deficient mice exhibited similar ABR thresholds and OHC counts at baseline as wild type mice, as well as comparable ABR threshold shifts and OHC loss after NE. However, we observed significantly reduced MOC terminal bouton degeneration in C3-deficient mice upon 112 dB SPL noise injury, indicating that C3 does modulate tissue damage and clearance, at least at the MOC terminals. Our results suggest that complement C3 is dynamically activated in the cochlea upon noise injury, which may play significant roles in damage recognition and further immune recruitment during the development of NIHL.

">Horizontal saccade bias results from combination of saliency anisotropies and egocentric biases</a></h4>

              
                Saccadic eye movements shift the fovea between objects of interest to build a visual percept. In humans, saccades are predominantly executed along the cardinal axes, particularly in the horizontal direction. It is unknown how this horizontal saccade bias could arise mechanistically, though previous work suggests contributions from neural, image-based, and ocular motor factors. Here we used two publicly available eye movement datasets to first investigate which image features -- spatial frequency, saliency, and structural content -- relate to the horizontal saccade bias. Among the three image features, we found that orientation anisotropies in saliency content best predicted the strength of the horizontal saccade bias. Based on this result, we next implemented a saccade target selection model combining allocentric biases aligned with image orientation and egocentric biases aligned with eye or head orientation, independent of image content. As in prior work, this combination successfully replicated human saccade distributions during free viewing of upright images. When applied to tilted images, the model produced effects of image tilt and saccade size that were correlated with prior empirical findings, though with reduced amplitude, suggesting that current saliency models do not fully capture image effects. Taken together, these results suggest that saccade generation reflects both the allocentric biases present in the structure of natural scenes and the egocentric biases present in the saccade generation system itself. An open question is why the egocentric saccade bias exists, but our results suggest that it is adaptive in response to regularities in the world and our typical upright orientation.

">Characterization of iGABASnFR2 for in vivo mesoscale imaging of intracortical GABA dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Most genetically encoded sensors for mesoscopic cortical imaging target excitatory signals, leaving inhibitory dynamics less understood. Capturing large-scale extracellular GABA activity in vivo is essential for understanding how inhibition shapes cortical processing across brain states. To validate the genetically encoded sensor iGABASnFR2 for mesoscale in vivo imaging of extracellular GABA dynamics and to assess how inhibitory activity reorganizes with sensory input, behavioral state, and pharmacological manipulation. We used wide-field imaging in head-fixed mice expressing iGABASnFR2 via retro-orbital AAV injection. Imaging was performed under anesthesia, during quiet wakefulness, natural sleep (NREM, REM), and after administration of the GABA reuptake inhibitor Tiagabine. We analyzed sensory-evoked and spontaneous GABA signals using seed-pixel correlation and spectral analyses. iGABASnFR2 revealed delayed, modality-specific inhibitory responses to sensory stimulation that were stronger and faster in the contralateral cortex. These responses were conserved between anesthesia and quiet wakefulness. During spontaneous activity, GABAergic networks showed state-dependent reorganization: widespread bilateral synchrony was observed in NREM and wakefulness, while REM sleep showed reduced GABA levels and decoupling. Tiagabine elevated baseline GABA, prolonged sensory responses, and enhanced long-range inhibitory connectivity. iGABASnFR2 enables reliable, real-time imaging of extracellular GABA across large cortical areas. These findings demonstrate its utility for tracking state-dependent inhibitory motifs and highlight the dynamic architecture of cortical inhibition in health and disease.

">Structural insights into allosteric mechanism of glycine transporter-mediated analgesia</a></h4>

              
                Chronic neuropathic pain, caused by nerve damage or disease, affects 10% of the population with rising incidence. The burden is exacerbated by ineffective treatments and overreliance on opioids. Neuronal glycine transporter, GlyT2, represents a promising target to restore disrupted inhibitory glycinergic neurotransmission in neuropathic pain. However, most GlyT2 inhibitors have not progressed to clinical use because of significant side effects, partly from irreversible inhibition at analgesic doses. Here, we report cryo EM structures of human GlyT2 bound to the potent pseudo irreversible inhibitor ORG25543, a reversible analogue RPI-GLYT2-82, and in substrate-free state. Both inhibitors bind an extracellular allosteric site, locking the transporter in an outward open conformation, whereas the substrate-free GlyT2 adopts an inward-open conformation. We demonstrate that RPI GLYT2 82 has a faster off-rate, providing analgesia in mouse neuropathic pain models, with no observed mechanism-based side-effects or addiction liability. Our data provide a model for allosteric inhibition, enabling structure-based design of new non-opioid analgesics.

">Dissociating stimulus encoding and task demands in ECoG responses from human visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Brain responses to sensory stimuli depend on the specific task performed by the observer. Previously, fMRI measurements in ventral temporal cortex (VTC) showed that BOLD responses to words and faces scale with the difficulty of a categorization task compared to responses observed during a fixation task (Kay and Yeatman, 2017). This scaling of BOLD responses is thought to be driven by the engagement of cognitive functions during image categorization. To understand how these cognitive task demands change dynamically over time and influence neural activity in VTC, we measured electrocorticography (ECoG) data in two human participants during the same experimental tasks. The ECoG high frequency broadband activity (>70 Hz) showed that local neuronal responses increased with image contrast (as expected for sensory encoding) and were scaled by task demands 0.2 seconds after stimulus onset. In contrast, ECoG low frequency activity in the alpha/beta range (8-28 Hz) was insensitive to image contrast and showed larger suppression with increasing task demands. These results indicate that high frequencies in VTC reflect both the encoding of sensory inputs and task demands, similar to prior BOLD response measurements, whereas low frequency oscillations represent task demands, not sensory inputs per se. In line with the interpretation that low frequency oscillations reflect pulsed inhibition, we speculate that suppression of low frequency oscillations amplifies neural activity in VTC in support of visual task demands.

">The influence of similarity, sensitivity and bias on letter identification</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have demonstrated that bias, sensitivity and similarity between letters are causes of errors in letter identification. However, these factors and their relative contribution in letter identification have not been investigated extensively. Our previous model (noisy template model) was devised to calculate the effect of bias and sensitivity in letter identification task. In the current study, we used the method of constant stimuli to measure letter acuity for Sloan letters at an eccentricity of 7 deg from fixation (temporal visual field). Similar to our previous work, we devised an tested a variety of models to estimate the joint role of bias and sensitivity, but extended our model to also incorporate the similarity between letters. Modelling results showed that bias is the major factor in determining the pattern of total, correct and incorrect responses in letter identification. Furthermore, the joint effect of similarity and bias was found to be higher than the joint effect of either bias and sensitivity or similarity and sensitivity in shaping the pattern of overall responses in letter identification. Incorporating the similarity factor to the noisy template model improved our understanding of the simultaneous contribution of the bias, sensitivity and similarity between letters in the letter identification task.

">Differential memory enrichment of cytotoxic CD4 T cells in Parkinson's disease patients reactive to α-synuclein</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease with a largely unknown etiology. Although the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta is the pathological hallmark of PD, neuroinflammation also plays a fundamental role in PD pathology. We have previously reported that PD patients have increased frequencies of T cell reactive to peptides from -synuclein (-syn). However, not all PD participants respond to -syn. Furthermore, we have previously found that CD4 T cells from PD participants responding to -syn (PD_R) are transcriptionally distinct from PD participants not responding to -syn (PD_NR). To gain further insight into the pathology of PD_R participants, we investigated surface protein expression of 11 proteins whose genes had previously been found to be differentially expressed when comparing PD_R and healthy control participants not responding to -syn (HC_NR). We found that Cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor 2 (CELSR2) was expressed on a significantly higher proportion of CD4 effector memory T cells (TEM) in PD_R compared to HC_NR. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of cells expressing or not expressing CELSR2 revealed that PD_R participants have elevated frequencies of activated TEM subsets and an almost complete loss of cytotoxic TEM cells. Flow cytometry analyses confirmed that Granulysin+ CD4 cytotoxic TEM cells are reduced in PD_R. Taken together, these results provide further insight into the perturbation of T cell subsets in PD_R, and highlights the need for further investigation into the role of Granulysin+ CD4 cytotoxic TEM in PD pathology.

">Behavioral deficits and exacerbated hemodynamics during lifespan of a mouse model of late onset Alzheimer's disease expressing humanized APOEϵ4 and Trem2*R47H</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's Disease (AD) poses a significant global health challenge, being the most prominent cause of dementia with prevalence increasing as the population ages. While the majority of AD cases are late-onset (LOAD), current animal models predominantly represent the more aggressive, faster progressing early-onset AD (EOAD), limiting their ability in assessing early biomarkers and gaining deeper understanding of LOAD progression. This study explores a promising translatable model, the APOE4.TREM2 mouse, which combines the APOE4 allele and the Trem2 p.R47H mutation, both linked to increased AD risk in the human population. We performed behavioral phenotyping and measured hemodynamics in dorsal olfactory bulbs (dOB) during odor stimulation of the APOE4.TREM2 mouse line. Experimental evidence of olfactory dysfunction prior to clinical symptoms suggests the opportunity of utilizing smell testing and fMRI as tools for screening of AD, both for preclinical and clinical studies. Here we assess and confirm the translatability of the APOE4.TREM2 mouse LOAD model, reporting exacerbated anxiety, deficits in odor-based foraging and spatial memory, and exacerbated odor-evoked dOB intrinsic responses in an age-dependent manner.

">T cell responses towards PINK1 and α-synuclein are elevated in prodromal Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                A role of the immune system in Parkinson's disease (PD) progression has long been suspected due to the increased frequency of activated glial cells and infiltrating T cells into the substantia nigra. It was previously reported that PD donors have increased T cell responses towards PINK1 and -synuclein (-syn), two Lewy body-associated proteins. Further, T cell reactivity towards -syn was highest closer to disease onset, highlighting that autoreactive T cells might play a role in PD pathogenesis. However, whether T cell autoreactivity is present during prodromal PD is unknown. Here, we investigated T cell responses towards PINK1 and -syn in donors at high risk of developing PD (i.e. prodromal PD: genetic risk, hyposmia, and or REM sleep behavior disorder), in comparison to PD and healthy control donors. T cell reactivity to these two autoantigens was detected in prodromal PD at levels comparable to those detected in individuals with clinically diagnosed PD. Aligned with the increased incidence of PD in males, we found that males with PD, but not females, had elevated T cell reactivity compared to healthy controls. However, among prodromal PD donors, males and females had elevated T cell responses. These differing trends in reactivity highlights the need for further studies of the impact of biological sex on neuroinflammation and PD progression.

                Symptoms of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the leading monogenic cause of intellectual disability and autism, are thought to arise from an excitation/inhibition (E/I) imbalance. Here, we leverage cell type specific mRNA sequencing to profile molecular alterations of cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurons in Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice, integrating transcriptomic results with circuit and behavioral readouts to prioritize novel therapeutic targets. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) were largely upregulated in Camk2a expressing excitatory neurons but downregulated in Pvalb-expressing inhibitory neurons, and the underlying signaling pathways were often altered in opposite directions. Among the 184 DEGs that were concordantly dysregulated across both cell types, only Rapgef4 (Epac2) was also an FMRP target, an ASD risk gene and brain enriched. EPAC2 has been implicated in synaptic maturation and plasticity. Systemic administration of an EPAC2 antagonist restored cortical circuit function in Fmr1 KO mice and ameliorated sensory behavioral phenotypes. EPAC2 is a potential target for therapy in FXS.

                The nematode C. elegans does not have eyes but can respond to aversive UV and blue light stimulation and even distinguish colours. The gustatory receptor homolog LITE-1 was identified in forward genetic screens for worms that failed to respond to blue light stimulation. When LITE-1 is expressed in body-wall muscles, it causes contraction in response to blue light suggesting that LITE-1 is both necessary and sufficient for blue light response. Here we show that in addition to light avoidance, LITE-1 is also required for worms' avoidance of high concentrations of diacetyl, an odorant that is attractive at low concentrations. Like blue light, diacetyl causes muscle contraction in transgenic worms engineered to express LITE-1 in body-wall muscles. These data are consistent with a direct chemoreceptor function for LITE-1 which would make it a multimodal sensor of aversive stimuli.

">FGF21 signals through KLB-expressing glutamatergic neurons in the hindbrain to mediate the effects of dietary protein restriction</a></h4>

              
                Animals adaptively respond to protein restriction by altering both behavior and metabolism. Previous work demonstrated that the metabolic hormone FGF21 acted in the brain to coordinate these adaptive responses, but the exact site of action remains unclear. Here, we identify a discrete population of glutamatergic, Klb-expressing neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), demonstrating that these neurons are key to mediating FGF21 action during protein restriction. Using a novel Klb-Flp mouse line combined with intersectional genetics, we demonstrate that these neurons are directly activated by FGF21. While previous work implicated the SCN, PVN, and VMH in FGF21 action, we find that these areas do not impact the response to protein restriction. Instead, selective ablation of NTS-KLB neurons prevents metabolic adaptations to protein restriction (food intake, food choice, and energy expenditure), while their chemogenetic activation is sufficient to drive these responses. These findings establish NTS-KLB neurons as a critical node for detecting protein status and coordinating whole-body metabolic responses, providing new insight into how the brain monitors and maintains protein homeostasis.

">Aperiodic neural timescales in prefrontal cortex dilate with increased task abstraction</a></h4>

              
                Navigating everyday environments requires that the brain perform information processing at multiple different timescales. For example, while watching a movie we use sensory information from every video frame to construct the current movie scene, which itself is continuously integrated into the narrative arc of the film. This critical function is supported by sensory inputs propagating from dynamic sensory cortices to association cortices, where neural activity remains more stable over time. The hierarchical organization of cortex is therefore reflected in a gradient of neural timescales. While this propagation of inputs up the cortical hierarchy is facilitated by both rhythmic (oscillatory) and non-rhythmic (aperiodic) neural activity, traditional measures of oscillations are often confounded by the influence of aperiodic signals. The reverse is also true: traditional measures of aperiodic neural timescales are influenced by oscillations. This makes it difficult to distinguish between oscillatory and timescale effects in cognition. Here, we analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) data from participants performing a cognitive control task that manipulated the amount of task-relevant contextual information, called task abstraction. Critically, we separated aperiodic neural timescales from the confounding influence of oscillatory power. We hypothesized that neural timescales would increase during the task, and more so in high-abstraction conditions. We found that task abstraction dilated the aperiodic neural timescale, as estimated from the autocorrelation function, over prefrontal cortical regions. Our findings suggests that neural timescales are a dynamic feature of the cerebral cortex that change to meet task demands.

                Loss of nuclear TDP-43 splicing activity is a common feature across neurodegenerative diseases, but its relevance to Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. Here, we show that TDP-43 pathology in AD is broadly associated with splicing abnormalities, including aberrant splicing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). We demonstrate that TDP-43 drives the formation of elongated APP isoforms, APP751 and APP770. Thus, TDP-43 dysregulation disrupts APP695/751/770 alternative splicing across ALS/FTLD-TDP and AD, providing a compelling mechanism for a 37-year-old observation of APP isoform dysregulation. We further establish a mechanistic link between TDP-43 pathology, APP splicing, and A{beta} pathology. Unexpectedly, this effect is mediated by a toxic gain of cytoplasmic TDP-43 function, rather than loss of its nuclear role. Using proximity proteomics and base editing in human iPSC-derived neurons, we show that TDP-43 pathology causes cytoplasmic co-sequestration of splicing regulators SCAF11, SRSF5, and TIAL1, which are involved in APP mis-splicing, but not in the regulation of other TDP-43 targets such as STMN2 or UNC13A. Together, our findings suggest that TDP-43-mediated splicing dysfunction upstream of APP contributes to the pathogenesis of seemingly disparate neurodegenerative diseases, uniting AD and ALS/FTLD-TDP through a shared molecular mechanism.

">Temporal Synchronization Analysis: A Model-Free Method for Detecting Robust and Nonlinear Brain Activation in fMRI Data</a></h4>

              
                The sluggishness of the fMRI blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal has motivated the use of block or trial-based experimental designs that rely on the assumption of linearity, typically modeled using the General Linear Model (GLM). But many non-sensory brain regions and subcortical areas do not correspond to such linearities. We introduce a model-free estimation method called Temporal Synchronization Analysis (TSA) which detects significant brain activations across trials and subjects at an individual time point. We validate it across multiple cognitive tasks (combined n=1600). In constrained task stimuli like visual checkerboard paradigms, we discovered novel nonlinearities not reported previously. In model-free task paradigms like listening to naturalistic auditory stimuli, TSA can detect unique stimuli linked quasi-temporal activations across default mode and language networks. Our user-friendly Python toolkit enables cognitive neuroscience researchers to identify stable and robust brain activation across various cognitive paradigms that are challenging to model with current methods.

">Identifying Networks within an fMRI Multivariate Searchlight Analysis</a></h4>

              
                There is great interest in understanding how different brain regions represent information across space and time. Information-based searchlight analyses systematically examine the information encoded within clusters of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) voxels across the brain. Significant searchlights contain information that can be used to decode conditions of interest, but significant discriminability can be achieved in a variety of ways. We have developed and report on a new analysis method that can identify sub-networks of searchlights. Notably, unlike methods that collapse trials by condition, such as Representational Similarity Analysis, our method groups searchlights based on them having similar temporal changes in information. We present this method and apply it to fMRI data collected as participants viewed words, faces, shapes, and numbers. After running a searchlight analysis with a 4-way Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) classifier, the accuracy vector was submitted to a multi-subject Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to group searchlights based on their decoding timeseries. The ICA identified seven components (sub-networks) of searchlights. These networks identified sets of brain areas that have been commonly associated with the processing of faces, words, shapes and numbers. For instance, two of the components drew strongly on the face-processing network, including fusiform cortex. Switching the classification scheme to faces versus non-faces reconfigured the observed network to reflected face-related systems. These results demonstrate that this method can divide searchlight maps into meaningful components.

">Lipid Mediated Formation of Antiparallel Aggregates in Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy</a></h4>

              
                Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a cerebrovascular disorder marked by amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) deposition in blood vessel walls, leading to hemorrhage and recurring stroke. Despite significant overlap with Alzheimer's disease (AD) through shared A{beta} pathology, the specific structural characteristics of A{beta} aggregates in CAA and their variations between stages of disease severity are yet to be fully understood. Traditional approaches relying on brain-derived fibrils can potentially overlook the polymorphic heterogeneity and chemical associations within vascular amyloids. This study utilizes sub-diffraction, label-free mid-infrared photothermal (MIP) spectroscopic imaging to directly probe the chemical structure and heterogeneity of vascular amyloid aggregates within human brain tissues across different CAA stages. Our results demonstrate a clear increase in {beta}-sheet content within vascular A{beta} deposits corresponding to disease progression. Crucially, we identify a significant presence of antiparallel {beta}-sheet structures, particularly prevalent in moderate/severe CAA. The abundance of antiparallel structures correlates strongly with co-localized lipids, implicating a lipid-mediated aggregation mechanism. We substantiate the ex-vivo observations using nanoscale AFM-IR spectroscopy and demonstrate that A{beta}40 aggregated in vitro with brain-derived lipids adopts antiparallel structural distributions mirroring those found in CAA vascular lesions. This work provides critical insights into the structural distributions of A{beta} aggregates in CAA, highlighting the presence of polymorphs typically associated with transient intermediates, which may lead to alternate mechanisms for neurotoxicity.

">Maturation of GABAergic signalling times the opening of a critical period in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                The occurrence of critical periods during the development of neural networks is widely documented. Activity manipulation when these periods are open can lead to permanent, and often debilitating, effects to the mature neural network. Detailed understanding of the specific contribution of critical periods to network development, however, remains elusive. This is partly because identified critical periods in mammals are present in complex sensory networks (e.g., visual and auditory) that make focused experimental manipulation challenging. It is significant, therefore, that critical periods have been identified in simpler model systems. A critical period occurs during the development of the embryonic locomotor network in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Perturbation of neuronal activity during this period is sufficient to permanently destabilise the mature larval locomotor network: leaving it prone to induced seizures. Given a clear role of {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the timing of the mammalian critical period of ocular dominance, we sought to establish whether this neurotransmitter also regulates the opening of the Drosophila locomotor critical period. Utilising GABA agonists, antagonists, and genetics, we manipulated the embryonic GABAergic system and, at the end of larval life, measured an induced seizure phenotype in mature third-instar larvae. We found that potentiating GABAergic signalling, via embryonic exposure to diazepam or overexpression of the GABAA receptor rdl, induced precocious opening of the critical period. By contrast, exposure to the GABA antagonist gabazine, or knockdown of the GABA-synthetic enzyme Gad1, delayed opening. Thus, we show that critical period timing within the Drosophila CNS is dictated by GABAergic signalling, indicating a phylogenetically conserved role.

">Evidence of elemental encoding at the olfactory periphery</a></h4>

              
                How complex, multifaceted perceptual odor qualities of volatile chemicals are encoded by the olfactory system is poorly understood. We explore the receptive fields of individual odorant receptors and show how potent agonists share a consistent perceptual quality despite chemical diversity. This supports the idea that the olfactory neural connectome maintains peripheral information like odor quality through the distinct layers of the system, akin to a labeled line regime present in other sensory structures. We further observe that simple combinatorial activation of odorant receptors can generate a perceptual sum. Human olfaction may thus be shaped by the orthogonal and elemental encoding of olfactory features detected by receptor selectivity and activity. These results provide novel insights into how the brain processes olfactory information and more broadly into neural encoding during sensory processing.

                Sleep-associated downscaling of neuronal firing, i.e. firing rate homeostasis (FRH), is essential for restorative sleep. Sleep dysfunction is common in Parkinson's disease (PD), but FRH has not been investigated. Here, using a within-subject design in the nonhuman primate model of PD, we report that thalamocortical FRH is disrupted in parkinsonism. These findings can inform therapeutic approaches tailored towards normalizing FRH to reestablish restorative sleep in PD.

">Midbrain organoids with an SNCA gene triplication display dopamine-dependent alterations in network activity</a></h4>

              
                Human midbrain organoids (hMOs) show promise as a patient-derived model for the study of Parkinson's disease (PD). Yet, much remains unknown about how accurately hMOs recapitulate key features of PD in the human brain. In both PD patients and animal models, disease progression leads to characteristic changes in neural activity throughout the basal ganglia. Here we demonstrate that patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) hMOs harboring a triplication in the SNCA gene, encoding -synuclein, a key protein in PD pathogenesis, can recapitulate PD-associated changes in neural activity. Namely, we observe hyperactive network activity in SNCA triplication hMOs, but not in isogenic, CRISPR-corrected iPSC hMOs. These changes are characterized by an increase in the number of bursts and network-wide bursts. Moreover, SNCA triplication hMOs exhibit an increase in network synchrony and burst/network burst strength similar to observations in animal and human PD brains. Subsequently, we show that the observed changes in neuronal activity are attributed to dopamine D2 receptor hypoactivity due to dopamine depletion, which could be reversed by the D2 receptor agonist quinpirole. Thus, hMOs faithfully model network wide electrophysiological changes associated with PD progression and serve as a promising tool for PD research and personalized medicine.

                Background Co-infection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has an impact on high HBV replication and progression to liver cancer. These may lead to cross-resistance of drugs due to natural mutations or therapeutic pressure. These require continuous monitoring of HBV variants for better diagnosis and treatment strategies. Methods Convenience sampling was used to collect fifty archival sera from Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital. Sera were subjected to HBsAg screening using ELISA, DNA extraction, PCR amplification, Sanger sequencing, genotype prediction and mutation analysis. Results Of the 50 samples, 86% (N= 43/50) were HBsAg positive; 82% (N=41/50) PCR positive with 92% (N=38/41) sequenced and only 26 sequences were subjected to molecular characterization. The HBV sequences showed similarity to genotype A (73% [N=19/26]), genotypes G (5% [N=3/26]) and genotype c (15% [N=4/26]). Prevalence of the mutations in the surface region was (47% [N=18/38]); including diagnostic failure (K122R and T143S) and immune escape mutations (P127T, G145R, S207N, Y200T, E164D, Y206H and L209V). The mutations in the RT were at (36% [N=14/38]) with drug resistance mutations (DRM) at (50% [7/14]). Mutations showed resistance to lamivudine (LMV) at (35% [5/14]), telbivudine (LdT) at (29% [4/14]), (14% [2/14]) for entecavir (ETV) and (21% [3/14]) for adefovir (ADV). One sample had a combination of L180M, M204V, S202K, and M250I mutations. Conclusions Our findings highlight the prevalence of HBV genotype A in HIV-infected patients in South Africa. The study provides evidence of mutations linked to immune evasion and drug resistance; this infers that these mutations may have clinical implications for the diagnosis and treatment of HBV in HBV/HIV co-infected individuals. Further in vitro studies must be conducted to explore the impact of the identified mutation on the surface protein expression during diagnosis; phenotype impact of the mutant virus towards the antiviral drugs.

                <p>Tinnitus is the subjective perception of a sound without corresponding external acoustic stimuli. Research highlights the influence of the sensorimotor system on tinnitus perception. Associated neuronal processes, however, are insufficiently understood, and it remains unclear how and at which hierarchical level the sensorimotor system interacts with the tinnitus-processing auditory system. We therefore asked 23 patients suffering from chronic tinnitus (11 males) to perform specific exercises, aimed at relaxing or tensing the jaw area, which temporarily modulated tinnitus perception. Associated neuronal processes were assessed using magnetencephalography. Results show that chronic tinnitus patients experienced their tinnitus as weaker and less annoying after completion of relaxing compared with tensing exercises. Furthermore, (1) sensorimotor alpha power and alpha-band connectivity directed from the somatosensory to the auditory cortex increased and (2) gamma power in the auditory cortex reduced, which (3) related to reduced tinnitus annoyance perception on a trial-by-trial basis in the relaxed state. No effects were revealed for 23 control participants without tinnitus (six males) performing the same experiment. We conclude that the increase in directed alpha-band connectivity from the somatosensory to the auditory cortex most likely reflects the transmission of inhibition from the somatosensory to the auditory cortex during relaxation, where concurrently tinnitus-related gamma power reduces. We suggest that revealed neuronal processes are transferable to other tinnitus-modulating systems beyond the sensorimotor one that is involved in attentional or emotional tinnitus modulation and provides deeper mechanistic insights into how and through which channels phantom sound perception might be modulated on a neuronal level.</p>

                <p>Perception, working memory, and long-term memory each evoke neural responses in the visual cortex. While previous neuroimaging research on the role of the visual cortex in memory has largely emphasized similarities between perception and memory, we hypothesized that responses in the visual cortex would differ depending on the origins of the inputs. Using fMRI, we quantified spatial tuning in the visual cortex while participants (both sexes) viewed, maintained in working memory, or retrieved from long-term memory a peripheral target. In each condition, BOLD responses were spatially tuned and aligned with the target's polar angle in all measured visual field maps including V1. As expected given the increasing sizes of receptive fields, polar angle tuning during perception increased in width up the visual hierarchy from V1 to V2, V3, hV4, and beyond. In stark contrast, the tuned responses were broad across the visual hierarchy during long-term memory (replicating a prior result) and during working memory. This pattern is consistent with the idea that mnemonic responses in V1 stem from top-down sources, even when the stimulus was recently viewed and is held in working memory. Moreover, in long-term memory, trial-to-trial biases in these tuned responses (clockwise or counterclockwise of target) predicted matched biases in memory, suggesting that the reinstated cortical responses influence memory-guided behavior. We conclude that feedback widens spatial tuning in the visual cortex during memory, where earlier visual maps inherit broader tuning from later maps thereby impacting the precision of memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/17/e0802242025?rss=1">Association of Bidirectional Network Cores in the Brain with Perceptual Awareness and Cognition</a></h4>

              
                <p>The brain comprises a complex network of interacting regions. To understand the roles and mechanisms of this intricate network, it is crucial to elucidate its structural features related to cognitive functions. Recent empirical evidence suggests that both feedforward and feedback signals are necessary for conscious perception, emphasizing the importance of subnetworks with bidirectional interactions. However, the link between such subnetworks and conscious perception remains unclear due to the complexity of brain networks. In this study, we propose a framework for extracting subnetworks with strong bidirectional interactions&mdash;termed the "cores" of a network&mdash;from brain activity. We applied this framework to resting-state and task-based human fMRI data from participants of both sexes to identify regions forming strongly bidirectional cores. We then explored the association of these cores with conscious perception and cognitive functions. We found that the extracted central cores predominantly included cerebral cortical regions rather than subcortical regions. Additionally, regarding their relation to conscious perception, we demonstrated that the cores tend to include regions previously reported to be affected by electrical stimulation that altered conscious perception, although the results are not statistically robust due to the small sample size. Furthermore, in relation to cognitive functions, based on a meta-analysis and comparison of the core structure with a cortical functional connectivity gradient, we found that the central cores were related to unimodal sensorimotor functions. The proposed framework provides novel insights into the roles of network cores with strong bidirectional interactions in conscious perception and unimodal sensorimotor functions.</p>

                <p>RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are important for posttranscriptional RNA processing, including pre-mRNA alternative splicing, mRNA stability, and translation. Several RBPs have been shown to play pivotal roles in the inner ear, whose dysfunction leads to auditory and/or balance impairments. Epithelial splicing-regulatory protein 1 (ESRP1) regulates alternative splicing and mRNA stability, and mutations in <I>ESRP1</I> gene have been associated with sensorineural hearing loss in humans. In <I>Esrp1</I> knock-out mouse embryos, alternative splicing of its target genes such as <I>Fgfr2</I> is impaired, which eventually result in cochlear development deficits. However, <I>Esrp1</I> knock-out mice die soon after birth because of complications from cleft-lip and palate defects, impeding further investigations at later postnatal ages. In the present study, we explored the role of ESRP1 in hearing using zebrafish as a model. We showed that <I>esrp1</I> and its paralog <I>esrp2</I> are expressed in the inner ear and certain anterior lateral line (ALL) neuromasts. Furthermore, our data suggested that Esrp1 and Esrp2 are required for the mechano-electrical transduction (MET) function of hair cells. RNA sequencing results indicated a significant decrease in the levels of several mRNAs in <I>esrp1/2</I> double knock-out larvae. Among the dysregulated genes are <I>tmc1</I> and <I>tmc2a</I>, which encode essential subunits of the MET complex. Further investigations demonstrated that Esrp1/2 could directly bind to <I>tmc1</I> and <I>tmc2a</I> mRNAs and affect their stability. Taken together, we showed here that Esrp1 and Esrp2 regulate the MET function of zebrafish sensory hair cells by modulating the stability of <I>tmc1</I> and <I>tmc2a</I> mRNAs.</p>

                <p>Mastering the associations between letters and their corresponding speech sounds (LSS) is pivotal in the early stages of reading development, requiring an effective reorganization of brain networks. Children with poor reading skills often show difficulties in LSS learning. To date, however, it remains unclear how the interaction of brain regions integral to the processing and integration of letters and speech sounds changes with LSS learning. Characterizing these changes and potential differences between children with typical (TR) or poor (PR) reading skills on both behavioral and neural levels is essential for a more comprehensive mechanistic understanding of reading impairments. In this study, we investigated brain network alterations underlying LSS learning and their association with reading skills using functional magnetic resonance imaging in 80 schoolchildren (6.9&ndash;10.8&nbsp;years, 36 females, 27 PR) with a wide range of reading skills. We applied a reinforcement learning drift-diffusion model to LSS learning data and analyzed the corresponding effective connectivity and activation measures in the brain. While both groups learned well, PR showed slower adaptation of responses than TR as trials progressed. This could be explained by a slower adjustment of the drift rate and decision boundary while learning and longer nondecision times. Alongside deviant connectivity in the network of visual, auditory, and associative brain regions, PR also showed reduced striatal modulation of connectivity from visual to audiovisual association areas throughout learning. These findings indicate impaired information transfer to integrative areas, which aids to explain the difficulties in achieving proficient reading skills from a neuroscientific perspective.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/17/e1551242025?rss=1">Striatal Dopamine Represents Valence on Dynamic Regional Scales</a></h4>

              
                <p>Adaptive decision-making relies on flexible updating of learned associations where environmental cues come to predict valenced stimuli, such as food or threat. Cue-guided behavior depends on a network of brain systems, including dopaminergic projections to the striatum. Critically, it remains unclear how dopamine signaling across the striatum encodes multivalent, dynamic learning contexts, where positive and negative associations must be rapidly disambiguated. To understand this, we used a pavlovian discrimination paradigm, where cues predicting food or threat were intermingled during conditioning sessions and their meaning was serially reversed across training. We found that male and female rats readily distinguished these cues and updated their behavior rapidly upon valence reversal. Using fiber photometry, we recorded dopamine signaling in three major striatal subregions&mdash;the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core, and the NAc medial shell&mdash;finding that valence was represented uniquely across all three regions, indicative of local signals biased for value and salience. Furthermore, ambiguity introduced by cue reversals reshaped striatal dopamine on different timelines: NAc signals updated more readily than those in the DLS. Together, these results indicate that striatal dopamine flexibly encodes stimulus valence according to region-specific rules, and these signals are dynamically modulated by changing contingencies in the resolution of ambiguity about the meaning of environmental cues.</p>

                <p>Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are gadolinium chelates and can leave gadolinium in brain regions after administration, causing damage to brain tissues. However, the exact effects of gadolinium on synaptic function and the underlying mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. Here, we report that gadolinium differentially modulates evoked and spontaneous synaptic transmission and induces bidirectional changes in the efficacy of evoked synaptic transmission in the mouse hippocampus in a concentration-dependent manner. Low-concentration gadolinium (100&nbsp;&mu;M) modestly potentiated evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs), while high-concentration gadolinium induced group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-, endocannabinoid (eCB)-, and purinergic P2Y1 receptor (P2Y1R)-dependent, presynaptically expressed long-term depression (LTD). Higher concentration of gadolinium (1,000&nbsp;&mu;M) also induced NMDAR- and mGluR-independent, partially P2Y13R-dependent, postsynaptically expressed LTD. Low-concentration gadolinium greatly increased miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency, while high-concentration gadolinium much more robustly increased its frequency and amplitude. Finally, we found that evoked EPSCs were not affected by a macrocyclic GBCA, gadoterate meglumine (Gd-GOTA, Magnescope). However, evoked EPSCs were enhanced by a linear GBCA, gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA, Magnevist), at 100&nbsp;&mu;M, a clinically relevant concentration in the human brain after repeated clinical GBCA administration and in the cerebrospinal fluid in the rodent brain during experimental GBCA administration. Thus, evoked and spontaneous synaptic transmissions are independently modulated by gadolinium. Furthermore, Gd-GOTA effectively chelated gadolinium; however, Gd-DTPA had side effects on the evoked synaptic transmission, presumably because it did not completely chelate gadolinium.</p>

                <p>Interval timing, the ability of animals to estimate the passage of time, is thought to involve diverse neural processes rather than a single central "clock" (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B33">Paton and Buonomano, 2018</cross-ref>). Each of the different processes engaged in interval timing follows a different dynamic path, according to its specific function. For example, attention tracks anticipated events, such as offsets of intervals (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B39">Rohenkohl and Nobre, 2011</cross-ref>), while motor processes control the timing of the behavioral output (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B14">De Lafuente et al., 2024</cross-ref>). However, which processes are involved and how they are orchestrated over time to produce a temporal decision remains unknown. Here, we study motor preparation in the temporal bisection task, in which human (female and male) participants categorized intervals as "long" or "short." In contrast to typical perceptual decisions, where motor plans for all response alternatives are prepared simultaneously (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B41">Shadlen and Kiani, 2013</cross-ref>), we find that temporal bisection decisions develop sequentially. While preparation for "long" responses was already underway before interval offset, no preparation was found for "short" responses. Furthermore, within intervals categorized as "long," motor preparation was stronger at interval offset for faster responses. Our findings support the two-stage model of temporal decisions, where "long" decisions are considered during the interval itself, while "short" decisions are only considered after the interval is over. Viewed from a wider perspective, our study offers methods to study the neural mechanisms of temporal decisions, by studying the multiple processes that produce them.</p>

                <p>Methylphenidate (MP) is a widely used stimulant medication for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder that enhances brain dopamine signaling and improves attention. However, how dopamine stimulation alters brain state dynamics to support improved attention during task performance is still unclear. To address this, we employed a multimodal neuroimaging approach combining positron emission tomography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and behavioral tasks, to discover associations between dopamine signaling, brain dynamics, and cognition. Multimodal images were collected from 37 healthy adults under a single-blind, counterbalanced, placebo-controlled crossover study. Dynamic functional analysis was used to compare the alterations in dynamic features of brain states before and after MP. Subsequently, we analyzed the correlation between these brain state changes and baseline striatal D<SUB>1</SUB> and D<SUB>2</SUB> dopamine receptor (D<SUB>1</SUB>R, D<SUB>2</SUB>R) availability. We also examined alterations in dynamic brain states and their effects on visuospatial tasks. The results showed that MP primarily affected frontoparietal-dominant activated (FPN+), somatomotor-dominant activated (SOM+), and visual-dominant suppressed (VIS&ndash;) brain states. Specifically, the dwell time and fractional occupancy exhibited significant increases within the FPN+ and VIS&ndash; and an opposite trend within the SOM+. Furthermore, the increase of dwell time in FPN+, which was positively correlated with baseline striatal D<SUB>1</SUB>R availability, was also associated with quicker response in the 2-ball-track task, but not significantly for the 3-ball-track task. The findings suggest that MP's enhancement of brain states with FPN+ and VIS&ndash; while decreasing SOM+, in part through D<SUB>1</SUB>R signaling might underlie MP's improvement of attention for low demanding tasks in healthy populations.</p>

                <p>Navigating space and forming memories based on spatial experience are crucial for survival, including storing memories in an allocentric (map-like) framework and conversion into egocentric (body-centered) action. The hippocampus and parietal cortex (PC) comprise a network for coordinating these reference frames, though the mechanism remains unclear. We used a task requiring remembering previous spatial locations to make correct future action and observed that hippocampus can encode the allocentric place, while PC encodes upcoming actions and relays this to hippocampus. Transformation from location to action unfolds gradually, with "Came From" signals diminishing and future action representations strengthening. PC sometimes encodes previous spatial locations in a route-based reference frame and conveys this to hippocampus. The signal for the future location appears first in PC, and then in hippocampus, in the form of an egocentric direction of future goal locations, suggesting egocentric encoding recently observed in hippocampus may originate in PC (or another "upstream" structure). Bidirectional signaling is apparent between PC and hippocampus and suggests a coordinated mechanism for integrating allocentric, route-centered, and egocentric spatial reference frames at the network level during navigation.</p>

                <p>The motor system adapts its output in response to experienced errors to maintain effective movement in a dynamic environment. This learning is thought to utilize sensory prediction errors, the discrepancy between predicted and observed sensory feedback, to update internal models that map motor outputs to sensory states. However, it remains unclear what sensory information is relevant (e.g., the extent to which sensory predictions depend on visual feedback features). We explored this topic by measuring the transfer of visuomotor adaptation across two contexts where input movements created visual motion in opposite directions by either (1) translating a cursor across a static environment or (2) causing the environment to move toward a static cursor (272 participants: 94 male, 175 female). We hypothesized that this difference in visual feedback should engage distinct internal models, resulting in poor transfer of learning between contexts. Instead, we found nearly complete transfer of learning across contexts, with evidence that the motor memory was bound to the planned displacement of the hand rather than visual features of the task space. Our results suggest that internal model adaptation is not tied to the exact nature of the sensory feedback that results from movement. Instead, adaptation relies on representations of planned movements, allowing a common internal model to be employed across different visual contexts.</p>

                <p>Our brains are in a constant state of generating predictions, implicitly extracting environmental regularities to support later cognition and behavior, a process known as statistical learning (SL). While prior work investigating the neural basis of SL has focused on the activity of single brain regions in isolation, much less is known about how distributed brain areas coordinate their activity to support such learning. Using fMRI and a classic visual SL task, we investigated changes in whole-brain functional architecture as human female and male participants implicitly learned to associate pairs of images, and later, when predictions generated from learning were violated. By projecting individuals&rsquo; patterns of cortical and subcortical functional connectivity onto a low-dimensional manifold space, we found that SL was associated with changes along a single neural dimension describing covariance across the visual-parietal and perirhinal cortex (PRC). During learning, we found regions within the visual cortex expanded along this dimension, reflecting their decreased communication with other networks, whereas regions within the dorsal attention network (DAN) contracted, reflecting their increased connectivity with higher-order cortex. Notably, when SL was interrupted, we found the PRC and entorhinal cortex, which did not initially show learning-related effects, now contracted along this dimension, reflecting their increased connectivity with the default mode and DAN, and decreased covariance with visual cortex. While prior research has linked SL to either broad cortical or medial temporal lobe changes, our findings suggest an integrative view, whereby cortical regions reorganize during association formation, while medial temporal lobe regions respond to their violation.</p>

                <p>Human performance is endowed by neural representations of information that is relevant for behavior, some of which are also activated in a preparatory fashion to optimize later execution. Most studies to date have focused on highly practiced actions, leaving largely unaddressed the novel reconfiguration of information to generate unique whole task sets. Using electroencephalography, this study investigated the dynamics of the content and geometry reflected on the neural patterns of control representations during reconfiguration of information. We designed a verbal instruction paradigm where each trial involved novel combinations of multicomponent task information. By manipulating three task-relevant factors in a sample of 40 participants (26 females, 14 males), we observed complex coding schemes throughout the trial, during both preparation and implementation stages. The temporal profiles were consistent with a hierarchical structure: whereas task information was active in a sustained manner, the coding of more concrete stimulus features was more transient. Data showed both high dimensionality and abstraction, particularly during instruction encoding and target processing. Our results suggest that whenever task content could be recovered from neural patterns of activity, there was evidence of abstract coding, with an underlying geometry that favored generalization. During target processing, where potential interference across stimulus and response factors increased, orthogonal configurations also appeared. Overall, our findings uncover the dynamic manner with which control representations operate during novel recombination unique scenarios, with changes in dimensionality and abstraction adjusting along processing stages.</p>

                <p>The brain builds hierarchical phrases during language comprehension; however, the details and dynamics of the phrase-building process remain underspecified. This study directly probes whether the neural code of verb phrases involves reactivating the syntactic property of a key subcomponent (the "head" verb). To this end, we train a part-of-speech sliding&ndash;window verb/adverb decoder on EEG signals recorded while 30 participants read sentences in a controlled experiment. The decoder reaches above-chance performance that is spatiotemporally consistent and generalizes to unseen data across sentence positions. Applying the decoder to held-out data yields predicted activation levels for the verbal "head" of a verb phrase at a distant nonhead word (adverb); the critical adverb appeared either at the end of a verb phrase or at a sequentially and lexically matched position with no verb phrase boundary. There is stronger verb activation beginning at ~600&nbsp;milliseconds at the critical adverb when it appears at a verb phrase boundary; this effect is not modulated by the strength of conceptual association nor does it reflect word predictability. Time-locked analyses additionally reveal a negativity waveform component and increased beta-delta inter-trial phase coherence, both previously linked to linguistic composition, in a similar time window. With a novel application of neural decoding, our findings delineate the dynamics by which the brain encodes phrasal representations by, in part, reactivating the representation of key subcomponents. We thus establish a link between cognitive accounts of phrasal representations and electrophysiological dynamics.</p>

                <p>Compared to males, aggression is less frequently noticed in females. Fierce maternal-aggression to thwart the attack/threat of a male conspecific/intruder is transiently expressed as she defends her pups. The odor cues emanated by the intruder provoke aggressive behavior by robustly activating the ventral-premammillary nucleus (PMv) in the hypothalamic-attack area (HAA). But, how PMv activation triggers aggression is unclear. In view of neuropeptide cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART)'s potential to reconfigure neural circuits for behavioral demands, occurrence throughout aggression circuitry, and abundance particularly in PMv, we test the role of PMv<sup>CART</sup> in maternal and inter-male aggression in rats. Males/dams actively attacked the intruder; virgin females did not. The dams/males without intruder showed isolated c-Fos cells in PMv, but the intruder's presence triggered c-Fos-activation in different PMv-subdivisions in dams/males. Compared to dams without intruder, confrontation with intruder robustly activated PMv<sup>CART</sup>-neurons and augmented CART-ir in ventral-PMv and <I>cart</I>-mRNA in PMv-containing tissues in dams. Conversely, in males, the intruder's presence activated lateral-PMv<sup>CART</sup> neurons, but CART-levels remained unaltered. Intra-PMv CART-siRNA administration suppressed maternal-aggression, but male aggression was unaffected. Since PMv is strongly connected with the ventrolateral&ndash;ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) and medial preoptic nucleus (MPN), we test whether CART signaling to these nuclei triggers maternal aggression. While VMHvl showed stronger CARTergic-axonal input than MPN, immunoneutralization of CART in VMHvl, but not MPN, blocked maternal-aggression. CART may drive the circuit beyond HAA since VMHvl neurons contacted by CART-axons project to periaqueductal gray. We identify the engagement of vPMv and lPMv during maternal and inter-male aggression, respectively, and CART as a key mediator in the PMv&ndash;VMHvl pathway to express maternal-aggression in rats.  </p>

                <p>Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) will be key for effective personalized treatment plans (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B8">Cummings, 2023</cross-ref>). Significant difficulties in auditory processing have been frequently reported in many patients with mild cognitive impairment, the prodromal form of AD (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B59">Tarawneh et al., 2022</cross-ref>), making it an outstanding candidate as AD diagnostic biomarker. However, the efficiency of diagnosis with this parameter has not been explored. Here we show that when male mice with amyloidosis begin to show memory decline, changes in the auditory brainstem response (ABR) to clicks enable the reliable diagnosis of disease using a machine learning algorithm. Interpretation of the machine learning diagnosis revealed that the upper levels of the auditory pathway, including the inferior colliculus, were the probable sources of the defects. Histological analyses show that in these locations, neuroinflammation and plaque deposition temporally correlate with behavioral changes consistent with memory loss. While these findings are tempered by the caveat that they derive from amyloidosis mice, we propose that ABR measurements be evaluated as an additional rapid, low-cost, noninvasive biomarker to assist the diagnostic testing of early-stage AD.</p>

                <p>Synchronous activity of neuronal networks is found in many brain areas and correlates with cognition and behavior. Gamma synchrony is particularly strong in the dentate gyrus, which is thought to process contextual information in the hippocampus. Several network mechanisms for synchrony generation have been proposed and studied computationally. One such mechanism relies solely on recurrent inhibitory interneuron connectivity, but it requires a large enough number of synapses. Here, we incorporate previously published connectivity data of the dentate gyrus from mice of either sex into a biophysical computational model to test its ability to generate synchronous activity. We find that recurrent interneuron connectivity is insufficient to induce synchronous activity. This applies to an interneuron ring network and the broader dentate gyrus circuitry. Despite asynchronous input, recurrent interneuron connectivity can have small synchronizing effects but can also desynchronize the network for some types of synaptic input. Our results suggest that biologically plausible recurrent inhibitory connectivity alone is likely insufficient to synchronize the dentate gyrus.</p>

                Background Underwater gliders are widely used in marine applications for monitoring purposes. These gliders must withstand hydrodynamic forces and maintain its body stability. The underwater environments are highly unpredictable, and small changes in the environment can lead to significant instability in underwater vehicles. Methods This study uses different numerical techniques to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of a torpedo-shaped glider. A symmetric torpedo-shaped glider model was created and analyzed using a licensed version of ANSYS 20.1 Fluent tool. The behavior of the torpedo glider under various flow conditions was examined such as variation of grid test, change of turbulent models, the variation in the inflow boundary conditions involves varying the velocity from 10.16 m/s to 15.16 m/s in 1m/s increment and from 10.16 m/s to 7.66 m/s in 0.5 m/s, also six different models were analyzed. Results Research was also attempted with different turbulent models and the Spalart-Allmara model was producing least validation error of 1.28 % with a primary focus on nose optimization. By varying the nose length, the study aimed to identify the best-suited nose geometry to minimize drag force. The nose lengths were varied to 0.205 m and 0.19m, resulting in validation errors of 2.81% and 1.16%, respectively, the results are clearly explained in the sub sequent sections of this article. Conclusion In conclusion, this study has evaluated various modifications and their impact on drag force reduction. The application of Spallart-Allmara model resulted in an improvement of 1.28%. Decrease in velocity lead to a significant reduction in the drag force, with an improvement of 37.3%. The nose optimization also contributed to drag force; a nose length of 0.205m yielded a 3.37% improvement. While a 0.19m nose length resulted in a 1.67% reduction. This study helps researchers in hydrodynamics by optimizing geometry for drag reduction.

                Background In previous studies we have shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replicates in vitro in bacterial growth medium, that the viral replication follows bacterial growth, and it is influenced by the administration of specific antibiotics. These observations are compatible with a ‘bacteriophage-like’ behaviour of SARS-CoV-2. Methods We have further elaborated on these unusual findings and here we present the results of three different supplementary experiments: (1) an electron-microscope analysis of samples of bacteria obtained from a faecal sample of a subject positive to SARS-CoV-2; (2) mass spectrometric analysis of these cultures to assess the eventual de novo synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein; (3) sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 collected from plaques obtained from two different gut microbial bacteria inoculated with supernatant from faecal microbiota of an individual positive to SARS-CoV-2. Results Immuno-labelling with Anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein antibody confirmed presence of SARS-CoV-2 both outside and inside bacteria. De novo synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was observed, as evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNA is translated in the bacterial cultures. In addition, phage-like plaques were spotted on faecal bacteria cultures after inoculation with supernatant from faecal microbiota of an individual positive to SARS-CoV-2. Bioinformatic analyses on the reads obtained by sequencing RNA extracted from the plaques revealed nucleic acid polymorphisms, suggesting different replication environment in the two bacterial cultures. Conclusions Based on these results we conclude that, in addition to its well-documented interactions with eukaryotic cells, SARS-CoV-2 may act as a bacteriophage when interacting with at least two bacterial species known to be present in the human microbiota. If the hypothesis proposed, i.e., that under certain conditions SARS-CoV-2 may multiply at the expense of human gut bacteria, is further substantiated, it would drastically change the model of acting and infecting of SARS-CoV-2, and most likely that of other human pathogenic viruses.

                <p>by Yannick Jadoul, Taylor A. Hersh, Elias Fernández Domingos, Marco Gamba, Livio Favaro, Andrea Ravignani</p>

Animal acoustic communication contains many structural features. Among these, temporal structure, or rhythmicity, is increasingly tested empirically and modelled quantitatively. Accelerando is a rhythmic structure which consists of temporal intervals increasing in rate over a sequence. Why this particular vocal behaviour is widespread in many different animal lineages, and how it evolved, is so far unknown. Here, we use evolutionary game theory and computer simulations to link two rhythmic aspects of animal communication, synchronization and overlap: We test whether rhythmic accelerando could evolve under a pressure for acoustic overlap in time. Our models show that higher acceleration values result in a higher payoff, driven by the higher relative overlap between sequences. The addition of a cost to the payoff matrix models a physiological disadvantage to high acceleration rates and introduces a divergence between an individual’s incentive and the overall payoff of the population. Analysis of the invasion dynamics of acceleration strategies shows a stable, non-invadable range of strategies for moderate acceleration levels. Our computational simulations confirm these results: A simple selective pressure to maximise the expected overlap, while minimising the associated physiological cost, causes an initially isochronous population to evolve towards producing increasingly accelerating sequences until a population-wide equilibrium of rhythmic accelerando is reached. These results are robust to a broad range of parameter values. Overall, our analyses show that if overlap is beneficial, emergent evolutionary dynamics allow a population to gradually start producing accelerating sequences and reach a stable state of moderate acceleration. Finally, our modelling results closely match empirical data recorded from an avian species showing rhythmic accelerando, the African penguin. This shows the productive interplay between theoretical and empirical biology.

                <p>by Hanah Goetz, Rong Zhang, Xiao Wang, Xiao-Jun Tian</p>

Although the impact of resource competition on the deterministic behavior of synthetic gene circuits has been studied, its effects on gene expression noise remain obscure. In this work, we systematically analyze the role of resource competition in noise propagation within a genetic inhibition cascade circuit. We found that resource competition amplifies gene expression noise by introducing unexpected bistability and stochastic switching between the two stable states. This emergent bistability, driven by resource competition-mediated double negative feedback, allows one gene to dominate expression while suppressing the other in a “winner-takes-all” behavior. Our findings highlight the critical role of resource competition in shaping the noise dynamics and its propagation, underscoring the importance of considering these effects when designing and controlling synthetic circuits.

Stimulation of specific cell groups under different network regimes (e.g., spontaneous activity or sensory-evoked activity) can provide insights into the neural dynamics of cortical columns. While these protocols are challenging to perform experimentally, modelling can serve as a powerful tool for such explorations. Using detailed electrophysiological and anatomical data from mouse V1, we built a novel spiking network model of a cortical column, which incorporates pyramidal cells and three distinct interneuron types (PV, SST, and VIP cells, specified per lamina), as well as the dynamic and voltage-dependent properties of AMPA, GABA, and NMDA receptors. We first demonstrate that thalamocortical feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) stimuli arriving in the column have opposite effects, leading to net columnar excitation and inhibition respectively and revealing translaminar gain control via full-column inhibition by layer 6. We then perturb one cell group (i.e., a cell type in a specific layer) at a time and observe the effects on other cell groups under distinct network states: spontaneous, feedforward-driven, feedback-driven, and a combination of feedforward and feedback. Our findings reveal that when a given group is perturbed, the columnar response varies significantly based on its state, with strong sensory feedforward input decreasing columnar sensitivity to all perturbations and feedback input serving as modulator of intra columnar interactions. Given that activity changes within specific neuronal populations are difficult to predict a priori in experiments, our model may constitute a useful tool to predict outcomes of perturbations and assist in experimental design.

                <p>by Minghao Luo, Huihui Zhang, Fang Fang, Huan Luo</p>

Automatic shaping of perception by past experiences is common in many cognitive functions, reflecting the exploitation of temporal regularities in environments. A striking example is serial dependence, i.e., current perception is biased by previous trials. However, the neural implementation of its operational circle in human brains remains unclear. In two experiments with electroencephalography (EEG)/magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings and delayed-response tasks, we demonstrate a two-stage ‘repulsive-then-attractive’ past–present interaction mechanism underlying serial dependence. First, past-trial reports, instead of past stimuli, serve as a prior to be reactivated during both encoding and decision-making. Crucially, past reactivation interacts with current information processing in a two-stage manner: repelling and attracting the present during encoding and decision-making, and arising in the sensory cortex and prefrontal cortex, respectively. Finally, while the early stage occurs automatically, the late stage is modulated by task and predicts bias behavior. These findings might also illustrate general mechanisms of past–present influences in neural operations.

                <p>by Susanne S. Babl, Torfi Sigurdsson</p>

The hippocampus (HPC) supports spatial working memory (SWM) through its interactions with the prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, it is not clear whether and how the dorsal (dHPC) and ventral (vHPC) poles of the HPC make distinct contributions to SWM and whether they differentially influence the PFC. To address this question, we optogenetically silenced the dHPC or the vHPC while simultaneously recording from the PFC of mice performing a SWM task. We found that whereas both HPC subregions were necessary during the encoding phase of the task, only the dHPC was necessary during the choice phase. Unexpectedly, silencing of either subregion did not affect PFC neurons’ ability to represent the animal’s position, but did alter how it was represented. In contrast, only silencing of the vHPC affected their coding of spatial goals. These results thus reveal distinct contributions of the dorsal and ventral HPC poles to SWM and the coding of behaviorally relevant spatial information by PFC neurons.

                <p>by Benjamin Wetherall, David Bulmer, Alexandra Sarginson, Christopher Thomas, Suzanne Madgwick</p>

During meiosis I in oocytes, anaphase is triggered by deactivation of cyclin B1-CDK1 and activation of separase. Active separase plays an essential role in cleaving cohesin rings that hold homologous chromosomes together. Critically, separase must be inhibited until all chromosomes are aligned and the cell is prepared for anaphase I. Inhibition can be mediated through the binding of separase to either securin or cyclin B1-CDK1. The relative contribution of each inhibitory pathway varies depending on cell type. Recently, shugoshin-2 (SGO2) has also been shown to inhibit separase in mitotic cells. Here, we used a separase biosensor and perturbed the three inhibitory pathways during meiosis I in mouse oocytes. We show that inhibition mediated by either securin or cyclin B1-CDK1, but not SGO2, is independently sufficient to suppress separase activity. However, when both the securin and cyclin B1-CDK1 inhibitory pathways are perturbed together, separase activity begins prematurely, resulting in gross segregation defects. Furthermore, we characterized SGO2 destruction dynamics and concluded that it is not an essential separase inhibitor in mouse oocytes. The existence of multiple separase inhibitory pathways highlights the critical importance of tightly regulated separase activity during this unique and challenging cell division.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Vascular NOTCH3 protein ectodomain aggregation is a pathological hallmark of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), a monogenic small vessel disease typically caused by cysteine-altering variants in <i>NOTCH3</i>. Given their high population frequency, these <i>NOTCH3</i> variants are an important genetic contributor to stroke and vascular dementia worldwide. Disease severity in CADASIL is highly variable and is mainly determined by the position of the pathogenic <i>NOTCH3</i> variant in the NOTCH3 ectodomain. Here, we aimed to investigate the association between NOTCH3 aggregation load in skin vessels, cysteine-altering <i>NOTCH3</i> variants, and disease severity in a prospective cohort study of 212 patients with CADASIL with 39 distinct cysteine-altering <i>NOTCH3</i> variants.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>NOTCH3 aggregation load in skin vessels was determined by calculating the NOTCH3 score; the fraction of skin vessel wall area positive for NOTCH3 staining. Variant-specific NOTCH3 scores were calculated for variants present in 10 or more participants, by averaging the NOTCH3 scores of individuals with that distinct variant. The associations between the NOTCH3 score, <i>NOTCH3</i> variants, and neuroimaging and clinical outcomes were investigated using multivariable linear mixed models, Cox regression, and mediation analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The NOTCH3 score was significantly associated with lifetime stroke probability and small vessel disease neuroimaging outcomes, but not with age. Variant-specific NOTCH3 scores reflected differences in disease severity associated with distinct <i>NOTCH3</i> variants.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest that differences in NOTCH3 aggregation propensity underlie the differences in disease severity associated with <i>NOTCH3</i> cysteine-altering variants, and show that <i>NOTCH3</i>-variant specific NOTCH3 scores can contribute to improved individualized disease prediction in CADASIL.

                Background Social media has turned into an important way for ecofeminists to raise awareness, create supportive communities, and push for fairness in environmental matters. Women activists, influencers, and groups are using social media sites like Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube to bring attention to topics like climate change, sustainability, and the link between gender and environmental issues. Methods By taking Ecofeminism as a theory, the paper examines selected accounts from three different social media platforms viz, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube to explore how they reflect the theme of ecofeminism. Ecofeminism is a theory that highlights the connection between women and nature, advocating for their protection. Results Our findings establish that the principles of ecofeminist theory and the works of ecofeminists have moved beyond physical propagation and are now being actively disseminated on digital media platforms. Through various forms of media such as reels, videos, pictures, and animations, many social media accounts vividly demonstrate the close relationship between women and nature, the exploitation they face from patriarchal society and how they can be protected. Conclusion Since the people of the current age are highly engaged with social media, these platforms effectively communicate the concept of ecofeminism and its importance, motivating global audiences to treat, protect, and preserve both nature and women. This helps in creating an inclusive society and advancing a sustainable world, which is critical in today’s context of environmental degradation and social unrest. The paper contributes to the fields of ecofeminism, media studies, and the sustainable development goals established by the UN in 2015.

<p>Sell et al. report that a single amino acid change at glycine 350 to valine in mouse Cntnap1 disrupts protein function and compromises the paranodal domain organization and axo-glial junction formation, leading to neurological deficits, which are all rescued by neuronal expression of the wild-type <i>Cntnap1</i> gene. Our studies open opportunities for potential gene therapy for the <i>CNTNAP1</i>-associated neuropathologies.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p><i>CNTNAP1</i> encodes the contactin-associated protein 1 (Cntnap1) which localizes to the paranodal region in all myelinated axons and is essential for axonal domain organization and the propagation of action potentials. To date, close to 45 reported human <i>CNTNAP1</i> variants have been identified that are associated with dysregulation and disorganization of the axonal domains, resulting in various forms of congenital hypomyelinating neuropathies in children. Currently, no treatments are available for neuropathies caused by <i>CNTNAP1</i> variants, highlighting the importance of fully characterizing these mutations and their impact on Cntnap1 functions. To understand the importance of a novel human <i>CNTNAP1</i> likely pathogenic variant that changes glycine at position 349 to valine in a child who also carries a <i>CNTNAP1</i> truncation and displayed severe neurological deficits, we used <i>CRISPR/Cas9</i> methodology and introduced a single nucleotide substitution in the mouse <i>Cntnap1</i> gene, resulting in glycine at 350 to valine (<i>Cntnap1</i>
<sup>
   <i>G350V</i>
</sup>). Trans-allelic combination of <i>Cntnap1</i>
<sup>
   <i>G350V</i>
</sup> with a <i>Cntnap1</i> null allele (<i>Cntnap1</i>
<sup>
   <i>G350V/−</i>
</sup>) mimics human pathologies, recapitulating hypomyelination neuropathies <i>associated with CNTNAP1</i> mutations as well as loss of paranodal junctions and disorganization of axonal domains in myelinated axons. Expression of the wild type <i>Cntnap1</i> transgene in <i>Cntnap1</i>
<sup>
   <i>G350V/−</i>
</sup> mice rescued the mutant phenotypes and restored all neurological deficits. Our studies demonstrate that GGT (glycine) to GTT (valine) change in human <i>CNTNAP1</i> creates a recessive loss of function allele and lays the foundation for potential gene therapy studies aimed at treating <i>CNTNAP1</i>-associated hypomyelinating neuropathies in children.</p>
