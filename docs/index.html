In 2006, Ma et al. presented an elegant theory for how populations of neurons might represent uncertainty to perform Bayesian inference. Critically, according to this theory, neural variability is no longer a nuisance, but rather a vital part of how the brain encodes probability distributions and performs computations with them.

Large-scale efforts are underway to map the neuronal connectomes of various animal species. In 1986 White et al. reported the first complete reconstruction of the nervous system connectome of an animal. Largely through manual reconstruction of serial electron micrographs, the authors characterized the morphology of each of the 302 neurons of the adult nematode C. elegans, and mapped the chemical and electrical synapses that connect them. This wiring diagram has profoundly influenced behavioral neurobiology and network science, and it continues to offer a guide for the impact of connectomics on neurobiology.

In a 2016 paper, Huth and colleagues probed, in a general way, how word meanings map onto cortical locations. By comparing the fit between alternative maps, this methodology offered a means to evaluate what sorts of meaning representations the brain handles under ecologically realistic conditions.

To better understand fundamental limits of this cohesion, we study the epithelium mechanics of an ultrathin (∼25 μm) primitive marine animal Trichoplax adhaerens,...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/VHdlf4kLAfk" width="1" />

<p>Graphene has the potential to make a very significant impact on society, with
important applications in the biomedical field. The possibility to engineer
graphene-based medical devices at the neuronal interface is of particular
interest, making it imperative to determine the biocompatibility of graphene
materials with neuronal cells. Here we conducted a comprehensive analysis of
the effects of chronic and acute exposure of rat primary cortical neurons to
few-layers pristine graphene (GR) and monolayer graphene oxide (GO) flakes. By
combining a range of cell biology, microscopy, electrophysiology and omics
approaches we characterized the graphene neuron interaction from the first
steps of membrane contact and internalization to the long-term effects on cell
viability, synaptic transmission and cell metabolism. GR/GO flakes are found in
contact with the neuronal membrane, free in the cytoplasm and internalized
through the endolysosomal pathway, with no significant impact on neuron
viability. However, GO exposure selectively caused the inhibition of excitatory
transmission, paralleled by a reduction in the number of excitatory synaptic
contacts, and a concomitant enhancement of the inhibitory activity. This was
accompanied by induction of autophagy, altered Ca2+ dynamics and by a
downregulation of some of the main players in the regulation of Ca2+
homeostasis in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Our results show that,
although graphene exposure does not impact on neuron viability, it does
nevertheless have important effects on neuronal transmission and network
functionality, thus warranting caution when planning to employ this material
for neuro-biological applications.

<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental syndrome.
Early diagnosis and precise treatment are essential for ASD patients. Although
researchers have built many analytical models, there has been limited progress
in accurate predictive models for early diagnosis. In this project, we aim to
build an accurate model to predict treatment outcome and ASD severity from
early stage functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans. The difficulty
in building large databases of patients who have received specific treatments
and the high dimensionality of medical image analysis problems are challenges
in this work. We propose a generic and accurate two-level approach for
high-dimensional regression problems in medical image analysis. First, we
perform region-level feature selection using a predefined brain parcellation.
Based on the assumption that voxels within one region in the brain have similar
values, for each region we use the bootstrapped mean of voxels within it as a
feature. In this way, the dimension of data is reduced from number of voxels to
number of regions. Then we detect predictive regions by various feature
selection methods. Second, we extract voxels within selected regions, and
perform voxel-level feature selection. To use this model in both linear and
non-linear cases with limited training examples, we apply two-level elastic net
regression and random forest (RF) models respectively. To validate accuracy and
robustness of this approach, we perform experiments on both task-fMRI and
resting state fMRI datasets. Furthermore, we visualize the influence of each
region, and show that the results match well with other findings.

<p>Various neurophysiological and cognitive functions are based on transferring
information between spiking neurons via a complex system of synaptic
connections. In particular, the capacity of presynaptic inputs to influence the
postsynaptic outputs---the efficacy of the synapses---plays a principal role in
all aspects of hippocampal neurophysiology. However, a direct link between the
information processed at the level of individual synapses and the animal's
ability to form memories at the organismal level has not yet been fully
understood. Here, we investigate the effect of synaptic transmission
probabilities on the ability of the hippocampal place cell ensembles to produce
a cognitive map of the environment. Using methods from algebraic topology, we
find that weakening synaptic connections increase spatial learning times,
produce topological defects in the large-scale representation of the ambient
space and restrict the range of parameters for which place cell ensembles are
capable of producing a map with correct topological structure. On the other
hand, the results indicate a possibility of compensatory phenomena, namely that
spatial learning deficiencies may be mitigated through enhancement of neuronal
activity.

<p>Automated segmentation of brain tumors from 3D magnetic resonance images
(MRIs) is necessary for the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment planning of
the disease. Manual delineation practices require anatomical knowledge, are
expensive, time consuming and can be inaccurate due to human error. Here, we
describe a semantic segmentation network for tumor subregion segmentation from
3D MRIs based on encoder-decoder architecture. Due to a limited training
dataset size, a variational auto-encoder branch is added to reconstruct the
input image itself in order to regularize the shared decoder and impose
additional constraints on its layers. The current approach won 1st place in the
BraTS 2018 challenge.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11594">Convolutional neural networks with extra-classical receptive fields. (arXiv:1810.11594v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have had great success in many
real-world applications and have also been used to model visual processing in
the brain. However, these networks are quite brittle - small changes in the
input image can dramatically change a network's output prediction. In contrast
to what is known from biology, these networks largely rely on feedforward
connections, ignoring the influence of recurrent connections. They also focus
on supervised rather than unsupervised learning. To address these issues, we
combine traditional supervised learning via backpropagation with a specialized
unsupervised learning rule to learn lateral connections between neurons within
a convolutional neural network. These connections have been shown to optimally
integrate information from the surround, generating extra-classical receptive
fields for the neurons in our new proposed model (CNNEx). Models with optimal
lateral connections are more robust to noise and achieve better performance on
noisy versions of the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Resistance to noise can be
further improved by combining our model with additional regularization
techniques such as dropout and weight decay. Although the image statistics of
MNIST and CIFAR-10 differ greatly, the same unsupervised learning rule
generalized to both datasets. Our results demonstrate the potential usefulness
of combining supervised and unsupervised learning techniques and suggest that
the integration of lateral connections into convolutional neural networks is an
important area of future research.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40630">Physiological constraint on acrobatic courtship behavior underlies rapid sympatric speciation in bearded manakins</a></h4>

Physiology’s role in speciation is poorly understood. Motor systems, for example, are widely thought to shape this process because they can potentiate or constrain the evolution of key traits that help mediate speciation. Previously, we found that Neotropical manakin birds have evolved one of the fastest limb muscles on record to support innovations in acrobatic courtship display (Fuxjager et al., 2016a). Here, we show how this modification played an instrumental role in the sympatric speciation of a manakin genus, illustrating that muscle specializations fostered divergence in courtship display speed, which may generate assortative mating. However, innovations in contraction-relaxation cycling kinetics that underlie rapid muscle performance are also punctuated by a severe speed-endurance trade-off, blocking further exaggeration of display speed. Sexual selection therefore potentiated phenotypic displacement in a trait critical to mate choice, all during an extraordinarily fast species radiation—and in doing so, pushed muscle performance to a new boundary altogether.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40048">Reversal of ApoE4 induced recycling block as a novel prevention approach for Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

ApoE4 genotype is the most prevalent and also clinically most important risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Available evidence suggests that the root cause for this increased risk is a trafficking defect at the level of the early endosome. ApoE4 differs from the most common ApoE3 isoform by a single amino acid that increases its isoelectric point and promotes unfolding of ApoE4 upon endosomal vesicle acidification. We found that pharmacological and genetic inhibition of NHE6, the primary proton leak channel in the early endosome, in rodents completely reverses the ApoE4 induced recycling block of the ApoE receptor Apoer2/Lrp8 and the AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamate receptors that are regulated by and co-endocytosed in a complex with Apoer2. Moreover, NHE6 inhibition restores the Reelin-mediated modulation of excitatory synapses that is impaired by ApoE4. Our findings suggest a novel potential approach for the prevention of late-onset AD.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39945">Dopamine neurons projecting to medial shell of the nucleus accumbens drive heroin reinforcement</a></h4>

The dopamine (DA) hypothesis posits the increase of mesolimbic dopamine levels as a defining commonality of addictive drugs, initially causing reinforcement, eventually leading to compulsive consumption. While much experimental evidence from psychostimulants supports this hypothesis, it has been challenged for opioid reinforcement. Here, we monitor genetically encoded DA and calcium indicators as well as cFos in mice to reveal that heroin activates DA neurons located in the medial part of the VTA, preferentially projecting to the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations of VTA DA or GABA neurons establish a causal link to heroin reinforcement. Inhibition of DA neurons blocked heroin self-administration, while heroin inhibited optogenetic self-stimulation of DA neurons. Likewise, heroin occluded the self-inhibition of VTA GABA neurons. Together, these experiments support a model of disinhibition of a subset of VTA DA neurons in opioid reinforcement.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39427">Ryanodine receptor dispersion disrupts Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in failing cardiac myocytes</a></h4>

Reduced cardiac contractility during heart failure (HF) is linked to impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from Ryanodine Receptors (RyRs). We investigated whether this deficit can be traced to nanoscale RyR reorganization. Using super-resolution imaging, we observed dispersion of RyR clusters in cardiomyocytes from post-infarction HF rats, resulting in more numerous, smaller clusters. Functional groupings of RyR clusters which produce Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks (Ca<sup>2+</sup> release units, CRUs) also became less solid. An increased fraction of small CRUs in HF was linked to augmented 'silent' Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak, not visible as sparks. Larger multi-cluster CRUs common in HF also exhibited low fidelity spark generation. When successfully triggered, sparks in failing cells displayed slow kinetics as Ca<sup>2+</sup> spread across dispersed CRUs. During the action potential, these slow sparks protracted and desynchronized the overall Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient. Thus, nanoscale RyR reorganization during HF augments Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak and slows Ca<sup>2+</sup> release kinetics, leading to weakened contraction in this disease.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39381">Zygotic gene activation in the chicken occurs in two waves, the first involving only maternally derived genes</a></h4>

The first-wave of transcriptional activation occurs after fertilisation in species-specific patterns. Despite its importance to initial embryonic development, the characteristics of transcription following fertilisation are poorly understood in Aves. Herein, we report detailed insights into the onset of genome activation in chickens. We established that two waves of transcriptional activation occurred after fertilisation and at Eyal-Giladi and Kochav Stage V. We found 1,544 single-nucleotide polymorphisms across 424 transcripts derived from parents in offspring during the early embryonic stages. Surprisingly, only the maternal genome was activated in the zygote, and the paternal genome remained silent until the second-wave, regardless of the presence of a paternal pronucleus or supernumerary sperm in the egg. The identified maternal genes involved in cleavage were replaced by bi-allelic expression. The results demonstrate that only maternal alleles are activated in the chicken zygote upon fertilisation, which could be essential for early embryogenesis and evolutionary outcomes in birds.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38200">Compensatory evolution drives multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Central Asia</a></h4>

Bacterial factors favoring the unprecedented multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) epidemic in the former Soviet Union remain unclear. We utilized whole genome sequencing and Bayesian statistics to analyze the evolutionary history, temporal emergence of resistance and transmission networks of MDR <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> complex isolates from Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan (2001–2006). One clade (termed Central Asian outbreak, CAO) dating back to 1974 (95% HPD 1969–1982) subsequently acquired resistance mediating mutations to eight anti-TB drugs. Introduction of standardized WHO-endorsed directly observed treatment, short-course in Karakalpakstan in 1998 likely selected for CAO-strains, comprising 75% of sampled MDR-TB isolates in 2005/2006. CAO-isolates were also identified in a published cohort from Russia (2008–2010). Similarly, the presence of mutations supposed to compensate bacterial fitness deficits was associated with transmission success and higher drug resistance rates. The genetic make-up of these MDR-strains threatens the success of both empirical and standardized MDR-TB therapies, including the newly WHO-endorsed short MDR-TB regimen in Uzbekistan.

Locomotion of tetrapods on land adapted to different environments and needs resulting in a variety of different gait styles. However comparative analyses reveal common principles of limb movement control. Here we report that a kinematic synergy involving the planar covariation of limb segment motion holds in 54 different animal species (10 birds and 44 mammals), despite large differences in body size, mass (ranging from 30 g to 4 tonnes), limb configuration, and amplitude of movements. This kinematic synergy lies at the interface between the neural command signals output by locomotor pattern generators, the mechanics of the body center of mass and the external environment, and it may represent one neuromechanical principle conserved in evolution to save mechanical energy.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37912">An NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent novel transcription factor controls stage conversion in <i>Entamoeba</i></a></h4>

Developmental switching between life-cycle stages is a common feature among parasitic pathogens to facilitate disease transmission and pathogenesis. The protozoan parasite <i>Entamoeba</i> switches between invasive trophozoites and dormant cysts, but the encystation process remains poorly understood despite being central to amoebic biology. We identify a transcription factor, Encystation Regulatory Motif-Binding Protein (ERM-BP), that regulates encystation. Down-regulation of ERM-BP decreases encystation efficiency resulting in abnormal cysts with defective cyst walls. We demonstrate that direct binding of NAD<sup>+</sup> to ERM-BP affects ERM-BP conformation and facilitates its binding to promoter DNA. Additionally, cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> levels increase during encystation and exogenous NAD<sup>+</sup> enhances encystation consistent with the role of carbon source depletion in triggering <i>Entamoeba</i> encystation. Furthermore, ERM-BP catalyzes conversion of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, which might have second messenger effects on stage conversion. Our findings link the metabolic cofactors nicotinamide and NAD<sup>+</sup> to transcriptional regulation via ERM-BP and provide the first mechanistic insights into <i>Entamoeba</i> encystation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37701">The subiculum is a patchwork of discrete subregions</a></h4>

In the hippocampus, the classical pyramidal cell type of the subiculum acts as a primary output, conveying hippocampal signals to a diverse suite of downstream regions. Accumulating evidence suggests that the subiculum pyramidal cell population may actually be comprised of discrete subclasses. Here, we investigated the extent and organizational principles governing pyramidal cell heterogeneity throughout the mouse subiculum. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we find that the subiculum pyramidal cell population can be deconstructed into eight separable subclasses. These subclasses were mapped onto abutting spatial domains, ultimately producing a complex laminar and columnar organization with heterogeneity across classical dorsal-ventral, proximal-distal, and superficial-deep axes. We further show that these transcriptomically defined subclasses correspond to differential protein products and can be associated with specific projection targets. This work deconstructs the complex landscape of subiculum pyramidal cells into spatially segregated subclasses that may be observed, controlled, and interpreted in future experiments.

The colon hosts gut microbes and glucagon-like peptide 1 secreting cells, both of which influence glucose homeostasis. We tested whether colectomy is associated with development of type 2 diabetes. Using nationwide register data, we identified patients who had undergone total colectomy, partial colectomy, or proctectomy. For each colectomy patient, we selected 15 non-colectomy patients who had undergone other surgeries. Compared with non-colectomy patients, patients with total colectomy (n = 3,793) had a hazard ratio (HR) of clinically recorded type 2 diabetes of 1.40 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21 to 1.62; p&lt;0.001). Corresponding HRs after right hemicolectomy (n = 10,989), left hemicolectomy (n = 2,513), and sigmoidectomy (n = 13,927) were 1.08 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.19; p=0.10), 1.41 (95% CI, 1.19 to 1.67; p&lt;0.001) and 1.30 (95% CI, 1.21 to 1.40; p&lt;0.001), respectively. Although we were not able to adjust for several potential confounders, our findings suggest that the left colon may contribute to maintenance of glucose homeostasis.

Presynaptic neuronal activity requires the localization of thousands of proteins that are typically synthesized in the soma and transported to nerve terminals. Local translation for some dendritic proteins occurs, but local translation in mammalian presynaptic nerve terminals is difficult to demonstrate. Here, we show an essential ribosomal component, 5.8S rRNA, at a glutamatergic nerve terminal in the mammalian brain. We also show active translation in nerve terminals, in situ, in brain slices demonstrating ongoing presynaptic protein synthesis in the mammalian brain. Shortly after inhibiting translation, the presynaptic terminal exhibits increased spontaneous release, an increased paired pulse ratio, an increased vesicle replenishment rate during stimulation trains, and a reduced initial probability of release. The rise and decay rates of postsynaptic responses were not affected. We conclude that ongoing protein synthesis can limit excessive vesicle release which reduces the vesicle replenishment rate, thus conserving the energy required for maintaining synaptic transmission.

The phylogenetic placement of the morphologically simple placozoans is crucial to understanding the evolution of complex animal traits. Here, we examine the influence of adding new genomes from placozoans to a large dataset designed to study the deepest splits in the animal phylogeny. Using site-heterogeneous substitution models, we show that it is possible to obtain strong support, in both amino acid and reduced-alphabet matrices, for either a sister-group relationship between Cnidaria and Placozoa, or for Cnidaria and Bilateria as seen in most published work to date, depending on the orthologues selected to construct the matrix. We demonstrate that a majority of genes show evidence of compositional heterogeneity, and that support for the Cnidaria+Bilateria clade can be assigned to this source of systematic error. In interpreting these results, we caution against a peremptory reading of placozoans as secondarily reduced forms of little relevance to broader discussions of early animal evolution.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36275">Real-time classification of experience-related ensemble spiking patterns for closed-loop applications</a></h4>

Communication in neural circuits across the cortex is thought to be mediated by spontaneous temporally organized patterns of population activity lasting ~50 –200 ms. Closed-loop manipulations have the unique power to reveal direct and causal links between such patterns and their contribution to cognition. Current brain–computer interfaces, however, are not designed to interpret multi-neuronal spiking patterns at the millisecond timescale. To bridge this gap, we developed a system for classifying ensemble patterns in a closed-loop setting and demonstrated its application in the online identification of hippocampal neuronal replay sequences in the rat. Our system decodes multi-neuronal patterns at 10 ms resolution, identifies within 50 ms experience-related patterns with over 70% sensitivity and specificity, and classifies their content with 95% accuracy. This technology scales to high-count electrode arrays and will help to shed new light on the contribution of internally generated neural activity to coordinated neural assembly interactions and cognition.

In temperate climates, winter deaths exceed summer ones. However, there is limited information on the timing and the relative magnitudes of maximum and minimum mortality, by local climate, age group, sex and medical cause of death. We used geo-coded mortality data and wavelets to analyse the seasonality of mortality by age group and sex from 1980 to 2016 in the USA and its subnational climatic regions. Death rates in men and women ≥ 45 years peaked in December to February and were lowest in June to August, driven by cardiorespiratory diseases and injuries. In these ages, percent difference in death rates between peak and minimum months did not vary across climate regions, nor changed from 1980 to 2016. Under five years, seasonality of all-cause mortality largely disappeared after the 1990s. In adolescents and young adults, especially in males, death rates peaked in June/July and were lowest in December/January, driven by injury deaths.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/34878">Organisms with alternative genetic codes resolve unassigned codons via mistranslation and ribosomal rescue</a></h4>

Organisms possessing genetic codes with unassigned codons raise the question of how cellular machinery resolves such codons and how this could impact horizontal gene transfer. Here, we use a genomically recoded <i>Escherichia coli</i> to examine how organisms address translation at unassigned UAG codons, which obstruct propagation of UAG-containing viruses and plasmids. Using mass spectrometry, we show that recoded organisms resolve translation at unassigned UAG codons via near-cognate suppression, dramatic frameshifting from at least −3 to +19 nucleotides, and rescue by <i>ssrA</i>-encoded tmRNA, ArfA, and ArfB. We then demonstrate that deleting tmRNA restores expression of UAG-ending proteins and propagation of UAG-containing viruses and plasmids in the recoded strain, indicating that tmRNA rescue and nascent peptide degradation is the cause of impaired virus and plasmid propagation. The ubiquity of tmRNA homologs suggests that genomic recoding is a promising path for impairing horizontal gene transfer and conferring genetic isolation in diverse organisms.

Extraembryonic tissues contribute to animal development, which often entails spreading over embryo or yolk. Apart from changes in cell shape, the requirements for this tissue spreading are not well understood. Here we analyze spreading of the extraembryonic serosa in the scuttle fly <i>Megaselia</i> <i>abdita</i>. The serosa forms from a columnar blastoderm anlage, becomes a squamous epithelium, and eventually spreads over the embryo proper. We describe the dynamics of this process in long-term, whole-embryo time-lapse recordings, demonstrating that free serosa spreading is preceded by a prolonged pause in tissue expansion. Closer examination of this pause reveals mechanical coupling to the underlying yolk sac, which is later released. We find mechanical coupling prolonged and serosa spreading impaired after knockdown of <i>M. abdita</i> <i>Matrix</i> <i>metalloprotease</i><i> 1</i>. We conclude that tissue-tissue interactions provide a critical functional element to constrain spreading epithelia.

Protein signaling networks are static views of dynamic processes where proteins go through many biochemical modifications such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation to propagate signals that regulate cells and can act as feed-back systems. Understanding the precise mechanisms underlying protein interactions can elucidate how signaling and cell cycle progression occur within cells in different diseases such as cancer. Large-scale protein signaling networks contain an important number of experimentally verified protein relations but lack the capability to predict the outcomes of the system, and therefore to be trained with respect to experimental measurements. Boolean Networks (BNs) are a simple yet powerful framework to study and model the dynamics of the protein signaling networks. While many BN approaches exist to model biological systems, they focus mainly on system properties, and few exist to integrate experimental data in them. In this work, we show an application of a method conceived to integrate time series phosphoproteomic data into protein signaling networks. We use a large-scale real case study from the HPN-DREAM Breast Cancer challenge. Our efficient and parameter-free method combines logic programming and model-checking to infer a family of BNs from multiple perturbation time series data of four breast cancer cell lines given a prior protein signaling network. Because each predicted BN family is cell line specific, our method highlights commonalities and discrepancies between the four cell lines. Our models have a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.31 with respect to the testing data, while the best performant method of this HPN-DREAM challenge had a RMSE of 0.47. To further validate our results, BNs are compared with the canonical mTOR pathway showing a comparable AUROC score (0.77) to the top performing HPN-DREAM teams. In addition, our approach can also be used as a complementary method to identify erroneous experiments. These results prove our methodology as an efficient dynamic model discovery method in multiple perturbation time course experimental data of large-scale signaling networks.

Abstract<p>GABAergic cells constitute 20-40% of the cells that project from the inferior colliculus (IC, a midbrain auditory hub) to the medial geniculate body (MG, the main auditory nucleus of the thalamus). Four subtypes of GABAergic IC cells have been identified based on their association with perineuronal nets (PNs) and dense rings of axosomatic terminals expressing vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2 rings). These subtypes differ in their soma size and distribution within the IC. Based on previous work emphasizing large GABAergic cells as the origin of GABAergic IC-MG projections, we hypothesized that GABAergic IC cells surrounded by PNs and VGLUT2 rings, which tend to have larger somas, were more likely to project to the MG than smaller cells lacking these extracellular markers. Here, we injected retrograde tract tracers into the MG of guinea pigs of either sex and analyzed retrogradely labeled GABAergic cells in the ipsilateral IC for soma size and association with PNs and/or VGLUT2 rings. We found a range of GABAergic soma sizes present within the IC-MG pathway, which were reflective of the full range of GABAergic soma sizes present within the IC. Further, we found that all four subtypes of GABAergic IC cells participate in the IC-MG pathway, and that GABAergic cells lacking PNs and VGLUT2 rings were more prevalent within the pathway than would be expected based on their overall prevalence in the IC. These results may provide an anatomical substrate for the multiple roles of inhibition in the IC-MG pathway which have emerged in electrophysiological studies.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> GABAergic cells constitute a substantial proportion (20-40%) of the cells that project from the inferior colliculus to the auditory thalamus. Previous studies highlight a single subtype of GABAergic colliculothalamic cell characterized by a large soma and dense perisomatic input from glutamatergic boutons. In response to a sound, these cells could provide an inhibitory signal to the thalamus that precedes excitation. Here, we demonstrate that colliculothalamic projections arise from four GABAergic cell subtypes. The predominant subtype has a small soma, suggesting slower inhibition that presumably overlaps the arrival of excitatory inputs to the thalamus. The results suggest extensive opportunity for temporal integration of inhibitory and excitatory inputs, and a wider diversity of functions than previously suggested for inhibitory colliculothalamic projections.</p>

Abstract<p>GABA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compact (SNc) play key roles in reward and aversion through their local inhibitory control of dopamine neuron activity and through long-range projections to several target regions including the nucleus accumbens. It is not clear if some of these GABA neurons are dedicated local interneurons or if they all collateralize and send projections externally as well as making local synaptic connections. Testing between these possibilities has been challenging in the absence of interneuron-specific molecular markers. We hypothesised that one potential candidate might be neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), a common interneuronal marker in other brain regions. To test this, we used a combination of immunolabelling (including antibodies for nNOS that we validated in tissue from nNOS-deficient mice) and cell-type-specific virus-based anterograde tracing in mice. We found that nNOS-expressing neurons, in the parabrachial pigmented (PBP) part of the VTA and the SNc were GABAergic and did not make detectable projections, suggesting they may be interneurons. In contrast, nNOS-expressing neurons in the Rostral Linear Nucleus (RLi) were mostly glutamatergic and projected to a number of regions, including the lateral hypothalamus, the ventral pallidum, and the median raphe nucleus. Taken together, these findings indicate that nNOS is expressed by neurochemically- and anatomically-distinct neuronal sub-groups in a sub-region-specific manner in the VTA and SNc.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> GABA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) play important roles in reward and aversion through their local control of dopamine neuron activity and long-range projections to regions such as the nucleus accumbens.

Abstract<p>CD137L (4-1BBL) is a co-stimulatory molecule whose signaling can promote monocyte/macrophage functions; however, CD137L-mediated microglial response and its role in neuropathic pain remain unknown. We investigated CD137L following peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain using a spinal nerve L5 transection (L5Tx) murine model in both sexes. First, C57BL/6_CD137L knockout (KO) mice displayed decreased mechanical and diminished heat hypersensitivity compared to wild type (WT) controls, beginning on day 3 to up to day 35 post-L5Tx. Purified anti-mouse CD137L neutralizing monoclonal antibody (0.1 or 0.5 µg) was also used to identify CD137L’s window of action in BALB/c mice. Anti-CD137L antibody was intrathecally administered either from day 0 (before surgery) to day 7 (early treatment), or from day 6 to 13 post-L5Tx (late treatment), and nociceptive thresholds were assessed before surgery to up to day 35 post-surgery. Early treatment with anti-CD137L reduced L5Tx-induced mechanical but not heat hypersensitivity, while later treatment did not alter either sensitivity. Pro- vs. anti-inflammatory responses within the lumbar spinal cord following L5Tx were further evaluated via <i>quantitative real-time</i> PCR and immunohistochemistry in time-course studies. Following L5Tx, female CD137L KO mice did not show increased iNOS mRNA and had reduced numbers of IL-1β<sup>+</sup> cells compared to WT. At 21 days post-surgery, CD137L KO mice had higher total numbers of arginase-1<sup>+</sup> cells and arginase-1<sup>+</sup> microglia. Altogether, results indicate that spinal cord CD137L contributes to the development of peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain, which may be in part mediated through CD137L’s modulation of the pro- and anti-inflammatory balance within the spinal cord.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the role of CD137L in the development of neuropathic pain. Our results indicate a contributory role of CD137L in the development of peripheral nerve injury-induced sensory hypersensitivity and its modulatory effects on the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses within the spinal cord and microglia. Further investigation of CD137L’s pro-nociceptive effects may result in novel drug targets for neuropathic pain treatment.</p>

<p>Deep learning has seen remarkable developments over the last years, many of
them inspired by neuroscience. However, the main learning mechanism behind
these advances - error backpropagation - appears to be at odds with
neurobiology. Here, we introduce a multilayer neuronal network model with
simplified dendritic compartments in which error-driven synaptic plasticity
adapts the network towards a global desired output. In contrast to previous
work our model does not require separate phases and synaptic learning is driven
by local dendritic prediction errors continuously in time. Such errors
originate at apical dendrites and occur due to a mismatch between predictive
input from lateral interneurons and activity from actual top-down feedback.
Through the use of simple dendritic compartments and different cell-types our
model can represent both error and normal activity within a pyramidal neuron.
We demonstrate the learning capabilities of the model in regression and
classification tasks, and show analytically that it approximates the error
backpropagation algorithm. Moreover, our framework is consistent with recent
observations of learning between brain areas and the architecture of cortical
microcircuits. Overall, we introduce a novel view of learning on dendritic
cortical circuits and on how the brain may solve the long-standing synaptic
credit assignment problem.

<p>Epilepsy creates a persistent increase in the probability of spontaneous
seizures. An ictal episode evolves due to acute disturbance of the fine-tuned
balance between excitatory vs. inhibitory inputs within a neural network in
favor of excitation. The current literature that proposes the
activity-dependent disinhibition as a valid mechanism of chronic epilepsy, does
not provide clues on why this mechanism emerges only in epileptic patients and
how the vicious circle resulting of an activity-dependent disinhibition in
over-active ictogenic network would end. A new model, which presents chronic
epilepsy as a disease of faulty architecture of the neural circuit, is
discussed. Wherein; variable genetic or acquired predisposing factors drive
abnormalities in the construction of multiple neural circuits resulting in an
activity-dependent positive feedback excitatory loops which transform normal
neural circuits into ictal foci. Such new mechanism, for igniting an
activity-dependent unstable excitation with subsequent relatively stable
disinhibition, leads to an ictal escape rhythm. The propagation of such
bursting activity occurs either electrochemically via synaptic communication to
remote susceptible circuits, or chemically via a trigger wave which recruits
the non-connected proximal neurons. Termination occurs abruptly when the
inhibitory interneurons functionally recover and reimpose their inhibitory
effect on the ictogenic circuit to transform the escape rhythm into a normal,
under-control output. The proposed model elucidates various enigmatic features
of the disease; and illustrates both the end-result ictogenic mechanism arising
from the wide variety of etiologies of human spontaneous and acquired epilepsy,
and the timing of episodic transitions from normal activity to seizures.

<p>Most decisions require information gathering from a stimulus presented with
different gaps. Indeed, the brain process of this integration is rarely
ambiguous. Recently, it has been claimed that humans can optimally integrate
the information of two discrete pulses independent of the temporal gap between
them. Interestingly, subjects' performance on such a task, with two discrete
pulses, is superior to what a perfect accumulator can predict. Although
numerous neuronal and descriptive models have been proposed to explain the
mechanism of perceptual decision-making, none can explain human behavior in
this two-pulse task. In order to investigate the mechanism of decision-making
on the noted tasks, a set of modified drift-diffusion models based on different
hypotheses were used. Model comparisons clarified that, in a sequence of
information arriving at different times, the accumulated information of earlier
evidence affects the process of information accumulation of later evidence. It
was shown that the rate of information extraction depends on whether the pulse
is the first or the second one. The proposed model can also explain the
stronger effect of the second pulse as shown by Kiani et al. 2013.

<p>This paper presents a new toolbox for MEEG source activity and connectivity
estimation: Brain Connectivity Variable Resolution Tomographic Analysis version
1.0 (BC-VARETA 1.0). It relies on the third generation of nonlinear methods for
the analysis of resting state MEEG Time Series. Into the state of the art of
MEEG analysis, the methodology underlying our tool (BC-VARETA) brings out
several assets. First: Constitutes a Bayesian Identification approach of Linear
Dynamical Systems in the Frequency Domain, grounded in more consistent models
(third generation). Second: Achieves Super-Resolution, through the iterative
solution of a Sparse Hermitian Source Graphical Model. Third: Tackles
efficiently in High Dimensional and Complex set up the estimation of
connectivity. Fourth: Incorporates priors at the connectivity level by
penalizing the groups of variables, corresponding to the Gray Matter anatomical
segmentation, and including a probability mask of the anatomically plausible
connections. Along with the implementation of our method, we include in this
toolbox a benchmark for the validation of MEEG source analysis methods, that
would serve for the evaluation of sophisticated methodologies (third
generation). It incorporates two elements. First: A realistic simulation
framework, for the generation of MEEG synthetic data, given an underlying
source connectivity structure. Second: Sensitive quality measures that allow
for a reliable evaluation of the source activity and connectivity
reconstruction performance, based on the Spatial Dispersion and Earth Movers
Distance, in both source and connectivity space.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38829">Aberrant information transfer interferes with functional axon regeneration</a></h4>

Functional axon regeneration requires regenerating neurons to restore appropriate synaptic connectivity and circuit function. To model this process, we developed an assay in <i>C. elegans</i> that links axon and synapse regeneration of a single neuron to recovery of behavior. After axon injury and regeneration of the DA9 neuron, synapses reform at their pre-injury location. However, these regenerated synapses often lack key molecular components. Further, synaptic vesicles accumulate in the dendrite in response to axon injury. Dendritic vesicle release results in information misrouting that suppresses behavioral recovery. Dendritic synapse formation depends on dynein and <i>jnk-1</i>. But even when information transfer is corrected, axonal synapses fail to adequately transmit information. Our study reveals unexpected plasticity during functional regeneration. Regeneration of the axon is not sufficient for the reformation of correct neuronal circuits after injury. Rather, synapse reformation and function are also key variables, and manipulation of circuit reformation improves behavioral recovery.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37549">Engineering induction of singular neural rosette emergence within hPSC-derived tissues</a></h4>

Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived neural organoids display unprecedented emergent properties. Yet in contrast to the singular neuroepithelial tube from which the entire central nervous system (CNS) develops in vivo, current organoid protocols yield tissues with multiple neuroepithelial units, a.k.a. neural rosettes, each acting as independent morphogenesis centers and thereby confounding coordinated, reproducible tissue development. Here, we discover that controlling initial tissue morphology can effectively (&gt;80%) induce single neural rosette emergence within hPSC-derived forebrain and spinal tissues. Notably, the optimal tissue morphology for observing singular rosette emergence was distinct for forebrain versus spinal tissues due to previously unknown differences in ROCK-mediated cell contractility. Following release of geometric confinement, the tissues displayed radial outgrowth with maintenance of a singular neuroepithelium and peripheral neuronal differentiation. Thus, we have identified neural tissue morphology as a critical biophysical parameter for controlling in vitro neural tissue morphogenesis furthering advancement towards biomanufacture of CNS tissues with biomimetic anatomy and physiology.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Behavioral change is paramount to adaptive behavior. Two ways to achieve alterations in previously established behavior are extinction and overexpectation. The infralimbic (IL) portion of the medial prefrontal cortex controls the inhibition of previously established aversive behavioral responses in extinction. The role of the IL cortex in behavioral modification in appetitive Pavlovian associations remains poorly understood. Here, we seek to determine if the IL cortex modulates overexpectation and extinction of reward learning. Using overexpectation or extinction to achieve a reduction in behavior, the present findings uncover a dissociable role for the IL cortex in these paradigms. Pharmacologically inactivating the IL cortex left overexpectation intact. In contrast, pre-training manipulations in the IL cortex prior to extinction facilitated the reduction in conditioned responding but led to a disrupted extinction retrieval on test drug-free. Additional studies confirmed that this effect is restricted to the IL and not dependent on the dorsally-located prelimbic cortex. Together, these results show that the IL cortex underlies extinction but not overexpectation-driven reduction in behavior, which may be due to regulating the expression of conditioned responses influenced by stimulus–response associations rather than stimulus–stimulus associations.</span>

The ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system. These receptors provide a range of temporally diverse signals which stem from subunit composition and also from the inherent ability of each member to occupy multiple functional states, the distribution of which can be altered by small molecule modulators and binding partners. Hence it becomes essential to characterize the conformational landscape of the receptors under this variety of different conditions.

Heart rate is under the precise control of the autonomic nervous system. However, the wiring of peripheral neural circuits that regulate heart rate is poorly understood. Here, we developed a clearing-imaging-analysis pipeline to visualize innervation of intact hearts in 3D and employed a multi-technique approach to map parasympathetic and sympathetic neural circuits that control heart rate in mice. We anatomically and functionally identify cholinergic neurons and noradrenergic neurons in an intrinsic cardiac ganglion and the stellate ganglia, respectively, that project to the sinoatrial node. We also report that the heart rate response to optogenetic versus electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve displays different temporal characteristics and that vagal afferents enhance parasympathetic and reduce sympathetic tone to the heart via central mechanisms. Our findings provide new insights into neural regulation of heart rate, and our methodology to study cardiac circuits can be readily used to interrogate neural control of other visceral organs.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/456194v1?rss=1">Specialized and spatially organized coding of sensory, motor, and cognitive variables in midbrain dopamine neurons</a></h4>

There is increased appreciation that dopamine (DA) neurons in the midbrain respond not only to reward and reward-predicting cues but also to other variables such as distance to reward, movements and behavioral choices. Based on these findings, a major open question is how the responses to these diverse variables are organized across the population of DA neurons. In other words, do individual DA neurons multiplex multiple variables, or are subsets of neurons specialized in encoding specific behavioral variables? The reason that this fundamental question has been difficult to resolve is that recordings from large populations of individual DA neurons have not been performed in a behavioral task with sufficient complexity to examine these diverse variables simultaneously. To address this gap, we used 2-photon calcium imaging through an implanted lens to record activity of &gt;300 midbrain DA neurons in the VTA during a complex decision-making task. As mice navigated in a virtual reality (VR) environment, DA neurons encoded an array of sensory, motor, and cognitive variables. These responses were functionally clustered, such that subpopulations of neurons transmitted information about a subset of behavioral variables, in addition to encoding reward. These functional clusters were spatially organized, such that neighboring neurons were more likely to be part of the same cluster. Taken together with the topography between DA neurons and their projections, this specialization and anatomical organization may aid downstream circuits in correctly interpreting the wide range of signals transmitted by DA neurons.

Absolute pitch, the ability to name or produce a musical tone without a reference, is a rare ability which is often related to early musical training and genetic components. However, it remains a matter of debate why absolute pitch is relatively common in autism spectrum disorders and why absolute pitch possessors exhibit higher autistic traits. By definition absolute pitch (which involves the analysis of single tones) is characterized by a focus on a local scale than relative pitch (involving relations between tones, intervals, melodies). This study investigated whether a detail-oriented cognitive style, a concept borrowed from the autism literature (weak central coherence theory), might provide a framework to explain this joint occurrence. Two local-to-global experiments in vision (hierarchically constructed letters) and audition (hierarchically constructed melodies) as well as a pitch adjustment test measuring absolute pitch proficiency were conducted in 31 absolute pitch and 33 relative pitch professional musicians. Analyses revealed inconsistent group differences among reaction time, accuracy and speed-accuracy-composite-scores of experimental conditions (local vs. global, and congruent vs. incongruent stimuli). Furthermore, amounts of interference of global form on judgements of local elements and vice versa were calculated. Interestingly, reduced global-to-local interference in audition was associated with greater absolute pitch ability and in vision with higher autistic traits. Results are partially in line with the idea of a detail-oriented cognitive style in absolute pitch musicians. The inconsistency of the results might be due to limitations of global-to-local paradigms in measuring cognitive style and due to heterogeneity of absolute pitch possessors. In summary, this study provides further evidence for a multifaceted pattern of various and potentially interacting factors on the acquisition of absolute pitch.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/455857v1?rss=1">Frequency- and area-specific entrainment of intrinsic cortical oscillations by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation</a></h4>

Neural oscillations are ubiquitous throughout the cortex, but the frequency of oscillations differs from area to area. To elucidate the mechanistic architectures establishing various rhythmic activities, we tested whether spontaneous neural oscillations in different cortical modules can be entrained by direct perturbation with distinct frequencies of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). While recording the electroencephalogram (EEG), we applied single-pulse TMS (sTMS) and repetitive TMS (rTMS) at 5, 11, and 23 Hz to motor or visual cortex. To assess entrainment, defined as phase locking of intrinsic oscillations to periodic external force , we examined local and global modulation of the phase-locking factor (PLF). sTMS triggered transient phase locking in a wide frequency band with distinct PLF peaks at 21 Hz in the motor cortex and 8 Hz in the visual cortex. With TMS pulse trains of 11 Hz over visual cortex and 23 Hz over motor cortex, phase locking was progressively enhanced at the stimulation frequency and lasted for a few cycles after the stimulation terminated. Moreover, such local entrainment propagated to other cortical regions, suggesting that rTMS entrained intrinsic neural oscillations locally and globally via network nodes. Because the entrainment was frequency-specific for each target site, these frequencies may correspond to the natural frequency of each cortical module and of the global networks. rTMS enables direct manipulation of the brain and is thus useful for investigating the causal roles of synchronous neural oscillations and synchrony in brain functions, and for the treatment of clinical symptoms associated with impaired oscillations and synchrony.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/455766v1?rss=1">Multipoint and large volume fiber photometry with a single tapered optical fiber implant</a></h4>

Techniques to monitor functional fluorescence signal from the brain are increasingly popular in the neuroscience community. However, most implementations are based on flat cleaved optical fibers (FFs) that can only interface with shallow tissue volumes adjacent to the fiber opening. To circumvent this limitation, we exploit modal properties of tapered optical fibers (TFs) to structure light collection over the wide optically active area of the fiber taper, providing an approach to efficiently and selectively collect light from the region(s) of interest. While being less invasive than FFs, TF probes can uniformly collect light over up to 2 mm of tissue and allow for multisite photometry along the taper. Furthermore, by micro-structuring the non-planar surface of the fiber taper, collection volumes from TFs can also be engineered arbitrarily in both shape and size. Owing to the abilities offered by these probes, we envision that TFs can set a novel, powerful paradigm in optically targeting not only the deep brain, but, more in general, any biological system or organ where light collection from the deep tissues is beneficial but challenging because of tissue scattering and absorption.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/455758v1?rss=1">Glutamate uptake and release at single adult corticostriatal synapses of normal and Huntington mice</a></h4>

Changes in the balance between synaptic glutamate (Glu) release and uptake may stimulate synaptic reorganization and even synapse loss. The search for the primary cause of a potential mismatch between uptake and release should be easier if both parameters are assessed independently and at a single synapse level. This has now become possible due to a new imaging assay with the genetically encoded ultrafast Glu sensor iGluu. We report results obtained from individual corticostriatal synapses in acute slices prepared from mice aged &gt;1 year. Contrasting patterns of short-term plasticity and a size criterion identified 2 classes of terminals, presumably corresponding to the previously defined IT and PT synapses. The latter exhibited a higher degree of frequency potentiation/residual Glu accumulation and were selected for investigation in the Q175 mouse model of Huntington disease (HD). It was found that the maximal [Glu] next to the presynaptic terminal (as indicator of release) in HD and the time constant of perisynaptic [Glu] decay (TauD, as indicator of uptake) were prolonged and reduced, respectively. According to these criteria, about 30% of P terminals tested in Q175 heterozygotes (HET) were diagnosed as sick. HD but not WT synapses exhibited a positive correlation between TauD and the peak amplitude of iGluu. Treatment of WT preparations with the Glu uptake blocker TFB-TBOA (100 nM) mimicked the TauD changes in homozygotes (HOM). The NMDAR-mediated unitary EPSCs elicited by optical activation of single ChR-expressing corticostriatal axons were prolonged, and less EAAT2 immunoreactivity was found in the environment of corticostriatal terminals. It is concluded that HD produces a mismatch between Glu uptake and release, especially in synapses with high degree of frequency potentiation. Astrocytic Glu transport therefore remains a promising target for therapeutic intervention.

Recently discovered glymphatic brain clearance mechanisms utilizing physiological pulsations have been shown to fail at removing waste materials such as amyloid and tau plaques in neurodegenerative diseases. Since cardiovascular pulsations are a main driving force of the clearance, this research investigates if commonly available blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals at 1.5 and 3 T could detect abnormal physiological pulsations in neurodegenerative diseases. Coefficient of variation in BOLD signal (CVBOLD) was used to estimate contribution of physiological signals in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). 17 AD patients and 18 bvFTD patients were compared to 24 control subjects imaged with a 1.5 T setup from a local institute. AD results were further verified with 3 T data from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) repository with 30 AD patients and 40 matched controls. Effect of motion and gray matter atrophy was evaluated and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses was performed. The CVBOLD was higher in both AD and bvFTD groups compared to controls (p &lt; 0.0005). The difference was not explained by head motion or gray matter atrophy. In AD patients, the CVBOLD alterations were localized in overlapping structures in both 1.5 T and 3 T data. Localization of the CVBOLD alterations was different in AD than in bvFTD. Areas where CVBOLD is higher in patient groups than in control group involved periventricular white matter, basal ganglia and multiple cortical structures. Notably, a robust difference between AD and bvFTD groups was found in the CVBOLD of frontal poles. In the analysis of diagnostic accuracy, the CVBOLD metrics area under the ROC for detecting disease ranged 0.85-0.96. Conclusions: The analysis of brain physiological pulsations measured using CVBOLD reveals disease-specific alterations in both AD and bvFTD.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/455675v1?rss=1">Does closing the eyes enhance auditory attention? Eye closure increases attentional alpha-power modulation but not listening performance</a></h4>

In challenging listening conditions, closing the eyes is a strategy with intuitive appeal to improve auditory attention and perception. On the neural level, closing the eyes increases the power of alpha oscillations (~10 Hz), which are a prime signature of auditory attention. Here, we test whether eye closure benefits neural and behavioural signatures of auditory attention and perception. Participants (N = 22) attended to one of two alternating streams of spoken numbers with open or closed eyes in a darkened chamber. After each trial, participants indicated whether probes had been among the to-be-attended or to-be-ignored numbers. In the electroencephalogram, alpha power was modulated in synchrony with auditory attending versus ignoring. Importantly, eye closure did not only increase the overall level of absolute alpha power but also the attentional modulation thereof. Behaviourally, however, neither perceptual sensitivity nor response criterion was affected by eye closure. To further examine whether this behavioural null-result would conceptually replicate in a simple auditory detection task, a follow-up experiment was conducted that required participants (N = 19) to detect a near-threshold target tone in noise. As in the main experiment, our results provide evidence for the absence of any difference in perceptual sensitivity and criterion for open versus closed eyes. In sum, we demonstrate here that the modulation of the human alpha rhythm by auditory attention is increased when participants close their eyes. However, our results speak against the widely held belief that eye closure per se improves listening behaviour.

Recurrent spontaneous seizures have been considered the sine qua non of epilepsy. Epileptic seizures were first associated with intense electrical activity measured from the brain in 1933 1. Spreading depression of brain activity was discovered by Leao in 1944 2, and has since been shown associated with migraine, stroke and traumatic brain injury 3,4. Although for many years spreading depression was thought to have only rare genetic links to epilepsy 5, recently it has been proposed that seizure-triggered spreading depression could underlie sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) 6. The physiological underpinning of spreading depression is an electrical spreading depolarization (SD) of brain cells. The depolarization is associated with a large, prolonged negative shift in tissue potential that cannot be well detected with standard human electroencephalographic (EEG) technology. Nevertheless, in recent years, computational models of the dynamics of neuron biophysics have shown a linkage between seizures and SD 7, and have predicted the possibility of dynamic trajectories linking the two phenomena 8. We developed a recording system for chronic, long-term measurements that provides a view of the complex interactions between spontaneous epileptic seizures and spreading depolarizations in the intact brain 9. We here experimentally demonstrate these theoretically predicted trajectories in multiple animal models of epilepsy, showing that spontaneous single seizures are frequently associated with SD, and that SD may mediate between seizures within clusters. We therefore propose that the ictus of epilepsy may be a combination of seizures and SD.

Although electrophysiological (EEG) measures of executive functions (EF) (e.g. error monitoring) and their link to academic achievement in typically developing children have been suggested, work investigating the link between error monitoring and academic skills in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is limited. We employed traditional electrophysiological and advanced time-frequency methods, combined with principal components analyses, to extract neural activity related to error monitoring, and tested their relations to academic achievement in 35 cognitively-able kindergarteners with ASD. A child-friendly Go/No-go Zoo Game successfully elicited an error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) in children with ASD as young as 5 years. We also observed increased response-related theta power during error relative to correct trials. Both larger Pe and theta power were associated with academic achievement. However, only the effects of theta power on reading and math skills remained significant after controlling for behavioral performance on the Zoo Game and IQ. Results suggest that the use of time frequency EEG analyses may provide new opportunities to investigate neurobiological mechanisms of EF in young children with ASD. Results also provide further insights for the development of more targeted treatment programs designed to improve EF, which could have cascading effects on academic development.

Inward rectifying (KIR) K+ channels are present in cerebral arterial smooth muscle and endothelial cells, a tandem arrangement suggestive of a dynamic yet undiscovered role for this channel. We explored whether vascular KIR channels were uniquely modulated by membrane lipids and hemodynamic stimuli. A KIR current was isolated in smooth muscle and endothelial cells of rat cerebral arteries and molecular analyses confirmed KIR2.1/KIR2.2 mRNA and protein expression. Electrophysiology next revealed that endothelial KIR was sensitive to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), with depletion impairing flow-induced activation of the channel. In contrast, smooth muscle KIR was sensitive to membrane cholesterol, with sequestration blocking pressure's ability to inhibit this channel. Membrane lipids helped confer KIR mechanosensitivity to intact arteries; virtual models then reconceptualised KIR as a dynamic regulator of basal tone development. We conclude that specific membrane lipid-KIR interactions enable unique channel populations to sense hemodynamic stimuli and set brain perfusion.

Genetically-modified mice have been widely used in neuroscience. Our understanding of the basal ganglia in particular has been greatly assisted by BAC mutants with selective transgene expression in striatal neurons forming the direct or indirect pathways. However, for more sophisticated behavioral tasks and larger intracranial implants, rats are preferred. Furthermore, BAC lines can show variable expression patterns depending upon genomic insertion site. We therefore used CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to generate two novel knock-in rat lines, specifically encoding iCre recombinase immediately after the dopamine D1 receptor (Drd1a) or adenosine 2a receptor (Adora2a) loci. We confirmed these rats show selective, functional Cre expression in the direct and indirect pathways respectively, using a combination of in situ hybridization and viral transfections. Finally, we verified normal movement, learning, and motivation across a range of behavioral paradigms. We expect these new D1-Cre and A2a-Cre rat lines to be widely used to study both normal brain functions and neurological and psychiatric pathophysiology.

Despite the fact that all insects have six legs, they display considerable differences in their legged locomotion. Are these differences irreconcilable, or simply different domains of the same system? In this study, we investigate walking in Drosophila. We find that despite the fact that flies walk extremely slowly relative to their size, they predominantly employ an alternating tripod gait, a gait typically associated with high-speed locomotion. The kinematics of their center of mass (CoM) is diametrically opposite to the CoM kinematics observed in insect runners such as cockroach. We resolve this tension between similar gaits, and differing kinematics in slow and high-speed locomotion by showing that the mechanics of a tripod gait naturally reduces to a simple biomechanical model which can support a range of kinematic patterns including both fly-like and cockroach-like patterns. These findings suggest that legged locomotion in different insects might represent different domains of the same system.

While the cerebellum is instrumental for motor control, it is not traditionally implicated in vision. Here, we report the existence of 5 ipsilateral visual field maps in the human cerebellum. These maps are located within the oculomotor vermis and cerebellar nodes of the dorsal attention and visual networks. These findings imply that the cerebellum is closely involved in visuospatial cognition, and that its contributions are anchored in sensory coordinates.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/455105v1?rss=1">Molecular inflection points in the aging human brain</a></h4>

The onset of neurodegenerative diseases has been associated with age-dependent changes of gene expression in the brain. Research on age-dependent genes commonly assumes gradual linear relationships between gene expression and aging, failing to identify sudden changes in gene expression that may provide insight into the aging process and its role in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, a piecewise linear regression model is proposed to identify critical inflection points at which aging mechanisms may accelerate. Age-related gene expression data from tissue of four regions of the human brain (frontal cortex, hippocampus, putamen, substantia nigra) and human microglia were analyzed for inflection points. The best piecewise model represented stable expression during younger ages followed by an increase or decrease with age after the inflection point. In brain tissue, genes showing inflection points in expression pattern were enriched for gene ontology terms involved in neurodegenerative diseases. The hippocampus showed the highest proportion of genes with inflection points and the lowest variability in inflection points. These findings suggest that inflection points in gene expression may be used to characterize the aging process in the human brain and may help identify markers for the onset of neurodegenerative diseases.

Ventral tenia tecta (vTT) is a part of the olfactory cortex that receives both olfactory sensory signals from the olfactory bulb and top-down signals from the prefrontal cortex. To address the question whether and how the neuronal activity of the vTT is modulated by prefrontal cognitive processes such as attention, expectation and working memory that occurs during goal-directed behaviors, we recorded individual neuronal responses in the vTT of freely moving awake mice that performed learned odor-guided feeding and drinking behaviors. We found that the firing pattern of individual vTT cells had repeatable behavioral correlates such that the environmental and behavioral scene the mouse encountered during the learned behavior was the major determinant of when individual vTT neurons fired maximally. Furthermore, spiking activity of these scene cells was modulated not only by the present scene but also by the future scene that the mouse predicted. We show that vTT receives afferent input from the olfactory bulb and top-down inputs from the medial prefrontal cortex and piriform cortex. These results indicate that different groups of vTT cells are activated at different scenes and suggest that processing of olfactory sensory information is handled by different scene cells during distinct scenes of learned feeding and drinking behaviors. In other words, during the feeding and drinking behavior, vTT changes its working mode moment by moment in accord with the scene change by selectively biasing specific scene cells. The scene effect on olfactory sensory processing in the vTT has implications for the neuronal circuit mechanisms of top-down attention and scene-dependent encoding and recall of olfactory memory.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/454934v1?rss=1">Criticality between cortical states</a></h4>

Since the first measurements of neuronal avalanches, the critical brain hypothesis has gained traction. However, if the brain is critical, what is the phase transition? For several decades it has been known that the cerebral cortex operates in a diversity of regimes, ranging from highly synchronous states (e.g. slow wave sleep, with higher spiking variability) to desynchronized states (e.g. alert waking, with lower spiking variability). Here, using independent signatures of criticality, we show that a phase transition occurs in an intermediate value of spiking variability. The critical exponents point to a universality class different from mean-field directed percolation (MF-DP). Importantly, as the cortex hovers around this critical point, it follows a linear relation between the avalanche exponents that encompasses previous experimental results from different setups and is reproduced by a model.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/454819v1?rss=1">Physiological Synchrony Predicts Observational Threat Learning in Humans</a></h4>

Understanding how information about threats in the environment is shared and transmitted between individuals is crucial for explaining adaptive, survival-related behavior in humans and other animals, and for developing treatments for phobias and other anxiety disorders. Research across species has shown that observing a conspecific's, a "demonstrator's", threat responses causes strong and persistent threat memories in the "observer". Such observational threat learning is hypothesized to be supported by empathic processes. Here, we examined if physiological coupling between demonstrator and observer can serve as a biomarker of the hypothesized empathic transfer. We find that synchronization of phasic skin conductance, which directly reflects autonomic nervous system activity and captures an organism's arousal when facing and responding to threats, between the demonstrator and observer during observational learning predicts the strength of the observer's later threat memories. Hence, dynamic coupling between an observer and demonstrator's autonomic activity may determine the formation and later retrieval of observational threat associations.

Memory requires similar episodes with overlapping features to be represented distinctly, a process that is disrupted in many clinical conditions as well as normal aging. Data from humans have linked this ability to activity in hippocampal CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG). While animal models have shown the perirhinal cortex is critical for disambiguating similar stimuli, hippocampal activity has not been causally linked to discrimination abilities. The goal of the current study was to determine how disrupting CA3/DG activity would impact performance on a rodent mnemonic discrimination task. Rats were surgically implanted with bilateral guide cannulae targeting dorsal CA3/DG. In Exp.1, the effect of intra-hippocampal muscimol on target-lure discrimination was assessed within subjects in randomized blocks. Muscimol initially impaired discrimination across all levels of target-lure similarity, but performance improved on subsequent test blocks irrespective of stimulus similarity and infusion condition. To clarify these results, Exp.2 examined whether prior experience with objects influenced the effect of muscimol on target-lure discrimination. Rats that received vehicle infusions in a first test block, followed by muscimol in a second block, did not show discrimination impairments for target-lure pairs of any similarity. In contrast, rats that received muscimol infusions in the first test block were impaired across all levels of target-lure similarity. Sustained effects of muscimol in disrupting behavioral performance after repeated infusions were verified in a spatial alternation task. At the conclusion of behavioral experiments, fluorescence in situ hybridization for the immediate-early genes Arc and Homer1a was used to determine the proportion of neurons active following muscimol infusion. Contrary to expectations, muscimol increased neural activity in DG. An additional experiment was carried out to quantify neural activity in naive rats that received an intra-hippocampal infusion of vehicle or muscimol. Results confirmed that muscimol led to DG excitation, likely through its actions on interneuron populations in hilar and molecular layers of DG and consequent disinhibition of principal cells. Taken together, our results suggest disruption of coordinated neural activity across the hippocampus impairs mnemonic discrimination when lure stimuli are novel.

Microscale electrodes are rapidly becoming critical tools for neuroscience and brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) for their high spatial and temporal resolution. However, the mechanics of how devices on this scale insert into brain tissue is unknown, making it difficult to balance between larger probes with higher stiffness, or smaller probes with lower damage. Measurements have been experimentally challenging due to the large deformations, rapid events, and small forces involved. Here we modified a nanoindentation force measurement system to provide the first ultra-high resolution force, distance, and temporal recordings of brain penetration as a function of microwire diameter (7.5 m to 100 m) and tip geometry (flat, angled, and electrosharpened). Surprisingly, both penetration force and tissue compression scaled linearly with wire diameter, rather than cross-sectional area. Linear brain compression with wire diameter strongly suggest smaller probes will cause less tissue damage upon insertion, though unexpectedly no statistical difference was observed between angled and flat tipped probes. These first of their kind measurements provide a mechanical framework for designing effective microprobe geometries while limiting mechanical damage.

<p>by Ioannis Kalfas, Kasper Vinken, Rufin Vogels</p>

Recent studies suggest that deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models show higher representational similarity, compared to any other existing object recognition models, with macaque inferior temporal (IT) cortical responses, human ventral stream fMRI activations and human object recognition. These studies employed natural images of objects. A long research tradition employed abstract shapes to probe the selectivity of IT neurons. If CNN models provide a realistic model of IT responses, then they should capture the IT selectivity for such shapes. Here, we compare the activations of CNN units to a stimulus set of 2D regular and irregular shapes with the response selectivity of macaque IT neurons and with human similarity judgements. The shape set consisted of regular shapes that differed in nonaccidental properties, and irregular, asymmetrical shapes with curved or straight boundaries. We found that deep CNNs (Alexnet, VGG-16 and VGG-19) that were trained to classify natural images show response modulations to these shapes that were similar to those of IT neurons. Untrained CNNs with the same architecture than trained CNNs, but with random weights, demonstrated a poorer similarity than CNNs trained in classification. The difference between the trained and untrained CNNs emerged at the deep convolutional layers, where the similarity between the shape-related response modulations of IT neurons and the trained CNNs was high. Unlike IT neurons, human similarity judgements of the same shapes correlated best with the last layers of the trained CNNs. In particular, these deepest layers showed an enhanced sensitivity for straight versus curved irregular shapes, similar to that shown in human shape judgments. In conclusion, the representations of abstract shape similarity are highly comparable between macaque IT neurons and deep convolutional layers of CNNs that were trained to classify natural images, while human shape similarity judgments correlate better with the deepest layers.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Y2OMH4zdfKQ" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/eW8COxnrm9o/article">Structural and dynamic basis of substrate permissiveness in hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT)</a></h4>

<p>by Ying-Chih Chiang, Olesya Levsh, Chun Kei Lam, Jing-Ke Weng, Yi Wang</p>

Substrate permissiveness has long been regarded as the raw materials for the evolution of new enzymatic functions. In land plants, hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT) is an essential enzyme of the phenylpropanoid metabolism. Although essential enzymes are normally associated with high substrate specificity, HCT can utilize a variety of non-native substrates. To examine the structural and dynamic basis of substrate permissiveness in this enzyme, we report the crystal structure of HCT from Selaginella moellendorffii and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed on five orthologous HCTs from several major lineages of land plants. Through altogether 17-<i>μ</i>s MD simulations, we demonstrate the prevalent swing motion of an arginine handle on a submicrosecond timescale across all five HCTs, which plays a key role in native substrate recognition by these intrinsically promiscuous enzymes. Our simulations further reveal how a non-native substrate of HCT engages a binding site different from that of the native substrate and diffuses to reach the catalytic center and its co-substrate. By numerically solving the Smoluchowski equation, we show that the presence of such an alternative binding site, even when it is distant from the catalytic center, always increases the reaction rate of a given substrate. However, this increase is only significant for enzyme-substrate reactions heavily influenced by diffusion. In these cases, binding non-native substrates ‘off-center’ provides an effective rationale to develop substrate permissiveness while maintaining the native functions of promiscuous enzymes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eW8COxnrm9o" width="1" />

<p>Little is known about how 17β-estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) mediates memory formation in males. In ovariectomized (OVX) mice, bilateral dorsal hippocampal (DH) infusion of E<sub>2</sub> enhances memory consolidation in object recognition (OR) and object placement (OP) tasks in a manner dependent on activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt signaling. Here, bilateral DH E<sub>2</sub> infusion enhanced memory consolidation in both tasks among OVX female, gonadally-intact male, and castrated male mice, suggesting comparable facilitation of memory consolidation in both sexes, independent of testicular hormones in males. Contrary to previous reports in OVX mice, E<sub>2</sub> did not increase DH ERK or Akt phosphorylation in males, nor did the ERK inhibitor U0126 [1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis (o-aminophenylmercapto) butadiene] prevent E<sub>2</sub> from enhancing memory consolidation among intact and castrated males. These data suggest that ERK activation is not necessary for E<sub>2</sub> to enhance memory consolidation in males, and compared with previous reports in females, reveal novel sex differences in the cell-signaling pathways through which E<sub>2</sub> facilitates memory consolidation. To explore the mechanisms underlying E<sub>2</sub>-induced memory enhancements in males, phosphorylation of the transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in the DH was assessed. E<sub>2</sub> increased phospho-CREB levels in both sexes, yet U0126 did not block these increases in castrated or intact males, indicating that E<sub>2</sub> regulates CREB phosphorylation in males via an ERK-independent mechanism. Collectively, these findings suggest that the beneficial effects of hippocampal E<sub>2</sub> on memory consolidation in males and females are mediated by different molecular mechanisms, which has important implications for the development of treatments to reduce memory dysfunction in men and women.</p>

Abstract
<p>The perception of gender and age of unfamiliar faces is reported to vary idiosyncratically across retinal locations such that, for example, the same androgynous face may appear to be male at one location but female at another. Here, we test spatial heterogeneity for the recognition of the <i>identity</i> of personally familiar faces in human participants. We found idiosyncratic biases that were stable within participants and that varied more across locations for low as compared to high familiar faces. These data suggest that like face gender and age, face identity is processed, in part, by independent populations of neurons monitoring restricted spatial regions and that the recognition responses vary for the same face across these different locations. Moreover, repeated and varied social interactions appear to lead to adjustments of these independent face recognition neurons so that the same familiar face is eventually more likely to elicit the same recognition response across widely separated visual field locations. We provide a mechanistic account of this reduced retinotopic bias based on computational simulations.</p>

<p>Publication date: February 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 54</p><p>Author(s): Andreas S Thum, Bertram Gerber</p><div><p>The <em>Drosophila</em> larva is a relatively simple, 10 000-neuron study case for learning and memory with enticing analytical power, combining genetic tractability, the availability of robust behavioral assays, the opportunity for single-cell transgenic manipulation, and an emerging synaptic connectome of its complete central nervous system. Indeed, although the insect mushroom body is a much-studied memory network, the connectome revealed that more than half of the classes of connection within the mushroom body had escaped attention. The connectome also revealed circuitry that integrates, both within and across brain hemispheres, higher-order sensory input, intersecting valence signals, and output neurons that instruct behavior. Further, it was found that activating individual dopaminergic mushroom body input neurons can have a rewarding or a punishing effect on olfactory stimuli associated with it, depending on the relative timing of this activation, and that larvae form molecularly dissociable short-term, long-term, and amnesia-resistant memories. Together, the larval mushroom body is a suitable study case to achieve a nuanced account of molecular function in a behaviorally meaningful memory network.</p></div>

<p>This paper tackles the problem of learning brain-visual representations for
understanding and neural processes behind human visual perception, with a view
towards replicating these processes into machines. The core idea is to learn
plausible representations through the combined use of human neural activity
evoked by natural images as a supervision mechanism for deep learning models.
To accomplish this, we propose a multimodal approach that uses two different
deep encoders, one for images and one for EEGs, trained in a siamese
configuration for learning a joint manifold that maximizes a compatibility
measure between visual features and brain representation. The learned manifold
is then used to perform image classification and saliency detection as well as
to shed light on the possible representations generated by the human brain when
perceiving the visual world. Performance analysis shows that neural signals can
be used to effectively supervise the training of deep learning models, as
demonstrated by the achieved performance in both image classification and
saliency detection. Furthermore, the learned brain-visual manifold is
consistent with cognitive neuroscience literature about visual perception and,
most importantly, highlights new associations between brain areas, image
patches and computational kernels. In particular, we are able to approximate
brain responses to visual stimuli by training an artificial model with image
features correlated to neural activity.

<p>Dementia is a syndrome characterised by the decline of different cognitive
abilities. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common dementia affecting
cognitive domains such as memory and learning, perceptual-motion or executive
function. High rate of deaths and high cost for detection, treatments and
patient's care count amongst its consequences. Early detection of AD is
considered of high importance for improving the quality of life of patients and
their families. The aim of this thesis is to introduce novel non-invasive early
diagnosis methods in order to speed the diagnosis, reduce the associated costs
and make them widely accessible. Novel AD's screening tests based on virtual
environments using new immersive technologies combined with advanced Human
Computer Interaction (HCI) systems are introduced. Four tests demonstrate the
wide range of screening mechanisms based on cognitive domain impairments that
can be designed using virtual environments. The use of emotion recognition to
analyse AD symptoms has been also proposed. A novel multimodal dataset was
specifically created to remark the autobiographical memory deficits of AD
patients. Data from this dataset is used to introduce novel descriptors for
Electroencephalogram (EEG) and facial images data. EEG features are based on
quaternions in order to keep the correlation information between sensors,
whereas, for facial expression recognition, a preprocessing method for motion
magnification and descriptors based on origami crease pattern algorithm are
proposed to enhance facial micro-expressions. These features have been proved
on classifiers such as SVM and Adaboost for the classification of reactions to
autobiographical stimuli such as long and short term memories.

<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography
(TMS-EEG) is widely used to study the reactivity and connectivity of brain
regions for clinical or research purposes. The electromagnetic pulse of the TMS
device generates at the instant of administration an artifact of large
amplitude and a duration up to tens of milliseconds that overlaps with brain
activity. Methods for TMS artifact correction have been developed to remove the
artifact and recover the underlying, immediate response of the cerebral cortex
to the magnetic stimulus. In this study, three such algorithms are evaluated.
Since there is no ground truth for the masked brain activity, pilot data formed
from the superposition of the isolated TMS artifact on the EEG brain activity
are used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. Different scenarios of
TMS-EEG experiments are considered for the evaluation: TMS at resting state,
TMS inducing epileptiform discharges and TMS administered during epileptiform
discharges. We show that a proposed gap filling method is able to reproduce
qualitative characteristics and in many cases closely resemble the hidden EEG
signal. Finally, shortcomings of the TMS correction algorithms as well as the
pilot data approach are discussed.

<p>Activation of most primary sensory neurons results in transduction currents
that are carried by cations. One notable exception is the vertebrate olfactory
receptor neuron (ORN), where the transduction current is carried largely by the
anion $Cl^-$. However, it remains unclear why ORNs use an anionic current for
signal amplification. We have sought to provide clarification on this topic by
studying the so far neglected dynamics of $Na^+$, $Ca^{2+}$, $K^+$ and $Cl^-$
in the small space of olfactory cilia during an odorant response. Using
computational modeling and simulations we compared the outcomes of signal
amplification based on either $Cl^-$ or $Na^+$ currents. We found that
amplification produced by $Na^+$ influx instead of a $Cl^-$ efflux is
problematic due to several reasons: First, the $Na^+$ current amplitude varies
greatly depending on mucosal ion concentration changes. Second, a $Na^+$
current leads to a large increase in the ciliary $Na^+$ concentration during an
odorant response. This increase inhibits and even reverses $Ca^{2+}$ clearance
by $Na^+/Ca^{2+}/K^+$ exchange, which is essential for response termination.
Finally, a $Na^+$ current increases the ciliary osmotic pressure, which could
cause swelling to damage the cilia. By contrast, a transduction pathway based
on $Cl^-$ efflux circumvents these problems and renders the odorant response
robust and reliable.

<p>An extensive body of empirical research has revealed remarkable regularities
in the acquisition, organization, deployment, and neural representation of
human semantic knowledge, thereby raising a fundamental conceptual question:
what are the theoretical principles governing the ability of neural networks to
acquire, organize, and deploy abstract knowledge by integrating across many
individual experiences? We address this question by mathematically analyzing
the nonlinear dynamics of learning in deep linear networks. We find exact
solutions to this learning dynamics that yield a conceptual explanation for the
prevalence of many disparate phenomena in semantic cognition, including the
hierarchical differentiation of concepts through rapid developmental
transitions, the ubiquity of semantic illusions between such transitions, the
emergence of item typicality and category coherence as factors controlling the
speed of semantic processing, changing patterns of inductive projection over
development, and the conservation of semantic similarity in neural
representations across species. Thus, surprisingly, our simple neural model
qualitatively recapitulates many diverse regularities underlying semantic
development, while providing analytic insight into how the statistical
structure of an environment can interact with nonlinear deep learning dynamics
to give rise to these regularities.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37344">Chromatin accessibility dynamics across <i>C. elegans</i> development and ageing</a></h4>

An essential step for understanding the transcriptional circuits that control development and physiology is the global identification and characterization of regulatory elements. Here we present the first map of regulatory elements across the development and ageing of an animal, identifying 42,245 elements accessible in at least one <i>C. elegans</i> stage. Based on nuclear transcription profiles, we define 15,714 protein-coding promoters and 19,231 putative enhancers, and find that both types of element can drive orientation-independent transcription. Additionally, more than 1000 promoters produce transcripts antisense to protein coding genes, suggesting involvement in a widespread regulatory mechanism. We find that the accessibility of most elements changes during development and/or ageing and that patterns of accessibility change are linked to specific developmental or physiological processes. The map and characterization of regulatory elements across <i>C. elegans</i> life provides a platform for understanding how transcription controls development and ageing.

Although a standard reinforcement learning model can capture many aspects of reward-seeking behaviors, it may not be practical for modeling human natural behaviors because of the richness of dynamic environments and limitations in cognitive resources. We propose a modular reinforcement learning model that addresses these factors. Based on this model, a modular inverse reinforcement learning algorithm is developed to estimate both the rewards and discount factors from human behavioral data, which allows predictions of human navigation behaviors in virtual reality with high accuracy across different subjects and with different tasks. Complex human navigation trajectories in novel environments can be reproduced by an artificial agent that is based on the modular model. This model provides a strategy for estimating the subjective value of actions and how they influence sensory-motor decisions in natural behavior.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/c92ynP6WQ2o" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Sensory prostheses can restore aspects of natural sensation by delivering electrical current directly into sensory circuits. An effective sensory prosthetic should be capable of generating reliable real-time perceptual signals for hours each day over many years. However, we still know little regarding the stability of percepts produced by electrical microstimulation of cerebral sensory cortex when stimulation is delivered repeatedly over long periods. Developing methods that yield highly sensitive and reliable assessments of a subject’s sensitivity to stimulation is important for developing prosthetic devices that can mimic the constant stream of information inherent in daily experience. Here, we trained rhesus monkeys to report electrical microstimulation of their primary visual cortex (V1) and measured how repeated stimulation affected the minimal electrical current needed to generate a percept (behavioral detection threshold). Using adaptive staircase procedures with a two-alternative forced-choice detection task, we obtained highly reliable detection threshold measures with as few as 100 trials. Using either chronically implanted or acutely inserted microelectrodes, we found that repeated electrical microstimulation elevated detection thresholds, with effects persisting between daily testing sessions. Our results demonstrate task designs that can support rapid and reliable measurements of detection thresholds, and point to the need for validation that detection thresholds in targeted structures will be sufficiently stable in the face of the amount of chronic stimulation that will be required for effective sensory prosthetics.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Delivering electrical current into sensory brain areas could enable those with compromised sensory systems to partially recover lost senses. Whether repeated stimulation of central sites in the brain changes the ability of the stimulated site to support perception remains unresolved. We present methods for rapid, bias-free and repeatable measures of behavioral thresholds for detecting microstimulation and show that repeated electrical stimulation of visual cortex impairs the ability of monkeys to perceive that stimulation. The results have important implications for the development and use of sensory prosthetics.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>The role of orexin during development, and especially in terms of spinal cord function, is not well understood. It is for this reason that we focused on the network actions of orexin during the first week of development. We found that orexinergic fibres were present in the lumbar spinal cord of P0-3 mice. The fibres were expressed mainly in the dorsal horn, but occasional fibres were observed in the ventral horn. Both Orexin A (OXA) and Orexin B (OXB) increased the motoneurons (MNs) tonic neurogram discharge. However, only OXA was found to significantly increase spontaneous bursting activity and the frequency of fictive locomotor bursts. We show that OXA is able to act directly onto MNs. To test the contribution of the recurrent MN collaterals we blocked the nicotinic cholinergic drive and observed that OXA retained its ability to increase fictive locomotor activity. Additionally, we recorded neurograms from ventral lateral funiculi (VLF), where OXA had no effect on population discharge. These effects were also confirmed by recording from descending commissural interneurons via patch recordings. The loci of OXA’s effects were further investigated in a dorsal horn removed preparation where OXA also shows an increase in the discharge from ventral root neurograms but no increase in frequency of spontaneous or fictive locomotion burst activity. In summary, multiple lines of evidence from our work demonstrate the robust effects of orexins on spinal cord networks and MNs at the time of birth.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Orexinergic cell recordings show that the cell population is highly active during locomotion. In this study, we show that during the first neonatal week, orexin fibres and receptors are present within the spinal cord and that orexins can affect spinal locomotor circuitry. We examine their effects on motoneuron firing and commissural interneurons. Overall, our work establishes that the orexin family contributes to the control of spinal motor function.</p>

<p>Pharmacoresistant epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in which increased neuronal intrinsic excitability and synaptic excitation lead to pathologically synchronous behavior in the brain. In the majority of experimental and theoretical epilepsy models, epilepsy is associated with reduced inhibition in the pathological neural circuits, yet effects of intrinsic excitability are usually not explicitly analyzed. Here we present a novel neural mass model that includes intrinsic excitability in the form of spike-frequency adaptation in the excitatory population. We validated our model using local field potential (LFP) data recorded from human hippocampal/subicular slices. We found that synaptic conductances and slow adaptation in the excitatory population both play essential roles for generating seizures and pre-ictal oscillations. Using bifurcation analysis, we found that transitions towards seizure and back to the resting state take place via Andronov–Hopf bifurcations. These simulations therefore suggest that single neuron adaptation as well as synaptic inhibition are responsible for orchestrating seizure dynamics and transition towards the epileptic state.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0340-18.2018v1?rss=1">Evolution of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in vertebrates</a></h4>

Abstract<p>The family of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) consists of five members in mammals, encoded by the <i>CHRM1</i>-5 genes. The mAChRs are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) which can be divided into two subfamilies: M2 and M4 receptors coupling to G<sub>i/o</sub> and M1, M3 and M5 receptors coupling to G<sub>q/11</sub>. However, despite the fundamental roles played by these receptors their evolution in vertebrates has not yet been fully described. We have combined sequence-based phylogenetic analyses with comparisons of exon-intron organization and conserved synteny in order to deduce the evolution of the mAChR receptors. Our analyses verify the existence of two ancestral genes prior to the two vertebrate tetraploidizations (1R and 2R). After these events, one gene had duplicated resulting in <i>CHRM2</i> and <i>CHRM4</i> and the other had triplicated forming the <i>CHRM1, CHRM3</i> and <i>CHRM5</i> subfamily. All five genes are still present in all vertebrate groups investigated except the <i>CHRM1</i> gene which has not been identified in some of the teleosts or in chicken or any other birds. Interestingly, the third tetraploidization (3R) that took place in the teleost predecessor resulted in duplicates of all five mAChR genes of which all ten are present in zebrafish. One of the copies of the <i>CHRM2</i> and <i>CHRM3</i> genes and both <i>CHRM4</i> copies have gained introns in teleosts. Not a single separate (non-tetraploidization) duplicate has been identified in any vertebrate species. These results clarify the evolution of the vertebrate mAChR family and reveal a doubled repertoire in zebrafish, inviting studies of gene neo- and sub-functionalization.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Despite their pivotal physiological role, the evolution of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) has not yet been resolved. By investigating the genomes of a broad selection of vertebrate species and combining three different types of data, namely sequence based phylogeny, conserved synteny and intron organization, we have deduced the evolution of the mAChR genes in relation to the major vertebrate tetraploidizations (1R, 2R and 3R). Our analyses show that all vertebrate mAChR gene duplications resulted from the tetraploidizations. Interestingly, following 3R, zebrafish doubled its gene number, resulting in the ten mAChR genes present. By knowing how and when the mAChR genes arose, studies of receptor subtype specialization and possible neo- or sub-functionalization can follow.</p>

<p>The occurrence of sleep is widespread over the large majority of animal
species, suggesting a specific evolutionary strategy. The activity displayed in
such a state is known to be beneficial for cognitive functions, stabilizing
memories and improving the performances in several tasks. Despite this, a
theoretical and computational approach to achieve the understanding of such
mechanism is still lacking. In this paper we show the effect of sleep-like
activity on a simplified thalamo-cortical model which is trained to encode and
retrieve images of handwritten digits. We show that, if
spike-timing-dependent-plasticity (STDP) is active during sleep, the
connections among groups of neurons associated to instances of the same class
(digit) are enhanced, and that the internal representation is hierarchical and
orthogonalized. Such effect might be beneficial to the network to obtain better
performances in retrieval and classification tasks and to create hierarchies of
categories in integrated representations. The model leverages on the
coincidence of top-down contextual information with bottom-up sensory flow
during the training phase and on the integration of top-down predictions and
bottom-up pathways during deep-sleep-like slow oscillations.

<p>Graphene-based materials are the focus of intense research efforts to devise
novel theranostic strategies for targeting the central nervous system. In this
work, we have investigated the consequences of long-term exposure of primary
rat astrocytes to pristine graphene (GR) and graphene oxide (GO) flakes. We
demonstrate that GR/GO interfere with a variety of intracellular processes as a
result of their internalization through the endo-lysosomal pathway.
Graphene-exposed astrocytes acquire a more differentiated morphological
phenotype associated with extensive cytoskeletal rearrangements. Profound
functional alterations are induced by GO internalization, including the
upregulation of inward-rectifying K+ channels and of Na+-dependent glutamate
uptake, which are linked to the astrocyte capacity to control the extracellular
homeostasis. Interestingly, GO-pretreated astrocytes promote the functional
maturation of co-cultured primary neurons by inducing an increase in intrinsic
excitability and in the density of GABAergic synapses. The results indicate
that graphene nanomaterials profoundly affect astrocyte physiology in vitro,
with consequences for neuronal network activity. This work supports the view
that GO-based materials could be of great interest to address pathologies of
the central nervous system associated to astrocyte dysfunctions.

<p>The human brain cortical layer has a convoluted morphology that is unique to
each individual. Characterization of the cortical morphology is necessary in
longitudinal studies of structural brain change, as well as in discriminating
individuals in health and disease. A method for encoding the cortical
morphology in the form of a graph is presented. The design of graphs that
encode the global cerebral hemisphere cortices as well as localized cortical
regions is proposed. Spectral features of these graphs are then studied and
proposed as descriptors of cortical morphology. As proof-of-concept of their
applicability in characterizing cortical morphology, the descriptors are
studied in the context of discriminating individuals based on their sex.

<p>Abnormal synchronisation has been associated with epileptic seizures, one of
the most common brain disease. Due to this fact, a better understanding of
neuronal synchronisation mechanisms can help in the epilepsy treatment. We
study neuronal synchronisation by means of a randomly network with excitatory
and inhibitory synapses, where the neuron model is given by the adaptive
exponential integrate-and-fire. In our network, we verify that the decrease in
the influence of inhibition can generate synchronisation from a pattern of
desynchronised spikes. The transition from desynchronous spikes to synchronous
bursts activities, induced by varying the synaptic coupling, emerges in a
hysteretic loop due to a bistable regime where normal (desynchronous) or
abnormal (synchronous) regimes exist. We show that, for parameters within the
bistable region, a square current pulse can trigger the abnormal synchronous
regime, a process we claim to reproduce features of an epileptic seizure. We
can also suppress it, as well. Suppression can be achieved through a current
with small amplitude applying on less than 10\% of neurons. Therefore, our
results demonstrate that electrical stimulation not only can trigger
synchronous behaviours, but also can be an effective treatment for epileptic
seizures induced in a bistable regime.

<p>Often, large, high dimensional datasets collected across multiple modalities
can be organized as a higher order tensor. Low-rank tensor decomposition then
arises as a powerful and widely used tool to discover simple low dimensional
structures underlying such data. However, we currently lack a theoretical
understanding of the algorithmic behavior of low-rank tensor decompositions. We
derive Bayesian approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms for recovering
arbitrarily shaped low-rank tensors buried within noise, and we employ dynamic
mean field theory to precisely characterize their performance. Our theory
reveals the existence of phase transitions between easy, hard and impossible
inference regimes, and displays an excellent match with simulations. Moreover,
it reveals several qualitative surprises compared to the behavior of symmetric,
cubic tensor decomposition. Finally, we compare our AMP algorithm to the most
commonly used algorithm, alternating least squares (ALS), and demonstrate that
AMP significantly outperforms ALS in the presence of noise.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Reward-predictive stimuli can increase an automatic response tendency, which needs to be counteracted by effortful response inhibition when this tendency is inappropriate for the current task. Here we investigated how the human brain implements this dynamic process by adopting a reward-modulated Simon task while acquiring EEG and fMRI data in separate sessions. In the Simon task, a lateral target stimulus triggers an automatic response tendency of the spatially corresponding hand, which needs to be overcome if the activated hand is opposite to what the task requires, thereby delaying the response. We associated high or low reward with different targets, the location of which could be congruent or incongruent with the correct response hand. High-reward targets elicited larger Simon effects than low-reward targets, suggesting an increase in the automatic response tendency induced by the stimulus location. This tendency was accompanied by modulations of the lateralized readiness potential over the motor cortex, and was inhibited soon after if the high-reward targets were incongruent with the correct response hand. Moreover, this process was accompanied by enhanced theta oscillations in medial frontal cortex and enhanced activity in a frontobasal ganglia network. With dynamical causal modeling, we further demonstrated that the connection from presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA) to right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) played a crucial role in modulating the reward-modulated response inhibition. Our results support a dynamic neural model of reward-induced response activation and inhibition, and shed light on the neural communication between reward and cognitive control in generating adaptive behaviors.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The success of humans in novel environments is partially supported by our ability to implement new task procedures via instructions. This complex skill has been associated with the activity of control-related brain areas. Current models link fronto-parietal and cingulo-opercular networks with transient and sustained modes of cognitive control, based on observations during repetitive task settings or rest. The current study extends this dual model to novel instructed tasks. We employed a mixed design and an instruction-following task to extract phasic and tonic brain signals associated with the encoding and implementation of novel verbal rules. We also performed a representation similarity analysis to capture consistency in task-set encoding within trial epochs. Our findings show that both networks are involved while following novel instructions: transiently, during the implementation of the instruction, and in a sustained fashion, across novel trials blocks. Moreover, the multivariate results showed that task representations in the cingulo-opercular network were more stable than in the fronto-parietal one. Our data extend the dual model of cognitive control to novel demanding situations, highlighting the high flexibility of control-related regions in adopting different temporal profiles.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We examined the responses of neurons in posterior parietal area 7a to passive rotational and translational self-motion stimuli, while systematically varying the speed of visually simulated (optic flow cues) or actual (vestibular cues) self-motion. Contrary to a general belief that responses in area 7a are predominantly visual, we found evidence for a vestibular dominance in self-motion processing. Only a small fraction of neurons showed multisensory convergence of visual/vestibular and linear/angular self-motion cues. These findings suggest possibly independent neuronal population codes for visual versus vestibular and linear versus angular self-motion. Neural responses scaled with self-motion magnitude (i.e., speed) but temporal dynamics were diverse across the population. Analyses of laminar recordings showed a strong distance-dependent decrease for correlations in stimulus-induced (signal correlation) and stimulus-independent (noise correlation) components of spike-count variability, supporting the notion that neurons are spatially clustered with respect to their sensory representation of motion. Single-unit and multiunit response patterns were also correlated, but no other systematic dependencies on cortical layers or columns were observed. These findings describe a likely independent multimodal neural code for linear and angular self-motion in a posterior parietal area of the macaque brain that is connected to the hippocampal formation.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Recent evidence suggests a systematic cultural difference in the volume/thickness of prefrontal regions of the brain. However, origins of this difference remain unclear. Here, we addressed this gap by adopting a unique genetic approach. People who carry the 7- or 2-repeat (7/2-R) allele of the dopamine D4 receptor gene (<span style="font-style: italic;">DRD4</span>) are more sensitive to environmental influences, including cultural influences. Therefore, if the difference in brain structure is due to cultural influences, it should be moderated by <span style="font-style: italic;">DRD4</span>. We recruited 132 young adults (both European Americans and Asian-born East Asians). Voxel-based morphometry showed that gray matter (GM) volume of the medial prefrontal cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex was significantly greater among European Americans than among East Asians. Moreover, the difference in GM volume was significantly more pronounced among carriers of the 7/2-R allele of <span style="font-style: italic;">DRD4</span> than among non-carriers. This pattern was robust in an alternative measure assessing cortical thickness. A further exploratory analysis showed that among East Asian carriers, the number of years spent in the U.S. predicted increased GM volume in the orbitofrontal cortex. The present evidence is consistent with a view that culture shapes the brain by mobilizing epigenetic pathways that are gradually established through socialization and enculturation.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is a promising treatment for psychiatric and neurologic conditions, but outcomes are variable across treated individuals. In principle, precise targeting of individual-specific features of functional brain networks could improve the efficacy of NIBS interventions. Network theory predicts that the role of a node in a network can be inferred from its connections; as such, we hypothesized that targeting individual-specific “hub” brain areas with NIBS should impact cognition more than nonhub brain areas. Here, we first demonstrate that the spatial positioning of hubs is variable across individuals but reproducible within individuals upon repeated imaging. We then tested our hypothesis in healthy individuals using a prospective, within-subject, double-blind design. Inhibition of a hub with continuous theta burst stimulation disrupted information processing during working-memory more than inhibition of a nonhub area, despite targets being separated by only a few centimeters on the right middle frontal gyrus of each subject. Based upon these findings, we conclude that individual-specific brain network features are functionally relevant and could leveraged as stimulation sites in future NIBS interventions.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Training and immobilization are powerful drivers of use-dependent plasticity in human primary motor hand area (M1<sub>HAND</sub>). In young right-handed volunteers, corticomotor representations of the left first dorsal interosseus and abductor digiti minimi muscles were mapped with neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to elucidate how finger-specific training and immobilization interact within M1<sub>HAND</sub>. A first group of volunteers trained to track a moving target on a smartphone with the left index or little finger for one week. Linear sulcus shape-informed TMS mapping revealed that the tracking skill acquired with the trained finger was transferred to the nontrained finger of the same hand. The cortical representations of the trained and nontrained finger muscle converged in proportion with skill transfer. In a second group, the index or little finger were immobilized for one week. Immobilization alone attenuated the corticomotor representation and pre-existing tracking skill of the immobilized finger. In a third group, the detrimental effects of finger immobilization were blocked by concurrent training of the nonimmobilized finger. Conversely, immobilization of the nontrained fingers accelerated learning in the adjacent trained finger during the first 2 days of training. Together, the results provide novel insight into use-dependent cortical plasticity, revealing synergistic rather than competitive interaction patterns within M1<sub>HAND</sub>.</span>

Trust pervades nearly every social aspect of our daily lives, and its disruption is a significant factor in mental illness. Research in the field of neuroeconomics has gained a deeper understanding of the neuropsychoeconomic (NPE) underpinnings of trust by combining complementary methodologies from neuroscience, psychology, and economics. However, a coherent model of trust that integrates separate findings under a conceptual framework is still lacking. Here, we sketch out an integrative NPE model that explains how the interactions of psychoeconomic components engage domain-general large-scale brain networks in shaping trust behavior over time.

Cerebellar functional networks are topographically individual-specific. Cerebellar intrinsic fMRI signals lag those in cortex by 100–400 ms. The frontoparietal control network is greatly overrepresented (&gt;2-fold), suggesting that the cerebellum is important for the adaptive control of the brain’s cognitive processes.

One of the many challenges with battling alcohol and substance use disorders is the risk of relapse. This study aims to understand the molecular basis of cravings associated with relapse by demonstrating how alcohol hijacks the Notch signaling pathway. The authors found that alcohol activates Notch in a memory circuit in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and that this is associated with misregulation of gene isoforms associated with memory formation. These findings provide insight into how alcohol induces such long-lasting cravings.

<p>by Frank S. Heldt, Reece Lunstone, John J. Tyson, Béla Novák</p>

The size of a cell sets the scale for all biochemical processes within it, thereby affecting cellular fitness and survival. Hence, cell size needs to be kept within certain limits and relatively constant over multiple generations. However, how cells measure their size and use this information to regulate growth and division remains controversial. Here, we present two mechanistic mathematical models of the budding yeast (<i>S</i>. <i>cerevisiae</i>) cell cycle to investigate competing hypotheses on size control: inhibitor dilution and titration of nuclear sites. Our results suggest that an inhibitor-dilution mechanism, in which cell growth dilutes the transcriptional inhibitor Whi5 against the constant activator Cln3, can facilitate size homeostasis. This is achieved by utilising a positive feedback loop to establish a fixed size threshold for the Start transition, which efficiently couples cell growth to cell cycle progression. Yet, we show that inhibitor dilution cannot reproduce the size of mutants that alter the cell’s overall ploidy and <i>WHI5</i> gene copy number. By contrast, size control through titration of Cln3 against a constant number of genomic binding sites for the transcription factor SBF recapitulates both size homeostasis and the size of these mutant strains. Moreover, this model produces an imperfect ‘sizer’ behaviour in G1 and a ‘timer’ in S/G2/M, which combine to yield an ‘adder’ over the whole cell cycle; an observation recently made in experiments. Hence, our model connects these phenomenological data with the molecular details of the cell cycle, providing a systems-level perspective of budding yeast size control.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/96FIxHm1CYc" width="1" />

Thermodynamics dictates the structure and function of metabolism. Redox reactions drive cellular energy and material flow. Hence, accurately quantifying the thermodynamics of redox reactions should reveal design principles that shape cellular metabolism. However, only few redox potentials have been measured, and mostly with inconsistent experimental setups. Here, we develop a quantum chemistry approach to calculate redox potentials of biochemical reactions and demonstrate our method predicts experimentally measured potentials with unparalleled accuracy. We then calculate the potentials of all redox pairs that can be generated from biochemically relevant compounds and highlight fundamental trends in redox biochemistry. We further address the question of why NAD/NADP are used as primary electron carriers, demonstrating how their physiological potential range fits the reactions of central metabolism and minimizes the concentration of reactive carbonyls. The use of quantum chemistry can revolutionize our understanding of biochemical phenomena by enabling fast and accurate calculation of thermodynamic values.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fxBdh4lAOFc" width="1" />

Multicellular tumour spheroids capture many characteristics of human tumour microenvironments, including hypoxia, and represent an experimentally tractable <i>in vitro</i> model for studying interactions between radiotherapy and anticancer drugs. However, interpreting spheroid data is challenging because of limited ability to observe cell fate within spheroids dynamically. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a hybrid continuum/agent-based model (ABM) for HCT116 tumour spheroids, parameterised using experimental models (monolayers and multilayers) in which reaction and diffusion can be measured directly. In the ABM, cell fate is simulated as a function of local oxygen, glucose and drug concentrations, determined by solving diffusion equations and intracellular reactions. The model is lattice-based, with cells occupying discrete locations on a 3D grid embedded within a coarser grid that encompasses the culture medium; separate solvers are employed for each grid. The generated concentration fields account for depletion in the medium and specify concentration-time profiles within the spheroid. Cell growth and survival are determined by intracellular oxygen and glucose concentrations, the latter based on direct measurement of glucose diffusion/reaction (in multilayers) for the first time. The ABM reproduces known features of spheroids including overall growth rate, its oxygen and glucose dependence, peripheral cell proliferation, central hypoxia and necrosis. We extended the ABM to describe in detail the hypoxia-dependent interaction between ionising radiation and a hypoxia-activated prodrug (SN30000), again using experimentally determined parameters; the model accurately simulated clonogenic cell killing in spheroids, while inclusion of reversible cell cycle delay was required to account for the marked spheroid growth delay after combined radiation and SN30000. This ABM of spheroid growth and response exemplifies the utility of integrating computational and experimental tools for investigating radiation/drug interactions, and highlights the critical importance of understanding oxygen, glucose and drug concentration gradients in interpreting activity of therapeutic agents in spheroid models.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nj5iKPxgTiA" width="1" />

<p>Publication date: February 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 54</p><p>Author(s): Jeffrey M Donlea</p><div><p>Sleep has been universally conserved across animal species. The basic functions of sleep remain unclear, but insufficient sleep impairs memory acquisition and retention in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Sleep is also a homeostatic process that is influenced not only by the amount of time awake, but also by neural activity and plasticity. Because of the breadth and precision of available genetic tools, the fruit fly has become a powerful model system to understand sleep regulation and function. Importantly, these tools enable the dissection of memory-encoding circuits at the level of individual neurons, and have allowed the development of genetic tools to induce sleep on-demand. This review describes recent investigations of the role for sleep in memory using <em>Drosophila</em> and current hypotheses of sleep’s functions for supporting plasticity, learning, and memory.</p></div>

<p>A brain clock, constituted of ~20,000 peptidergically heterogeneous neurons, is located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). While many peptidergic cell types have been identified, little is known about the connections among these neurons in mice. We first sought to identify contacts among major peptidergic cell types in the SCN using triple-label fluorescent immunocytochemistry (ICC). To this end, contacts among vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), and calretinin (CALR) cells of the core, and arginine vasopressin (AVP) and met-enkephalin (ENK) cells of the shell were analyzed. Some core-to-shell and shell-to-core communications are specialized. We found that in wild-type (WT) mice, AVP fibers make extremely sparse contacts onto VIP neurons but contacts in the reverse direction are numerous. In contrast, AVP fibers make more contacts onto GRP neurons than conversely. For the other cell types tested, largely reciprocal connections are made. These results point to peptidergic cell type-specific communications between core and shell SCN neurons. To further understand the impact of VIP-to-AVP communication, we next explored the SCN in VIP-deficient mice (VIP-KO). In these animals, AVP expression is markedly reduced in the SCN, but it is not altered in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON). Surprisingly, in VIP-KO mice, the number of AVP appositions onto other peptidergic cell types is not different from controls. Colchicine administration, which blocks AVP transport, restored the numbers of AVP neurons in VIP-KO to that of WT littermates. The results indicate that VIP has an important role in modulating AVP expression levels in the SCN in this mouse.</p>

Abstract
<p>Our aim was to study the mechanisms that contribute to the development of discrete thalamic nuclei during mouse embryogenesis (both sexes included). We characterized the expression of the transcription factor coding gene <i>Zic4</i> and the distribution of cells that expressed <i>Zic4</i> in their lineage. We used genetic fate mapping to show that <i>Zic4</i>-lineage cells mainly contribute to a subset of thalamic nuclei, in particular the lateral geniculate nuclei (LGNs), which are crucial components of the visual pathway. We observed that almost all <i>Zic4</i>-lineage diencephalic progenitors express the transcription factor Pax6 at variable location-dependent levels. We used conditional mutagenesis to delete either one or both copies of <i>Pax6</i> from <i>Zic4</i>-lineage cells. We found that <i>Zic4</i>-lineage cells carrying either homozygous or heterozygous loss of <i>Pax6</i> contributed in abnormally high numbers to one or both of the main lateral geniculate nuclei (LGNs). This could not be attributed to a change in cell production and was likely due to altered sorting of thalamic cells. Our results indicate that positional information encoded by the levels of Pax6 in diencephalic progenitors is an important determinant of the eventual locations of their daughter cells.</p>

Abstract
<p>The quick and reliable detection and identification of a tastant in the mouth regulate nutrient uptake and toxin expulsion. Consistent with the pivotal role of the gustatory system, taste category information (e.g., sweet, salty) is represented during the earliest phase of the taste-evoked cortical response (Crouzet et al., 2015), and different tastes are perceived and responded to within only a few hundred milliseconds, in rodents (Perez et al., 2013) and humans (Bujas, 1935). Currently, it is unknown whether taste detection and discrimination are sequential or parallel processes, i.e., whether you know what it is as soon as you taste it. To investigate the sequence of processing steps involved in taste perceptual decisions, participants tasted sour, salty, bitter, and sweet solutions and performed a taste-detection and a taste-discrimination task. We measured response times (RTs) and 64-channel scalp electrophysiological recordings and tested the link between the timing of behavioral decisions and the timing of neural taste representations determined with multivariate pattern analyses. Irrespective of taste and task, neural decoding onset and behavioral RTs were strongly related, demonstrating that differences between taste judgments are reflected early during chemosensory encoding. Neural and behavioral detection times were faster for the iso-hedonic salty and sour tastes than their discrimination time. No such latency difference was observed for sweet and bitter, which differ hedonically. Together, these results indicate that the human gustatory system detects a taste faster than it discriminates between tastes, yet hedonic computations may run in parallel (Perez et al., 2013) and facilitate taste identification.</p>

Abstract
<p>In central respiratory circuitry, synaptic excitation is responsible for synchronizing neuronal activity in the different respiratory rhythm phases, whereas chloride-mediated inhibition is important for shaping the respiratory pattern itself. The potassium chloride cotransporter KCC2, which serves to maintain low intraneuronal Cl<sup>–</sup> concentration and thus render chloride-mediated synaptic signaling inhibitory, exists in two isoforms, KCC2a and KCC2b. KCC2 is essential for functional breathing motor control at birth, but the specific contribution of the KCC2a isoform remains unknown. Here, to address this issue, we investigated the respiratory phenotype of mice deficient for KCC2a. <i>In vivo</i> plethysmographic recordings revealed that KCC2a-deficient pups at P0 transiently express an abnormally low breathing rate and a high occurrence of apneas. Immunostainings confirmed that KCC2a is normally expressed in the brainstem neuronal groups involved in breathing (pre-Bötzinger complex, parafacial respiratory group, hypoglossus nucleus) and is absent in these regions in the KCC2a<sup>–/–</sup> mutant. However, in variously reduced <i>in vitro</i> medullary preparations, spontaneous rhythmic respiratory activity is similar to that expressed in wild-type preparations, as is hypoglossal motor output, and no respiratory pauses are detected, suggesting that the rhythm-generating networks are not intrinsically affected in mutants at P0. In contrast, inhibitory neuromodulatory influences exerted by the pons on respiratory rhythmogenesis are stronger in the mutant, thereby explaining the breathing anomalies observed <i>in vivo</i>. Thus, our results indicate that the KCC2a isoform is important for establishing proper breathing behavior at the time of birth, but by acting at sites that are extrinsic to the central respiratory networks themselves.</p>

<p>Accumulation of α-Synuclein (α-Syn) causes Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as other synucleopathies. α-Syn is the major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, the proteinaceous aggregates that are a hallmark of sporadic PD. In familial forms of PD, mutations or copy number variations in <i>SNCA</i> (the α-Syn gene) result in a net increase of its protein levels. Furthermore, common risk variants tied to PD are associated with small increases of <i>wild-type</i> α-Syn levels. These findings are further bolstered by animal studies which show that overexpression of α-Syn is sufficient to cause PD-like features. Thus, increased α-Syn levels are intrinsically tied to PD pathogenesis and underscore the importance of identifying the factors that regulate its levels. In this study, we establish a pooled RNAi screening approach and validation pipeline to probe the druggable genome for modifiers of α-Syn levels and identify 60 promising targets. Using a cross-species, tiered validation approach, we validate six strong candidates that modulate α-Syn levels and toxicity in cell lines, <i>Drosophila</i>, human neurons, and mouse brain of both sexes. More broadly, this genetic strategy and validation pipeline can be applied for the identification of therapeutic targets for disorders driven by dosage-sensitive proteins.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We present a research strategy for the systematic identification and validation of genes modulating the levels of α-Synuclein, a protein involved in Parkinson's disease. A cell-based screen of the druggable genome (&gt;7,500 genes that are potential therapeutic targets) yielded many modulators of α-Synuclein that were subsequently confirmed and validated in <i>Drosophila</i>, human neurons, and mouse brain. This approach has broad applicability to the multitude of neurological diseases that are caused by mutations in genes whose dosage is critical for brain function.</p>

<p>Sleep-specific oscillations of spindles and slow waves are generated through thalamocortical and corticocortical loops, respectively, and provide a unique opportunity to measure the integrity of these neuronal systems. Understanding the relative contribution of genetic factors to sleep oscillations is important for determining whether they constitute useful endophenotypes that mark vulnerability to psychiatric illness. Using high-density sleep EEG recordings in human adolescent twin pairs (<i>n</i> = 60; 28 females), we find that over posterior regions 80–90% of the variance in slow oscillations, slow wave, and spindle activity is due to genes. Surprisingly, slow (10–12 Hz) and fast (12–16 Hz) anterior spindle amplitude and  power are largely driven by environmental factors shared among the twins. To our knowledge this is the first example of a neural phenotype that exhibits a strong influence of nature in one brain region, and nurture in another. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of the sleep EEG as a reliable and easy to measure endophenotype during adolescence. This measure may be used to measure disease risk in development before the onset of a psychiatric disorder; the location within the brain of deficits in sleep neurophysiology may suggest whether the ultimate cause is genetic or environmental.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Two cardinal oscillations of sleep, slow waves and sleep spindles, play an important role in the core functions of sleep including memory consolidation, synaptic plasticity, and the recuperative function of sleep. In this study, we use a behavioral genetics approach to examine the heritability of sleep neurophysiology using high-density EEG in a sample of early adolescent twins. Our findings reveal a strong influence of both environmental and genetic factors in shaping these oscillations, dependent on brain region. Thus, during a developmental period when brain structure and function is in flux, we find that the sleep EEG is among the most heritable of human traits over circumscribed brain regions.</p>

<p>Humans with amygdalar lesions show proportional reductions of the emotional response to facial expressions in the fusiform face area as well as deficits in emotion recognition from facial expressions. While processing of bodily expressions shares many similarities with facial expressions, there is no substantial evidence that lesions of the amygdala result in similar behavioral and neural sequelae. We combined behavioral assessment with functional neuroimaging in a group of male and female humans with unilateral anterior temporal lobe (ATL) resections, including the amygdala (right: <i>n</i> = 10; left: <i>n</i> = 10) and 12 matched controls. The objective was to assess whether the amygdala is crucial for the recognition of body expressions and for modulatory effects on distant areas during perception of body expressions. The behavioral results revealed normal performance in both patient groups on emotion categorization of body expressions. The neuroimaging results showed that ATL patients displayed no enhanced activations in right fusiform body area and left extrastriate body area and that left ATL patients additionally displayed no enhanced activations in right posterior superior temporal sulcus and right extrastriate body area, respectively. Multivoxel pattern analysis revealed altered categorization capacity between emotional and neutral stimuli in right posterior superior temporal sulcus in right ATL patients. In addition, we also found emotional enhancement in frontal, parietal, occipital, and cingulate regions in controls. Together, our data show that the amygdala and ATLs are not necessary for recognition of dynamic body expressions, but suggest that amygdala lesions affect body emotion processing in distant brain areas.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> For humans, information from emotional expressions of others is crucial to support social interactions. The majority of emotion studies has focused on facial expressions; however, in daily life, we also use information from body postures and body movement. Visual processing of body expressions relies on a brain network, including body-specific visual areas and visuomotor areas. Even though the importance of the amygdala and its modulatory effects on distant brain regions have been documented, it remains unclear whether the amygdala plays a crucial role in emotional body processing. By combining behavioral and neuroimaging data in patients with amygdalar lesions, we provide further evidence for its modulatory effect on distant areas during the perception of body expressions.</p>

<p>Hebbian synaptic plasticity at hippocampal Schaffer collateral synapses is tightly regulated by postsynaptic small conductance (SK) channels that restrict NMDA receptor activity. SK channels are themselves modulated by G-protein-coupled signaling pathways, but it is not clear under what conditions these are activated to enable synaptic plasticity. Here, we show that muscarinic M1 receptor (M1R) and type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1) signaling pathways, which are known to inhibit SK channels and thereby disinhibit NMDA receptors, converge to facilitate spine calcium transients during the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) at hippocampal Schaffer collateral synapses onto CA1 pyramidal neurons of male rats. Furthermore, mGluR1 activation is required for LTP induced by reactivated place-cell firing patterns that occur in sharp-wave ripple events during rest or sleep. In contrast, M1R activation is required for LTP induced by place-cell firing patterns during exploration. Thus, we describe a common mechanism that enables synaptic plasticity during both encoding and consolidation of memories within hippocampal circuits.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Memory ensembles in the hippocampus are formed during active exploration and consolidated during rest or sleep. These two distinct phases each require strengthening of synaptic connections by long-term potentiation (LTP). The neuronal activity patterns in each phase are very different, which makes it hard to map generalized rules for LTP induction onto both formation and consolidation phases. In this study, we show that inhibition of postsynaptic SK channels is a common necessary feature of LTP induction and that SK channel inhibition is achieved by separate but convergent metabotropic signaling pathways. Thus, we reveal a common mechanism for enabling LTP under distinct behavioral conditions.</p>

<p>Odorants are coded in the primary olfactory processing centers by spatially and temporally distributed patterns of glomerular activity. Whereas the spatial distribution of odorant-induced responses is known to be conserved across individuals, the universality of its temporal structure is still debated. Via fast two-photon calcium imaging, we analyzed the early phase of neuronal responses in the form of the activity onset latencies in the antennal lobe projection neurons of honeybee foragers. We show that each odorant evokes a stimulus-specific response latency pattern across the glomerular coding space. Moreover, we investigate these early response features for the first time across animals, revealing that the order of glomerular firing onsets is conserved across individuals and allows them to reliably predict odorant identity, but not concentration. These results suggest that the neuronal response latencies provide the first available code for fast odor identification.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Here, we studied early temporal coding in the primary olfactory processing centers of the honeybee brain by fast imaging of glomerular responses to different odorants across glomeruli and across individuals. Regarding the elusive role of rapid response dynamics in olfactory coding, we were able to clarify the following aspects: (1) the rank of glomerular activation is conserved across individuals, (2) its stimulus prediction accuracy is equal to that of the response amplitude code, and (3) it contains complementary information. Our findings suggest a substantial role of response latencies in odor identification, anticipating the static response amplitude code.</p>

<p>New myelin sheaths can be restored to demyelinated axons in a spontaneous regenerative process called remyelination. In general, new myelin sheaths are made by oligodendrocytes newly generated from a widespread population of adult CNS progenitors called oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). New myelin in CNS remyelination in both experimental models and clinical diseases can also be generated by Schwann cells (SCs), the myelin-forming cells of the PNS. Fate-mapping studies have shown that SCs contributing to remyelination in the CNS are often derived from OPCs and appear not to be derived from myelinating SCs from the PNS. In this study, we address whether CNS remyelinating SCs can also be generated from PNS-derived cells other than myelinating SCs. Using a genetic fate-mapping approach, we have found that a subpopulation of nonmyelinating SCs identified by the expression of the transcription factor Foxj1 also contribute to CNS SC remyelination, as well as to remyelination in the PNS. We also find that the ependymal cells lining the central canal of the spinal cord, which also express Foxj1, do not generate cells that contribute to CNS remyelination. These findings therefore identify a previously unrecognized population of PNS glia that can participate in the regeneration of new myelin sheaths following CNS demyelination.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Remyelination failure in chronic demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis drives the current quest for developing means by which remyelination in CNS can be enhanced therapeutically. Critical to this endeavor is the need to understand the mechanisms of remyelination, including the nature and identity of the cells capable of generating new myelin sheath-forming cells. Here, we report a previously unrecognized subpopulation of nonmyelinating Schwann cells (SCs) in the PNS, identified by the expression of the transcription factor Foxj1, which can give rise to SCs that are capable of remyelinating both PNS and CNS axons. These cells therefore represent a new cellular target for myelin regenerative strategies for the treatment of CNS disorders characterized by persistent demyelination.</p>

<p>Stac protein (named for its SH3- and cysteine-rich domains) was first identified in brain 20 years ago and is currently known to have three isoforms. Stac2, Stac1, and Stac3 transcripts are found at high, modest, and very low levels, respectively, in the cerebellum and forebrain, but their neuronal functions have been little investigated. Here, we tested the effects of Stac proteins on neuronal, high-voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Overexpression of the three Stac isoforms eliminated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation (CDI) of l-type current in rat neonatal hippocampal neurons (sex unknown), but not CDI of non-l-type current. Using heterologous expression in tsA201 cells (together with β and α<sub>2</sub>-<sub>1</sub> auxiliary subunits), we found that CDI for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 (the predominant, neuronal l-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels) was suppressed by all three Stac isoforms, whereas CDI for the P/Q channel, Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1, was not. For Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2, the inhibition of CDI by the Stac proteins appeared to involve their direct interaction with the channel's C terminus. Within the Stac proteins, a weakly conserved segment containing ~100 residues and linking the structurally conserved PKC C1 and SH3_1 domains was sufficient to fully suppress CDI. The presence of CDI for l-type current in control neonatal neurons raised the possibility that endogenous Stac levels are low in these neurons and Western blotting indicated that the expression of Stac2 was substantially increased in adult forebrain and cerebellum compared with neonate. Together, our results indicate that one likely function of neuronal Stac proteins is to tune Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via neuronal l-type channels.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Stac protein, first identified 20 years ago in brain, has recently been found to be essential for proper trafficking and function of the skeletal muscle l-type Ca2+ channel and is the site of mutations causing a severe, inherited human myopathy. In neurons, however, functions for Stac protein have remained unexplored. Here, we report that one likely function of neuronal Stac proteins is tuning Ca2+ entry via l-type, but not that via non-l-type, Ca2+ channels. Moreover, there is a large postnatal increase in protein levels of the major neuronal isoform (Stac2) in forebrain and cerebellum, which could provide developmental regulation of l-type channel Ca2+ signaling in these brain regions.</p>

<p>It was proposed that the <i>Drosophila amnesiac</i> gene (<i>amn</i>) is required for consolidation of aversive memory in the dorsal paired medial (DPM) neurons, a pair of large neurons that broadly innervate the mushroom bodies (MB), the fly center for olfactory learning and memory (Waddell et al., 2000). Yet, a conditional analysis showed that it was not possible to rescue the memory deficit of <i>amn<sup>X8</sup></i> null mutant flies when <i>amn</i> expression was restored only in the adult (DeZazzo et al., 1999), which led the authors to suggest that <i>amn</i> might be involved in the development of brain structures that normally promote adult olfactory memory. To further investigate temporal and spatial requirements of Amnesiac (AMN) peptide in memory, we used RNA interference in combination with conditional drivers. Experiments were conducted either in both sexes, or in either sexes. Our data show that acute modulation of <i>amn</i> expression in adult DPM neurons does not impact memory. We further show that <i>amn</i> expression is required for normal development of DPM neurons. Detailed enhancer trap analyses suggest that <i>amn</i> transcription unit contains two distinct enhancers, one specific of DPM neurons, and the other specific of α/β MB neurons. This prompted us to investigate extensively the role of AMN in the adult MB. Together, our results demonstrate that <i>amn</i> is acutely required in adult α/β MB neurons for middle-term and long-term memory. The data thus establish that <i>amn</i> plays two distinct roles. Its expression is required in DPM neurons for their development, and in adult MB for olfactory memory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The <i>Drosophila amnesiac</i> gene encodes a neuropeptide whose expression was proposed to be required for consolidation of aversive memory in the dorsal paired medial (DPM) neurons, a pair of large neurons that broadly innervate the mushroom bodies (MB), the olfactory memory center. Here, we investigated <i>amnesiac</i> temporal and spatial requirement using conditional tools that allowed us to manipulate its expression in selected neurons. This work leads to a complete reassessment of the role of <i>amnesiac</i> in brain development and memory. We show that <i>amnesiac</i> is required for two distinct processes: for normal development of DPM neurons, and in adult MB for memory.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/43/9186?rss=1">CACHD1 is an {alpha}2{delta}-Like Protein That Modulates CaV3 Voltage-Gated Calcium Channel Activity</a></h4>

<p>The putative cache (Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel and chemotaxis receptor) domain containing 1 (CACHD1) protein has predicted structural similarities to members of the α2 voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel auxiliary subunit family. CACHD1 mRNA and protein were highly expressed in the male mammalian CNS, in particular in the thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum, with a broadly similar tissue distribution to Ca<sub>V</sub>3 subunits, in particular Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1. In expression studies, CACHD1 increased cell-surface localization of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, and these proteins were in close proximity at the cell surface, consistent with the formation of CACHD1-Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 complexes. In functional electrophysiological studies, coexpression of human CACHD1 with Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2, and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 caused a significant increase in peak current density and corresponding increases in maximal conductance. By contrast, α2-1 had no effect on peak current density or maximal conductance in Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2, or Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3. A comparison of CACHD1-mediated increases in Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 current density and gating currents revealed an increase in channel open probability. In hippocampal neurons from male and female embryonic day 19 rats, CACHD1 overexpression increased Ca<sub>V</sub>3-mediated action potential firing frequency and neuronal excitability. These data suggest that CACHD1 is structurally an α2-like protein that functionally modulates Ca<sub>V</sub>3 voltage-gated calcium channel activity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This is the first study to characterize the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel and chemotaxis receptor domain containing 1 (CACHD1) protein. CACHD1 is widely expressed in the CNS, in particular in the thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum. CACHD1 distribution is similar to that of low voltage-activated (Ca<sub>V</sub>3, T-type) calcium channels, in particular to Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, a protein that regulates neuronal excitability and is a potential therapeutic target in conditions such as epilepsy and pain. CACHD1 is structurally an α2-like protein that functionally increases Ca<sub>V</sub>3 calcium current. CACHD1 increases the presence of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 at the cell surface, forms complexes with Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 at the cell surface, and causes an increase in channel open probability. In hippocampal neurons, CACHD1 causes increases in neuronal firing. Thus, CACHD1 represents a novel protein that modulates Ca<sub>V</sub>3 activity.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/43/9175?rss=1">Dreaming in NREM Sleep: A High-Density EEG Study of Slow Waves and Spindles</a></h4>

<p>Dreaming can occur in both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep. We recently showed that in both REM and NREM sleep, dreaming is associated with local decreases in slow wave activity (SWA) in posterior brain regions. To expand these findings, here we asked how specific features of slow waves and spindles, the hallmarks of NREM sleep, relate to dream experiences. Fourteen healthy human subjects (10 females) underwent nocturnal high-density EEG recordings combined with a serial awakening paradigm. Reports of dreaming, compared with reports of no experience, were preceded by fewer, smaller, and shallower slow waves, and faster spindles, especially in central and posterior cortical areas. We also identified a minority of very steep and large slow waves in frontal regions, which occurred on a background of reduced SWA and were associated with high-frequency power increases (local "microarousals") heralding the successful recall of dream content. These results suggest that the capacity of the brain to generate experiences during sleep is reduced in the presence of neuronal off-states in posterior and central brain regions, and that dream recall may be facilitated by the intermittent activation of arousal systems during NREM sleep.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> By combining high-density EEG recordings with a serial awakening paradigm in healthy subjects, we show that dreaming in non-rapid eye movement sleep occurs when slow waves in central and posterior regions are sparse, small, and shallow. We also identified a small subset of very large and steep frontal slow waves that are associated with high-frequency activity increases (local "microarousals") heralding successful recall of dream content. These results provide noninvasive measures that could represent a useful tool to infer the state of consciousness during sleep.</p>

<p>To date, histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub), a mark associated with transcriptional elongation and ongoing transcription, has not been linked to the development or maintenance of neuropathic pain states. Here, using male Sprague Dawley rats, we demonstrated spinal nerve ligation (SNL) induced behavioral allodynia and provoked ring finger protein 20 (RNF20)-dependent H2Bub in dorsal horn. Moreover, SNL provoked RNF20-mediated H2Bub phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) in the promoter fragments of <i>mGluR5</i>, thereby enhancing <i>mGluR5</i> transcription/expression in the dorsal horn. Conversely, focal knockdown of spinal RNF20 expression reversed not only SNL-induced allodynia but also RNF20/H2Bub/RNAPII phosphorylation-associated spinal <i>mGluR5</i> transcription/expression. Notably, TNF-α injection into naive rats and specific neutralizing antibody injection into SNL-induced allodynia rats revealed that TNF-α-associated allodynia involves the RNF20/H2Bub/RNAPII transcriptional axis to upregulate mGluR5 expression in the dorsal horn. Collectively, our findings indicated TNF-α induces RNF20-drived H2B monoubiquitination, which facilitates phosphorylated RNAPII-dependent <i>mGluR5</i> transcription in the dorsal horn for the development of neuropathic allodynia.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub), an epigenetic post-translational modification, positively correlated with gene expression. Here, TNF-α participated in neuropathic pain development by enhancing RNF20-mediated H2Bub, which facilitates phosphorylated RNAPII-dependent <i>mGluR5</i> transcription in dorsal horn. Our finding potentially identified neuropathic allodynia pathophysiological processes underpinning abnormal nociception processing and opens a new avenue for the development of novel analgesics.</p>

<p>The divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) is a multimetal transporter with a primary role in iron transport. Although DMT1 has been described previously in the CNS, nothing was known about the role of this metal transporter in oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination. To determine whether DMT1 is required for oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) maturation, we used siRNAs and the <i>Cre-lox</i> system to knock down/knock out DMT1 expression <i>in vitro</i> as well as <i>in vivo</i>. Blocking DMT1 synthesis in primary cultures of OPCs reduced oligodendrocyte iron uptake and significantly delayed OPC development. <i>In vivo</i>, a significant hypomyelination was found in DMT1 conditional knock-out mice in which DMT1 was postnatally deleted in NG2- or Sox10-positive OPCs. The brain of DMT1 knock-out animals presented a decrease in the expression levels of myelin proteins and a substantial reduction in the percentage of myelinated axons. This reduced postnatal myelination was accompanied by a decrease in the number of myelinating oligodendrocytes and a rise in proliferating OPCs. Furthermore, using the cuprizone model of demyelination, we established that DMT1 deletion in NG2-positive OPCs lead to less efficient remyelination of the adult brain. These results indicate that DMT1 is vital for OPC maturation and for the normal myelination of the mouse brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To determine whether divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), a multimetal transporter with a primary role in iron transport, is essential for oligodendrocyte development, we created two conditional knock-out mice in which DMT1 was postnatally deleted in NG2- or Sox10-positive oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). We have established that DMT1 is necessary for normal OPC maturation and is required for an efficient remyelination of the adult brain. Since iron accumulation by OPCs is indispensable for myelination, understanding the iron incorporation mechanism as well as the molecules involved is critical to design new therapeutic approaches to intervene in diseases in which the myelin sheath is damaged or lost.</p>

<p>A monosynaptic projection from the cortex to the subthalamic nucleus is thought to have an important role in basal ganglia function and in the mechanism of therapeutic subthalamic deep-brain stimulation, but in humans the evidence for its existence is limited. We sought physiological confirmation of the cortico-subthalamic hyperdirect pathway using invasive recording techniques in patients with Parkinson's disease (9 men, 1 woman). We measured sensorimotor cortical evoked potentials using a temporary subdural strip electrode in response to low-frequency deep-brain stimulation in patients undergoing awake subthalamic or pallidal lead implantations. Evoked potentials were grouped into very short latency (&lt;2 ms), short latency (2–10 ms), and long latency (10–100 ms) from the onset of the stimulus pulse. Subthalamic and pallidal stimulation resulted in very short-latency evoked potentials at 1.5 ms in the primary motor cortex accompanied by EMG-evoked potentials consistent with corticospinal tract activation. Subthalamic, but not pallidal stimulation, resulted in three short-latency evoked potentials at 2.8, 5.8, and 7.7 ms in a widespread cortical distribution, consistent with antidromic activation of the hyperdirect pathway. Long-latency potentials were evoked by both targets, with subthalamic responses lagging pallidal responses by 10–20 ms, consistent with orthodromic activation of the thalamocortical pathway. The amplitude of the first short-latency evoked potential was predictive of the chronic therapeutic stimulation contact.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This is the first physiological demonstration of the corticosubthalamic hyperdirect pathway and its topography at high spatial resolution in humans. We studied cortical potentials evoked by deep-brain stimulation in patients with Parkinson's disease undergoing awake lead implantation surgery. Subthalamic stimulation resulted in multiple short-latency responses consistent with activation of hyperdirect pathway, whereas no such response was present during pallidal stimulation. We contrast these findings with very short latency, direct corticospinal tract activations, and long-latency responses evoked through polysynaptic orthodromic projections. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating the hyperdirect pathway into models of human basal ganglia function.</p>

<p>Publication date: February 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 54</p><p>Author(s): Markus Knaden</p><div><p>The desert ant <em>Cataglyphis</em> inhabits the arid environment of North Africa where it forages individually for dead arthropods. Because of the ants’ high motivation to find the nest entrance and due to the almost lab-like conditions of their environment — the flat salt pan (where visual information and partly also olfactory information available to a homing ant can be easily manipulated) — <em>Cataglyphis</em> has become an important model for animal navigation. So far, we know a lot about how <em>Cataglyphis</em> uses path integration and learns visual and olfactory cues to return to its nest entrance after far-reaching foraging runs. We know, however, less regarding the neuronal processes involved in both path integration and landmark acquisition. In this article I discuss recent progress in molecular and neurophysiological techniques in other insect species. I furthermore speculate how these techniques might — in a hopefully not too far future — help us pinpointing the neuronal circuits involved in the fascinating navigation and learning capabilities of <em>Cataglyphis</em>.</p></div>

In songbirds, vocal learning relies on an evolutionarily specialized basal ganglia nucleus, Area X, densely innervated by dopaminergic inputs from the ventral tegmental area (VTA). While this positions songbirds as a unique model in which to tease apart the contributions of VTA dopamine neurons to vocal learning and performance, that potential has been largely underrealized. Recent breakthroughs recording from and manipulating activity of Area X projecting VTA neurons (VTAx) provide early evidence of the role of VTAx neurons to internally-guided vocal plasticity. We discuss these novel studies in the context of previous data implicating dopamine in Area X in the social modulation of song performance and how to reconcile effects on learning versus performance.</p></div>

<p>Principles of network topology have been widely studied in the human
connectome. Of particular interest is the modularity of the human brain, where
the connectome is divided into subnetworks and subsequently changes with
development, aging or disease are investigated. We present a weighted network
measure, the Network Dependency Index (NDI), to identify an individual region's
importance to the global functioning of the network. Importantly, we utilize
NDI to differentiate four subnetworks (Tiers) in the human connectome following
Gaussian Mixture Model fitting. We analyze the topological aspects of each
subnetwork with respect to age and compare it to rich-club based subnetworks
(rich-club, feeder and seeder). Our results first demonstrate the efficacy of
NDI to identify more consistent, central nodes of the connectome across
age-groups, when compared to the rich-club framework. Stratifying the
connectome by NDI led to consistent subnetworks across the life-span revealing
distinct patterns associated with age where, e.g., the key relay nuclei and
cortical regions are contained in a subnetwork with highest NDI. The divisions
of the human connectome derived from our data-driven NDI framework have the
potential to reveal topological alterations due to disease and/or development
which are not detectable by utilizing the connectome as a whole.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Primate cortical evolution has been characterized by massive and disproportionate expansion of a set of specific regions in the neocortex. The associated increase in neocortical neurons comes with a high metabolic cost, thus the functions served by these regions must have conferred significant evolutionary advantage. In the present series of analyses, we show that evolutionary high-expanding cortex – as estimated from patterns of surface growth from several primate species – shares functional connections with different brain networks in a context-dependent manner. Specifically, we demonstrate that high-expanding cortex is characterized by high internetwork functional connectivity; is recruited flexibly over many different cognitive tasks; and changes its functional coupling pattern between rest and a multimodal task-state. The capacity of high-expanding cortex to connect flexibly with various specialized brain networks depending on particular cognitive requirements suggests that its selective growth and sustainment in evolution may have been linked to an involvement in supramodal cognition. In accordance with an evolutionary-developmental view, we find that this observed ability of high-expanding regions – to flexibly modulate functional connections as a function of cognitive state – emerges gradually through childhood, with a prolonged developmental trajectory plateauing in young adulthood.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>It is commonly assumed that the human auditory cortex is organized similarly to that of macaque monkeys, where the primary region, or “core,” is elongated parallel to the tonotopic axis (main direction of tonotopic gradients), and subdivided across this axis into up to 3 distinct areas (A1, R, and RT), with separate, mirror-symmetric tonotopic gradients. This assumption, however, has not been tested until now. Here, we used high-resolution ultra-high-field (7 T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to delineate the human core and map tonotopy in 24 individual hemispheres. In each hemisphere, we assessed tonotopic gradients using principled, quantitative analysis methods, and delineated the core using 2 independent (functional and structural) MRI criteria. Our results indicate that, contrary to macaques, the human core is elongated perpendicular rather than parallel to the main tonotopic axis, and that this axis contains no more than 2 mirror-reversed gradients within the core region. Previously suggested homologies between these gradients and areas A1 and R in macaques were not supported. Our findings suggest fundamental differences in auditory cortex organization between humans and macaques.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The human cerebral cortex is highly regionalized, and this feature emerges from morphometric gradients in the cerebral vesicles during embryonic development. We tested if this principle of regionalization could be traced from the embryonic development to the human life span. Data-driven fuzzy clustering was used to identify regions of coordinated longitudinal development of cortical surface area (SA) and thickness (CT) (<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 301, 4–12 years). The principal divide for the developmental SA clusters extended from the inferior–posterior to the superior–anterior cortex, corresponding to the major embryonic morphometric anterior–posterior (AP) gradient. Embryonic factors showing a clear AP gradient were identified, and we found significant differences in gene expression of these factors between the anterior and posterior clusters. Further, each identified developmental SA and CT clusters showed distinguishable life span trajectories in a larger longitudinal dataset (4–88 years, 1633 observations), and the SA and CT clusters showed differential relationships to cognitive functions. This means that regions that developed together in childhood also changed together throughout life, demonstrating continuity in regionalization of cortical changes. The AP divide in SA development also characterized genetic patterning obtained in an adult twin sample. In conclusion, the development of cortical regionalization is a continuous process from the embryonic stage throughout life.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Dopaminergic projections are hypothesized to stabilize neural signaling and neural representations, but how they shape regional information processing and large-scale network interactions remains unclear. Here we investigated effects of lowered dopamine levels on within-region temporal signal variability (measured by sample entropy) and between-region functional connectivity (measured by pairwise temporal correlations) in the healthy brain at rest. The acute phenylalanine and tyrosine depletion (APTD) method was used to decrease dopamine synthesis in 51 healthy participants who underwent resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) scanning. Functional connectivity and regional signal variability were estimated for each participant. Multivariate partial least squares (PLS) analysis was used to statistically assess changes in signal variability following APTD as compared with the balanced control treatment. The analysis captured a pattern of increased regional signal variability following dopamine depletion. Changes in hemodynamic signal variability were concomitant with changes in functional connectivity, such that nodes with greatest increase in signal variability following dopamine depletion also experienced greatest decrease in functional connectivity. Our results suggest that dopamine may act to stabilize neural signaling, particularly in networks related to motor function and orienting attention towards behaviorally-relevant stimuli. Moreover, dopamine-dependent signal variability is critically associated with functional embedding of individual areas in large-scale networks.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Using stereological analysis of NeuN-stained sections, we investigated neuronal density and number of neurons per column throughout the marmoset cortex. Estimates of mean neuronal density encompassed a greater than 3-fold range, from &gt;150 000 neurons/mm<sup>3</sup> in the primary visual cortex to ~50 000 neurons/mm<sup>3</sup> in the piriform complex. There was a trend for density to decrease from posterior to anterior cortex, but also local gradients, which resulted in a complex pattern; for example, in frontal, auditory, and somatosensory cortex neuronal density tended to increase towards anterior areas. Anterior cingulate, motor, premotor, insular, and ventral temporal areas were characterized by relatively low neuronal densities. Analysis across the depth of the cortex revealed greater laminar variation of neuronal density in occipital, parietal, and inferior temporal areas, in comparison with other regions. Moreover, differences between areas were more pronounced in the supragranular layers than in infragranular layers. Calculations of the number of neurons per unit column revealed a pattern that was distinct from that of neuronal density, including local peaks in the posterior parietal, superior temporal, precuneate, frontopolar, and temporopolar regions. These results suggest that neuronal distribution in adult cortex result from a complex interaction of developmental/ evolutionary determinants and functional requirements.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Parcellation of distinct areas in the cerebral cortex has a long history in neuroscience and is of great value for the study of brain function, specialization, and alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. Analysis of cytoarchitectonical features has revealed their close association with molecular profiles based on protein density. This provides a rationale for the use of <span style="font-style: italic;">in vivo</span> molecular imaging data for parcellation of the cortex with the advantage of whole-brain coverage. In the current work, parcellation was based on expression of key players of the serotonin neurotransmitter system. Positron emission tomography was carried out for the quantification of serotonin 1A (5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 30) and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors (<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 22), the serotonin-degrading enzyme monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A, <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 32) and the serotonin transporter (5-HTT, <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 24) in healthy participants. Cortical protein distribution maps were obtained using surface-based quantification. Based on k-means clustering, silhouette criterion and bootstrapping, five distinct clusters were identified as the optimal solution. The defined clusters proved of high explanatory value for the effects of psychotropic drugs acting on the serotonin system, such as antidepressants and psychedelics. Therefore, the proposed method constitutes a sensible approach towards integration of multimodal imaging data for research and development in neuropharmacology and psychiatry.</span>

The trade-off between reward and effort is at the heart of most behavioral theories, from ecology to economics. Compared to reward, however, effort remains poorly understood, both at the behavioral and neurophysiological levels. This is important because unwillingness to overcome effort to gain reward is a common feature of many neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. A recent surge in interest in the neurobiological basis of effort has led to seemingly conflicting results regarding the role of dopamine.

Abstract<p>Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss due to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration that develops slowly with age. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a significant risk factor, though many patients develop glaucoma with IOP in the normal range. Mutations in microfibril-associated genes cause glaucoma in animal models, suggesting the hypothesis that microfibril defects contribute to glaucoma. To test this hypothesis, we investigated IOP and functional/structural correlates of RGC degeneration in mice of either sex with abnormal microfibrils due to heterozygous <i>Tsk</i> mutation of the fibrilin-1 gene (<i>Fbn1<sup>Tsk</sup></i> <sup>/+</sup>). Although IOP was not affected, <i>Fbn1<sup>Tsk</sup></i> <sup>/+</sup> mice developed functional deficits at advanced age consistent with glaucoma, including reduced RGC responses in electroretinogram (ERG) experiments. While RGC density in the retina was not affected, the density of RGC axons in the optic nerve was significantly reduced in <i>Fbn1<sup>Tsk</sup></i> <sup>/+</sup> mice. However, reduced axon density correlated with expanded optic nerves, resulting in similar numbers of axons in <i>Fbn1<sup>Tsk</sup></i> <sup>/+</sup> and control nerves. Axons in the optic nerves of <i>Fbn1<sup>Tsk</sup></i> <sup>/+</sup> mice were significantly enlarged and axon diameter was strongly correlated with optic nerve area, as has been reported in early pathogenesis of the DBA/2J mouse model of glaucoma. Our results suggest that microfibril abnormalities can lead to phenotypes found in early-stage glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Thinning of the elastic fiber-rich pia mater was found in <i>Fbn1<sup>Tsk</sup></i> <sup>/+</sup> mice, suggesting mechanisms allowing for optic nerve expansion and a possible biomechanical contribution to determination of axon caliber.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease of the optic nerve that causes vision loss and blindness in tens of millions of people worldwide. Similar to other neurodegenerations, glaucoma onset typically occurs with advanced age. Recent genetic evidence has implicated genes associated with microfibril structure and function as causative for glaucoma. Microfibrils are structures in the extracellular matrix that contribute to tissue biomechanics and regulate signal transduction <i>via</i> transforming growth factor beta. This study tested the hypothesis that microfibril deficiencies contribute to glaucoma by investigating glaucoma phenotypes in mice known to have defective microfibrils. The results suggest that abnormal microfibrils can cause accelerated expansion of optic nerve axons, potentially resulting in increased susceptibility to pressure-induced damage.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0171-18.2018v1?rss=1">Changes in GABAergic transmission to and intrinsic excitability of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuron during the estrous cycle in mice: Estrous-cycle dependent changes in GnRH neurons</a></h4>

Abstract<p>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons form the final common central output pathway controlling fertility and are regulated by steroid feedback. In females, estradiol feedback action varies between negative and positive; negative feedback typically regulates episodic GnRH release whereas positive feedback initiates a surge of GnRH, and subsequently LH, release ultimately triggering ovulation. During the estrous cycle, changes between estradiol negative and positive feedback occur with cycle stage and time of day, with positive feedback in the late afternoon of proestrus in nocturnal species. To test the hypotheses that synaptic and intrinsic properties of GnRH neurons are regulated by cycle stage and time of day, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp studies of GnRH neurons in brain slices from mice at two times considered negative feedback (diestrous PM and proestrous AM) and during positive feedback (proestrous PM). GABAergic transmission can excite GnRH neurons and was higher in cells from proestrous PM mice than cells from proestrous AM mice and approached traditional significance levels relative to cells from diestrous PM mice. Action potential response to current injection was also greater in cells from proestrous PM mice than the other two groups. Interestingly, the hormonal milieu of proestrous AM provided stronger negative feedback on both GnRH neuron excitability and GABAergic postsynaptic current amplitude than diestrous PM. These observations demonstrate elements of both synaptic and intrinsic properties of GnRH neurons are regulated in a cycle-dependent manner and provide insight into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying cyclic changes in neuroendocrine function among states of estradiol negative and positive feedback.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Infertility affects 15-20% of couples; failure to ovulate is a common cause. Understanding how the brain controls ovulation is critical for new developments in both infertility treatment and contraception. GnRH neurons are the final output pathway for central control of fertility and produce a signal that ultimately initiates ovulation in response to estradiol positive feedback. We studied how the reproductive cycle regulates both synaptic transmission to GnRH neurons and excitability of these cells. Both GABAergic transmission to GnRH neurons and GnRH neuron excitability are decreased during stages the estrous cycle characterized by negative feedback by gonadal steroids, compared to the late afternoon of proestrus, when positive feedback and ovulation occur.</p>

The development of novel therapeutics is urgently required for diseases where existing treatments are failing due to the emergence of resistance. This is particularly pertinent for parasitic infections of the tropics and sub-tropics, referred to collectively as neglected tropical diseases, where the commercial incentives to develop new drugs are weak. One such disease is schistosomiasis, a highly prevalent acute and chronic condition caused by a parasitic helminth infection, with three species of the genus <i>Schistosoma</i> infecting humans. Currently, a single 40-year old drug, praziquantel, is available to treat all infective species, but its use in mass drug administration is leading to signs of drug-resistance emerging. To meet the challenge of developing new therapeutics against this disease, we developed an innovative computational drug repurposing pipeline supported by phenotypic screening. The approach highlighted several protein kinases as interesting new biological targets for schistosomiasis as they play an essential role in many parasite’s biological processes. Focusing on this target class, we also report the first elucidation of the kinome of <i>Schistosoma japonicum</i>, as well as updated kinomes of <i>S</i>. <i>mansoni</i> and <i>S</i>. <i>haematobium</i>. In comparison with the human kinome, we explored these kinomes to identify potential targets of existing inhibitors which are unique to <i>Schistosoma</i> species, allowing us to identify novel targets and suggest approved drugs that might inhibit them. These include previously suggested schistosomicidal agents such as bosutinib, dasatinib, and imatinib as well as new inhibitors such as vandetanib, saracatinib, tideglusib, alvocidib, dinaciclib, and 22 newly identified targets such as CHK1, CDC2, WEE, PAKA, MEK1. Additionally, the primary and secondary targets in <i>Schistosoma</i> of those approved drugs are also suggested, allowing for the development of novel therapeutics against this important yet neglected disease.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-gKKJ-Zutu0" width="1" />

<p>by Braden A. W. Brinkman, Fred Rieke, Eric Shea-Brown, Michael A. Buice</p>

A major obstacle to understanding neural coding and computation is the fact that experimental recordings typically sample only a small fraction of the neurons in a circuit. Measured neural properties are skewed by interactions between recorded neurons and the “hidden” portion of the network. To properly interpret neural data and determine how biological structure gives rise to neural circuit function, we thus need a better understanding of the relationships between measured effective neural properties and the true underlying physiological properties. Here, we focus on how the effective spatiotemporal dynamics of the synaptic interactions between neurons are reshaped by coupling to unobserved neurons. We find that the effective interactions from a pre-synaptic neuron <i>r</i>′ to a post-synaptic neuron <i>r</i> can be decomposed into a sum of the true interaction from <i>r</i>′ to <i>r</i> plus corrections from every directed path from <i>r</i>′ to <i>r</i> through unobserved neurons. Importantly, the resulting formula reveals when the hidden units have—or do not have—major effects on reshaping the interactions among observed neurons. As a particular example of interest, we derive a formula for the impact of hidden units in random networks with “strong” coupling—connection weights that scale with 1 / N, where <i>N</i> is the network size, precisely the scaling observed in recent experiments. With this quantitative relationship between measured and true interactions, we can study how network properties shape effective interactions, which properties are relevant for neural computations, and how to manipulate effective interactions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iD53yQ24wOw" width="1" />

<p>by Erki Aun, Age Brauer, Veljo Kisand, Tanel Tenson, Maido Remm</p>

We have developed an easy-to-use and memory-efficient method called PhenotypeSeeker that (a) identifies phenotype-specific k-mers, (b) generates a <i>k</i>-mer-based statistical model for predicting a given phenotype and (c) predicts the phenotype from the sequencing data of a given bacterial isolate. The method was validated on 167 <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> isolates (virulence), 200 <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> isolates (ciprofloxacin resistance) and 459 <i>Clostridium difficile</i> isolates (azithromycin resistance). The phenotype prediction models trained from these datasets obtained the F1-measure of 0.88 on the <i>K</i>. <i>pneumoniae</i> test set, 0.88 on the <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> test set and 0.97 on the <i>C</i>. <i>difficile</i> test set. The F1-measures were the same for assembled sequences and raw sequencing data; however, building the model from assembled genomes is significantly faster. On these datasets, the model building on a mid-range Linux server takes approximately 3 to 5 hours per phenotype if assembled genomes are used and 10 hours per phenotype if raw sequencing data are used. The phenotype prediction from assembled genomes takes less than one second per isolate. Thus, PhenotypeSeeker should be well-suited for predicting phenotypes from large sequencing datasets. PhenotypeSeeker is implemented in Python programming language, is open-source software and is available at GitHub (https://github.com/bioinfo-ut/PhenotypeSeeker/).<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lD-D2JbSrjM" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Nogo receptor-1 signaling is involved in the limitation of axonal regeneration following spinal cord injury (SCI) through collapsing the growth cone and inhibiting neurite outgrowth. Lateral olfactory tract usher substance (LOTUS), a Nogo receptor antagonist, suppresses these pathological conditions. A previous report demonstrated the positive effects of LOTUS expression on motor function through raphespinal tract regeneration using pan-neuronally LOTUS-overexpressing transgenic mice. However, this report used a hemi-section model, which does not represent the majority of clinical SCI cases, and lacked a detailed histological analysis of other descending tracts. To determine the true therapeutic effects of LOTUS, we used a more clinically relevant contusive SCI model in female transgenic mice. Definitive tracing analyses revealed that LOTUS promoted the extensive regeneration of the reticulospinal tract across the lesion site and suppressed axonal dieback of corticospinal tract (CST). A significant increase in raphespinal tract fibers was seen from the subacute to the chronic phase after the injury, strongly suggesting that LOTUS promoted translesional elongation of this tract. Furthermore, histological analyses revealed that LOTUS had a neuroprotective effect on the injured spinal cord through suppressing cellular apoptosis during the acute phase. These neuroprotective and regenerative effects contributed to significant motor functional recovery and restoration of the motor evoked potential. Therefore, LOTUS application could prove beneficial in the treatment of SCI by promoting axonal regeneration of some descending fibers, reducing axonal dieback of CST fibers and encouraging motor function recovery.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Axonal regeneration following spinal cord injury (SCI) is extremely limited due to Nogo receptor (NgR) signaling, which inhibits neurite outgrowth and collapses growth cones. Lateral olfactory tract usher substance (LOTUS), a NgR antagonist, suppresses this inhibition by NgR. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of LOTUS using a clinically relevant contusive SCI model. Our data revealed that LOTUS promoted extensive translesional regeneration of the reticulospinal and raphespinal tracts and rostral regeneration of the corticospinal tract. Furthermore, LOTUS suppressed cellular apoptosis during the acute phase, and these neuroprotective and regenerative effects contributed to significant recovery of motor function and nerve conduction. Therefore, this study suggested that LOTUS could aid the treatment of SCI by promoting axonal regeneration and motor function recovery.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is a common pediatric neurodevelopmental disorder, frequently resulting in motor and developmental deficits and often accompanied by cognitive impairments. A regular pathobiological hallmark of CP is oligodendrocyte maturation impairment resulting in white matter (WM) injury and reduced axonal myelination. Regeneration therapies based on cell replacement are currently limited, but neural precursor cells (NPCs), as cellular support for myelination, represent a promising regeneration strategy to treat CP, although the transplantation parameters (e.g. timing, dosage, mechanisms) remain to be determined.</p><p>We optimised a hemiplegic mouse model of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia that mirrors the pathobiological hallmarks of CP and transplanted NPCs into the corpus callosum (CC), a major white matter structure impacted in CP patients. The NPCs survived, engrafted and differentiated morphologically in male and female mice. Histology and MRI showed repair of lesioned structures. Furthermore, electrophysiology revealed functional myelination of the CC (e.g. restoration of conduction velocity), while Cylinder and CatWalk tests demonstrated motor recovery of the affected forelimb. Endogenous oligodendrocytes, recruited in the CC following transplantation of exogenous NPCs, are the principal actors in this recovery process.</p><p>The lack of differentiation of the transplanted NPCs is consistent with enhanced recovery due to an indirect mechanism, such as a trophic and/or a "bio-bridge" support mediated by endogenous oligodendrocytes. Our work establishes that transplantation of NPCs represents a viable therapeutic strategy for CP treatment, and that the enhanced recovery is mediated by endogenous oligodendrocytes. This will further our understanding and contribute to the improvement of cellular therapeutic strategies.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cerebral palsy (CP) is one of the most common pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders, affecting more than 17 million people worldwide. Current treatment options for CP are largely restricted to rehabilitative approaches that alleviate and mitigate symptoms.</p>

Abstract<p>Reading literature (e.g., an entire book) is an enriching experience that qualitatively differs from reading a single sentence; however, the brain dynamics of such context-dependent memory remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate mnemonic neural dynamics during natural reading of literature by performing electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Brain activities of human participants recruited on campus were correlated with their subsequent memory, which was quantified by semantic correlation between the read text and reports subsequently written by them based on state of the art natural language processing procedures. The results of the EEG data analysis showed a significant positive relationship between subsequent memory and fixation-related EEG. Sentence-length and paragraph-length mnemonic processes were associated with N1-P2 and P3 fixation-related potential (FRP) components and fixation-related theta-band (4-8 Hz) EEG power, respectively. In contrast, the results of fMRI analysis showed a significant negative relationship between subsequent memory and blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) activation. Sentence-length and paragraph-length mnemonic processes were associated with networks of regions forming part of the salience network and the default mode network (DMN), respectively. Taken together with the EEG results, these memory-related deactivations in the salience network and the DMN were thought to reflect the reading of sentences characterized by low mnemonic load and the suppression of task-irreverent thoughts, respectively. It was suggested that the context-dependent mnemonic process during literature reading requires large-scale network deactivation, which might reflect coordination of a range of voluntary processes during reading.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Context-dependent memory encoding during natural reading of literature was evaluated using electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based on a subsequent memory paradigm. Subsequent memory was quantified by semantic correlation between the read text and reports subsequently written by the participants, based on a recent natural language processing procedure. Our results demonstrated a positive correlation between subsequent memory and fixation-related EEG and a negative correlation with fMRI activity. Sentence-length and paragraph-length processes were associated with regions belonging to the salience network and the default mode network, respectively. This is the first demonstration that memory encoding during literature reading is associated with large-scale network deactivations, which might reflect the coordination of a range of voluntary processes during reading.</p>

Astrocytic processes are extremely complex and can physically surround neuronal synapses where they are involved in regulating neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity. This review describes important roles glial cells play in synapse maturation and stabilization in the developing central nervous system. We highlight recent evidence showing that the motility of astrocytic and radial glial processes is modulated by neuronal signals and is important for normal synapse maturation and function. Examples of glia-derived molecules that influence synapse maturation and stabilization are presented. We close by touching on recent and future trends in neuron-glia research.</p></div>

<p>Numerous types of inhibitory neurons sculpt the performance of human neocortical circuits, with each type exhibiting a constellation of subcellular phenotypic features in support of its specialized functions. Axonal myelination has been absent among the characteristics used to distinguish inhibitory neuron types; in fact, very little is known about myelinated inhibitory axons in human neocortex. Here, using array tomography to analyze samples of neurosurgically excised human neocortex, we show that inhibitory myelinated axons originate predominantly from parvalbumin-containing interneurons. Compared to myelinated excitatory axons, they have higher neurofilament and lower microtubule content, shorter nodes of Ranvier, and more myelin basic protein (MBP) in their myelin sheath. Furthermore, these inhibitory axons have more mitochondria, likely to sustain the high energy demands of parvalbumin interneurons, as well as more 2’,3’-cyclic nucleotide 3’-phosphodiesterase (CNP), a protein enriched in the myelin cytoplasmic channels that are thought to facilitate the delivery of nutrients from ensheathing oligodendrocytes. Our results demonstrate that myelinated axons of parvalbumin inhibitory interneurons exhibit distinctive features that may support the specialized functions of this neuron type in human neocortical circuits.</p>

Here we present RAVEN Toolbox 2.0 with major enhancements, including: (i) <i>de novo</i> reconstruction of GEMs based on the MetaCyc pathway database; (ii) a redesigned KEGG-based reconstruction pipeline; (iii) convergence of reconstructions from various sources; (iv) improved performance, usability, and compatibility with the COBRA Toolbox. Capabilities of RAVEN 2.0 are here illustrated through <i>de novo</i> reconstruction of GEMs for the antibiotic-producing bacterium <i>Streptomyces coelicolor</i>. Comparison of the automated <i>de novo</i> reconstructions with the iMK1208 model, a previously published high-quality <i>S</i>. <i>coelicolor</i> GEM, exemplifies that RAVEN 2.0 can capture most of the manually curated model. The generated <i>de novo</i> reconstruction is subsequently used to curate iMK1208 resulting in Sco4, the most comprehensive GEM of <i>S</i>. <i>coelicolor</i>, with increased coverage of both primary and secondary metabolism. This increased coverage allows the use of Sco4 to predict novel genome editing targets for optimized secondary metabolites production. As such, we demonstrate that RAVEN 2.0 can be used not only for <i>de novo</i> GEM reconstruction, but also for curating existing models based on up-to-date databases. Both RAVEN 2.0 and Sco4 are distributed through GitHub to facilitate usage and further development by the community (https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/RAVEN and https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/Streptomyces_coelicolor-GEM).<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kidUMXJNwMA" width="1" />

<p>by Song Xu, Sanggu Kim, Irvin S. Y. Chen, Tom Chou</p>

In a recent clone-tracking experiment, millions of uniquely tagged hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were autologously transplanted into rhesus macaques and peripheral blood containing thousands of tags were sampled and sequenced over 14 years to quantify the abundance of hundreds to thousands of tags or “clones.” Two major puzzles of the data have been observed: consistent differences and massive temporal fluctuations of clone populations. The large sample-to-sample variability can lead clones to occasionally go “extinct” but “resurrect” themselves in subsequent samples. Although heterogeneity in HSC differentiation rates, potentially due to tagging, and random sampling of the animals’ blood and cellular demographic stochasticity might be invoked to explain these features, we show that random sampling cannot explain the magnitude of the temporal fluctuations. Moreover, we show through simpler <i>neutral</i> mechanistic and statistical models of hematopoiesis of tagged cells that a broad distribution in clone sizes can arise from stochastic HSC self-renewal instead of tag-induced heterogeneity. The very large clone population fluctuations that often lead to extinctions and resurrections can be naturally explained by a generation-limited proliferation constraint on the progenitor cells. This constraint leads to bursty cell population dynamics underlying the large temporal fluctuations. We analyzed experimental clone abundance data using a new statistic that counts clonal disappearances and provided least-squares estimates of two key model parameters in our model, the total HSC differentiation rate and the maximum number of progenitor-cell divisions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hrgk_-GnzwY" width="1" />

<p>by Dominik Wodarz, Pamela J. Skinner, David N. Levy, Elizabeth Connick</p>

Data from SIV-infected macaques indicate that virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are mostly present in the extrafollicular (EF) compartment of the lymphoid tissue, with reduced homing to the follicular (F) site. This contributes to the majority of the virus being present in the follicle and represents a barrier to virus control. Using mathematical models, we investigate these dynamics. Two models are analyzed. The first assumes that CTL can only become stimulated and expand in the extrafollicular compartment, with migration accounting for the presence of CTL in the follicle. In the second model, follicular CTL can also undergo antigen-induced expansion. Consistent with experimental data, both models predict increased virus compartmentalization in the presence of stronger CTL responses and lower virus loads, and a more pronounced rise of extrafollicular compared to follicular virus during CD8 cell depletion experiments. The models, however, differ in other aspects. The follicular expansion model results in dynamics that promote the clearance of productive infection in the extrafollicular site, with any productively infected cells found being the result of immigration from the follicle. This is not observed in the model without follicular CTL expansion. The models further predict different consequences of introducing engineered, follicular-homing CTL, which has been proposed as a therapeutic means to improve virus control. Without follicular CTL expansion, this is predicted to result in a reduction of virus load in both compartments. The follicular CTL expansion model, however, makes the counter-intuitive prediction that addition of F-homing CTL not only results in a reduction of follicular virus load, but also in an increase in extrafollicular virus replication. These predictions remain to be experimentally tested, which will be relevant for distinguishing between models and for understanding how therapeutic introduction of F-homing CTL might impact the overall dynamics of the infection.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xkNLNCfLeo0" width="1" />

<p>by Maximilian Schmidt, Rembrandt Bakker, Kelly Shen, Gleb Bezgin, Markus Diesmann, Sacha Jennifer van Albada</p>

Cortical activity has distinct features across scales, from the spiking statistics of individual cells to global resting-state networks. We here describe the first full-density multi-area spiking network model of cortex, using macaque visual cortex as a test system. The model represents each area by a microcircuit with area-specific architecture and features layer- and population-resolved connectivity between areas. Simulations reveal a structured asynchronous irregular ground state. In a metastable regime, the network reproduces spiking statistics from electrophysiological recordings and cortico-cortical interaction patterns in fMRI functional connectivity under resting-state conditions. Stable inter-area propagation is supported by cortico-cortical synapses that are moderately strong onto excitatory neurons and stronger onto inhibitory neurons. Causal interactions depend on both cortical structure and the dynamical state of populations. Activity propagates mainly in the feedback direction, similar to experimental results associated with visual imagery and sleep. The model unifies local and large-scale accounts of cortex, and clarifies how the detailed connectivity of cortex shapes its dynamics on multiple scales. Based on our simulations, we hypothesize that in the spontaneous condition the brain operates in a metastable regime where cortico-cortical projections target excitatory and inhibitory populations in a balanced manner that produces substantial inter-area interactions while maintaining global stability.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0swIe6iJ5Ls" width="1" />

A tremendous amount of research has focused on understanding the neural circuits for vision and the developmental mechanisms that establish them. The eye-to-brain, or ‘retinofugal’ pathway remains a particularly important model in these contexts because it is essential for sight, its overt anatomical features relate to distinct functional attributes and those features develop in a tractable sequence. Much progress has been made in understanding the growth of retinal axons out of the eye, their selection of targets in the brain, the development of laminar and cell type-specific connectivity within those targets, and also dendritic connectivity within the retina itself. Moreover, because the retinofugal pathway is prone to degeneration in many common blinding diseases, understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that establish connectivity early in life stands to provide valuable insights into approaches that re-wire this pathway after damage or loss. Here we review recent progress in understanding the development of retinofugal pathways and how this information is important for improving visual circuit regeneration.</p></div>

Aging-related cognitive decline represents a critical risk factor for the development of dementia and is associated with global neurophysiological changes. It is imperative to act early, while the neural reserve is still sufficient, to prevent or postpone cognitive decline. Given that no significant modifying pharmacological intervention is available, a focus on pharmacological agents alone seems insufficient. We argue that combinations of different approaches are most effective in stimulating long-lasting molecular changes that restore, promote, and preserve cognition through the modulation of cognitively relevant neurotransmitter systems that ultimately converge in driving neurotrophic signaling.

We hypothesize that Parkinson’s disease (PD) pathogenesis can be divided into three temporal phases. During the first phase, ‘triggers’, such as viral infections or environmental toxins, spark the disease process in the brain and/or peripheral tissues. Triggers alone, however, may be insufficient, requiring ‘facilitators’ like peripheral inflammation for PD pathology to develop. Once the disease manifests, ‘aggravators’ spur further neurodegeneration and exacerbate symptoms. Aggravators are proposed to include impaired autophagy and cell-to-cell propagation of α-synuclein pathology.

<p>by Kanika Bansal, John D. Medaglia, Danielle S. Bassett, Jean M. Vettel, Sarah F. Muldoon</p>

The relationship between brain structure and function has been probed using a variety of approaches, but how the underlying structural connectivity of the human brain drives behavior is far from understood. To investigate the effect of anatomical brain organization on human task performance, we use a data-driven computational modeling approach and explore the functional effects of naturally occurring structural differences in brain networks. We construct personalized brain network models by combining anatomical connectivity estimated from diffusion spectrum imaging of individual subjects with a nonlinear model of brain dynamics. By performing computational experiments in which we measure the excitability of the global brain network and spread of synchronization following a targeted computational stimulation, we quantify how individual variation in the underlying connectivity impacts both local and global brain dynamics. We further relate the computational results to individual variability in the subjects’ performance of three language-demanding tasks both before and after transcranial magnetic stimulation to the left-inferior frontal gyrus. Our results show that task performance correlates with either local or global measures of functional activity, depending on the complexity of the task. By emphasizing differences in the underlying structural connectivity, our model serves as a powerful tool to assess individual differences in task performances, to dissociate the effect of targeted stimulation in tasks that differ in cognitive demand, and to pave the way for the development of personalized therapeutics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Zw5QfjF3eog" width="1" />

<p>by Michael A. Skinnider, R. Greg Stacey, Leonard J. Foster</p>

Elucidating the complete network of protein-protein interactions, or interactome, is a fundamental goal of the post-genomic era, yet existing interactome maps are far from complete. To increase the throughput and resolution of interactome mapping, methods for protein-protein interaction discovery by co-migration have been introduced. However, accurate identification of interacting protein pairs within the resulting large-scale proteomic datasets is challenging. Consequently, most computational pipelines for co-migration data analysis incorporate external genomic datasets to distinguish interacting from non-interacting protein pairs. The effect of this procedure on interactome mapping is poorly understood. Here, we conduct a rigorous analysis of genomic data integration for interactome recovery across a large number of co-migration datasets, spanning diverse experimental and computational methods. We find that genomic data integration leads to an increase in the functional coherence of the resulting interactome maps, but this comes at the expense of a decrease in power to discover novel interactions. Importantly, putative novel interactions predicted by genomic data integration are no more likely to later be experimentally discovered than those predicted from co-migration data alone. Our results reveal a widespread and unappreciated limitation in a methodology that has been widely used to map the interactome of humans and model organisms.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FgE0UzOuvEs" width="1" />

<p>by Amrit Dhar, Kristian Davidsen, Frederick A. Matsen IV, Vladimir N. Minin</p>

B cells develop high affinity receptors during the course of affinity maturation, a cyclic process of mutation and selection. At the end of affinity maturation, a number of cells sharing the same ancestor (i.e. in the same “clonal family”) are released from the germinal center; their amino acid frequency profile reflects the allowed and disallowed substitutions at each position. These clonal-family-specific frequency profiles, called “substitution profiles”, are useful for studying the course of affinity maturation as well as for antibody engineering purposes. However, most often only a single sequence is recovered from each clonal family in a sequencing experiment, making it impossible to construct a clonal-family-specific substitution profile. Given the public release of many high-quality large B cell receptor datasets, one may ask whether it is possible to use such data in a prediction model for clonal-family-specific substitution profiles. In this paper, we present the method “Substitution Profiles Using Related Families” (SPURF), a penalized tensor regression framework that integrates information from a rich assemblage of datasets to predict the clonal-family-specific substitution profile for any single input sequence. Using this framework, we show that substitution profiles from similar clonal families can be leveraged together with simulated substitution profiles and germline gene sequence information to improve prediction. We fit this model on a large public dataset and validate the robustness of our approach on two external datasets. Furthermore, we provide a command-line tool in an open-source software package (https://github.com/krdav/SPURF) implementing these ideas and providing easy prediction using our pre-fit models.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JsZ93r65PGI" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/42/9105?rss=1">DMRT5, DMRT3, and EMX2 Cooperatively Repress Gsx2 at the Pallium-Subpallium Boundary to Maintain Cortical Identity in Dorsal Telencephalic Progenitors</a></h4>

<p>Specification of dorsoventral regional identity in progenitors of the developing telencephalon is a first pivotal step in the development of the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia. Previously, we demonstrated that the two zinc finger <i>doublesex</i> and <i>mab-3 related</i> (<i>Dmrt</i>) genes, <i>Dmrt5</i> (<i>Dmrta2</i>) and <i>Dmrt3</i>, which are coexpressed in high caudomedial to low rostrolateral gradients in the cerebral cortical primordium, are separately needed for normal formation of the cortical hem, hippocampus, and caudomedial neocortex. We have now addressed the role of <i>Dmrt3</i> and <i>Dmrt5</i> in controlling dorsoventral division of the telencephalon in mice of either sex by comparing the phenotypes of single knock-out (KO) with double KO embryos and by misexpressing <i>Dmrt5</i> in the ventral telencephalon. We find that DMRT3 and DMRT5 act as critical regulators of progenitor cell dorsoventral identity by repressing ventralizing regulators. Early ventral fate transcriptional regulators expressed in the dorsal lateral ganglionic eminence, such as <i>Gsx2</i>, are upregulated in the dorsal telencephalon of <i>Dmrt3;Dmrt5</i> double KO embryos and downregulated when ventral telencephalic progenitors express ectopic <i>Dmrt5</i>. Conditional overexpression of <i>Dmrt5</i> throughout the telencephalon produces gene expression and structural defects that are highly consistent with reduced GSX2 activity. Further, <i>Emx2;Dmrt5</i> double KO embryos show a phenotype similar to <i>Dmrt3;Dmrt5</i> double KO embryos, and both DMRT3, DMRT5 and the homeobox transcription factor EMX2 bind to a ventral telencephalon-specific enhancer in the <i>Gsx2</i> locus. Together, our findings uncover cooperative functions of DMRT3, DMRT5, and EMX2 in dividing dorsal from ventral in the telencephalon.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We identified the DMRT3 and DMRT5 zinc finger transcription factors as novel regulators of dorsoventral patterning in the telencephalon. Our data indicate that they have overlapping functions and compensate for one another. The double, but not the single, knock-out produces a dorsal telencephalon that is ventralized, and olfactory bulb tissue takes over most remaining cortex. Conversely, overexpressing <i>Dmrt5</i> throughout the telencephalon causes expanded expression of dorsal gene determinants and smaller olfactory bulbs. Furthermore, we show that the homeobox transcription factor EMX2 that is coexpressed with DMRT3 and DMRT5 in cortical progenitors cooperates with them to maintain dorsoventral patterning in the telencephalon. Our study suggests that DMRT3/5 function with EMX2 in positioning the pallial-subpallial boundary by antagonizing the ventral homeobox transcription factor GSX2.</p>

We propose a framework for the memory function of spindle oscillations during sleep. In this framework, memories are reinstated by spindle events and further reprocessed during subsequent spindle refractory periods. We posit that spindle refractoriness is crucial for protecting memory reprocessing from interference. We further argue that temporally-coordinated spindle refractory periods across local networks facilitate the consolidation of rich, multimodal representations, and that localized spindle refractoriness optimizes oscillatory interactions that support systems consolidation in the sleeping brain.

<p>by Ivan Tomić, Paul M. Bays</p>

The precision with which visual information can be recalled from working memory declines as the number of items in memory increases. This finding has been explained in terms of the distribution of a limited representational resource between items. Here we investigated how the sensory strength of memoranda affects resource allocation. We manipulated signal strength of an orientation stimulus in two ways: we varied the internal (sensory) noise by adjusting stimulus contrast, and varied the external (stimulus) noise by altering the within-stimulus variability. Both manipulations had similar effects on the precision with which the orientation could be recalled, but differed in their impact on memory for other stimuli. These results indicate that increasing internal noise released resources that could be used to store other stimuli more precisely; increasing external noise had no such effect. We show that these observations can be captured by a simple neural model of working memory encoding, in which spiking activity takes on the role of the limited resource.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/532tuGBOm9M" width="1" />

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The primary visual cortex of carnivores and primates is dominated by the OFF visual pathway and responds more strongly to dark than light stimuli. Here, we demonstrate that this cortical OFF dominance is modulated by the size and spatial frequency of the stimulus in awake primates and we uncover a main neuronal mechanism underlying this modulation. We show that large grating patterns with low spatial frequencies drive five times more OFF-dominated than ON-dominated neurons, but this pronounced cortical OFF dominance is strongly reduced when the grating size decreases and the spatial frequency increases, as when the stimulus moves away from the observer. We demonstrate that the reduction in cortical OFF dominance is not caused by a selective reduction of visual responses in OFF-dominated neurons but by a change in the ON/OFF response balance of neurons with diverse receptive field properties that can be ON or OFF dominated, simple, or complex. We conclude that cortical OFF dominance is continuously adjusted by a neuronal mechanism that modulates ON/OFF response balance in multiple cortical neurons when the spatial properties of the visual stimulus change with viewing distance and/or optical blur.</span>

<p>Publication date: February 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 54</p><p>Author(s): Elodie Perrin, Laurent Venance</p><div><p>The striatum, the main input nucleus of the basal ganglia, controls goal-directed behavior and procedural learning. Striatal projection neurons integrate glutamatergic inputs from cortex and thalamus together with neuromodulatory systems, and are subjected to plasticity. Striatal projection neurons exhibit bidirectional plasticity (LTP and LTD) when exposed to Hebbian paradigms. Importantly, correlative and even causal links between procedural learning and striatal plasticity have recently been shown. This short review summarizes the current view on striatal plasticity (with a focus on spike-timing-dependent plasticity), recent studies aiming at bridging <em>in vivo</em> skill acquisition and striatal plasticity, the temporal credit-assignment problem, and the gaps that remain to be filled.</p></div>

<p>Publication date: February 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 54</p><p>Author(s): Lisa Topolnik, Olivier Camiré</p><div><p>Understanding of how intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signals regulate the efficacy of transmission at excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the central nervous system (CNS) has been a focus of intense investigation. This review discusses recent findings on how Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are integrated in dendrites of inhibitory interneurons to regulate their synapses. In particular, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling through intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release plays an essential role in synaptic signal transduction and experience-dependent plasticity in dendrites of interneurons. Understanding the alternative pathways of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the absence of canonical voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> mechanisms is beginning to shed light on how their regulation can contribute to interneuron function and dysfunction in disease.</p></div>

After injury, activation and recruitment of inflammatory and immune cells has been thought to occur throughout the whole body. A recent study shows that after brain injury in mice, immune cells are primarily recruited from nearby skull bone marrow and invade the brain through microscopic vascular channels. Manipulation of this process may provide new therapeutic options.

Converging evidence across species highlights the contribution of environmental stress to anhedonia (loss of pleasure and/or motivation). However, despite a clear link between stress and the emergence of anhedonic-like behavior in both human and animal models, the underlying biological pathways remain elusive. Here, we synthesize recent findings across multiple levels, from molecular signaling pathways through whole-brain networks, to discuss mechanisms through which stress may influence anhedonia.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/I5VLXmddQbU/article">State dependence of stimulus-induced variability tuning in macaque MT</a></h4>

<p>by Joseph A. Lombardo, Matthew V. Macellaio, Bing Liu, Stephanie E. Palmer, Leslie C. Osborne</p>

Behavioral states marked by varying levels of arousal and attention modulate some properties of cortical responses (e.g. average firing rates or pairwise correlations), yet it is not fully understood what drives these response changes and how they might affect downstream stimulus decoding. Here we show that changes in state modulate the tuning of response variance-to-mean ratios (Fano factors) in a fashion that is neither predicted by a Poisson spiking model nor changes in the mean firing rate, with a substantial effect on stimulus discriminability. We recorded motion-sensitive neurons in middle temporal cortex (MT) in two states: alert fixation and light, opioid anesthesia. Anesthesia tended to lower average spike counts, without decreasing trial-to-trial variability compared to the alert state. Under anesthesia, within-trial fluctuations in excitability were correlated over longer time scales compared to the alert state, creating supra-Poisson Fano factors. In contrast, alert-state MT neurons have higher mean firing rates and largely sub-Poisson variability that is stimulus-dependent and cannot be explained by firing rate differences alone. The absence of such stimulus-induced variability tuning in the anesthetized state suggests different sources of variability between states. A simple model explains state-dependent shifts in the distribution of observed Fano factors via a suppression in the variance of gain fluctuations in the alert state. A population model with stimulus-induced variability tuning and behaviorally constrained information-limiting correlations explores the potential enhancement in stimulus discriminability by the cortical population in the alert state.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/I5VLXmddQbU" width="1" />
