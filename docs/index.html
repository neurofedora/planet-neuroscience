              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13161">Noumenal Labs White Paper: How To Build A Brain</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.13161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This white paper describes some of the design principles for artificial or machine intelligence that guide efforts at Noumenal Labs. These principles are drawn from both nature and from the means by which we come to represent and understand it. The end goal of research and development in this field should be to design machine intelligences that augment our understanding of the world and enhance our ability to act in it, without replacing us. In the first two sections, we examine the core motivation for our approach: resolving the grounding problem. We argue that the solution to the grounding problem rests in the design of models grounded in the world that we inhabit, not mere word models. A machine super intelligence that is capable of significantly enhancing our understanding of the human world must represent the world as we do and be capable of generating new knowledge, building on what we already know. In other words, it must be properly grounded and explicitly designed for rational, empirical inquiry, modeled after the scientific method. A primary implication of this design principle is that agents must be capable of engaging autonomously in causal physics discovery. We discuss the pragmatic implications of this approach, and in particular, the use cases in realistic 3D world modeling and multimodal, multidimensional time series analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13362">Dynamic directed functional connectivity as a neural biomarker for objective motor skill assessment</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.13362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective motor skill assessment plays a critical role in fields such as surgery, where proficiency is vital for certification and patient safety. Existing assessment methods, however, rely heavily on subjective human judgment, which introduces bias and limits reproducibility. While recent efforts have leveraged kinematic data and neural imaging to provide more objective evaluations, these approaches often overlook the dynamic neural mechanisms that differentiate expert and novice performance. This study proposes a novel method for motor skill assessment based on dynamic directed functional connectivity (dFC) as a neural biomarker. By using electroencephalography (EEG) to capture brain dynamics and employing an attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for non-linear Granger causality analysis, we compute dFC among key brain regions involved in psychomotor tasks. Coupled with hierarchical task analysis (HTA), our approach enables subtask-level evaluation of motor skills, offering detailed insights into neural coordination that underpins expert proficiency. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is then used to classify skill levels, achieving greater accuracy and specificity than established performance metrics in laparoscopic surgery. This methodology provides a reliable, objective framework for assessing motor skills, contributing to the development of tailored training protocols and enhancing the certification process.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13606">LaVCa: LLM-assisted Visual Cortex Captioning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.13606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the property of neural populations (or voxels) in the human brain can advance our comprehension of human perceptual and cognitive processing capabilities and contribute to developing brain-inspired computer models. Recent encoding models using deep neural networks (DNNs) have successfully predicted voxel-wise activity. However, interpreting the properties that explain voxel responses remains challenging because of the black-box nature of DNNs. As a solution, we propose LLM-assisted Visual Cortex Captioning (LaVCa), a data-driven approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate natural-language captions for images to which voxels are selective. By applying LaVCa for image-evoked brain activity, we demonstrate that LaVCa generates captions that describe voxel selectivity more accurately than the previously proposed method. Furthermore, the captions generated by LaVCa quantitatively capture more detailed properties than the existing method at both the inter-voxel and intra-voxel levels. Furthermore, a more detailed analysis of the voxel-specific properties generated by LaVCa reveals fine-grained functional differentiation within regions of interest (ROIs) in the visual cortex and voxels that simultaneously represent multiple distinct concepts. These findings offer profound insights into human visual representations by assigning detailed captions throughout the visual cortex while highlighting the potential of LLM-based methods in understanding brain representations.

                arXiv:2502.13661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term efficacy of internal globus pallidus (GPi) deep-brain stimulation (DBS) in DYT1 dystonia and disease progression under DBS was studied. Twenty-six patients of this open-label study were divided into two groups: (A) with single bilateral GPi lead, (B) with a second bilateral GPi lead implanted owning to subsequent worsening of symptomatology. Dystonia was assessed with the Burke Scale. Appearance of new symptoms and distribution according to body region were recorded. In the whole cohort, significant decreases in motor and disability subscores (P < 0.0001) were observed at 1 year and maintained up to 10 years. Group B showed worsening of the symptoms. At 1 year, there were no significant differences between Groups A (without subsequent worsening) and B; at 5 years, a significant difference was found for motor and disability scores. Within Group B, four patients exhibited additional improvement after the second DBS surgery. In the 26 patients, significant difference (P = 0.001) was found between the number of body regions affected by dystonia preoperatively and over the whole follow-up. DBS efficacy in DYT1 dystonia can be maintained up to 10 years (two patients). New symptoms appear with long-term follow-up and may improve with additional leads in a subgroup of patients.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13888">Freezing of Gait as a Complication of Pallidal Deep Brain Stimulation in DYT- KMT2B Patients with Evidence of Striatonigral Degeneration</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.13888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Mutations in KMT2B are a recognized cause of early-onset complex dystonia, with deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the internal globus pallidus (GPi-DBS) being an effective treatment. However, gait impairment, particularly freezing of gait (FOG), remains a significant challenge in DYT-KMT2B patients post-DBS. Objectives: To characterize the emergence of FOG in DYT-KMT2B patients treated with GPi-DBS and explore potential underlying mechanisms, including striatonigral degeneration. Methods: Five patients (four females) with KMT2B-related dystonia and protein-truncating variants (PTVs) were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical progression, response to GPi-DBS, and the presence of FOG were documented. Dopaminergic function was assessed using DaTscan (SPECT for ^123I-ioflupane) in four patients. Results: FOG developed in all patients, with onset ranging from 1 to 15.5 years post-DBS. DaTscan abnormalities, indicative of bilateral striatal dopaminergic denervation, were observed in four cases. Prior to DBS, all patients exhibited dystonia unresponsive to L-dopa, and post-DBS, FOG remained refractory to dopaminergic treatment in most cases. Despite initial improvements in gait post-DBS, only one patient maintained independent ambulation at the last follow-up. Conclusions: FOG is an emerging complication in DYT-KMT2B patients with PTVs undergoing GPi-DBS, potentially linked to underlying striatonigral degeneration. The findings suggest a need for long-term motor surveillance and consideration of alternative therapeutic strategies, including dopaminergic trials, in this patient population. Further studies are required to elucidate the precise mechanisms driving DBS-related hypokinetic gait disturbances in DYT-KMT2B dystonia.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11201">Evolution of diverse (and advanced) cognitive abilities through adaptive fine-tuning of learning and chunking mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.11201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of cognition is frequently discussed as the evolution of cognitive abilities or the evolution of some neuronal structures in the brain. However, since such traits or abilities are often highly complex, understanding their evolution requires explaining how they could have gradually evolved through selection acting on heritable variations in simpler cognitive mechanisms. With this in mind, making use of a previously proposed theory, here we show how the evolution of cognitive abilities can be captured by the fine-tuning of basic learning mechanisms and, in particular, chunking mechanisms. We use the term chunking broadly for all types of non-elemental learning, claiming that the process by which elements are combined into chunks and associated with other chunks, or elements, is critical for what the brain can do, and that it must be fine-tuned to ecological conditions. We discuss the relevance of this approach to studies in animal cognition, using examples from animal foraging and decision-making, problem solving, and cognitive flexibility. Finally, we explain how even the apparent human-animal gap in sequence learning ability can be explained in terms of different fine-tunings of a similar chunking process.

                arXiv:2502.13729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human and animal memory for sequentially presented items is well-documented to be more accurate for those at the beginning and end of a sequence, phenomena known as the primacy and recency effects, respectively. By contrast, artificial neural network (ANN) models are typically designed with a memory that decays monotonically over time. Accordingly, ANNs are expected to show the recency effect but not the primacy effect. Contrary to this theoretical expectation, however, the present study reveals a counterintuitive finding: a recently developed ANN architecture, called structured state-space models, exhibits the primacy effect when trained and evaluated on a synthetic task that mirrors psychological memory experiments. Given that this model was originally designed for recovering neuronal activity patterns observed in biological brains, this result provides a novel perspective on the psychological primacy effect while also posing a non-trivial puzzle for the current theories in machine learning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13477">An Enhancement of Cuckoo Search Algorithm for Optimal Earthquake Evacuation Space Allocation in Intramuros, Manila City</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.13477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA), while effective in solving complex optimization problems, faces limitations in random population initialization and reliance on fixed parameters. Random initialization of the population often results in clustered solutions, resulting in uneven exploration of the search space and hindering effective global optimization. Furthermore, the use of fixed values for discovery rate and step size creates a trade-off between solution accuracy and convergence speed. To address these limitations, an Enhanced Cuckoo Search Algorithm (ECSA) is proposed. This algorithm utilizes the Sobol Sequence to generate a more uniformly distributed initial population and incorporates Cosine Annealing with Warm Restarts to dynamically adjust the parameters. The performance of the algorithms was evaluated on 13 benchmark functions (7 unimodal, 6 multimodal). Statistical analyses were conducted to determine the significance and consistency of the results. The ECSA outperforms the CSA in 11 out of 13 benchmark functions with a mean fitness improvement of 30% across all functions, achieving 35% for unimodal functions and 24% for multimodal functions. The enhanced algorithm demonstrated increased convergence efficiency, indicating its superiority to the CSA in solving a variety of optimization problems. The ECSA is subsequently applied to optimize earthquake evacuation space allocation in Intramuros, Manila.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13730">Cascading CMA-ES Instances for Generating Input-diverse Solution Batches</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.13730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rather than obtaining a single good solution for a given optimization problem, users often seek alternative design choices, because the best-found solution may perform poorly with respect to additional objectives or constraints that are difficult to capture into the modeling process.
  Aiming for batches of diverse solutions of high quality is often desirable, as it provides flexibility to accommodate post-hoc user preferences. At the same time, it is crucial that the quality of the best solution found is not compromised.
  One particular problem setting balancing high quality and diversity is fixing the required minimum distance between solutions while simultaneously obtaining the best possible fitness. Recent work by Santoni et al. [arXiv 2024] revealed that this setting is not well addressed by state-of-the-art algorithms, performing in par or worse than pure random sampling.
  Driven by this important limitation, we propose a new approach, where parallel runs of the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) inherit tabu regions in a cascading fashion. We empirically demonstrate that our CMA-ES-Diversity Search (CMA-ES-DS) algorithm generates trajectories that allow to extract high-quality solution batches that respect a given minimum distance requirement, clearly outperforming those obtained from off-the-shelf random sampling, multi-modal optimization algorithms, and standard CMA-ES.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04663">CLIF: Complementary Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron for Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2402.04663v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are promising brain-inspired energy-efficient models. Compared to conventional deep Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), SNNs exhibit superior efficiency and capability to process temporal information. However, it remains a challenge to train SNNs due to their undifferentiable spiking mechanism. The surrogate gradients method is commonly used to train SNNs, but often comes with an accuracy disadvantage over ANNs counterpart. We link the degraded accuracy to the vanishing of gradient on the temporal dimension through the analytical and experimental study of the training process of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Neuron-based SNNs. Moreover, we propose the Complementary Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (CLIF) Neuron. CLIF creates extra paths to facilitate the backpropagation in computing temporal gradient while keeping binary output. CLIF is hyperparameter-free and features broad applicability. Extensive experiments on a variety of datasets demonstrate CLIF's clear performance advantage over other neuron models. Furthermore, the CLIF's performance even slightly surpasses superior ANNs with identical network structure and training conditions. The code is available at https://github.com/HuuYuLong/Complementary-LIF.

                arXiv:2412.20694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving NP-hard problems traditionally relies on heuristics, yet manually designing effective heuristics for complex problems remains a significant challenge. While recent advancements like FunSearch have shown that large language models (LLMs) can be integrated into evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for heuristic design, their potential is hindered by limitations in balancing exploitation and exploration. We introduce Quality-Uncertainty Balanced Evolution (QUBE), a novel approach that enhances LLM+EA methods by redefining the priority criterion within the FunSearch framework. QUBE employs the Quality-Uncertainty Trade-off Criterion (QUTC), based on our proposed Uncertainty-Inclusive Quality metric, to evaluate and guide the evolutionary process. Through extensive experiments on challenging NP-complete problems, QUBE demonstrates significant performance improvements over FunSearch and baseline methods. Our code are available at https://github.com/zzjchen/QUBE\_code.

                arXiv:2306.04940v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel activation mechanism called LayerAct for CNNs. This approach is motivated by our theoretical and experimental analyses, which demonstrate that Layer Normalization (LN) can mitigate a limitation of existing activation functions regarding noise robustness. However, LN is known to be disadvantageous in CNNs due to its tendency to make activation outputs homogeneous. The proposed method is designed to be more robust than existing activation functions by reducing the upper bound of influence caused by input shifts without inheriting LN's limitation. We provide analyses and experiments showing that LayerAct functions exhibit superior robustness compared to ElementAct functions. Experimental results on three clean and noisy benchmark datasets for image classification tasks indicate that LayerAct functions outperform other activation functions in handling noisy datasets while achieving superior performance on clean datasets in most cases.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06898">Words are not Wind -- How Public Joint Commitment and Reputation Solve the Prisoner's Dilemma</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2307.06898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To achieve common goals, we often use joint commitments. Our commitment helps us to coordinate with our partners and assures them that their cooperative efforts will benefit themselves. However, if one of us can exploit the other's cooperation (as in the Prisoner's Dilemma), our commitment appears less useful. It cannot remove the temptation for our partners to exploit us. Using methods from evolutionary game theory, we study the function of joint commitments in the Prisoner's Dilemma. We propose a reputation system akin to indirect reciprocity, wherein agents observe interactions even when not directly involved. They judge cooperation as good and defection as bad, but, crucially, only if the parties involved had committed to cooperate. This results in stable cooperation even though judgments are made privately, which had been a weakness in previous models of indirect reciprocity. Our work shows that joint commitments have utility beyond coordination problems, which could explain their prevalence. The proposed link between joint commitments and reputation could also explain why some joint commitments are pointedly public, like wedding vows. A reputation-based mechanism might have been particularly relevant in our distant past, in which no institutions existed to enforce commitments.

                <p>The opioid epidemic endangers not only public health but also social and economic welfare. Growing clinical evidence indicates that chronic use of prescription opioids may contribute to an elevated risk of ischemic stroke and negatively impact poststroke recovery. In addition, NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been related to several cerebrovascular diseases, including ischemic stroke. Interestingly, an increase in NLRP3 inflammasome activation has also been reported in chronic opioid exposure. Given the pivotal roles of the blood&ndash;brain barrier (BBB) and oxidative stress in ischemic stroke pathophysiology, this study focuses on the impact of chronic exposure to prescription opioids on the integrity of cerebrovascular microvasculature, endothelial mitochondrial homeostasis, and the outcomes of ischemic stroke in male wild-type and NLRP3-deficient mice. Our results demonstrate that chronic opioid exposure can compromise the integrity of the BBB and elevate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in endothelial mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis activation. We also provide evidence that opioid exposure enhances inflammasome activation and inflammatory responses and increases the severity of an ischemic stroke. The antioxidant <I>N</I>-acetylcysteine ameliorated these opioid-induced alterations and accelerated the poststroke tissue restoration and functional recovery processes in opioid-exposed mice. Importantly, there was also a significant decrease in ischemic stroke damage in the NLRP3-deficient mice with chronic opioid exposure as compared with wild-type controls. These findings indicate that chronic exposure to prescription opioids impacts the outcome of ischemic stroke by damaging microvascular cerebral integrity through inflammasome activation and mitochondrial dysfunction.</p>

                <p>Pyramidal cells (PCs) in CA1 hippocampus can be classified by their radial position as deep or superficial and organize into subtype-specific circuits necessary for differential information processing. Specifically, superficial PCs receive fewer inhibitory synapses from parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons than deep PCs, resulting in weaker feedforward inhibition of input from CA3 Schaffer collaterals. Using mice, we investigated mechanisms underlying CA1 PC differentiation and the development of this inhibitory circuit motif. We found that the transcriptional regulator SATB2, which is necessary for pyramidal cell differentiation in the neocortex, is selectively expressed in superficial PCs during early postnatal development. To investigate its role in CA1, we conditionally knocked out <I>Satb2</I> from pyramidal cells during embryonic development using both male and female <I>Emx1<sup>IRES-Cre</sup>; Satb2<sup>flox/flox</sup></I> mice. Loss of <I>Satb2</I> resulted in increased feedforward inhibition of CA3 Schaffer collateral input to superficial PCs, which matched that observed to deep PCs in control mice. Using paired whole-cell recordings between PCs and PV+ interneurons, we found this was due to an increase in the strength of unitary inhibitory synaptic connections from PV+ interneurons to mutant superficial PCs. Regulation of synapse strength was restricted to inhibitory synapses; excitatory synaptic connections from CA3 to CA1 PCs and CA1 PCs to PV+ interneurons were not affected by loss of <I>Satb2</I>. Finally, we show that SATB2 expression in superficial PCs is necessary to suppress the formation of synapses from PV+ interneurons during synaptogenesis. Thus, early postnatal expression of SATB2 in superficial PCs is necessary for the development of biased feedforward inhibition in CA1.</p>

                <p>Diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) is a common chronic complication of diabetes mellitus and a clinically common form of neuropathic pain. The thalamus is an important center for the conduction and modulation of nociceptive signals. The paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) is an important midline nucleus of the thalamus involved in sensory processing, but the specific role of PVT astrocytes and GABAergic neurons in DNP remains unclear. Here, we examined the activity of PVT astrocytes and neurons at various time points during the development of DNP by fluorescence immunohistochemistry and found that the activity of PVT astrocytes was significantly increased while that of PVT neurons was significantly decreased 14&nbsp;d after streptozotocin injection in male rats. The inhibition of PVT astrocytes by chemogenetic manipulation relieved mechanical allodynia in male DNP model rats, whereas the activation of PVT astrocytes induced mechanical allodynia in normal male rats. Interestingly, chemogenetic activation of GABAergic neurons in the PVT alleviated mechanical allodynia in male DNP model rats, whereas chemogenetic inhibition of GABAergic neurons in the PVT induced mechanical allodynia in normal male rats. These data demonstrate the distinct roles of PVT astrocytes and GABAergic neurons in modulating DNP, revealing the mechanism of DNP pathogenesis and the role of the PVT in pain modulation.</p>

                <p>Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) is a presynaptic protein targeted by the antiseizure drug levetiracetam. One or more of the three SV2 genes is expressed in all neurons and is essential to normal neurotransmission. Loss of SV2A results in a seizure phenotype in mice and mutations in humans are also linked to congenital seizures. How SV2A action impacts the epileptic phenotype remains unclear, especially among the diverse neuronal populations that regulate network excitability. This study explored how brain structure and function are affected by SV2A conditional knock-out (SV2A-cKO) in specific neural cell subtypes. We show that SV2A-cKO in all neurons of the postnatal brain triggers lethal seizures, suggesting that the seizures observed in earlier knock-out models were not due to aberrant brain development. Similar lethal seizures are detected in mice in which the loss of SV2A is limited to GABAergic neurons, whereas loss in excitatory neurons produces no noticeable phenotype. No apparent gender difference was ever observed. Further investigation revealed that SV2A-cKO in different GABAergic interneuron populations induces seizure, with variable timescales and severity. Most notably SV2A-cKO in parvalbumin interneurons (PV<sup>+</sup>) leads to lethal seizures in young animals, while SV2A-cKO in somatostatin (SST) inhibitory neurons results in seizures that were scarcely observed only in adult mice. These results support the crucial role SV2A plays in PV and SST interneurons and suggest that the action of levetiracetam may be due largely to effects on a subset of GABAergic interneurons.</p>

                <p>Huntington's disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disease, affects approximately 30,000 people in the United States, with 200,000 more at risk. Mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mutant huntingtin (mHTT) drives early HD pathophysiology. mHTT binds the translocase of the mitochondrial inner membrane (TIM23) complex, inhibiting mitochondrial protein import and altering the mitochondrial proteome. The 17&nbsp;aa HTT N-terminal sequence (N17) acts as a regulatory domain in HD pathogenesis; phosphomimetic modification of serines 13 and 16 of the N17 domain impacts subcellular localization and degradation and ameliorates toxicity in mouse and cell models of HD. Using cellular and mouse (either sex) HD models, we investigated the mechanisms by which HTT phosphorylation affects intracellular localization. We demonstrate that introducing phosphomimetic mutations within the mHTT fragment N17 domain decreased TIM23 binding affinity and reduced inhibition of mHTT-mediated mitochondrial protein import. BACHD-SD mice expressing full-length mHTT harboring the same two N17 phosphomimetic mutations have an ameliorated HD-like phenotype as compared with mice expressing mHTT. Consistent with reduced toxicity in vivo, we found that the amount of full-length mHTT in the brain mitochondria of BACHD-SD transgenic mice is less when the mHTT has two phosphomimetic mutations. To complement the relevance of the phosphomimetic HTT findings, endogenous N17 phospho-mHTT is less likely to translocate to the mitochondria compared with nonphosphorylated mHTT. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of mHTT at serines 13 and 16 is critical for negatively regulating mHTT mitochondrial targeting and that reducing mHTT mitochondrial localization and binding to TIM23 results in amelioration of mHTT-induced mitochondrial and neuronal toxicity.</p>

                <p>While hypothalamic kisspeptin (KP) neurons play well-established roles in the estrogen-dependent regulation of reproduction, little is known about extrahypothalamic KP-producing (KP<SUB>LS</SUB>) neurons of the lateral septum. As established previously, <I>Kiss1</I> expression in this region is low and regulated by estrogen receptor- and GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptor-dependent mechanisms. Our present experiments on <I>Kiss1-Cre/ZsGreen</I> knock-in mice revealed that transgene expression in the LS begins at Postnatal Day (P)33&ndash;36 in females and P40&ndash;45 in males and is stimulated by estrogen receptor signaling. Fluorescent cell numbers continue to increase in adulthood and are higher in females. Viral tracing uncovered that the bulk of KP<SUB>LS</SUB> fibers joins the medial forebrain bundle and terminates in the hypothalamic supramammillary nucleus. Smaller subsets innervate the medial amygdala or project to other limbic structures. One-quarter of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-immunoreactive perikarya in the preoptic area and their dendrites receive appositions from KP<SUB>LS</SUB> axons. OVX adult <I>Kiss1-Cre/ZsGreen</I> mice treated for 4&nbsp;d with 17&beta;-estradiol or vehicle were used for RNA sequencing studies of laser-microdissected KP<SUB>LS</SUB> neurons. The transcriptome included markers of GABAergic and neuropeptidergic (<I>Penk</I>, <I>Cartpt</I>, <I>Vgf</I>) cotransmission and 571 estrogen-regulated transcripts. Estrogen treatment upregulated the acetylcholine receptor transcript <I>Chrm2</I> and, in slice electrophysiology experiments, caused enhanced muscarinic inhibition of KP<SUB>LS</SUB> neurons. Finally, we provided immunohistochemical evidence for homologous neurons in the postmortem human brain, suggesting that KP<SUB>LS</SUB> neurons may contribute to evolutionarily conserved regulatory mechanisms. Future studies will need to investigate the putative roles of KP<SUB>LS</SUB> neurons in the estrogen-dependent control of GnRH neurons and/or various hypothalamic/limbic functions.</p>

                <p>Gravity has long been purported to serve a unique role in sensorimotor coordination, but the specific mechanisms underlying gravity-based visuomotor realignment remain elusive. In this study, astronauts (nine males, two females) performed targeted hand movements with eyes open or closed, both on the ground and in weightlessness. Measurements revealed systematic drift in hand-path orientation seen only when eyes were closed and only in very specific conditions with respect to gravity. In weightlessness, drift in path orientation was observed in two postures (seated, supine) for two different movement axes (longitudinal, sagittal); on Earth, such drift was only observed during longitudinal (horizontal) movements performed in the supine posture. In addition to providing clear evidence that gravitational cues play a fundamental role in sensorimotor coordination, these unique observations lead us to propose an "inverted pendulum" hypothesis to explain the saliency of the gravity vector for eye&ndash;hand coordination&mdash;and why eye&ndash;hand coordination is altered during body tilt or in weightlessness.</p>

                <p>The structure and function of the brain and cardiovascular system change over the lifespan. In this study, we aim to establish the extent to which age-related changes in these two vital organs are linked. Utilizing normative models and data from the UK Biobank, we estimate biological ages for the brain and heart for 2,904 middle-aged and older healthy adults, including both males and females. Biological ages were based on multiple structural, morphological, and functional features derived from brain and cardiovascular imaging modalities. We find that cardiovascular aging, particularly aging of its functional capacity and physiology, is selectively associated with the aging of specific brain networks, including the salience, default mode, and somatomotor networks as well as the subcortex. Our work provides unique insight into brain&ndash;heart relationships and may facilitate an improved understanding of the increased co-occurrence of brain and heart diseases in aging.</p>

                <p>Dexterous motor skills, like those needed for playing musical instruments and sports, require the somatosensory system to accurately and rapidly process somatosensory information from multiple body parts. This is challenging due to the convergence of afferent inputs from different body parts into a single neuron and the overlapping representation of neighboring body parts in the somatosensory cortices. How do trained individuals, such as pianists and athletes, manage this? Here, a series of five experiments with pianists and nonmusicians (female and male) shows that pianists have enhanced inhibitory function in the somatosensory system, which isolates the processing of somatosensory afferent inputs from each finger. This inhibitory function was assessed using a paired-pulse paradigm of somatosensory evoked potentials in electroencephalography, which measures the suppressive effect of a first stimulus [i.e., conditioning stimulus (CS)] on the response to a subsequent second stimulus. We found that pianists and nonmusicians showed an inhibitory response to the sequential stimuli to the peripheral somatosensory nerve at the wrist when the CS was intense. However, only pianists exhibited an inhibitory response to a weak CS, indicating enhanced inhibitory function in pianists. Additionally, the CS increased the information content segregating individual fingers represented in the cortical activity evoked by passive finger movements and improved the perception of fast multifinger sequential movements, specifically for pianists. Our findings provide the first evidence for experience-dependent plasticity in somatosensory inhibitory function and highlight its role in the expert motor performance of pianists.</p>

                <p>The ability of neurons to sense and respond to damage is crucial for maintaining homeostasis and facilitating nervous system repair. For some cell types, notably dorsal root ganglia and retinal ganglion cells, extensive profiling has uncovered a significant transcriptional response to axon injury, which influences survival and regenerative outcomes. In contrast, the injury responses of most supraspinal cell types, which display limited regeneration after spinal damage, remain mostly unknown. In this study, we used single-nuclei sequencing in adult male and female mice to profile the transcriptional responses of diverse supraspinal cell types to spinal injury. Surprisingly, thoracic spinal injury induced only modest changes in gene expression across all populations, including corticospinal tract (CST) neurons. Additionally, CST neurons exhibited minimal response to cervical injury but showed a much stronger reaction to intracortical axotomy, with upregulation of numerous regeneration and apoptosis-related transcripts shared with injured DRG and RGC neurons. Thus, the muted response of CST neurons to spinal injury is linked to the injury's distal location, rather than intrinsic cellular characteristics. More broadly, these findings indicate that a central challenge for enhancing regeneration after a spinal injury is the limited detection of distant injuries and the subsequent modest baseline neuronal response.</p>

                <p>The extraction and analysis of pitch underpin speech and music recognition, sound segregation, and other auditory tasks. Perceptually, pitch can be represented as a helix composed of two factors: height monotonically aligns with frequency, while chroma cyclically repeats at doubled frequencies. Although the early perceptual and neurophysiological mechanisms for extracting pitch from acoustic signals have been extensively investigated, the equally essential subsequent stages that bridge to high-level auditory cognition remain less well understood. How does the brain represent perceptual attributes of pitch at higher-order processing stages, and how are the neural representations formed over time? We used a machine learning approach to decode time-resolved neural responses of human listeners (10 females and 7 males) measured by magnetoencephalography across different pitches, hypothesizing that different pitches sharing similar neural representations would result in reduced decoding performance. We show that pitch can be decoded from lower-frequency neural responses within auditory-frontal cortical regions. Specifically, linear mixed-effects modeling reveals that height and chroma explain the decoding performance of delta band (0.5&ndash;4&nbsp;Hz) neural activity at distinct latencies: a long-lasting height effect precedes a transient chroma effect, followed by a recurrence of height after chroma, indicating sequential processing stages associated with unique perceptual and neural characteristics. Furthermore, the localization analyses of the decoder demonstrate that height and chroma are associated with overlapping cortical regions, with differences observed in the right orbital and polar frontal cortex. The data provide a perspective motivating new hypotheses on the mechanisms of pitch representation.</p>

                <p>Functional imaging studies indicate that both the assessment of a person as untrustworthy and the assumption that a person has a sexually transmitted infection are associated with activation in regions of the salience network. However, studies are missing that combine these aspects and investigate the perceived trustworthiness of individuals previously assessed with high or low probability of a sexually transmitted infection. During fMRI measurements, 25 participants viewed photographs of people preclassified as having high or low HIV probability and judged their trustworthiness. In a postrating, stimuli were rated for trustworthiness, attractiveness, and HIV probability. Persons preclassified as HIV&ndash; in contrast to those preclassified as HIV+ were rated more trustworthy and with lower HIV probability. Activation in medial orbitofrontal cortex was higher for those rated and preclassified as HIV&ndash; than HIV+. Based on the individual ratings, but not the preclassification, there was significantly higher activation in the insula, amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, and nucleus accumbens in response to untrustworthy than to trustworthy faces. Activation of the salience network occurred when a person was judged as untrustworthy, but not according to a preclassification. Activation in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, a structure associated with reward, was enhanced when a person was perceived as trustworthy and also when a person was preclassified with low HIV probability. Our findings suggest that trustworthiness and HIV&ndash; perception have consistency across samples, while the perception of risk and associated activation of the salience network has restricted cross-sample consistency.</p>

                <p>Hearing impairment (HI) disrupts social interaction by hindering the ability to follow conversations in noisy environments. While hearing aids (HAs) with noise reduction (NR) partially address this, the "cocktail-party problem" persists, where individuals struggle to attend to specific voices amidst background noise. This study investigated how NR and an advanced signal processing method for compensating for nonlinearities in Electroencephalography (EEG) signals can improve neural speech processing in HI listeners. Participants wore HAs with NR, either activated or deactivated, while focusing on target speech amidst competing masker speech and background noise. Analysis focused on temporal response functions to assess neural tracking of relevant target and masker speech. Results revealed enhanced neural responses (N1 and P2) to target speech, particularly in frontal and central scalp regions, when NR was activated. Additionally, a novel method compensated for nonlinearities in EEG data, leading to improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and potentially revealing more precise neural tracking of relevant speech. This effect was most prominent in the left-frontal scalp region. Importantly, NR activation significantly improved the effectiveness of this method, leading to stronger responses and reduced variance in EEG data and potentially revealing more precise neural tracking of relevant speech. This study provides valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying NR benefits and introduces a promising EEG analysis approach sensitive to NR effects, paving the way for potential improvements in HAs.</p>

                <p>Breathing is a complex neuromuscular process vital to sustain life. In preclinical animal models, the study of respiratory motor control is primarily accomplished through neurophysiologic recordings and functional measurements of respiratory output. Neurophysiologic recordings that target neural or muscular output via direct nerve recordings or respiratory muscle electromyography (EMG) are commonly collected during anesthetized conditions. While offering tight control of experimental preparations, the use of anesthesia results in respiratory depression, may impact cardiovascular control, eliminates the potential to record volitional nonventilatory behaviors, and can limit translation. Since the diaphragm is a unique muscle which is rhythmically active and difficult to access, placing diaphragm EMGs to collect chronic recordings in awake animals is technically challenging. Here, we describe methods for fabricating and implanting indwelling diaphragm EMG electrodes to enable recordings from awake rodents for longitudinal studies. These electrodes are relatively easy and quick to produce (~1&nbsp;h), are affordable, and provide high-quality and reproducible diaphragm signals using a tethered system that allows animals to <I>ad libitum</I> behave. This system is also designed to work in conjunction with whole-body plethysmography to facilitate simultaneous recordings of diaphragm EMG and ventilation. We include detailed instructions and considerations for electrode fabrication and surgical implantation. We also provide a brief discussion on data acquisition, material considerations for implant fabrication, and the physiological implications of the diaphragm EMG signal.</p>

                <p>Secondary motor cortical regions, such as the supplementary motor area (SMA), are involved in planning and learning motor sequences; however, the neurophysiological mechanisms across these secondary cortical networks remain poorly understood. In the primary motor cortex, changes in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission (<I>E</I>:<I>I</I> balance) accompany motor sequence learning. In particular, there is an early reduction in inhibition (i.e., disinhibition). Here, we investigated whether disinhibition occurs across secondary motor cortical regions during motor sequence learning using combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG). Twenty-nine healthy adults (14 female) practiced a sequential motor task with TMS applied to the SMA during sequence planning. TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) were measured with EEG before, during, and after practice. The N45 TEP peak was our primary measure of disinhibition, while we analyzed the slope of aperiodic EEG activity as an additional <I>E</I>:<I>I</I> balance measure. We observed a reduction in N45 amplitudes across an electrode cluster encompassing the SMA and nearby cortical regions as participants began learning new motor sequences, compared with a baseline rest phase (<I>p&nbsp;</I>&lt;&nbsp;0.01). Smaller N45 amplitudes during early learning were associated with improvements in reaction times across learning (<I>p </I>&lt; 0.05). Intriguingly, aperiodic exponents increased as learning progressed and were associated with greater improvements in skill (<I>p </I>&lt; 0.05). Overall, our results show that inhibition is modulated across SMA and secondary motor cortex during the planning phase of motor sequence learning and thus provide novel insight on the neurophysiological mechanisms within higher-order motor cortex that accompany new sequence learning.</p>

                <p>Estimating the motion of objects in depth is important for behavior and is strongly supported by binocular visual cues. To understand both how the brain should estimate motion in depth and how natural constraints shape and limit performance in two local 3D motion tasks, we develop image-computable ideal observers from a large number of binocular video clips created from a dataset of natural images. The observers spatiotemporally filter the videos and nonlinearly decode 3D motion from the filter responses. The optimal filters and decoder are dictated by the task-relevant image statistics and are specific to each task. Multiple findings emerge. First, two distinct filter subpopulations are spontaneously learned for each task. For 3D speed estimation, filters emerge for processing either changing disparities over time or interocular velocity differences, cues that are used by humans. For 3D direction estimation, filters emerge for discriminating either left&ndash;right or toward&ndash;away motion. Second, the filter responses, conditioned on the latent variable, are well-described as jointly Gaussian, and the covariance of the filter responses carries the information about the task-relevant latent variable. Quadratic combination is thus necessary for optimal decoding, which can be implemented by biologically plausible neural computations. Finally, the ideal observer yields nonobvious&mdash;and in some cases counterintuitive&mdash;patterns of performance like those exhibited by humans. Important characteristics of human 3D motion processing and estimation may therefore result from optimal information processing in the early visual system.</p>

                <p>Extracellular matrix (ECM) is a network of macromolecules which has two forms&mdash;perineuronal nets (PNNs) and a diffuse ECM (dECM)&mdash;both influence brain development, synapse formation, neuroplasticity, CNS injury and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. ECM remodeling can influence extrasynaptic transmission, mediated by diffusion of neuroactive substances in the extracellular space (ECS). In this study we analyzed how disrupted PNNs and dECM influence brain diffusibility. Two months after oral treatment of rats with 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU), an inhibitor of hyaluronan (HA) synthesis, we found downregulated staining for PNNs, HA, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. These changes were enhanced after 4 and 6&nbsp;months and were reversible after a normal diet. Morphometric analysis further indicated atrophy of astrocytes. Using real-time iontophoretic method dysregulation of ECM resulted in increased ECS volume fraction <I>&alpha;</I> in the somatosensory cortex by 35%, from <I>&alpha;</I> = 0.20 in control rats to <I>&alpha;</I> = 0.27 after the 4-MU diet. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed a decrease of mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy (FA) in the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, pallidum, and spinal cord. This study shows the increase in ECS volume, a loss of FA, and changes in astrocytes due to modulation of PNNs and dECM that could affect extrasynaptic transmission, cell-to-cell communication, and neural plasticity.</p>

                This study aims to evaluate the impact of big data analytics (BDA) on the performance of healthcare supply chain management (HCSCMP) by examining both overall efficiency improvements and identifying critical success factors for effective implementation. Through a systematic literature review, the research investigates how BDA enhances real-time decision-making within healthcare supply chains (HCSCs) and identifies the key enablers required for successful BDA adoption. A comprehensive search strategy was employed to analyze 65 papers, resulting in the inclusion of 39 studies published between 2016 and 2023. The review revealed a preference for literature reviews and questionnaires as the primary research methods. The findings indicate that BDA significantly improves HCSCs’ efficiency, particularly in real-time decision-making and operational management. However, successful BDA implementation depends on addressing critical enablers and overcoming associated challenges.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-456/v4?src=rss">Delirium management and current practice among Intensive Care Units Doctors, Khartoum [version 4; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Delirium is a brain dysfunction characterized by attention and cognitive disturbances in a fluctuating manner. The international guidelines recommend daily screening for delirium. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) are the most commonly used methods for assessing delirium. This study aimed to identify barriers and gaps in knowledge and practice. This was a hospital-based Cross-Sectional study. Stratified random sampling was used in this study. 72 ICU doctors were randomly selected. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 23. Descriptive data were presented, and the chi-squared test was used to determine the associations among variables. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. More than 70% of the doctors were ≤ 30 years of age and female. A total of 69.4% of the participants had < 1year of experience. In total, 94.4% of the participants worked in medical ICUs. Less than 20% of the doctors used delirium assessment tools, with a statistically significant difference based on experience (p=0.012). Delirium was not regularly assessed in 13.9% of the patients. Non-pharmacological management was applied by 76.4% of doctors, and communication with patients was the most frequent (75%). Haloperidol was the most commonly used drug (83.3%). A total of 40.3% of doctors did not stop delirium medication on ICU discharge. A regular delirium assessment was performed. However, the use of validated assessment tools is uncommon. Nonpharmacological management of delirium is important and is mostly performed. Our doctors prescribed antipsychotics for the treatment of both forms of delirium, and almost half of them did not stop the medications on ICU discharge. Medication reconciliation and contact with the next in-charge of the patients are important.

Voxelwise encoding models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as state-of-the-art predictive models of brain activity evoked by natural movies. Despite their superior predictive performance, the huge number of parameters in CNN-based models have made them difficult to interpret. Here, we investigate whether model compression can build more interpretable and more stable CNN-based voxelwise models while maintaining accuracy. We used multiple compression techniques to prune less important CNN filters and connections, a receptive field compression method to select receptive fields with optimal center and size, and principal component analysis to reduce dimensionality. We demonstrate that the model compression improves the accuracy of identifying visual stimuli in a hold-out test set. Additionally, compressed models offer a more stable interpretation of voxelwise pattern selectivity than uncompressed models. Finally, the receptive field-compressed models reveal that the optimal model-based population receptive fields become larger and more centralized along the ventral visual pathway. Overall, our findings support using model compression to build more interpretable voxelwise models.

                <p>by Jordan Childs, Tiago Bernardino Gomes, Amy E Vincent, Andrew Golightly, Conor Lawless</p>

Mitochondria are organelles in most human cells which release the energy required for cells to function. Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is a key biochemical process within mitochondria required for energy production and requires a range of proteins and protein complexes. Mitochondria contain multiple copies of their own genome (mtDNA), which codes for some of the proteins and ribonucleic acids required for mitochondrial function and assembly. Pathology arises from genetic defects in mtDNA and can reduce cellular abundance of OXPHOS proteins, affecting mitochondrial function. Due to the continuous turn-over of mtDNA, pathology is random and neighbouring cells can possess different OXPHOS protein abundance. Estimating the proportion of cells where OXPHOS protein abundance is too low to maintain normal function is critical to understanding disease severity and predicting disease progression. Currently, one method to classify single cells as being OXPHOS deficient is prevalent in the literature. The method compares a patient’s OXPHOS protein abundance to that of a small number of healthy control subjects. If the patient’s cell displays an abundance which differs from the abundance of the controls then it is deemed deficient. However, due to the natural variation between subjects and the low number of control subjects typically available, this method is inflexible and often results in a large proportion of patient cells being misclassified. These misclassifications have significant consequences for the clinical interpretation of these data. We propose a single-cell classification method using a Bayesian hierarchical mixture model, which allows for inter-subject OXPHOS protein abundance variation. The model accurately classifies an example dataset of OXPHOS protein abundances in skeletal muscle fibres (myofibres). When comparing the proposed and existing model classifications to manual classifications performed by experts, the proposed model results in estimates of the proportion of deficient myofibres that are consistent with expert manual classifications.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012364">Quantifying infectious disease epidemic risks: A practical approach for seasonal pathogens</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexander R Kaye, Giorgio Guzzetta, Michael J Tildesley, Robin N Thompson</p>

For many infectious diseases, the risk of outbreaks varies seasonally. If a pathogen is usually absent from a host population, a key public health policy question is whether the pathogen’s arrival will initiate local transmission, which depends on the season in which arrival occurs. This question can be addressed by estimating the “probability of a major outbreak” (the probability that introduced cases will initiate sustained local transmission). A standard approach for inferring this probability exists for seasonal pathogens (involving calculating the Case Epidemic Risk; CER) based on the mathematical theory of branching processes. Under that theory, the probability of pathogen extinction is estimated, neglecting depletion of susceptible individuals. The CER is then one minus the extinction probability. However, as we show, if transmission cannot occur for long periods of the year (e.g., over winter or over summer), the pathogen will most likely go extinct, leading to a CER that is equal (or very close) to zero even if seasonal outbreaks can occur. This renders the CER uninformative in those scenarios. We therefore devise an alternative approach for inferring outbreak risks for seasonal pathogens (involving calculating the Threshold Epidemic Risk; TER). Estimation of the TER involves calculating the probability that introduced cases will initiate a local outbreak in which a threshold number of cumulative infections is exceeded before outbreak extinction. For simple seasonal epidemic models, such as the stochastic Susceptible-Infectious-Removed model, the TER can be calculated numerically (without model simulations). For more complex models, such as stochastic host-vector models, the TER can be estimated using model simulations. We demonstrate the application of our approach by considering chikungunya virus in northern Italy as a case study. In that context, transmission is most likely in summer, when environmental conditions promote vector abundance. We show that the TER provides more useful assessments of outbreak risks than the CER, enabling practically relevant risk quantification for seasonal pathogens.

                <p>by Yung-Heng Chang, Josh Dubnau</p>

Neurodevelopment requires dynamic control of synapse number. A new study in PLOS Biology reveals that the gag protein of Copia, an active retrotransposon, forms virus-like capsids that transfer its own RNA across the Drosophila neuromuscular junction. Here, Copia acts antagonistically with Arc, another retrotransposon gag protein, to regulate synapse formation.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>The human brain demonstrates an exceptional adaptability, which encompasses the ability to regulate emotions, exhibit cognitive flexibility, and generate behavioral responses, all supported by neuroplasticity. Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) employ adaptive algorithms and machine learning techniques to adapt to variations in the user’s brain activity, allowing for customized interactions with external devices. Older adults may experience cognitive decline, which could affect the ability to learn and adapt to new technologies such as BCIs, but both (human brain and BCI) demonstrate adaptability in their responses. The human brain is skilled at quickly switching between tasks and regulating emotions, while BCIs can modify signal-processing algorithms to accommodate changes in brain activity. Furthermore, the human brain and BCI participate in knowledge acquisition; the first one strengthens cognitive abilities through exposure to new experiences, and the second one improves performance through ongoing adjustment and improvement. Current research seeks to incorporate emotional states into BCI systems to improve the user experience, despite the exceptional emotional regulation abilities of the human brain. The implementation of BCIs for older adults could be more effective, inclusive, and beneficial in improving their quality of life. This review aims to improve the understanding of brain–machine interfaces and their implications for mental health in older adults.

                Background Ensuring the security and trustworthiness of a digitized and automated electoral process remains a significant challenge in democratic systems. As digital voting systems are increasingly being investigated around the world, ensuring the integrity of the process using robust security measures is of great importance. This paper presents a simplified model to enhance electoral integrity by leveraging Blockchain technology in the context of Oman’s digital voting system. The model uses Blockchain technology to create a secure and trustworthy voting environment, addressing key vulnerabilities in digital electoral systems. Methods The research utilized a quantitative approach, employing an experimental design methodology using open-source software to simulate voting systems. Synthetic population data is utilized for operating these systems, while advanced biometric authentication technologies are used to verify voter identities. Blockchain technology is leveraged to ensure secure vote recording, with smart contracts used to authenticate voters and securely record votes. Additionally, synchronous transactions are executed for both voter registration and voting processes, enhancing the overall security and efficiency of the system. Results The experimental results shows that Blockchain enhances electoral integrity and security in Oman voting system, improves transparency and reliability in elections. The performance evaluation of the model focuses on efficiency, reliability, and scalability metrics. Asynchronous transactions are utilized to improve processing time for voter registration and voting. Election administrators can manage, monitor, and certify election results, while Ethereum nodes ensure decentralized verification and transparency in the voting process. Conclusion This research offers insights for policymakers to consider Blockchain for electoral reforms, addressing issues like data integrity, fraud prevention, and transparency to boost voter trust. A strong regulatory framework and public awareness are crucial for successful implementation. Pilot projects are needed to assess Blockchain’s practical impact. Oman could lead global innovation in electoral technology, though infrastructure and public resistance challenges must be managed.

                Background Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) is commonly fatal, with an overall mortality rate of nearly 90%, and the risk of subsequent rupture remains high, especially in large aneurysm diameters or progressive disease. Unfavorable neck anatomy in EVAR is linked to early graft failure and long-term complications. Recently, a novel multiple stiff wire (MSW) technique has been developed to overcome the challenges of hostile neck anatomy without introducing additional devices and procedural complexity. It has also been feasible in a series of elective cases. In this case, we report the first-ever utilization of the MSW technique in an emergency case of an acute contained rAAA with a conical-shaped, severely angulated neck who underwent Endovascular Aortic Repair (EVAR). Case presentation A 61-year-old man came with intermittent sharp stomach pain radiating to his back since three weeks ago. Physical examination showed elevated blood pressure and anemic conjunctiva. Laboratory examinations showed anemia, leukocytosis, elevated D-dimer level, high creatinine level, and low eGFR. CT-Scan Angiography (CTA) revealed severely hostile anatomy, a conical-shaped abdominal aorta aneurysm with a length of 13.2 cm and a maximum diameter of 9.3 cm with angulation of 90.1°. The patient was diagnosed with Ruptured AAA with a conical-shaped, severely angulated neck. Endovascular Aortic Repair (EVAR) management with MSW technique was planned for him. After four days, The patient was discharged in a clinically stable condition with optimal medical treatment and education. Conclusion The endovascular approach could be performed in emergency settings and has been proven to reduce length of stay, mortality, and morbidity rates. In this case, the endovascular approach with the MSW technique showed promising results for the patient.

                Background This study explores the relationship between average savings deposit rates and average commercial banks’ lending rates in Ghana from 2000 to 2020. Appreciating the connection is essential for developing successful policies that promote financial intermediation and economic growth. Methods A quantitative research approach was adopted by utilising the ARIMA model to forecast trends in average savings deposit rates and analyse their future behaviour. The study controlled for macroeconomic factors such as inflation (INF) and inter-bank weighted average (IWA) to assess their impact on both savings and lending rates. Results The findings reveal a significant positive correlation between average savings deposit rates and average lending rates with a correlation coefficient of 0.75 (p < 0.01). Inflation negatively impacts lending rates as evidenced by a coefficient of -0.40 (p < 0.05). Additionally, IWA exerts a minimal but favourable influence on average savings deposit rates. Conclusions The results underscore the need for effective policies aimed at stabilising savings deposit rates and fostering competition within the banking sector. Such measures are essential to enhance financial intermediation and promote sustainable economic growth in Ghana.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure leads to persisting increases in glial markers and significantly decreases the neurogenic niche in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Our previous study indicated that donepezil (DZ), a cholinesterase inhibitor, can reverse the AIE effect of decreased doublecortin (DCX), a neurogenic marker, and increased cleaved caspase 3, a marker of apoptosis, in the dentate gyrus of male rats. However, to date, no studies have assessed the effects of DZ on AIE effects in females. The purpose of this study was to determine whether DZ can reverse neuroimmune, neurogenic, and neuronal death effects in adulthood after AIE in female rats. Adolescent female rats were given 14 doses of ethanol (5 g/kg) over 24 days by intragastric gavage. Seventeen days later, DZ (2.5 mg/kg, 1.88 mL/kg, i.g., in water) was then administered daily for 4 days prior to sacrifice. Immunohistochemical techniques were utilized to determine the effects of DZ on AIE-induced changes in neurogenesis, cell death, glial, and neuroimmune markers. As expected, AIE decreased the neurogenic markers DCX, SOX2, and Ki-67 in the dentate gyrus and also caused an increase in the glial markers GFAP and Iba-1 in the hippocampus. The effects of AIE on neurogenic and glial markers were reversed by DZ treatment, but the reversal of AIE effects on glial markers was regionally specific within the hippocampus. Overall, these findings indicate that systemic DZ in adult female rats ameliorates the effects of AIE on neurogenesis, neuronal cell death, neuroimmune markers, and glial activation markers. Future studies will determine if DZ alters hippocampally driven behaviors, as well as the mechanisms underlying donepezil's effects.</p>

                A microglia subpopulation termed “dark microglia” has been associated with aging and neurodegeneration, although its role has remained elusive. New research from Flury et al. in this issue of Neuron shows that dark microglia drive neurodegeneration via secretion of toxic lipids.

Through simultaneous cortical and subcortical recordings and manipulations, they demonstrate that motor cortex and striatum conjointly specify parameters necessary for shaping flexible, goal-directed actions.

                Yang et al. disclose that HSPA8, a molecular chaperone, identifies PKR and enlists CHIP to promote PKR ubiquitination and degradation. Subsequently, PKR phosphorylates INSIG and leads to SREBP activation, thereby controlling lipid metabolism. Short-term hyperglycemia triggers SREBP1 to transcriptionally activate HSPA8, whereas persistent hyperglycemia represses HSPA8 through NF-κB.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100988">Cortico-striatal action control inherent of opponent cognitive-motivational styles</a></h4>

              
                Turning on cue or stopping at a red light requires attending to such cues to select action sequences, or suppress action, in accordance with learned cue-associated action rules. Cortico-striatal projections are an essential part of the brain’s attention–motor interface. Glutamate-sensing microelectrode arrays were used to measure glutamate transients in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) of male and female rats walking a treadmill and executing cued turns and stops. Prelimbic–DMS projections were chemogenetically inhibited to determine their behavioral necessity and the cortico-striatal origin of cue-evoked glutamate transients. Furthermore, we investigated rats exhibiting preferably goal-directed (goal trackers, GTs) versus cue-driven attention (sign-trackers, STs), to determine the impact of such cognitive-motivational biases on cortico-striatal control. GTs executed more cued turns and initiated such turns more slowly than STs. During turns, but not missed turns or cued stops, cue-evoked glutamate concentrations were higher in GTs than in STs. In STs, turn cue-locked glutamate concentrations frequently peaked twice or three times, contrasting with predominately single peaks in GTs. In GTs, but not STs, inhibition of prelimbic–DMS projections attenuated turn rates and turn cue-evoked glutamate concentrations and increased the number of turn cue-locked glutamate peaks. These findings indicate that turn cue-evoked glutamate release in GTs is tightly controlled by cortico-striatal neuronal activity. In contrast, in STs, glutamate release from DMS glutamatergic terminals may be regulated by other striatal circuitry, preferably mediating cued suppression of action and reward tracking. As cortico-striatal dysfunction has been hypothesized to contribute to a wide range of disorders, including complex movement control deficits in Parkinson’s disease and compulsive drug taking, the demonstration of phenotypic contrasts in cortico-striatal control implies the presence of individual vulnerabilities for such disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93283">Synovial macrophage diversity and activation of M-CSF signaling in post-traumatic osteoarthritis</a></h4>

              
                Synovium is home to immune and stromal cell types that orchestrate inflammation following a joint injury; in particular, macrophages are central protagonists in this process. We sought to define the cellular and temporal dynamics of the synovial immune niche in a mouse model of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA), and to identify stromal-immune crosstalk mechanisms that coordinate macrophage function and phenotype. We induced PTOA in mice using a non-invasive tibial compression model of anterior cruciate ligament rupture (ACLR). Single-cell RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry were used to assess immune cell populations in healthy (Sham) and injured (7 and 28 days post-ACLR) synovium. Characterization of synovial macrophage polarization states was performed, alongside computational modeling of macrophage differentiation, as well as implicated transcriptional regulators and stromal-immune communication axes. Immune cell types are broadly represented in healthy synovium, but experience drastic expansion and speciation in PTOA, most notably in the macrophage portion. We identified several polarization states of macrophages in synovium following joint injury, underpinned by distinct transcriptomic signatures, and regulated in part by stromal-derived macrophage colony-stimulating factor signaling. The transcription factors Pu.1, Cebpα, Cebpβ, and Jun were predicted to control differentiation of systemically derived monocytes into pro-inflammatory synovial macrophages. In summary, we defined different synovial macrophage subpopulations present in healthy and injured mouse synovium. Nuanced characterization of the distinct functions, origins, and disease kinetics of macrophage subtypes in PTOA will be critical for targeting these highly versatile cells for therapeutic purposes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87742">SMARCAD1 and TOPBP1 contribute to heterochromatin maintenance at the transition from the 2C-like to the pluripotent state</a></h4>

              
                Chromocenters are established after the 2-cell (2C) stage during mouse embryonic development, but the factors that mediate chromocenter formation remain largely unknown. To identify regulators of 2C heterochromatin establishment in mice, we generated an inducible system to convert embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to 2C-like cells. This conversion is marked by a global reorganization and dispersion of H3K9me3-heterochromatin foci, which are then reversibly formed upon re-entry into pluripotency. By profiling the chromatin-bound proteome (chromatome) through genome capture of ESCs transitioning to 2C-like cells, we uncover chromatin regulators involved in de novo heterochromatin formation. We identified TOPBP1 and investigated its binding partner SMARCAD1. SMARCAD1 and TOPBP1 associate with H3K9me3-heterochromatin in ESCs. Interestingly, the nuclear localization of SMARCAD1 is lost in 2C-like cells. SMARCAD1 or TOPBP1 depletion in mouse embryos leads to developmental arrest, reduction of H3K9me3, and remodeling of heterochromatin foci. Collectively, our findings contribute to comprehending the maintenance of chromocenters during early development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92203">Catalytic growth in a shared enzyme pool ensures robust control of centrosome size</a></h4>

              
                Accurate regulation of centrosome size is essential for ensuring error-free cell division, and dysregulation of centrosome size has been linked to various pathologies, including developmental defects and cancer. While a universally accepted model for centrosome size regulation is lacking, prior theoretical and experimental works suggest a centrosome growth model involving autocatalytic assembly of the pericentriolar material. Here, we show that the autocatalytic assembly model fails to explain the attainment of equal centrosome sizes, which is crucial for error-free cell division. Incorporating latest experimental findings into the molecular mechanisms governing centrosome assembly, we introduce a new quantitative theory for centrosome growth involving catalytic assembly within a shared pool of enzymes. Our model successfully achieves robust size equality between maturing centrosome pairs, mirroring cooperative growth dynamics observed in experiments. To validate our theoretical predictions, we compare them with available experimental data and demonstrate the broad applicability of the catalytic growth model across different organisms, which exhibit distinct growth dynamics and size scaling characteristics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102788">AI-enabled alkaline-resistant evolution of protein to apply in mass production</a></h4>

              
                Artificial intelligence (AI) models have been used to study the compositional regularities of proteins in nature, enabling it to assist in protein design to improve the efficiency of protein engineering and reduce manufacturing cost. However, in industrial settings, proteins are often required to work in extreme environments where they are relatively scarce or even non-existent in nature. Since such proteins are almost absent in the training datasets, it is uncertain whether AI model possesses the capability of evolving the protein to adapt extreme conditions. Antibodies are crucial components of affinity chromatography, and they are hoped to remain active at the extreme environments where most proteins cannot tolerate. In this study, we applied an advanced large language model (LLM), the Pro-PRIME model, to improve the alkali resistance of a representative antibody, a VHH antibody capable of binding to growth hormone. Through two rounds of design, we ensured that the selected mutant has enhanced functionality, including higher thermal stability, extreme pH resistance, and stronger affinity, thereby validating the generalized capability of the LLM in meeting specific demands. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first LLM-designed protein product, which is successfully applied in mass production.

">Decoding memory dysfunction in hippocampal amnesia</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus reconstructs past experiences by integrating sensory, perceptual, and conceptual information across a cortico-hippocampal autobiographical memory network (AMN). Here, in 18 human participants with amnesia, we decoded the effects of bilateral focal hippocampal damage on distinct autobiographical representations using representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs). Hippocampal pathology resulted in: (1) impaired generalised episodic memory retrieval RDM model fit in the left angular gyrus; and, (2) reduced distinct episodic memory RDM model fit and trial-by-trial voxel-representational stability in the right angular gyrus, right orbitofrontal cortex, and right inferior frontal gyrus. RDM model fits and mnemonic stability were predicted by total CA23 volumes. Trial-by-trial retrieval stability within the right orbitofrontal cortex and right inferior frontal gyrus predicted autobiographical memory performance, providing the first direct neural correlate between hippocampal dysfunction, altered mnemonic representations, and amnesia. The results demonstrate that hippocampal-mediated amnesia results from impaired mnemonic representational distinctiveness and stability within the AMN.

">On the typical development of the central sulcus in infancy: a longitudinal evaluation of its morphology and link to behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: The progressive folding of the cortex is an important feature of neurodevelopment starting early during gestation. The central sulcus (CS) is one of the first to fold. Since it represents the anatomical boundary between primary somatosensory and motor functional regions, its developing morphology may inform on the acquisition of sensorimotor skills. We aimed to identify potential asynchronous morphological changes along the CS during infancy, with the hypothesis that this may reflect the gradual emergence of body usage. Method: Based on 3T anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dedicated post-processing, we characterized the evolution in CS depth and curvature in 33 typical infants (aged 1 and 3 months, 22 with longitudinal data) in relation to 23 young adults as a reference. Four regions of interest (ROIs) along the CS, supposed to correspond to different parts of the body and one centred on the hand knob (HK), were reproducibly examined and compared across groups. We also explored the relationship between the age-related changes in morphological features and the global motor scaled scores evaluated at 3 months of age with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development. Results: While all ROIs showed significant increases in CS depth and curvature between 3-month-olds and adults, the results were more variable between 1 and 3 months of age depending on cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. The central-medial and central-lateral regions showed the most consistent increase in depth. Besides, motor development at 3 months of age was not significantly related to CS morphological changes, but a positive trend was observed for depth changes in the (HK-related) central-medial ROI. Conclusion: The rapid evolution of CS folding during infancy may reflect the intense but asynchronous maturation of the brain sensorimotor system, with the differential growth of cortical areas related to body parts and underlying white matter connections. Although it will have to be replicated on larger groups and at other ages, this longitudinal and multimodal study highlights the potential of characterizing CS features as key markers of early sensorimotor development, both at the cerebral and behavioural levels. Combining anatomical and functional neuroimaging could provide deeper insights into the relationship between CS morphology and somatotopic organization in typical infants, but also in infants at risk of developing motor disorders.

">Prior expectations guide multisensory integration during face-to-face communication</a></h4>

              
                Face-to-face communication relies on the seamless integration of multisensory signals, including voice, gaze, and head movements, to convey meaning effectively. This poses a fundamental computational challenge: optimally binding signals sharing the same communicative intention (e.g. looking at the addressee while speaking) and segregating unrelated signals (e.g. looking away while coughing), all within the rapid turn-taking dynamics of conversation. Critically, the computational mechanisms underlying this extraordinary feat remain largely unknown. Here, we cast face-to-face communication as a Bayesian Causal Inference problem to formally test whether prior expectations arbitrate between the integration and segregation of vocal and bodily signals. Moreover, we asked whether there is a stronger prior tendency to integrate audiovisual signals that show the same communicative intention, thus carrying a crossmodal pragmatic correspondence. In a spatial localization task, participants watched audiovisual clips of a speaker where the audio (voice) and the video (bodily cues) were sampled either from congruent positions or at increasing spatial disparities. Crucially, we manipulated the pragmatic correspondence of the signals: in a communicative condition, the speaker addressed the participant with their head, gaze and speech; in a non-communicative condition, the speaker kept the head down and produced a meaningless vocalization. We measured audiovisual integration through the ventriloquist effect, which quantifies how much the perceived audio position is misplaced towards the video position. Bayesian Causal Inference outperformed competing models in explaining participants' behaviour, demonstrating that prior expectations guide multisensory integration during face-to-face communication. Remarkably, participants showed a stronger prior tendency to integrate vocal and bodily information when signals conveyed congruent communicative intent, suggesting that pragmatic correspondences enhance multisensory integration. Collectively, our findings provide novel and compelling evidence that face-to-face communication is shaped by deeply ingrained expectations about how multisensory signals should be structured and interpreted.

">Neurochemical markers of uncertainty processing in humans</a></h4>

              
                How individuals process and respond to uncertainty has important implications for cognition and mental health. Here we use computational phenotyping to examine individualised 'uncertainty fingerprints' in relation to neurometabolites and trait anxiety in humans. We introduce a novel categorical state-transition extension of the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter (HGF) to capture implicit learning in a four-choice probabilistic sensorimotor reversal learning task by tracking beliefs about stimulus transitions. Using 7-Tesla Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, we measured baseline neurotransmitter levels in the primary motor cortex (M1). Model-based results revealed dynamic belief updating in response to environmental changes. We further found region-specific relationships between M1 glutamate+ glutamine levels and prediction errors and volatility beliefs, revealing an important neural marker of probabilistic reversal learning in humans. High trait anxiety was associated with faster post-reversal responses. By integrating computational modelling with neurochemical assessments, this study provides novel insights into the neurocomputations that drive individual differences in processing uncertainty.

">Cell type transcriptomics reveal shared genetic mechanisms in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Historically, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) have been investigated as two distinct disorders of the brain. However, a few similarities in neuropathology and clinical symptoms have been documented over the years. Traditional single gene-centric genetic studies, including GWAS and differential gene expression analyses, have struggled to unravel the molecular links between AD and PD. To address this, we tailor a pattern-learning framework to analyze synchronous gene co-expression at sub-cell-type resolution. Utilizing recently published single-nucleus AD (70,634 nuclei) and PD (340,902 nuclei) datasets from postmortem human brains, we systematically extract and juxtapose disease-critical gene modules. Our findings reveal extensive molecular similarities between AD and PD gene cliques. In neurons, disrupted cytoskeletal dynamics and mitochondrial stress highlight convergence in key processes; glial modules share roles in T-cell activation, myelin synthesis, and synapse pruning. This multi-module sub-cell-type approach offers insights into the molecular basis of shared neuropathology in AD and PD.

">Histone Lysine Crotonylation Regulates Long-Term Memory Storage</a></h4>

              
                Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs), particularly lysine acetylation (Kac), are critical epigenetic regulators of gene transcription underlying long-term memory consolidation. Beyond Kac, several other non-acetyl acylations have been identified, but their role in memory consolidation remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate histone lysine crotonylation (Kcr) as a key molecular switch of hippocampal memory storage. Spatial memory training induces distinct spatiotemporal patterns of Kcr induction in the dorsal hippocampus of mice. Through genetic and pharmacological manipulations, we show that reducing hippocampal Kcr levels impairs long-term memory, while increasing Kcr enhances memory. Utilizing single-nuclei multiomics, we delineate that Kcr enhancement during memory consolidation activates transcription of genes involved in neurotransmission and synaptic function within hippocampal excitatory neurons. Cell-cell communication analysis further inferred that Kcr enhancement strengthens glutamatergic signaling within principal hippocampal neurons. Our findings establish Kcr as a novel epigenetic mechanism governing memory consolidation and provide a foundation for therapeutic strategies targeting memory-related disorders.

">Investigating Facial Expression Processing during Fast Periodic Visual Stimulation using Highly Variable Stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Facial expression recognition is a fundamental aspect of human social interaction, enabling effective communication and emotional understanding. Fast Periodic Visual Stimulation (FPVS) paradigms have recently emerged as a powerful approach for studying facial expression processing. However, previous studies often utilized identical base stimuli, making it difficult to disentangle neural responses to low-level perceptual differences from those reflecting conceptual discrimination of emotion. By introducing variability in our stimuli, we aimed to overcome these limitations and investigate neural responses to facial expressions of anger, fear, happiness, and sadness. Using EEG, robust oddball responses were observed across participants at both individual and group levels, demonstrating the paradigm's sensitivity even with brief recordings and limited post-processing. Significant neural responses were detected across key regions of interest, with the right occipito-temporal region showing the strongest activity, consistent with its role in high-level facial expression processing. This study highlights the effectiveness of the FPVS paradigm for examining emotional processing using naturalistic stimuli and provides a framework for future research into neural mechanisms underlying facial emotion recognition in diverse and pathological populations.

">A Drd1-cre mouse line with nucleus accumbens gene dysregulation exhibits blunted fentanyl seeking</a></h4>

              
                The synthetic opioid fentanyl remains abundant in the illicit drug supply, contributing to tens of thousands of overdose deaths every year. Despite this, the neurobiological effects of fentanyl use remain largely understudied. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a central locus promoting persistent drug use and relapse, largely dependent on activity of dopamine D1 receptors. NAc D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) undergo molecular and physiological adaptations that contribute to negative affect during fentanyl abstinence, but whether these neuroadaptations also promote fentanyl relapse is unclear. Here, we obtained Drd1-cre120Mxu mice to investigate D1-dependent mechanisms of fentanyl relapse. We serendipitously discovered this mouse line is resistant to fentanyl seeking, despite similar intravenous fentanyl self-administration, and greater fentanyl-induced locomotion, compared to wildtype counterparts. In drug naive mice, we found Drd1-cre120Mxu mice have elevated D1 receptor expression in NAc, alongside increased expression of MSN marker genes Chrm4 and Penk. We show Drd1-cre120Mxu mice have increased sensitivity to the D1 receptor agonist SKF-38393, and exhibit divergent expression of MSN markers, opioid receptors, glutamate receptor subunits, and TrkB after fentanyl self-administration that may underly blunted fentanyl seeking. Finally, we show fentanyl-related behavior is unaltered by chemogenetic manipulation of D1-MSNs in Drd1-cre120Mxu mice. Conversely, chemogenetic stimulation of putative D1-MSNs in wildtype mice recapitulated the blunted fentanyl seeking of Drd1-cre120Mxu mice, supporting a role for aberrant D1-MSN signaling in this behavior. Together, our data uncover alterations in NAc gene expression and function with implications for susceptibility and resistance to developing fentanyl use disorder.

                The current depth of site-specific N-glycoproteomics is insufficient to fully characterize glycosylation events in biological samples. Herein, we achieved an ultradeep and precision analysis of the N-glycoproteome of mouse tissues by integrating multiple workflows. The largest N-glycoproteomic dataset to date was established on mice, which contained 91,972 precursor glycopeptides, 62,216 glycoforms, 8,939 glycosites and 4,563 glycoproteins. The database consisted of 6.8 million glyco-spectra (containing oxonium ions), among which 160,928 were high-quality spectra with confident N-glycopeptide identifications. The large-scale and high-quality dataset enhanced the performance of current artificial intelligence models for glycopeptide tandem spectrum prediction. Using this ultradeep dataset, we observed tissue specific microheterogeneity and functional implications of protein glycosylation in mice. Furthermore, the region-resolved brain N-glycoproteomes for Alzheimer's Diseases, Parkinson Disease and aging mice revealed the spatiotemporal signatures and distinct pathological functions of the N-glycoproteins. A comprehensive database resource of experimental N-glycoproteomic data from this study and previous literatures were further established. This N-glycoproteome atlas serves as a promising tool for revealing the role of protein glycosylation in biological systems.

">Autism-associated ASPM variant causes macrocephaly and social-cognitive deficits in mice</a></h4>

              
                In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a neurodevelopmental disorder with social-cognitive deficits, macrocephaly occurs in 20% of patients with severe symptoms. However, the role of macrocephaly in ASD pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we address the mechanistic link between macrocephaly and ASD by investigating a novel ASD-associated gain-of-function A1877T mutation in ASPM (abnormal spindle-like microcephaly-associated). ASPM is a key regulator of cortical size and cell proliferation expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal progenitors but not in differentiated neurons. We found that Aspm gain-of-function knock-in mice exhibit macrocephaly, excessive embryonic neurogenesis with expanded outer radial glia, an increased excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) ratio, brain hyperconnectivity, and social-cognitive deficits with male specificity. Our results suggest that macrocephaly in ASD is not a proportional expansion of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, but a shift in the E-I ratio, independent of the expression patterns of the causative gene. Thus, macrocephaly alone can cause a subset of ASD-like symptoms.

">Chronic social defeat causes dysregulation of systemic glucose metabolism via the cerebellar fastigial nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Chronic psychological stress leads to hyperglycemia through the endocrine and sympathetic nervous systems, which contributes to the development of type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Higher plasma corticosteroids after stress is one well-established driver of insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. However, previous studies have indicated that only a fraction of patients with depression and post-traumatic disorder (PTSD) who develop T2DM exhibit hypocortisolism, so corticosteroids do not fully explain psychological stress-induced T2DM. Here, we find that chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) in mice enhances gluconeogenesis, which is accompanied by a decrease in plasma insulin, an increase in plasma catecholamines, and a drop in plasma corticosterone levels. We further reveal that these metabolic and endocrinological changes are mediated by the activation of neurons projecting from the cerebellar fastigial nucleus (FN) to the medullary parasolitary nucleus (PSol). These neurons are crucial in shifting the body's primary energy source from glucose to lipids. Additionally, data from patients with depression reveal correlations between the presence of cerebellar abnormalities and both worsening depressive symptoms and elevated HbA1c levels. These findings highlight a previously unappreciated role of the cerebellum in metabolic regulation and its importance as a potential therapeutic target in depression, PTSD, and similar psychological disorders.

">Convergent and selective representations of pain, appetitive processes, aversive processes, and cognitive control in the insula</a></h4>

              
                Regions that respond to multiple types of information ("convergence zones") are crucial for the brain to generate coherent experiences and behaviors. The insular cortex, known for its functional diversity, has been hypothesized to be a key convergence hub, yet empirical evidence identifying how and where convergence occurs is incomplete. To address this gap, we analyzed functional convergence across four key task domains--somatic pain, non-somatic appetitive processes, aversive processes, and cognitive control--in a large-scale Bayesian mega-analysis of fMRI data (N=540, systematically sampled from 36 studies). Bayes Factor analyses identified both convergent zones responding to multiple domains and selective zones responding to single domains. Results revealed a hierarchical convergence architecture, with a multi-domain convergence zone in bilateral dorsal anterior insula surrounded by zones showing progressively increasing convergence. Functional decoding and coactivation analyses further support the insula's role as a convergence hub, while cytoarchitectonic and neurotransmitter profiling characterizes the potential neuroanatomical underpinnings subserving convergent and domain-selective function. Overall, our results demonstrate a structured functional topography in the insula that bridges specialized and convergent processing, providing a potential neural basis for how diverse information streams combine into unified subjective experiences.

">Microglia regulate neuronal activity via structural remodeling of astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Neuron-glia interactions play a central role in regulating synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. Structural plasticity of astrocytes is associated with numerous physiological and pathological conditions, however, the mechanism underlying this process remains unknown. To examine the basis for structural astrocyte plasticity, we used the classic example of the loss of astrocytic processes that takes place in the hypothalamic magnocellular system during chronic high-salt intake. We discovered that a high-salt diet triggers a local accumulation of reactive microglia around vasopressin-secreting neurons, but not in other brain areas. Microglia phagocytose astrocytic processes, reducing astrocytic coverage of vasopressin neurons. The pruning of astrocytic processes impairs synaptic glutamate clearance, enabling activation of extrasynaptic glutamate NMDA receptors and increasing the activity of vasopressin neurons. Inhibiting microglia-mediated astrocyte pruning attenuates the increased neuronal activity and vasopressin-dependent hypertensive phenotype of rats fed high-salt diet. Thus, microglia orchestrate neuron-glia interactions and regulate neuronal activity through astrocyte pruning.

">Epigenetic changes, neuronal dysregulation and metabolomic abnormalities in Zmym2 mutant mice, a genetic model of schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders</a></h4>

              
                Loss-of-function mutations in ZMYM2 are associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia (SCZ) and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). ZMYM2 interacts with proteins involved in histone modification and gene regulation, including LSD1 and ADNP; however, its specific roles in the brain remain poorly understood. In this multi-omics study, we demonstrate that heterozygous knockout of Zmym2 in mice results in widespread disturbances in gene expression affecting diverse molecular pathways, including those related to histone modifications and neuronal activity. Proteomic analysis of synapses reveals dysregulation of lipid metabolism and neurofilament-associated pathways, while metabolomic profiling identifies alterations in sphingomyelin and ceramide levels. Furthermore, Zmym2 mutant mice exhibit abnormal brain oscillation patterns on EEG and locomotor hyperactivity in the open field test. Collectively, these findings underscore the critical role of ZMYM2 in brain development and function and highlight Zmym2 mutant mice as a genetic animal model for SCZ and NDD.

">Congruent neuronal modulation across competing actions challenges the role of the substantia nigra in action selection</a></h4>

              
                The basal ganglia are involved in the control of movement, but their exact role is unclear. Paradoxically, most of the inhibitory projection neurons in the main output nuclei increase firing around the time of movement; only a small fraction decrease firing. This antagonistic activity pattern could subserve action selection, with the small "decrease" population selectively disinhibiting the desired movement, and the larger "increase" population inhibiting competing movements. The action-selection hypothesis makes an implicit assumption: neurons that decrease firing to disinhibit a specific action should increase firing to inhibit that action when a different action is desired. To test this hypothesis, we recorded projection neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) of mice trained to alternate between two different types of movements. Many SNr neurons showed a "ramping" pattern of pre-movement firing-rate modulation, with most neurons increasing firing, consistent with previous findings. However, contrary to the action-selection model, the overwhelming majority of SNr neurons exhibited congruent modulation between the competing actions, either increasing or decreasing their firing rates for both actions; only a small fraction of neurons exhibited opposite signs of modulation. We could not ascribe the congruent modulation to potential uninstructed movements. Our results are not easily reconciled with simple antagonistic mechanisms for action selection in the basal ganglia output nuclei. We also found that ramping activity in SNr neurons typically began hundreds of ms before self-timed and spontaneous movements, in contrast to previous findings suggesting that basal ganglia output is modulated too late to be involved in movement initiation. Our findings suggest constraints - and raise new questions - about the role of the basal ganglia in movement initiation and action selection.

">Relative timing and coupling of neural population bursts in large-scale recordings from multiple neuron populations</a></h4>

              
                The onset of a sensory stimulus elicits transient bursts of activity in neural populations, which are presumed to convey information about the stimulus to downstream populations. The time at which these synchronized bursts reach their peak is highly variable across stimulus presentations, but the relative timing of bursts across interconnected brain regions may be less variable, especially for regions that are strongly functionally coupled. We developed a simple analytical framework that obtains good estimates of population burst times on a trial-by-trial basis, and of the correlations in the timing of evoked population bursts across areas. We show that this method performs well on simulated data, and is 85 to 90% faster than an alternative, recently-published method while also being much easier to apply. Using this new approach, we examined the relative timing of the first two population bursts following the onset of a drifting grating stimulus in large-scale recordings of spiking activity from six cortical visual areas and one visual thalamic nucleus in thirteen mice. The new method allowed us to identify mouse-to-mouse variation in peak times and region-to-region functional coupling. While all results were consistent with known anatomy and physiology, we found some sequences of activity across areas to be the same across all mice, while others varied with the individual. The general approach can thus produce sensitive analyses of timing relationships across neural populations.

">Robust single-trial estimates of electrocortical generalized aversive conditioning: Validation of a Bayesian multilevel learning model</a></h4>

              
                Aversive conditioning changes visuocortical responses to conditioned cues, and the generalization of these changes to perceptually similar cues may provide mechanistic insights into anxiety and fear disorders. Yet, neuroimaging conditioning paradigms are challenged by poor single-trial signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), missing trials, and inter-individual differences in learning. Here, we address these issues with the validation of a steady-state visual evoked potential (ssVEP) generalization paradigm in conjunction with a Rescorla-Wagner inspired Bayesian multilevel learning model. A preliminary group of observers (N=24) viewed circular gratings varying in grating orientation, with only one orientation paired with an aversive outcome (noxious electric pulse). Gratings were flickered at 15 Hz to evoke ssVEPs recorded with 31 channels of EEG in an MRI scanner. The multilevel structure of the Bayesian model learning model informs and constrains estimates per participant providing an interpretable generative model. It led to superior cross-validation accuracy and insights into individual participant dynamics than simpler models. It also isolates the generalized effects of conditioning, providing improved statistical certainty. Lastly, the present report demonstrates that missing trials are interpolated and weighted appropriately using the full model's structure. This is a critical aspect for single-trial analyses of simultaneously recorded physiological measures, because each added measure will typically increase the number of trials missing a complete set of observations. The present technical report validates a limited version of a learning model to illustrate the utility of this analytical framework. It shows how models may be iteratively built and compared in a modern Bayesian workflow. Future models may use different conceptualizations of learning, allow integration of clinically relevant factors, and enable the fusion of different simultaneous physiological recordings.

">EPICURUS: E-field-based spatial filtering procedure for an accurate estimation of local EEG activity evoked by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Background: The concurrent use of Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with electroencephalography (EEG) is increasingly integrated in research and clinical protocols to provide proof of effect by magnetic pulses. However, a reliable identification of evoked local EEG activity over TMS targeted cortical sites remains still challenging. Methods: Here we present EPICURUS, a novel EEG spatial filtering approach, by which, individual MRI based simulations of TMS- electrical fields (E-fields) guide the reconstruction of TMS evoked o EEG signals originated in the primary motor cortex, minimizing crosstalk from non relevant more distant sources. Results: A reduction of late Transcranial Evoked-Potentials (TEPs) components (>100 ms post pulse onset) suggest our E-field-based spatial filter approach efficiently reduced intrusion of non-locally relevant distant sources engaged by TMS, particularly when combined with a suppression of auditory entries. Conclusion: The individually customized E-field-based spatial filtering procedure here developed for TMS-EEG datasets shows promise improving the spatio-temporal mapping of primary sources activated by magnetic pulses.

	<p>Introduction: Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline, primarily due to dysfunction of acetylcholine caused by acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. While synthetic cholinesterase inhibitors like donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine are commonly used, they have notable side effects, prompting interest in natural alternatives. Medicinal plants, rich in bioactive compounds like flavonoids and alkaloids, have shown potential as cholinesterase inhibitors with additional antioxidants and anti-inflammatory benefits. This study aimed to evaluate the cholinesterase-inhibiting effects of various plant species and their compounds to identify new therapeutic candidates and reduce side effects. Method: A PRISMA-compliant review was conducted, screening studies from multiple databases, with a final inclusion of 64 in vivo studies. Results: These studies highlighted plant extracts such as Ferula ammoniacum, Elaeagnus umbellata, Bacopa monnieri, and Centella asiatica, which improved memory, reduced oxidative stress, and provided neuroprotection. Some extracts also reduced amyloid plaques, enhanced neuronal integrity, and restored cholinesterase activity, indicating their potential as therapeutic agents for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Conclusions: The findings underscore the promise of plant-based compounds in treating cognitive decline and cholinergic dysfunction in AD, advocating for further research into their therapeutic potential.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Bipolar disorder (BD) affects over 1% of the global population and significantly impacts psychosocial functioning and life expectancy. This manuscript has the objective of investigating gender differences in the clinical and biochemical parameters of patients affected by BD. Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study examined 672 patients diagnosed with BD in psychiatric wards in Milan and Monza. Clinical data and biochemical parameters were collected on the first day of hospitalization. Independent sample t-tests, chi-square tests and binary logistic regressions were performed to identify gender differences in BD. Results: With regard to univariate analyses, women were found to be more susceptible to psychiatric comorbidities (&amp;amp;chi;2 = 12.75, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), medical comorbidities (&amp;amp;chi;2 = 45.38, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), obesity (&amp;amp;chi;2 = 6.75, p = 0.01) and hypercholesterolemia (&amp;amp;chi;2 = 23.54, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), as well as to having more mood episodes in the year prior to hospitalization (t = 5.69, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Men were found to be more likely to develop psychotic symptoms (&amp;amp;chi;2 = 4.40, p = 0.04), to be tobacco smokers (&amp;amp;chi;2 = 15.13, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) and to have substance abuse disorders (&amp;amp;chi;2 = 14.66, p = &amp;amp;lt;0.01). Logistic regression analyses showed that women compared to men showed more psychiatric comorbidity (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), higher Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores (p = 0.05) and higher total cholesterol plasma levels (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01); however, they also had fewer red blood cells (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) and lower creatinine plasma levels (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Conclusions: Female patients (compared to males) exhibited higher levels of global functioning despite the higher frequency of psychiatric comorbidity and susceptibility to metabolic complications; consistent with earlier studies, female patients also showed higher cholesterol levels. Further studies will have to confirm the present findings and identify gender-related clinical pathways for the management of BD.</p>

	<p>Background: Coccygodynia presents significant challenges in diagnosis and treatment. While coccygectomy has emerged as a crucial intervention for refractory cases, significant heterogeneity exists in surgical techniques. Traditional approaches are increasingly complemented by novel methods, necessitating a comprehensive review of current surgical options. Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted using Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and Embase databases from inception to present. Search terms included &amp;amp;ldquo;coccygectomy&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;coccydynia&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;coccygodynia&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;coccyx pain&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;tailbone pain&amp;amp;rdquo;. We analyzed peer-reviewed studies focusing on surgical techniques, outcomes and complications of coccygectomy. Studies were excluded if non-peer-reviewed, non-English without translation, or not directly addressing surgical management. Results: Traditional midline approaches, while common, demonstrate increased wound complications compared to paramedian techniques. Minimally invasive methods, including coccygeoplasty and endoscopic coccygectomy, show promising early outcomes with reduced recovery times. Both partial and complete resections provide significant pain relief, with complete resection potentially offering superior results in severe cases. Wound closure technique significantly impacts surgical success. Conclusions: Optimal outcomes in coccygectomy require individualized surgical approaches incorporating modern techniques like paramedian incision and advanced wound closure. Emerging minimally invasive procedures may further reduce complications and enhance recovery. Treatment success depends on careful patient selection and surgical technique optimization.</p>

	<p>Background: Prenatal stress has been reported to harm the physiological and biochemical functions of the brain of the offspring, potentially resulting in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors later in life. Trans-Resveratrol (RESV) is known for its anti-inflammatory, anxiolytic, and antidepressant properties. However, whether administering RESV during pregnancy can counteract the anxiety- and depression-like behaviors induced by maternal stress is unknown. Objective: This study aimed to assess the protective potential of RESV against molecular and behavioral changes induced by prenatal stress. Methods: During pregnancy, the dams received 50 mg/kg BW/day of RESV orally. They underwent a movement restriction for forty-five minutes, three times a day, in addition to being exposed to artificial light 24 h before delivery. The male offspring were left undisturbed until early adulthood, at which point they underwent behavioral assessments, including the open field test, elevated plus maze, and forced swim test. Subsequently, they were euthanized, and the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were extracted for RT-qPCR analysis to measure Bdnf mRNA expression. Results: By weaning, results showed that prenatal stress led to reduced weight gain and, in adulthood, increased anxiety- and depression-like behaviors and changes in Bdnf mRNA expression. However, these effects were attenuated by maternal RESV supplementation. Conclusions: The findings suggest that RESV can prevent anxiety- and depression-like behaviors induced by prenatal stress by modulating Bdnf mRNA expression.</p>

	<p>Background: Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type (wt) glioblastoma is an aggressive malignancy associated with poor clinical outcomes, marked by high heterogeneity and resistance to treatment. This study aims to investigate the prognostic significance of B7-H3 expression in IDH wt glioblastoma and its potential association with clinical outcomes, including overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Additionally, the relationship between B7-H3 and PD-L1 expression was explored. Methods: A retrospective cohort of 86 IDH wt glioblastoma patients, all of whom underwent surgery, radiotherapy, and temozolomide treatment, was analyzed. B7-H3 expression was quantified using an immunoreactivity score (IRS), classifying samples as low (IRS &amp;amp;le; 4) or high (IRS &amp;amp;gt; 4). PD-L1 expression was evaluated based on tumor and immune cell staining, with &amp;amp;gt;5% positivity indicating significant expression. Results: High B7-H3 expression was significantly associated with poorer OS and PFS. Co-expression of B7-H3 and PD-L1 was prevalent, particularly among younger male patients with unifocal tumors; however, PD-L1 expression did not show a significant correlation with clinical outcomes. Conclusions: B7-H3 appears to be a promising prognostic biomarker in IDH wt glioblastoma and may serve as a target for developing combination therapies, integrating B7-H3-targeting treatments with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Further prospective studies are necessary to validate these findings and to explore potential therapeutic strategies.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Bilateral steno-occlusive disease of the internal carotid artery (ICA) carries an increased stroke risk with associated high morbidity and mortality. Management of these patients is often complex. In this study, we evaluate the value of non-invasive optimal vessel analysis quantitative magnetic resonance angiography (NOVA-qMRA) for studying flow and collateral patterns in patients with bilateral carotid steno-occlusive disease. Methods: Patients with bilateral ICA-stenosis &amp;amp;ge; 50% who received NOVA-qMRA were included in this study. The volume flow rates (VFRs) of the A2-segment of the anterior cerebral artery (A2-ACA), M1-segment of the middle cerebral artery (M1-MCA), and P2-segment of the posterior cerebral artery (P2-PCA) were analyzed. Demographic, clinical, and treatment data were collected. Results: Twenty-two patients (mean age &amp;amp;plusmn; SD: 68 &amp;amp;plusmn; 10 years) were included. Nineteen patients (86%) were symptomatic. Thirteen patients (59%) were revascularized; among them, M1-VFR was significantly lower (p-value = 0.01) on the side selected for revascularization (88 mL/min &amp;amp;plusmn; 53) compared to the contralateral one (130 mL/min &amp;amp;plusmn; 56). P2-VFR was significantly higher (p-value = 0.04) in the treated subgroup (108 mL/min &amp;amp;plusmn; 41) than in the non-treated one (83 mL/min &amp;amp;plusmn; 34). Conclusions: The present study supports the use of NOVA-qMRA to study flow and collateral patterns in patients with bilateral steno-occlusive carotid disease, especially M1- and P2-VFR. This information may be helpful for decision-making and to tailor revascularization treatment.</p>

                Background Dental identification methods are employed to determine a person’s identity in forensic odontology. Additionally, analyzing a person’s teeth can provide insights into their socioeconomic status, which may assist in the process of identification. Our study aimed to assess the correlation between dental health status and SES among individuals, with a focus on identifying predictors of SES based on dental health indicators Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the correlation between dental health status and socioeconomic status among 135 individuals. who had visited the Department of Oral Medicine for various forms of dental care. SES was measured according to a modified Kuppuswamy scale. The associations between SES and dental health indicators were analyzed using chi-square tests for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables. Results Dental caries is more common in lower SES groups, attributed to factors like poor nutrition and hygiene. Partial and complete edentulism are also more prevalent in lower SES populations, often due to financial constraints and lack of awareness, leading to extractions rather than restorations. However, urban populations, regardless of SES, show greater utilization of dental restorations, likely due to the concentration of dentists in cities and access to community-based dental camps offering low-cost treatments. Periodontal diseases further reflect SES disparities. Studies show that individuals from lower SES backgrounds report more severe periodontal issues, such as gingival swelling, while higher SES groups report milder symptoms like gingival bleeding, indicating earlier intervention. Conclusion SES plays a vital role in shaping health and lifestyle outcomes. The findings in our study demonstrate the value of incorporating SES indicators, such as education, occupation, marital status, and residence, into forensic investigations to enhance the precision of identification processes.

                Abstract Background Food-related illnesses have become more prevalent globally over time, having a detrimental impact on the health and economic prosperity of both emerging and developed nations. A large percentage of these diseases are caused by food-borne infections, both globally and locally. Objective To determine food safety and hygiene practices of food vendors in the Bibiani Municipality. Method A descriptive cross-sectional design was employed in this study. A quota sampling technique was used to select 152 food vendors from Bibiani. The community was divided into three parts: Bibiani, Anwhiaso, and Bekwai. The data collection tool was structured questionnaires and exported into Statistics and Data 15.0 (STATA 15.0). The data were analyzed descriptively and presented as frequency counts, simple percentages, and tables. Results Out of 152 respondents, 89.5% put leftover foods in the refrigerator for preservation, 4.6% put food pans in water, 76.3% used a serving spoon when dishing food, 5.3% used bear hands, 64.5% used soap and water during hand washing, and 73.0% had done a medical examination; 82.2% wore aprons as well as hair covers during the cooking and serving of food. Conclusion The majority of respondents had satisfactory safety and hygiene practices, while some still had several unsafe hygienic practices. Recommendation The government of Ghana and MMDAs should establish the pre-requisite standard operating procedures for all institutions undertaking hospitality regarding food safety and hygiene.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected global health systems and daily life, exacerbating vulnerabilities, particularly in Indonesia. This study investigates the impact of anxiety and education level on mental health, with spiritual intelligence as an intervening variable among post-COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Methods Utilizing a cross-sectional design, data were collected from 390 post-COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Structured questionnaires assessed anxiety, education level, spiritual intelligence, and mental health. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the relationships among these variables. Results The findings indicate that anxiety significantly affects both spiritual intelligence and mental health, with spiritual intelligence acting as a mediating factor. Additionally, higher educational attainment is positively associated with enhanced spiritual intelligence and improved mental health outcomes. Conclusions The study underscores the importance of incorporating spiritual development practices into mental health interventions and educational programs to boost resilience and overall well-being in the post-pandemic era. While these findings are promising, the cross-sectional design limits causal inferences, and future research should consider longitudinal studies to examine these relationships over time. These practices can help mitigate the adverse effects of anxiety and educational disparities on mental health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-134/v2?src=rss">Heavy Metal Contamination: Sources, Health Impacts, and Sustainable Mitigation Strategies with Insights from Nigerian Case Studies [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Heavy metal contamination has gradually become a very much important significant global issue due to its continual existence in the environment and bioaccumulation in the ecosystems, posing deleterious risks to human health. This review aims to investigate the sources, pathways, and toxicological impacts of heavy metals such as cadmium, lead, mercury, and arsenic, elucidating their health consequences and plausible mitigation strategies. Furthermore, the review explores the dual origins of heavy metal contamination; natural geological processes and anthropogenic activities such as industrial emissions, mining, and agricultural practices. These heavy metals sip into soil, water, and food chains, leading to bioaccumulation, bio-magnification and causing significant health risks, including cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and reproductive toxicity. Additionally, the addition of indigenous case studies from Nigeria, such as lead poisoning in Zamfara State and contamination in the Great Kwa River of Cross Rivers State underscores the disproportionate impact of heavy metal pollution in developing nations. These case studies reveal the socio-economic and environmental dimensions of the issue, providing a contextual understanding of region-specific vulnerabilities and health outcomes. To address these problems, the review evaluates already existing mitigation strategies, including chelation therapy and phytoremediation, while proposing sustainable, cost-effective solutions for reducing exposure and mitigating impacts. It emphasizes the importance of integrative approaches involving policy, community engagement, and technological innovations to fight heavy metal contamination effectively.

                Chickenpox is an extremely contagious disease; caused by the varicella-zoster virus primary infection. The most common symptom of chickenpox is a vesicular rash that appears on the scalp, back, and front of the neck, face, and scapulae and then disseminates distally to the limbs. A 27-year-old adult Black African male health care worker presented with severe headache, intermittent weakness and inability to walk, intermittent nausea, fever, nocturnal polydipsia, shortness of breath, itching, pruritus (intensely pruritic erythematous macules), lesions with pus on the skin, sleep disturbances, and nightmares for two days. In this case report, the patient face, neck and scapulae were the most infected areas of the body and the rest of the body except the legs, hands, genital areas and buttocks, were also highly infected. Acyclovir 800 mg orally, five times a day, was given for ten days to treat chickenpox infection because acyclovir inhibits varicella zoster virus replication. It is typically unable to eradicate varicella-zoster virus from the latent state in neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1503/v2?src=rss">Life Cycle Assessment of Microalgae-Based Products for Carbon Dioxide Utilization in Thailand: Biofertilizer, Fish Feed, and Biodiesel [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Microalgae-based products offer a sustainable solution for food, fuel, and agricultural inputs, presenting environmental benefits and economic opportunities. A comprehensive assessment is needed to understand their potential in supporting sustainability goals, considering the complex interplay between production methods, energy sources, and environmental impacts. Methods This study evaluated the environmental impacts of three microalgae-derived products – biodiesel, fish feed, and biofertilizer – through a comprehensive life cycle assessment. Nine scenarios were explored comparing three electricity profiles (current Thai mix, 50% renewable/50% current mix hybrid, 100% renewable) across the three products. The assessment evaluated environmental impacts and potential economic benefits of transitioning to these microalgae-based alternatives. Results and discussion All products demonstrated potential for significant environmental benefits under increased renewable energy scenarios. Fish feed consistently exhibited the lowest environmental impacts across all categories examined, showing substantial improvements with increased renewable energy use. With an annual demand of 0.4 million tonnes, fish feed could generate USD 560 million in revenue and reduce CO2 emissions by 1.1 million tonnes. Fulfilling the projected biodiesel demand of 4,015 million liters per year through microalgae production could yield approximately USD 3.5 billion in revenue and reduce CO2 emissions by 30 million tonnes compared to conventional fossil-based diesel. Additionally, algal biofertilizer production could meet a 5 million tonnes annual demand, offering USD 2 billion in revenue while reducing CO2 emissions by 6 million tonnes yearly. Collectively, these products could offset 37 million tonnes of CO2, representing about 14% of Thailand’s total CO2 emissions, contributing significantly to the country’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target of 20-30% greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Conclusion Transitioning to microalgae-based products could transform the aquaculture, energy, and agricultural sectors, potentially supporting the national climate change mitigation goals, if implemented.
