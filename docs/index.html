	<p>Electroencephalography (EEG) records the electrical activity of the brain, which is an important tool for the automatic detection of epileptic seizures. It is certainly a very heavy burden to only recognize EEG epilepsy manually, so the method of computer-assisted treatment is of great importance. This paper presents a seizure detection algorithm based on variational modal decomposition (VMD) and a deep forest (DF) model. Variational modal decomposition is performed on EEG recordings, and the first three variational modal functions (VMFs) are selected to construct the time&amp;amp;ndash;frequency distribution of the EEG signals. Then, the log&amp;amp;minus;Euclidean covariance matrix (LECM) is computed to represent the EEG properties and form EEG features. The deep forest model is applied to complete the EEG signal classification, which is a non-neural network deep model with a cascade structure that performs feature learning through the forest. In addition, to improve the classification accuracy, postprocessing techniques are performed to generate the discriminant results by moving average filtering and adaptive collar expansion. The algorithm was evaluated on the Bonn EEG dataset and the Freiburg long&amp;amp;minus;term EEG dataset, and the former achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 99.32% and 99.31%, respectively. The mean sensitivity and specificity of this method for the 21 patients in the Freiburg dataset were 95.2% and 98.56%, respectively, with a false detection rate of 0.36/h. These results demonstrate the superior performance advantage of our algorithm and indicate its great research potential in epilepsy detection.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Importance of Semantic Network Brain Regions in Integrating Prior Knowledge with an Ongoing Dialogue</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>To understand a dialogue, we need to know the topics that are being discussed. This enables us to integrate our knowledge of what was said previously to interpret the current dialogue. This study involved a large-scale behavioral experiment conducted online and a separate fMRI experiment, both testing human participants. In both, we selectively manipulated knowledge about the narrative content of dialogues presented in short videos. The clips were scenes from situation comedies that were split into two parts. The speech in the part 1 clips could either be presented normally or spectrally rotated to render it unintelligible. The part 2 clips that concluded the scenes were always presented normally. The behavioral experiment showed that knowledge of the preceding narrative boosted memory for the part 2 clips as well as increased the intersubject semantic similarity of recalled descriptions of the dialogues. The fMRI experiment replicated the finding that prior knowledge improved memory for the conclusions of the dialogues. Furthermore, prior knowledge strengthened temporal intersubject correlations in brain regions including the left angular gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus. Together, these findings show that (1) prior knowledge constrains the interpretation of a dialogue to be more similar across individuals; and (2), consistent with this, the activation of brain regions involved in semantic control processing is also more similar between individuals who share the same prior knowledge. Processing in these regions likely supports the activation and integration of prior knowledge, which helps people to better understand and remember dialogues as they unfold.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide (PACAP) System of the Central Amygdala Mediates the Detrimental Effects of Chronic Social Defeat Stress in Rats</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Many psychiatric diseases stem from an inability to cope with stressful events, as chronic stressors can precipitate or exacerbate psychopathologies. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying the response to chronic stress and the resulting anxiety states remain poorly understood. Stress neuropeptides in the extended amygdala circuitry mediate the behavioral response to stress, and hyperactivity of these systems has been hypothesized to be responsible for the emergence of persistent negative outcomes and for the pathogenesis of anxiety-related and trauma-related disorders. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and its receptor PAC1R are highly expressed within the central amygdala (CeA) and play a key role in stress regulation. Here, we used chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), a clinically relevant model of psychosocial stress that produces robust maladaptive behaviors in rodents. We found that 10 days of CSDS cause a significant increase in PACAP levels selectively in the CeA of rats, as well as an increase in PAC1R mRNA. Using a viral vector strategy, we found that PAC1R knock-down in the CeA attenuates the CSDS-induced body weight loss and prevents the CSDS-induced increase in anxiety-like behavior. Notably, CSDS animals display reduced basal corticosterone (CORT) levels and PAC1R knock-down in CeA further reduce them. Finally, the CeA PAC1R knock-down blocks the increase in corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) immunoreactivity induced by CSDS in CeA. Our findings support the notion that the persistent activation of the PACAP-PAC1R system in the CeA mediates the behavioral outcomes of chronic psychosocial stress independently of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, perhaps via the recruitment of the CRF system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Abstinence-Dependent Effects of Long-Access Cocaine Self-Administration on Nucleus Accumbens Astrocytes Are Observed in Male, But Not Female, Rats</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Accumulating evidence indicates significant consequences for astrocytes associated with drug abuse. For example, reductions in structural features and synaptic colocalization of male rat nucleus accumbens (NAc) astrocytes are observed following short-access (ShA; 2 h/d) self-administration and extinction from cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin. However, it is unknown whether these observations extend to other rodent models of drug abuse, how enduring these effects may be, and whether similar effects are observed in female rats. Here, we assess the effects of long-access (LgA; 6 h/d) cocaine self-administration and abstinence on NAc astrocytes separately in male and female rats, employing a commonly used behavioral approach to investigate the incubation of cocaine craving. NAc astrocytes from male rats exhibit extensive (~40%) reductions in surface area, volume, and postsynaptic colocalization 45 d but not 24 h after the last self-administration session. In contrast, no effect of self-administration and abstinence was observed in astrocytes from female rats. Moreover, no effect of LgA self-administration and abstinence was observed on NAc GLT-1 expression in female rats, an effect that has been well described in males. These results indicate striking and sexually dimorphic effects of abstinence subsequent to LgA self-administration on astrocytes. Taken together, these results indicate a pivotal role of prolonged abstinence in the effects of cocaine self-administration on NAc astrocytes, and extend a growing body of evidence regarding sex differences in the cellular consequences of drug self-administration in the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">p140Cap Regulates the Composition and Localization of the NMDAR Complex in Synaptic Lipid Rafts</a></h4>

              
                <p>The NMDARs are key players in both physiological and pathologic synaptic plasticity because of their involvement in many aspects of neuronal transmission as well as learning and memory. The contribution in these events of different types of GluN2A-interacting proteins is still unclear. The p140Cap scaffold protein acts as a hub for postsynaptic complexes relevant to psychiatric and neurologic disorders and regulates synaptic functions, such as the stabilization of mature dendritic spine, memory consolidation, LTP, and LTD. Here we demonstrate that p140Cap directly binds the GluN2A subunit of NMDAR and modulates GluN2A-associated molecular network. Indeed, in p140Cap KO male mice, GluN2A is less associated with PSD95 both in <I>ex vivo</I> synaptosomes and in cultured hippocampal neurons, and p140Cap expression in KO neurons can rescue GluN2A and PSD95 colocalization. p140Cap is crucial in the recruitment of GluN2A-containing NMDARs and, consequently, in regulating NMDARs' intrinsic properties. p140Cap is associated to synaptic lipid-raft (LR) and to soluble postsynaptic membranes, and GluN2A and PSD95 are less recruited into synaptic LR of p140Cap KO male mice. Gated-stimulated emission depletion microscopy on hippocampal neurons confirmed that p140Cap is required for embedding GluN2A clusters in LR in an activity-dependent fashion. In the synaptic compartment, p140Cap influences the association between GluN2A and PSD95 and modulates GluN2A enrichment into LR. Overall, such increase in these membrane domains rich in signaling molecules results in improved signal transduction efficiency.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Here we originally show that the adaptor protein p140Cap directly binds the GluN2A subunit of NMDAR and modulates the GluN2A-associated molecular network. Moreover, we show, for the first time, that p140Cap also associates to synaptic lipid rafts and controls the selective recruitment of GluN2A and PSD95 to this specific compartment. Finally, gated-stimulated emission depletion microscopy on hippocampal neurons confirmed that p140Cap is required for embedding GluN2A clusters in lipid rafts in an activity-dependent fashion. Overall, our findings provide the molecular and functional dissection of p140Cap as a new active member of a highly dynamic synaptic network involved in memory consolidation, LTP, and LTD, which are known to be altered in neurologic and psychiatric disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Afferent Loss, GABA, and Central Gain in Older Adults: Associations with Speech Recognition in Noise</a></h4>

              
                <p>Deficits in auditory nerve (AN) function for older adults reduce afferent input to the cortex. The extent to which the cortex in older adults adapts to this loss of afferent input and the mechanisms underlying this adaptation are not well understood. We took a neural systems approach measuring AN and cortical evoked responses within 50 older and 27 younger human adults (59 female) to estimate central gain or increased cortical activity despite reduced AN activity. Relative to younger adults, older adults' AN response amplitudes were smaller, but cortical responses were not. We used the relationship between AN and cortical response amplitudes in younger adults to predict cortical response amplitudes for older adults from their AN responses. Central gain in older adults was thus defined as the difference between their observed cortical responses and those predicted from the parameter estimates of younger adults. In older adults, decreased afferent input contributed to lower cortical GABA levels, greater central gain, and poorer speech recognition in noise (SIN). These effects on SIN occur in addition to, and independent from, effects attributed to elevated hearing thresholds. Our results are consistent with animal models of central gain and suggest that reduced AN afferent input in some older adults may result in changes in cortical encoding and inhibitory neurotransmission, which contribute to reduced SIN. An advancement in our understanding of the changes that occur throughout the auditory system in response to the gradual loss of input with increasing age may provide potential therapeutic targets for intervention.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Age-related hearing loss is one of the most common chronic conditions of aging, yet little is known about how the cortex adapts to this loss of sensory input. We measured AN and cortical responses to the same stimulus in younger and older adults. In older adults we found hyperexcitability in cortical activity relative to concomitant declines in afferent input that are consistent with central gain. Lower levels of cortical GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, were associated with greater central gain, which predicted poorer SIN. The results suggest that the cortex in older adults may adapt to attenuated sensory input by reducing inhibition to amplify the cortical response, but this amplification may lead to poorer SIN.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Layer-Specific Developmentally Precise Axon Targeting of Transient Suppressed-by-Contrast Retinal Ganglion Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>The mouse retina encodes diverse visual features in the spike trains of &gt;40 retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types. Each RGC type innervates a specific subset of the &gt;50 retinorecipient brain areas. Our catalog of RGC types and feature representations is nearing completion. Yet, we know little about where specific RGC types send their information. Furthermore, the developmental strategies by which RGC axons choose their targets and pattern their terminal arbors remain obscure. Here, we identify a genetic intersection (<I>Cck-Cre</I> and <I>Brn3c<sup>CKOAP</sup></I>) that selectively labels transient Suppressed-by-Contrast (tSbC) RGCs, a member of an evolutionarily conserved functionally mysterious RGC subclass. We find that tSbC RGCs selectively innervate the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and ventrolateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN) of the thalamus, the superior colliculus (SC), and the nucleus of the optic tract (NOT) in mice of either sex. They binocularly innervate dLGN and vLGN but project only contralaterally to SC and NOT. In each target, tSbC RGC axons occupy a specific sublayer, suggesting that they restrict their input to specific circuits. The tSbC RGC axons span the length of the optic tract by birth and remain poised there until they simultaneously innervate their four targets around postnatal day 3. The tSbC RGC axons choose the right targets and establish mature stratification patterns from the outset. This precision is maintained in the absence of Brn3c. Our results provide the first map of SbC inputs to the brain, revealing a narrow target set, unexpected laminar organization, target-specific binocularity, and developmental precision.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In recent years, we have learned a lot about the visual features encoded by RGCs, the output neurons of the eye. In contrast, we know little about where RGCs send their information and how RGC axons, which carry this information, target specific brain areas during development. Here, we develop an intersectional strategy to label a unique RGC type, the tSbC RGC, and map its projections. We find that tSbC RGC axons are highly selective. They innervate few retinal targets and restrict their arbors to specific sublayers within these targets. The selective tSbC RGC projection patterns develop synchronously and without trial and error, suggesting molecular determinism and coordination.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Enhancement of Hippocampal-Thalamocortical Temporal Coordination during Slow-Frequency Long-Duration Anterior Thalamic Spindles</a></h4>

              
                <p>Temporal nesting of cortical slow oscillations, thalamic spindles, and hippocampal ripples indicates multiregional neuronal interactions required for memory consolidation. However, how the thalamic activity during spindles organizes hippocampal dynamics remains largely undetermined. We analyzed simultaneous recordings of anterodorsal thalamus and CA1 in male mice to determine the contribution of thalamic spindles in cross-regional synchronization. Our results indicated that temporal hippocampo-thalamocortical coupling was more enhanced during slower and longer thalamic spindles. Additionally, spindles occurring closer to slow oscillation trough were more strongly coupled to ripples. We found that the temporal association between CA1 spiking/ripples and thalamic spindles was stronger following spatial exploration compared with baseline sleep. We further developed a hippocampal-thalamocortical model to explain the mechanism underlying the duration and frequency-dependent coupling of thalamic spindles to hippocampal activity. Our findings shed light on our understanding of the functional role of thalamic activity during spindles on multiregional information transfer.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The contribution of thalamic spindles with differential properties to cross-regional synchronization and information transfer still remains poorly understood. Using simultaneous anterodorsal thalamic and hippocampal recordings from naturally sleeping mice before and after exploration, we found strong coupling of CA1 units to anterodorsal thalamic spindles and increase of this coupling following spatial experience. We further showed that the temporal coupling of CA1 units and hippocampal ripples with thalamic spindles and the spindle-associated modulation of CA1 units with ripples were stronger for spindles with slower frequency of oscillations. Our experimental as well as computational findings using a hippocampal-thalamocortical model provide the first demonstration that spindle frequency and duration can provide valuable information about the underlying multiregional interactions essential for memory consolidation computations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Oscillatory Population-Level Activity of Dorsal Raphe Serotonergic Neurons Is Inscribed in Sleep Structure</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dorsal raphe (DR) 5-HT neurons regulate sleep&ndash;wake transitions. Previous studies demonstrated that single-unit activity of DR 5-HT neurons is high during wakefulness, decreases during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and ceases during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. However, characteristics of the population-level activity of DR 5-HT neurons, which influence the entire brain, are largely unknown. Here, we measured population activities of 5-HT neurons in the male and female mouse DR across the sleep&ndash;wake cycle by ratiometric fiber photometry. We found a slow oscillatory activity of compound intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals during NREM sleep. The trough of the concave 5-HT activity increased across sleep progression, but 5-HT activity always returned to that seen during the wake period. When the trough reached a minimum and remained there, REM sleep was initiated. We also found a unique coupling of the oscillatory 5-HT activity and wideband EEG power fluctuation. Furthermore, optogenetic activation of 5-HT neurons during NREM sleep triggered a high EMG power and induced wakefulness, demonstrating a causal role of 5-HT neuron activation. Optogenetic inhibition induced REM sleep or sustained NREM, with an EEG power increase and EEG fluctuation, and pharmacological silencing of 5-HT activity using a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor led to sustained NREM, with an EEG power decrease and EEG fluctuation. These inhibitory manipulations supported the association between oscillatory 5-HT activity and EEG fluctuation. We propose that NREM sleep is not a monotonous state, but rather it contains dynamic changes that coincide with the oscillatory population-level activity of DR 5-HT neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previous studies have demonstrated single-cell 5-HT neuronal activity across sleep&ndash;wake conditions. However, population-level activities of these neurons are not well understood. We monitored DR 5-HT population activity using a fiber photometry system in mice and found that activity was highest during wakefulness and lowest during REM sleep. Surprisingly, during non-REM sleep, the 5-HT population activity decreased with an oscillatory pattern, coinciding with EEG fluctuations. EEG fluctuations persisted when DR 5-HT neuron activity was silenced by either optogenetic or pharmacological interventions during non-REM sleep, suggesting an association between the two. Although oscillatory DR 5-HT neuron activity did not generate EEG fluctuations, it provides evidence that non-REM sleep exhibits at least binary states.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Non-Neural Factors Influencing BOLD Response Magnitudes within Individual Subjects</a></h4>

              
                <p>To what extent is the size of the BOLD response influenced by factors other than neural activity? In a reanalysis of three neuroimaging datasets (male and female human participants), we find large systematic inhomogeneities in the BOLD response magnitude in primary visual cortex (V1): stimulus-evoked BOLD responses, expressed in units of percent signal change, are up to 50% larger along the representation of the horizontal meridian than the vertical meridian. To assess whether this surprising effect can be interpreted as differences in local neural activity, we quantified several factors that potentially contribute to the size of the BOLD response. We find relationships between BOLD response magnitude and cortical thickness, curvature, depth, and macrovasculature. These relationships are consistently found across subjects and datasets and suggest that variation in BOLD response magnitudes across cortical locations reflects, in part, differences in anatomy and vascularization. To compensate for these factors, we implement a regression-based correction method and show that, after correction, BOLD responses become more homogeneous across V1. The correction reduces the horizontal/vertical difference by about half, indicating that some of the difference is likely not because of neural activity differences. We conclude that interpretation of variation in BOLD response magnitude across cortical locations should consider the influence of the potential confounding factors of thickness, curvature, depth, and vascularization.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The magnitude of the BOLD signal is often used as a surrogate of neural activity, but the exact factors that contribute to its strength have not been studied on a voxel-wise level. Here, we examined several anatomical and measurement-related factors to assess their relationship with BOLD signal magnitude. We find that BOLD magnitude correlates with cortical anatomy, depth, and macrovasculature. To remove the contribution of these factors, we propose a simple, data-driven correction method that can be used in any fMRI experiment. After accounting for the confounding factors, BOLD magnitude becomes more spatially homogeneous. Our correction method improves the ability to make more accurate inferences about local neural activity from fMRI data.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Two Types of Motor Inhibition after Action Errors in Humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>Adaptive behavior requires the ability to appropriately react to action errors. Post-error slowing (PES) of response times is one of the most reliable phenomena in human behavior. It has been proposed that PES is partially achieved through inhibition of the motor system. However, there is no direct evidence for this link, or indeed, that the motor system is physiologically inhibited after errors altogether. Here, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation and electromyography to measure corticospinal excitability (CSE) across four experiments using a Simon task, in which female and male human participants sometimes committed errors. Errors were followed by reduced CSE at two different time points and in two different modes. Shortly after error commission (250 ms), CSE was broadly suppressed (i.e., even task-unrelated motor effectors were inhibited). During the preparation of the subsequent response, CSE was specifically reduced at task-relevant effectors only. This latter effect was directly related to PES, with stronger CSE suppression accompanying greater PES. This suggests that PES is achieved through increased inhibitory control during post-error responses. To provide converging evidence, we then reanalyzed an openly available EEG dataset that contained both Simon- and Stop-signal tasks using independent component analysis. We found that the same neural source component that indexed action cancellation in the stop-signal task also showed clear PES-related activity during post-error responses in the Simon task. Together, these findings provide evidence that post-error adaptation is partially achieved through motor inhibition. Moreover, inhibition is engaged in two modes (first nonselective, then selective), aligning with recent multistage theories of error processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is a common observation that humans implement a higher degree of caution when repeating an action during which they just committed a mistake. In the laboratory, such increased "caution" is reflected in post-error slowing of response latencies. Many competing theories exist regarding the precise neural mechanisms underlying post-error slowing. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, we show that, after error commission, the human corticomotor system is momentarily inhibited, both immediately after an error and during the preparation of the next action. Moreover, motor inhibition during the latter time period is directly predictive of post-error slowing. This shows that inhibitory control is a key mechanism humans engage to regulate their own behavior in the aftermath of error commission.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamics of Hierarchical Task Representations</a></h4>

              
                <p>Task representations are critical for cognitive control and adaptive behavior. The hierarchical organization of task representations allows humans to maintain goals, integrate information across varying contexts, and select potential responses. In this study we characterized the structure and interactive dynamics of task representations that facilitate cognitive control. Human participants (both males and females) performed a hierarchical task that required them to select a response rule while considering the contingencies from different contextual inputs. By applying time- and frequency-resolved representational similarity analysis to human electroencephalography data, we characterized properties of task representations that are otherwise difficult to observe. We found that participants formed multiple representations of task-relevant contexts and features from the presented stimuli, beyond simple stimulus&ndash;response mappings. These disparate representations were hierarchically structured, with higher-order contextual representations dominantly influencing subordinate representations of task features and response rules. Furthermore, this cascade of top-down interactions facilitated faster responses. Our results describe key properties of task representations that support hierarchical cognitive control.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Humans can adjust their actions in response to contingencies imposed by the environment. Although it has long been hypothesized that this ability depends on mental representations of tasks, the neural dynamics of task representations have been difficult to characterize. Our study used electroencephalography data from human participants to demonstrate the neural organization and interactive dynamics of task representations. Our results revealed a top-down, hierarchically organized representational structure that encoded multiple contexts and features from the environment. To support cognitive control, higher-level contextual representations influenced subordinate representations of task-relevant features and potential responses, facilitating response selection in a context-dependent manner. Our results provide direct evidence of organizational properties of task representations, which are cornerstones of cognitive control theories.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Alpha Oscillations Track Content-Specific Working Memory Capacity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Although the neural basis of working memory (WM) capacity is often studied by exploiting interindividual differences, capacity may also differ across memory materials within a given individual. Here, we exploit the content dependence of WM capacity as a novel approach to investigate the oscillatory correlates of WM capacity, focusing on posterior 9&ndash;12 Hz alpha activity during retention. We recorded scalp electroencephalography (EEG) while male and female human participants performed WM tasks with varying memory loads (two vs. four items) and materials (English letters vs. regular shapes vs. abstract shapes). First, behavioral data confirmed that memory capacity was fundamentally content dependent; capacity for abstract shapes plateaued at around two, whereas the participants could remember more letters and regular shapes. Critically, content-specific capacity was paralleled in the degree of attenuation of EEG-alpha activity that plateaued in a similar content-specific manner. Although we observed greater alpha attenuation for higher loads for all materials, we found larger load effects for letters and regular shapes than for abstract shapes, which is consistent with our behavioral data showing a lower capacity plateau for abstract shapes. Moreover, when only considering two-item trials, alpha attenuation was greater for abstract shapes where two items were close to the capacity plateau than for other materials. Multivariate decoding of alpha activity patterns reinforced these findings. Finally, for each material, load effects on capacity (<I>K</I>) and alpha attenuation were correlated across individuals. Our results demonstrate that alpha oscillations track memory capacity in a content-specific manner and track not just the number of items but also their complexity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> WM is limited in its capacity. We show that capacity is not fixed for an individual but is rather memory-content dependent. Moreover, we used this as a novel approach to investigate the neural basis of WM capacity with EEG. We found that both behavioral capacity estimates and neural oscillations in the alpha band varied with memory loads and materials. The critical finding is a capacity plateau of approximately two items only for the more complex materials, accompanied by a similar plateau in the EEG alpha attenuation. The load effects on capacity and alpha attenuation were furthermore correlated across individuals for each of the materials. Our results demonstrate that alpha oscillations track the content-specific nature of WM capacity.</p>

                <p>Fragile X Syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder and the most common monogenic cause of intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, and anxiety disorders. Loss of fragile x mental retardation protein results in disruptions of synaptic development during a critical period of circuit formation in the BLA. However, it is unknown how these alterations impact microcircuit development and function. Using a combination of electrophysiologic and behavioral approaches in both male (<I>Fmr1</I>-/y) and female (<I>Fmr1</I>&ndash;/&ndash;) mice, we demonstrate that principal neurons in the <I>Fmr1</I>KO BLA exhibit hyperexcitability during a sensitive period in amygdala development. This hyperexcitability contributes to increased excitatory gain in fear-learning circuits. Further, synaptic plasticity is enhanced in the BLA of <I>Fmr1</I>KO mice. Behavioral correlation demonstrates that fear-learning emerges precociously in the <I>Fmr1</I>KO mouse. Early life 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo [5,4-c]pyridin-3ol intervention ameliorates fear-learning in <I>Fmr1KO</I> mice. These results suggest that critical period plasticity in the amygdala of the <I>Fmr1</I>KO mouse may be shifted to earlier developmental time points.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In these studies, we identify early developmental alterations in principal neurons in the Fragile X syndrome BLA. We show that, as early as P14, excitability and feedforward excitation, and synaptic plasticity are enhanced in Fmr1KO lateral amygdala. This correlates with precocious emergence of fear-learning in the <I>Fmr1</I>KO mouse. Early life 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo [5,4-c]pyridin-3ol intervention restores critical period plasticity in WT mice and ameliorates fear-learning in the <I>Fmr1</I>KO mouse.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Downregulating PTBP1 Fails to Convert Astrocytes into Hippocampal Neurons and to Alleviate Symptoms in Alzheimer's Mouse Models</a></h4>

              
                <p>Conversion of astroglia into functional neurons has been considered a promising therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies reported that downregulation of the RNA binding protein, polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1), converts astrocytes into neurons <I>in situ</I> in multiple mouse brain regions, consequently improving pathologic phenotypes associated with Parkinson's disease, RGC loss, and aging. Here, we demonstrate that PTBP1 downregulation using an astrocyte-specific AAV-mediated shRNA system fails to convert hippocampal astrocytes into neurons in both male and female wild-type (WT) and &beta;-amyloid (5<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT>FAD) and tau (PS19) Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models and fails to reverse synaptic/cognitive deficits and AD-associated pathology in male mice. Similarly, PTBP1 downregulation cannot convert astrocytes into neurons in the striatum and substantia nigra in both male and female WT mice. Together, our study suggests that cell fate conversion strategy for neurodegenerative disease therapy through manipulating one single gene, such as PTBP1, warrants more rigorous scrutiny.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our results do not support some of the recent extraordinary and revolutionary claims that resident astrocytes can be directly and efficiently converted into neurons. Our study is critical for the field of neural regeneration and degeneration. In addition, our study is financially important because it may prevent other researchers/organizations from wasting a vast amount of time and resources on relevant investigations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Tripartite Crosstalk between Cytokine IL-1{beta}, NMDA-R and Misplaced Mitochondrial Anchor in Neuronal Dendrites Is a Novel Pathway for Neurodegeneration in Inflammatory Diseases</a></h4>

              
                <p>The mitochondrial anchor syntaphilin (SNPH) is a key mitochondrial protein normally expressed in axons to maintain neuronal health by positioning mitochondria along axons for metabolic needs. However, in 2019 we discovered a novel form of excitotoxicity that results when SNPH is misplaced into neuronal dendrites in disease models. A key unanswered question about this SNPH excitotoxicity is the pathologic molecules that trigger misplacement or intrusion of SNPH into dendrites. Here, we identified two different classes of pathologic molecules that interact to trigger dendritic SNPH intrusion. Using primary hippocampal neuronal cultures from mice of either sex, we demonstrated that the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1&beta; interacts with NMDA to trigger SNPH intrusion into dendrites. First, IL-1&beta; and NMDA each individually triggers dendritic SNPH intrusion. Second, IL-1&beta; and NMDA do not act independently but interact. Thus, blocking NMDAR by the antagonist MK-801 blocks IL-1&beta; from triggering dendritic SNPH intrusion. Further, decoupling the known interaction between IL-1&beta; and NMDAR by tyrosine inhibitors prevents either IL-1&beta; or NMDA from triggering dendritic SNPH intrusion. Third, neuronal toxicity caused by IL-1&beta; or NMDA is strongly ameliorated in SNPH<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> neurons. Together, we hypothesize that the known bipartite IL-1&beta;/NMDAR crosstalk converges to trigger misplacement of SNPH in dendrites as a final common pathway to cause neurodegeneration. Targeting dendritic SNPH in this novel tripartite IL-1&beta;/NMDAR/SNPH interaction could be a strategic downstream locus for ameliorating neurotoxicity in inflammatory diseases.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> SNPH is a key mitochondrial protein normally expressed specifically in healthy axons to help position mitochondria along axons to match metabolic needs. In 2019 we discovered that misplacement of SNPH into neuronal dendrites causes a novel form of excitotoxicity in rodent models of multiple sclerosis. A key unanswered question about this new form of dendritic SNPH toxicity concerns pathologic molecules that trigger toxic misplacement of SNPH into dendrites. Here, we identified two major categories of pathologic molecules, the pro-inflammatory cytokines and NMDA, that interact and converge to trigger toxic misplacement of SNPH into dendrites. We propose that a dendritic mitochondrial anchor provides a novel, single common target for ameliorating diverse inflammatory and excitatory injuries in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Improving the predictive power of xenograft and syngeneic anti-tumour studies using mice humanised for pathways of drug metabolism [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Drug development is an expensive and time-consuming process, with only a small fraction of drugs gaining regulatory approval from the often many thousands of candidates identified during target validation. Once a lead compound has been identified and optimised, they are subject to intensive pre-clinical research to determine their pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties, procedures which inevitably involve significant numbers of animals - mainly mice and rats, but also dogs and monkeys in much smaller numbers and for specific types of drug candidates. Many compounds that emerge from this process, having been shown to be safe and efficacious in pre-clinical studies, subsequently fail to replicate this outcome in clinical trials, therefore wasting time, money and, most importantly, animals. The poor predictive power of animal models in pre-clinical studies is predominantly due to lack of efficacy or safety reasons, which in turn can be attributed mainly to the significant species differences in drug metabolism between humans and animals. To circumvent this, we have developed a complex transgenic mouse model – 8HUM - which faithfully replicates human Phase I drug metabolism (and its regulation), and which will generate more human-relevant data [REFINEMENT] from fewer animals [REDUCTION] in a pre-clinical setting and reduce attrition in the clinic. One key area for the pre-clinical application of animals in an oncology setting – almost exclusively mice - is their use in anti-tumour studies. We now further demonstrate the utility of the 8HUM mouse using a murine melanoma cell line as a syngeneic tumour and also present an immunodeficient version 8HUM_Rag2-/- - for use in xenograft studies. These models will be of significant benefit not only to Pharma for pre-clinical drug development work, but also throughout the drug efficacy, toxicology, pharmacology, and drug metabolism communities, where fewer animals will be needed to generate more human-relevant data.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Predictors of face mask use during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia: Application of the health belief model, psychological distress and health motivation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: High infection rates of COVID-19 in Indonesia require attention, especially transmission and prevention behaviors. One way to lower infection rates is the use of face masks. However, people's adherence to its usage when in public is still low. This necessitates the exploration of predictors of the use of masks to increase community compliance. This study further aims to investigate the predictors of face mask use by applying the Health Belief Model, anxiety, stress, depression, and health motivation. Methods: A total of 255 respondents from Jakarta, Bandung, Tangerang, and Banten filled out an online questionnaire. Furthermore, hierarchical multiple regression was used to detect predictors associated with face mask use. Results: The results showed that the high perceived benefits and health motivation were higher in individuals who used a face mask when in public, while those who have high perceived barriers likely do not use masks. The respondent's level of psychological distress, including depression, anxiety, and stress were not associated with face mask use. Conclusions: Therefore, these findings highlight the importance of personal appraisal regarding COVID-19 and its prevention behaviors. Comfortable mask design, and emphasizing the benefits of using masks in the community improve compliance.

                Background: Leptomeningeal metastasis is an infrequent form of cancer expression, and it has a poor prognosis due to its torpid evolution and its challenging diagnosis. Case report: We report the case of a 68-year-old woman with rapidly progressing cognitive decline and focal epilepsy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive gyriform hypersignal in the right precentral sulcus region, without mass effect, tenuous contrast uptake, and hydrocephalus with transependymal edema. The body tomographic study was negative for solid cancer and the 18F-FDG PET-CT revealed a severe hypermetabolism in the right lung upper lobe. These findings were suggestive of lung cancer with leptomeningeal metastasis. We performed a brain biopsy, finding atypical cells in the leptomeningeal region with positive immunohistochemical staining for CK7 and negative for CK20 corresponding to lung adenocarcinoma. The patient was evaluated in the oncology service and scheduled for radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Conclusions: Focal leptomeningeal disease is an entity that should be considered as a differential diagnosis in all cases of focal leptomeningitis. Timely diagnosis and adequate cancer management can increase patient survival.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Liability of Artificial Intelligence's Moral Dilemma [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents the fundamentals of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Its advancement in technology has brought benefit to mankind over the years, which helps to amplify our daily lives in numerous ways. Among the technologies that have been innovated utilizing AI are Artificial Intelligence Lawyers (AI Lawyers), autonomous vehicles, AI judges, augmented drafting services and delivery drones. Although AI has brought many advancements in our lives, concerns are raised with regards to the moral implication of AI. This study aims to examine the situation wherein tools which incorporate AI would have to face a moral dilemma situation, or situations where AI had acted beyond what was instructed or programmed by the manufacturers. Thus, this work discusses whether the torts theory of liability on negligence is applicable in such a context. Methods: The methodology involved a doctrinal research in analysing the legal rules and existing studies in relation to AI and the negligence principle to develop a critical analysis of the literature. Besides, this research finds the application of principle negligence adopted in other countries, particularly in the United States, since it has employed AI much earlier compared to other countries. Results: The findings suggest that the question of the liability of AI is still at its infancy, as policy makers or regulators have yet to decide the liability of AI. However, the findings also suggest that theories of liabilities such as product liability and strict liability are possible to adduce liability on AI, so long as AI could be defined as a product. The research limitation is the scarcity amount of related studies available in the literature. The motivation of this work is in the importance to determine whether advanced AI may be liable for ‘moral decisions’ that cause damage to the victim under the principle of negligence.

                Background: A chronic inflammatory process can cause disorders on the cardiovascular system. It is caused by an enhancement of inflammatory cytokines that can decrease the heart working-function. This article aims to review inflammatory cytokines that can cause the cardiovascular system disease. Methods: The review process began by taking articles from two databases, namely PubMed and SpringerLink without using the publication year limit. The reviewed article was a research article using human samples, which analyzed the impact of inflammatory cytokines on cardiovascular disease or the risk level of cardiovascular disease. Result: From a total of 3926 articles originating from two databases, 21 obtained articles have matched with the inclusion criteria for the review process. Of those 21 articles, 17 reported an increased effect of inflammatory cytokines on cardiovascular disease, while four articles showed no association between increased inflammatory cytokines and cardiovascular disease. There were six inflammatory cytokines that could affect cardiovascular disease, namely: TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-17 where cytokine IL-6 is confirmed by as many as 14 articles, TNF-α as many as six articles, and IL-1 β as many as three articles as inflammatory cytokines that could affect cardiovascular function. Conclusion: The increased level of inflammatory cytokines can be a trigger for decreased function and cause the disease in the cardiovascular system.

                The taxon Elasmobranchii (sharks and rays) contains one of the long-established evolutionary lineages of vertebrates with a tantalizing collection of species occupying critical aquatic habitats. To overcome the current limitation in molecular resources, we launched the Squalomix Consortium in 2020 to promote a genome-wide array of molecular approaches, specifically targeting shark and ray species. Among the various bottlenecks in working with elasmobranchs are their elusiveness and low fecundity as well as the large and highly repetitive genomes. Their peculiar body fluid composition has also hindered the establishment of methods to perform routine cell culturing required for their karyotyping. In the Squalomix consortium, these obstacles are expected to be solved through a combination of in-house cytological techniques including karyotyping of cultured cells, chromatin preparation for Hi-C data acquisition, and high fidelity long-read sequencing. The resources and products obtained in this consortium, including genome and transcriptome sequences, a genome browser powered by JBrowse2 to visualize sequence alignments, and comprehensive matrices of gene expression profiles for selected species are accessible through https://github.com/Squalomix/info.

                Background: Breast milk is a critical element in developing a baby's immunity through immune transfer. Antibodies are an essential unit of immunity against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This paper explores antibodies in breast milk in postpartum women who have been vaccinated or exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Duration of antibody appearance was studied to determine the adequate time in transferring antibodies by breastfeeding. Methods: Three databases, PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect, were used as sources of articles. Inclusion criteria applied in selecting articles were prospective observational study or experimental design study in English, evaluating antibodies in breast milk, and conducted between 2019–2021. Article quality and risk of bias were assessed with Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). The data found were synthesized in a narrative manner. Results: This systematic review included 20 articles. A total of 306 postpartum women who were infected with COVID-19, 20 postpartum women who had viral symptoms and 495 postpartum women who had been vaccinated were studied. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were found in the breast milk of infected and vaccinated postpartum women. SARS CoV-2 infection is associated with the presence of IgA dominant, whereas vaccination is related to the presence of IgG dominant. Antibodies persisted from day 10 of onset to 10 months in infected postpartum women and started from three days to six weeks in vaccinated postpartum women. Meta-analysis could not be carried out due to the variety of articles. Conclusions: Antibodies found in breast milk in infected and vaccinated postpartum women have different dominant types. Further research needs to be done regarding the mechanism of antibody transfer in breast milk, longer research duration and studies that directly examine the comparison of antibodies in breast milk in vaccinated and infected postpartum women.

                A recent modelling paper on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in the US (Bartsch et al.) suggested that maintaining face mask use until a high vaccine coverage (70–90%) is achieved is generally cost-effective or even cost-saving in many of the scenarios considered. Their conclusion was based on the assumed effectiveness of continued face mask use, cited from a study that reported an 18% reduction in the effective reproduction number associated with the introduction of state-level mask mandate policies in the US in the summer of 2020. However, using this value implicitly assumes that the effect of face mask use in 2021 through 2022 is the same as that of summer 2020, when stringent nonpharmaceutical interventions were in place. The effectiveness of universal mask wearing in 2021–2022 is probably more uncertain than considered in Bartsch et al. and rigorous sensitivity analysis on this parameter is warranted.

Since next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become widely available, large gene panels containing up to several hundred genes can be sequenced cost-efficiently. However, the interpretation of the often large numbers of sequence variants detected when using NGS is laborious, prone to errors and is often difficult to compare across laboratories. To overcome this challenge, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) have introduced standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequencing variants. Additionally, disease-specific refinements have been developed that include accurate thresholds for many criteria, enabling highly automated processing. This is of particular interest for common but heterogeneous disorders such as hearing impairment. With more than 200 genes associated with hearing disorders, the manual inspection of possible causative variants is particularly difficult and time-consuming.
To this end, we developed the open-source bioinformatics tool GenOtoScope, which automates the analysis of all ACMG/AMP criteria that can be assessed without further individual patient information or human curator investigation, including the refined loss of function criterion (“PVS1”). Two types of interfaces are provided: (i) a command line application to classify sequence variants in batches for a set of patients and (ii) a user-friendly website to classify single variants.
We compared the performance of our tool with two other variant classification tools using two hearing loss data sets, which were manually annotated either by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Gene Curation Expert Panel or the diagnostics unit of our human genetics department. GenOtoScope achieved the best average accuracy and precision for both data sets. Compared to the second-best tool, GenOtoScope improved the accuracy metric by 25.75% and 4.57% and precision metric by 52.11% and 12.13% on the two data sets, respectively. The web interface is accessible via: http://genotoscope.mh-hannover.de:5000 and the command line interface via: https://github.com/damianosmel/GenOtoScope.

Understanding how animals display diverse and complex behaviours remains a central question in biology. A new study in PLOS Biology suggests that the emergence of clusters of parvalbumin neurons in the forebrain could reflect a convergent mechanism underlying the evolution of skilled behaviours in birds.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The primary familial brain calcification-associated protein MYORG is an α-galactosidase with restricted substrate specificity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Richard W. Meek, Jacob Brockerman, Osei B. Fordwour, Wesley F. Zandberg, Gideon J. Davies, David J. Vocadlo</p>

Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is characterised by abnormal deposits of calcium phosphate within various regions of the brain that are associated with severe cognitive impairments, psychiatric conditions, and movement disorders. Recent studies in diverse populations have shown a link between mutations in myogenesis-regulating glycosidase (MYORG) and the development of this disease. MYORG is a member of glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 31 (GH31) and, like the other mammalian GH31 enzyme α-glucosidase II, this enzyme is found in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Though presumed to act as an α-glucosidase due to its localization and sequence relatedness to α-glucosidase II, MYORG has never been shown to exhibit catalytic activity. Here, we show that MYORG is an α-galactosidase and present the high-resolution crystal structure of MYORG in complex with substrate and inhibitor. Using these structures, we map detrimental mutations that are associated with MYORG-associated brain calcification and define how these mutations may drive disease progression through loss of enzymatic activity. Finally, we also detail the thermal stabilisation of MYORG afforded by a clinically approved small molecule ligand, opening the possibility of using pharmacological chaperones to enhance the activity of mutant forms of MYORG.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Identification of prognostic biomarkers of invasive ductal carcinoma by an integrated bioinformatics approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common breast cancer worldwide. Nowadays, due to IDC heterogeneity and its high capacity for metastasis, it is necessary to discover novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Thus, this study aimed to identify new prognostic genes of IDC using an integrated bioinformatics approach. Methods: Using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we downloaded publicly available data of the whole-genome mRNA expression profile from the first three stages of IDC in two expression profiling datasets, GSE29044 and GSE32291; intra-group data repeatability tests were conducted using Pearson’s correlation test, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the online tool GEO2R, followed by the construction of a protein‑protein interaction network (PPI-net) with the common DEGs identified in the three analyzed stages using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database and Cytoscape software, from these PPI-net we identify the hub genes (prognostic genes). Results: We found seven genes [WW domain-containing E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase 1 (WWP1), STIP1 homology and U-box containing protein 1 (STUB1), F-box and WD repeat domain containing 7 (FBXW7), kelch like family member 13 (KLHL13), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 Q1 (UBE2Q1), tripartite motif-containing 11 (TRIM11), and the beta-transducin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (BTRC)] as potential candidates for IDC prognostic biomarkers, which were mainly enriched in the Ubiquitin-specific protease activity, cytoskeletal protein binding, and ligase activity. The role of these genes in the pathophysiology of IDC is not yet well characterized, representing a way to improve our understanding of the process of tumorigenesis and the underlying molecular events of IDC. Conclusions: Genes identified may lead to the discovery of new prognostic targets and precise therapeutics for IDC.

     alt="Aversive memory reactivation: A possible role for delta oscillations in the hippocampus–amygdala circuit"/>
<p>While rats were retrieving a fear memory, changes in oscillatory patterns were observed in dorsal hippocampus and basolateral amygdala, favoring delta oscillations and their interaction with gamma oscillations, associated with increase in plasticity markers levels. Few differences were observed between controls (non-handled) and maternal separation rats.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Memory labilization, the process by which memories become susceptible to update, is essential for memory reconsolidation and has been a target for novel therapies for traumatic memory-associated disorders. Maternal separation (MS) in male rats produced memories resistant to labilization in adulthood. Based on previous results, we hypothesized that temporal desynchronization between the dorsal hippocampus (DHc) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA), during memory retrieval, could be responsible for this impairment. Our goal was to investigate possible differences in oscillatory activity and synchrony between the DHc and BLA during fear memory reactivation, between MS and non-handled (NH) rats. We used male adult Wistar rats, NH or MS, with electrodes for local field potential (LFP) recordings implanted in the DHc and BLA. Animals were submitted to aversive memory reactivation by exposure to the conditioned context (Reat) or to <i>pseudo</i>-reactivation in a neutral context (pReat), and LFP was recorded. Plasticity markers linked to reconsolidation were evaluated one hour after reactivation. The power of delta oscillations and DHc-BLA synchrony in Reat animals was increased, during freezing. Besides, delta modulation of gamma oscillations amplitude in the BLA was associated with the increase in DHc Zif268 levels, an immediate early gene specifically associated with reconsolidation. Concerning early life stress, we found lower power of delta and strength of delta-gamma oscillations coupling in MS rats, compared to NH, which could explain the low Zif268 levels in a subgroup of MS animals. These results suggest a role for delta oscillations in memory reactivation that should be further investigated.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Systemic metabolic alteration dependent on the thyroid‐liver axis in early PD</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by initial involvement of the olfactory bulb/amygdala or autonomic nerves followed by nigral degeneration. Although autonomic innervation strictly regulates multiorgan systems including endocrine functions, circulation, and digestion, how dysautonomia in PD affects systemic metabolism has not been identified. In this study, we tried to estimate the pathogenic linkage of PD by nuclear medicine techniques, trans-omic analysis of blood samples and cultured cell experiments.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Thyroid mediastinum ratio of MIBG scintigraphy was measured in 1158 PD patients. Furthermore, serum exosome miRNA transcriptome analysis and plasma metabolome analysis followed by trans-omic analysis were performed in <i>de novo</i> PD patients and age-matched healthy control persons. Additionally, thyroid hormone was administered to skeletal muscle and liver derived cells to evaluate the effect of hypothyroidism for these organs.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Sympathetic denervation of thyroid correlating with its cardiac denervation was confirmed in 1158 PD patients by <sup>123</sup>I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy. Among patients with drug-naïve PD, comprehensive metabolome analysis revealed decreased levels of thyroxine and insufficient fatty acid β-oxidation, which positively correlate with one another. Likewise, both plasma metabolome data and transcriptome data of circulating exosomal miRNAs, revealed specific enrichment of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARα) axis. Finally, association of thyroid hormone with PPARα-dependent β-oxidation regulation was confirmed by <i>in vitro</i> experiments.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest that interorgan communications between the thyroid and liver are disorganized in the early stage of PD, which would be a sensitive diagnostic biomarker for PD.</p>

                Canonically, axons are considered the output structures of neurons, relaying signals generated at the dendrites and soma. In this issue of Neuron, Kramer et al. challenge this notion by showing that dopaminergic axons can be depolarized directly by cholinergic interneurons and even generate action potentials independent of somatic activity.

                Nicotine has both rewarding and aversive effects. In this issue of Neuron, Liu et al. show that nicotine aversion depends on both desensitization of high-affinity nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) that activate midbrain dopamine neurons and activation of low-affinity nAChRs that inhibit dopamine neurons via the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT).

Kanamori and Mrsic-Flogel show that despite similar effects on neural responses, spatial attention and running act independently to modulate individual neurons in the primary visual cortex, suggesting separable mechanisms for their implementation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">High order unimodal olfactory sensory preconditioning in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Learning and memory storage is a complex process that has proven challenging to tackle. It is likely that, in nature, the instructive value of reinforcing experiences is acquired rather than innate. The association between seemingly neutral stimuli increases the gamut of possibilities to create meaningful associations and the predictive power of moment-by-moment experiences. Here we report physiological and behavioral evidence of olfactory unimodal sensory preconditioning in fruit flies. We show that the presentation of a pair of odors (S1 and S2) before one of them (S1) is associated with electric shocks elicits a conditional response not only to the trained odor (S1) but to the odor previously paired with it (S2). This occurs even if the S2 odor was never presented in contiguity with the aversive stimulus. In addition, we show that inhibition of the small G protein <i>Rac1</i>, a known forgetting regulator, facilitates the association between S1/S2 odors. These results indicate that flies can infer value to olfactory stimuli based on the previous associative structure between odors, and that inhibition of <i>Rac1</i> lengthens the time window of the olfactory 'sensory buffer', allowing the establishment of associations between odors presented in sequence.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A dopamine-gated learning circuit underpins reproductive state-dependent odor preference in Drosophila females</a></h4>

              
                Motherhood induces a drastic, sometimes long-lasting, change in internal state and behavior in many female animals. How a change in reproductive state or the discrete event of mating modulates specific female behaviors is still incompletely understood. Using calcium imaging of the whole brain of <i>Drosophila</i> females, we find that mating does not induce a global change in brain activity. Instead, mating modulates the pheromone response of dopaminergic neurons innervating the fly's learning and memory center, the mushroom body (MB). Using the mating-induced increased attraction to the odor of important nutrients, polyamines, we show that disruption of the female fly's ability to smell, for instance the pheromone cVA, during mating leads to a reduction in polyamine preference for days later indicating that the odor environment at mating lastingly influences female perception and choice behavior. Moreover, dopaminergic neurons including innervation of the β'1 compartment are sufficient to induce the lasting behavioral increase in polyamine preference. We further show that MB output neurons (MBON) of the β'1 compartment are activated by pheromone odor and their activity during mating bidirectionally modulates preference behavior in mated and virgin females. Their activity is not required, however, for the expression of polyamine attraction. Instead, inhibition of another type of MBON innervating the β'2 compartment enables expression of high odor attraction. In addition, the response of a lateral horn (LH) neuron, AD1b2, which output is required for the expression of polyamine attraction, shows a modulated polyamine response after mating. Taken together, our data in the fly suggests that mating-related sensory experience regulates female odor perception and expression of choice behavior through a dopamine-gated learning circuit.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Contribution of Trp63CreERT2 labeled cells to alveolar regeneration is independent of tuft cells</a></h4>

              
                Viral infection often causes severe damage to the lungs, leading to the appearance of ectopic basal cells (EBCs) and tuft cells in the lung parenchyma. Thus far the roles of these ectopic epithelial cells in alveolar regeneration remain controversial. Here, we confirm that the ectopic tuft cells are originated from EBCs in mouse models and COVID-19 lungs. The differentiation of tuft cells from EBCs is promoted by Wnt inhibition while suppressed by Notch inhibition. Although progenitor functions have been suggested in other organs, pulmonary tuft cells don't proliferate or give rise to other cell lineages. Consistent with previous reports, <i>Trp63<sup>CreERT2</sup></i> and <i>KRT5-CreERT2</i> labeled ectopic EBCs do not exhibit alveolar regeneration potential. Intriguingly, when tamoxifen was administrated post viral infection, <i>Trp63<sup>CreERT2</sup></i> but not <i>KRT5-CreERT2</i> labels islands of alveolar epithelial cells that are negative for EBC biomarkers. Furthermore, germline deletion of <i>Trpm5</i> significantly increases the contribution of <i>Trp63<sup>CreERT2</sup></i> labeled cells to the alveolar epithelium. Although Trpm5 is known to regulate tuft cell development, complete ablation of tuft cell production fails to improve alveolar regeneration in <i>Pou2f3<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, implying that Trpm5 promotes alveolar epithelial regeneration through a mechanism independent of tuft cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Proteogenomic analysis of cancer aneuploidy and normal tissues reveals divergent modes of gene regulation across cellular pathways</a></h4>

              
                How cells control gene expression is a fundamental question. The relative contribution of protein-level and RNA-level regulation to this process remains unclear. Here, we perform a proteogenomic analysis of tumors and untransformed cells containing somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs). By revealing how cells regulate RNA and protein abundances of genes with SCNAs, we provide insights into the rules of gene regulation. Protein complex genes have a strong protein-level regulation while non-complex genes have a strong RNA-level regulation. Notable exceptions are plasma membrane protein complex genes, which show a weak protein-level regulation and a stronger RNA-level regulation. Strikingly, we find a strong negative association between the degree of RNA-level and protein-level regulation across genes and cellular pathways. Moreover, genes participating in the same pathway show a similar degree of RNA- and protein-level regulation. Pathways including translation, splicing, RNA processing, and mitochondrial function show a stronger protein-level regulation while cell adhesion and migration pathways show a stronger RNA-level regulation. These results suggest that the evolution of gene regulation is shaped by functional constraints and that many cellular pathways tend to evolve one predominant mechanism of gene regulation at the protein level or at the RNA level.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptic scale dopamine disruption in Huntington's Disease model mice imaged with near infrared catecholamine nanosensors</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine neuromodulation is a critical process that facilitates learning, motivation, and motor control. Disruption of these processes has been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders including Huntington's Disease (HD). While several treatments for physical and psychiatric HD symptoms target dopaminergic neuromodulation, the mechanism by which dopaminergic dysfunction occurs during HD is unknown. This is partly due to limited capability to visualize dopamine dynamics at the spatiotemporal resolution of both neuromodulator release (ms) and dopaminergic boutons (m). Here we employ near-infrared fluorescent catecholamine nanosensors (nIRCats) to image dopamine release within the brain striatum of R6/2 Huntington's Disease Model (R6/2) mice. We find that stimulated dorsal striatal dopamine release decreases with progressive motor degeneration and that these decreases are primarily driven by a decrease in the number of dopamine hotspots combined with decreased release intensity and decreased release fidelity. Using nIRCat's high spatial resolution, we show that dopamine hotspots in late HD show increased ability to add new dopamine hotspots at high extracellular calcium concentrations and track individual dopamine hotspots over repeated stimulations and pharmacological wash to measure dopamine hotspots release fidelity. Compellingly, we demonstrate that antagonism of D2-autoreceptors using Sulpiride and direct blocking of Kv1.2 channels using 4-Aminopyradine (4-AP) increases the fidelity of dopamine hotspot activity in WT striatum but not in late HD striatum, indicating that D2-autoreceptor regulation of dopamine release through Kv1.2 channels is compromised in late HD. These findings, enabled by nIRCats, provide a more detailed look into how dopamine release is disrupted and dysregulated during Huntington's Disease to alter the coverage of dopamine modulation across the dorsal striatum.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">DEED: A Dataset for Dream-related Emotion Research</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Emotion is closely related to human cognition and behaviour. In recent years, scholars have conducted extensive research on emotion in waking state based on electroencephalography (EEG) and achieved certain results. However, Emotional activity continues after sleep, with a concentrated response of sleep emotions in dreams. Sleep emotions are concentrated in dreams, which can better reflect a series of real physical and psychological states of the human body. Currently, there is no publicly available dataset for the assessment of dream mood. Therefore, we present a physiological dataset Dream Emotion Evaluation Dataset (DEED) for the assessment of dream mood, which recorded EEG signals from 38 participants over 89 whole sleep nights and 533 dream segments(after exclusion of unqualified nights, those dream segments are extracted from 82 whole sleep nights). We studied the correlations between the subjective ratings and the EEG signals and brain network patterns for dream emotions. In addition, the relationship between the asymmetry of left and right brain bands and positive and negative dream emotions was studied. The machine learning algorithm was also used to classify different emotional EEG, which confirmed the validity of the dataset. In the meantime, we encourage other researchers to explore the underlying neural mechanisms involved in sleep.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Posterior white matter hyperintensities are associated with reduced medial temporal lobe subregional integrity and long-term memory in older adults</a></h4>

              
                White matter hyperintensities are a marker of small vessel cerebrovascular disease that are strongly related to cognition in older adults. Similarly, medial temporal lobe atrophy is well-documented in aging and Alzheimer's disease and is associated with memory decline. Here, we assessed the relationship between lobar white matter hyperintensities, medial temporal lobe subregional volumes, and hippocampal memory in older adults. We collected MRI scans in a sample of 139 older adults without dementia (88 females, mean age (SD) = 76.95 (10.61)). Participants were administered the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). Regression analyses tested for associations among medial temporal lobe subregional volumes, regional white matter hyperintensities and memory, while adjusting for age, sex, and education and correcting for multiple comparisons. Increased occipital white matter hyperintensities were related to worse RAVLT delayed recall performance, and to reduced CA1, dentate gyrus, perirhinal cortex (Brodmann area 36), and parahippocampal cortex volumes. These medial temporal lobe subregional volumes were related to delayed recall performance. The association of occipital white matter hyperintensities with delayed recall performance was fully mediated statistically only by perirhinal cortex volume. These results suggest that white matter hyperintensities may be associated with memory decline through their impact on medial temporal lobe atrophy. These findings provide new insights into the role of vascular pathologies in memory loss in older adults and suggest that future studies should further examine the neural mechanisms of these relationships in longitudinal samples.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Closed-loop spinal cord stimulation is superior in restoring locomotion in rodent models of Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Dorsal column stimulation (DCS) of the spinal cord is emerging as a promising new technology for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effect on PD symptoms are not fully understood. Here we demonstrate a closed-loop DCS (CLDCS) paradigm - a substantial advancement from previously tested continuous high-frequency DCS - in a bilateral intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-ohda) rodent model of PD. Firstly, CLDCS performed significantly better than continuous open-loop DCS in ameliorating motor symptoms of PD. Secondly, the application of CLDCS triggered by corticostriatal beta frequency oscillations created a pro-locomotion brain state that reduced akinesia. Finally, CLDCS was better at disrupting beta oscillations in the corticostriatal areas and achieved it with lesser overall charge delivery than continuous open-loop stimulation. These results indicate that CLDCS is remarkably better than traditional spinal cord stimulation methods and has the potential to be highly effective in treating PD symptoms. We envision that the CLDCS approach can be beneficial in the treatment of other neurological disorders which showcase similar pathological neuronal oscillations.

	<p>We addressed both brain pre-surgical functional and neurophysiological aspects of the hand representation in 18 right-handed patients harboring a highly malignant brain tumor in the sensorimotor (SM) cortex (10 in the left hemisphere, LH, and 8 in the right hemisphere, RH) and 10 healthy controls, who performed an fMRI hand-clenching task with both hands alternatively. We extracted the main ROI in the SM cortex and compared ROI values and volumes between hemispheres and groups, in addition to their motor neurophysiological measures. Hemispheric asymmetry in the fMRI signal was observed for healthy controls, namely higher signal for the left-hand movements, but not for either patients&amp;amp;rsquo; groups. ROI values, although altered in patients vs. controls, did not differ significantly between groups. ROI volumes associated with right-hand movement were lower for both patients&amp;amp;rsquo; groups vs. controls, and those associated with left-hand movement were lower in the RH group vs. all groups. These results are relevant to interpret potential preoperative plasticity and make inferences about postoperative plasticity and can be integrated in the surgical planning to increase surgery success and postoperative prognosis and quality of life.</p>

	<p>Despite the relative scarcity of studies focusing on pharmacotherapy in aphasia, there is evidence in the literature indicating that remediation of language disorders via pharmaceutical agents could be a promising aphasia treatment option. Among the various agents used to treat chronic aphasic deficits, cholinergic drugs have provided meaningful results. In the current review, we focused on published reports investigating the impact of acetylcholine on language and other cognitive disturbances. It has been suggested that acetylcholine plays an important role in neuroplasticity and is related to several aspects of cognition, such as memory and attention. Moreover, cholinergic input is diffused to a wide network of cortical areas, which have been associated with language sub-processes. This could be a possible explanation for the positive reported outcomes of cholinergic drugs in aphasia recovery, and specifically in distinct language processes, such as naming and comprehension, as well as overall communication competence. However, evidence with regard to functional alterations in specific brain areas after pharmacotherapy is rather limited. Finally, despite the positive results derived from the relevant studies, cholinergic pharmacotherapy treatment in post-stroke aphasia has not been widely implemented. The present review aims to provide an overview of the existing literature in the common neuroanatomical substrate of cholinergic pathways and language related brain areas as a framework for interpreting the efficacy of cholinergic pharmacotherapy interventions in post-stroke aphasia, following an integrated approach by converging evidence from neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and neuropsychology.</p>

	<p>Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia worldwide. Emerging non-invasive treatments such as photobiomodulation target the mitochondria to minimize brain damage, improving cognitive functions. In this work, an experimental design was carried out to evaluate the effect of transcranial light therapy (TLTC) on synaptic plasticity (SP) and cognitive functions in an AD animal model. Twenty-three mice were separated into two general groups: an APP/PS1 (ALZ) transgenic group and a wild-type (WT) group. Each group was randomly subdivided into two subgroups: mice with and without TLTC, depending on whether they would undergo treatment with TLTC. Cognitive function, measured through an object recognition task, showed non-significant improvement after TLTC. SP, on the other hand, was evaluated using four electrophysiological parameters from the Schaffer-CA1 collateral hippocampal synapses: excitatory field potentials (fEPSP), paired pulse facilitation (PPF), long-term depression (LTD), and long-term potentiation (LTP). An improvement was observed in subjects treated with TLTC, showing higher levels of LTP than those transgenic mice that were not exposed to the treatment. Therefore, the results obtained in this work showed that TLTC could be an efficient non-invasive treatment for AD-associated SP deficits.</p>

	<p>Background: Facial paralysis (FP) is a common symptom after stroke, which influences the quality of life and prognosis of patients. Recently, peripheral magnetic stimulation (PMS) shows potential effects on peripheral and central nervous system damage. However, the effect of PMS on FP after stroke is still unclear. Methods: In this study, we applied PMS on the facial nerve of nine stroke patients with FP. At the same time, laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) was used to explore the facial skin blood flow (SkBF) in 19 healthy subjects and nine stroke patients with FP before and after the PMS intervention. The whole face was divided into 14 regions to compare the SkBF in different sub-areas. Results: In baseline SkBF, we found that there were no significant differences in the SkBF between the left and right faces in the healthy subjects. However, there was a significant difference in the SkBF between the affected and unaffected faces in Region 7 (Chin area, p = 0.046). In the following five minutes after the PMS intervention (Pre_0&amp;amp;ndash;5 min), the SkBF increased in Region 5 (p = 0.014) and Region 7 (p = 0.046) and there was an increasing trend in Region 3 (p = 0.088) and Region 6 (p = 0.069). In the five to ten minutes after the intervention (Post_6&amp;amp;ndash;10 min), the SkBF increased in Region 5 (p = 0.009), Region 6 (p = 0.021) and Region 7 (p = 0.023) and there was an increasing trend in Region 3 (p = 0.080) and left and right whole face (p = 0.051). Conclusions: These pilot results indicate that PMS intervention could increase facial skin blood flow in stroke patients with FP. A further randomized controlled trial can be performed to explore its possible clinical efficacy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Genetic and environmental perturbations alter the rhythmic expression pattern of a circadian long non-coding RNA, Per2AS, in mouse liver [version 1; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a wide variety of biological roles without encoding a protein. Although the functions of many lncRNAs have been uncovered in recent years, the regulatory mechanism of lncRNA expression is still poorly understood despite that the expression patterns of lncRNAs are much more specific compared to mRNAs. Here, we investigated the rhythmic expression of Per2AS, a novel lncRNA that regulates circadian rhythms. Given that Per2AS expression is antiphasic to Period2 (Per2), a core circadian clock gene, and transcribed from the antisense strand of Per2, we hypothesized that the rhythmic Per2AS expression is driven either by its own promoter or by the rhythmic Per2 transcription via transcriptional interference. Methods: We leveraged existing circadian RNA-seq datasets and analyzed the expression patterns of Per2AS and Per2 in response to the genetic or environmental disruption of the circadian rhythm in mouse liver. We tested our hypotheses by comparing the changes in the expression patterns of Per2AS and Per2. Conclusions: We found that, in some cases, Per2AS expression is independently controlled by other circadian transcription factors. In other cases, the pattern of expression change is consistent with both transcriptional interference and independent regulation hypotheses. Although additional experiments will be necessary to distinguish these possibilities, findings from this work contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanism of how the expression of lncRNA is regulated.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The circadian clock mediates the response to oxidative stress in a cone photoreceptor‒like (661W) cell line via regulation of glutathione peroxidase activity [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The mammalian retina contains an autonomous circadian clock that controls many physiological functions within this tissue. Our previous studies have indicated that disruption of this circadian clock by removing Bmal1 from the retina affects the visual function, retinal circuitry, and cone photoreceptor viability during aging. In the present study, we employed a mouse-derived cone photoreceptor‒like cell, 661W, to investigate which molecular mechanisms of the circadian clock may modulate cone photoreceptor viability during aging. Methods: Bmal1 knockout (BKO) cells were generated from 661W cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tool. Deletion of Bmal1 from 661W was verified by western blot and monitoring Per2-luc bioluminescence circadian rhythms. To investigate the effect of Bmal1 removal on an oxidative stress challenge, cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2,1 mM) for two hours and then cell viability was assessed. Cells were also cultured and harvested for gene expression analysis and antioxidant assay. Results: Our data indicated that 661W cells contain a functional circadian clock that mediates the response to an oxidative stress challenge in vitro and that such a response is no longer present in the BKO cell. We also hypothesized that the effect was due to the circadian regulation of the intracellular antioxidant defense mechanism. Our results indicated that in 661W cells, the antioxidant defense mechanism is under circadian control, whereas in BKO cells, there is an overall reduction in this antioxidant defense mechanism, and it is no longer under circadian control. Conclusions: Our work supported the notion that the presence of a functional circadian clock and its ability to modulate the response to an oxidative stress is the underlying mechanism that may protect cones during aging.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Understanding the funding characteristics of research impact: A proof-of-concept study linking REF 2014 impact case studies with Researchfish grant agreements [version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: All parts of the research community have an interest in understanding research impact whether that is around the pathways to impact, processes around impact, methods for measurement, describing impact and so on. This proof of concept study explored the relationship between research funding and research impact using the case studies submitted to the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) exercise in 2014 as a proxy for impact. Methods: The paper describes an approach to link the REF impact case studies with the underpinning research grants present in the Researchfish dataset, primarily using the publications captured in both datasets. Where possible the methodology utilised unique identifiers such as Digital Object Identifiers and PubMed ID’s, and where this was not possible the funding information within each publication was used. Results: Through this automated approach 21% of the non-redacted case studies could be linked to a specific research grant. Additional qualitative analysis was then done for unlinked REF impact case studies, which involved reading the document to identify additional information to make the linkage. This approach was taken on 100 REF impact case studies selected at random and resulted in only seven having no identifiable research grants funding associated. The linked research grants were analysed to identify characteristics that are more frequently associated with these grants, than non-linked ones. Conclusions: This analysis did point to some interesting observations such as the grant funding linked to REF impact case studies are more likely to be longer, higher financial value, have more publications and be more collaborative (amongst other characteristics). These findings should be used with caution at present and not be over interpreted, this is due to the sample size for this proof of concept study and some potential limitations on the data which were not addressed at this stage.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Dentists’ perceptions on present and future dental practice during the COVID-19 pandemic: An embedded study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has placed a significant burden on everyone. Although dental professionals are at an increased risk of COVID-19 infection, currently, very little is known about how oral health professionals and their professions could be affected by the pandemic. This study aims to investigate dentists' perceptions on present and future dental practice in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Methods: We conducted an embedded mixed-methods study at Manipal College of Dental Sciences, Mangalore, with Indian dentists registered with the Dental Council of India.   Results: Of the 976 participating dentists, 61% were females, 32% were 40 years of age or younger. Nearly half of the respondents (54%) acknowledged that the lockdown measures caused them a severe financial burden, and 56% were seriously concerned about being a source of infection to their family, friends, and community. Although 79% felt very comfortable or somewhat comfortable going back to work, they were all worried that Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) use would increase their financial burden and impact the number of patients seeking care. Even though a vast majority received the necessary information regarding returning to practice from their concerned dental regulatory bodies, some were unsure about the reuse of the PPEs because of the conflicting information they received.  Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic affected participants' professional lives negatively. Their major concerns were being a source of infection to their families and community. Providing information to dental professionals in a timely manner may prepare dentists to provide safe care to their patients while protecting themselves, their staff, and their families.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Informative prior on structural equation modelling with non-homogenous error structure [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: This study investigates the impact of informative prior on Bayesian structural equation model (BSEM) with heteroscedastic error structure. A major drawback of homogeneous error structure is that, in most studies the underlying assumption of equal variance across observation is often unrealistic, hence the need to consider the non-homogenous error structure. Methods: Updating appropriate informative prior, four different forms of heteroscedastic error structures were considered at sample sizes 50, 100, 200 and 500. Results: The results show that both posterior predictive probability (PPP) and log likelihood are influenced by the sample size and the prior information, hence the model with the linear form of error structure is the best. Conclusions: The study has been able to address sufficiently the problem of heteroscedasticity of known form using four different heteroscedastic conditions, the linear form outperformed other forms of heteroscedastic error structure thus can accommodate any form of data that violates the homogenous variance assumption by updating appropriate informative prior. Thus, this approach provides an alternative approach to the existing classical method which depends solely on the sample information.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Nicotine products relative risk assessment: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The nicotine products relative risk assessment estimates the relative risk of tobacco-related diseases due to use of 15 nicotine products. This update adds new data to the original analysis and creates separate categories for United States and rest of world varieties of smokeless tobacco, as well as bidi cigarettes. Methods: The PubMed®, MEDLINE and Clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched systematically. The study lists were exported, screened at the title, abstract and full-text level according to pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria. The study quality was assessed, and risk of bias was accounted for in the screening criteria. The extracted data was synthesized into a toxin emissions/content analysis for 12 Group 1 carcinogens, used to estimate lifetime cancer risk, and epidemiological meta-analysis of over 40 tobacco-related diseases. The two analyses were integrated into a combined risk score for each nicotine product, weighted by the risk of bias due to missing data, and incorporated into the relative risk spectrum. Results: In this update, 70 new studies were added to the synthesis, making a total of 123 studies included. All combustible tobacco products score between 40 and 100, with bidis and smokeless (rest of world) also in this range. All other products have a combined risk score of 10 or less, including U.S. chewing tobacco, U.S. dipping tobacco, snus, heat-not-burn tobacco, electronic cigarettes, non-tobacco pouches and nicotine replacement therapy. Discussion: Consistent with previous studies, we define a group of high-risk nicotine products, scoring between 40 and 100 on the spectrum, and reduced risk nicotine products, scoring less than 10. Limitations of this study include the potential for bias due to missing data, the heterogeneity of the data included in the relative risk hierarchy synthesis, and the assumed consumption levels.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Anti-inflammatory activity and toxicity evaluation of 1,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)urea [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Inflammation is a normal protective response caused by tissue damage through physical trauma, chemical damage, or invasion of pathogenic microorganisms. 1,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)urea is a modified p-aminophenol compound, which is considered to have strong analgesic activity based on cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition and has fewer hepatotoxic side effects. In-silico test showed 1,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)urea has COX-1 and TNF- binding activity, so it has the potential to be developed as an anti-inflammatory agent. Anti-inflammatory activity was tested using mice. Toxicity test was conducted to test the safety of 1,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)urea. Methods: Anti-inflammatory test was carried out by measuring the percentage of inflammation in rat paws using a plethysmometer after administration of 1,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)urea induced by carrageenan 1%, and then histology was performed to observe the number of neutrophils. A toxicity test using OECD guidelines carried out acute toxicity for 24 hours and was observed for 14 days. The subchronic toxicity test was carried out for 28 days, followed by 42 days in the satellite group. Results: Analysis of rat paw inflammation volume showed 1,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)urea could suppress inflammation after carrageenan-1% induction. The group given {1.3 bis (p-Hydroxyphenyl)urea} and sodium diclofenac 2.25 mg/kg BW had a significant difference in results (p<0.05) with 0.5% Na CMC group. Doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg BW showed no significant difference (p>0.05) with diclofenac sodium. The number of neutrophils also decreased compared to the 0.5% Na CMC group. The acute toxicity test of 1,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)urea did not cause toxic symptoms and death up to a dose of 5000 mg/kg BW. The microscopic results of subchronic toxicity of liver tissue experienced hydropic degeneration at a dose of 1000 mg/kg BW; in the lungs causes congestion, and microscopic renal tissue undergoes Bowman space dilatation and tubular lumen dilatation, but this condition is reversible. Conclusion: This 1,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)urea compound had an anti-inflammatory activity and relatively low toxicity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">AIRRscape: An interactive tool for exploring B-cell receptor repertoires and antibody responses</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eric Waltari, Saba Nafees, Krista M. McCutcheon, Joan Wong, John E. Pak</p>

The sequencing of antibody repertoires of B-cells at increasing coverage and depth has led to the identification of vast numbers of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. However, the size and complexity of these Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) datasets makes it difficult to perform exploratory analyses. To aid in data exploration, we have developed AIRRscape, an R Shiny-based interactive web browser application that enables B-cell receptor (BCR) and antibody feature discovery through comparisons among multiple repertoires. Using AIRR-seq data as input, AIRRscape starts by aggregating and sorting repertoires into interactive and explorable bins of germline V-gene, germline J-gene, and CDR3 length, providing a high-level view of the entire repertoire. Interesting subsets of repertoires can be quickly identified and selected, and then network topologies of CDR3 motifs can be generated for further exploration. Here we demonstrate AIRRscape using patient BCR repertoires and sequences of published monoclonal antibodies to investigate patterns of humoral immunity to three viral pathogens: SARS-CoV-2, HIV-1, and DENV (dengue virus). AIRRscape reveals convergent antibody sequences among datasets for all three pathogens, although HIV-1 antibody datasets display limited convergence and idiosyncratic responses. We have made AIRRscape available as a web-based Shiny application, along with code on GitHub to encourage its open development and use by immuno-informaticians, virologists, immunologists, vaccine developers, and other scientists that are interested in exploring and comparing multiple immune receptor repertoires.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">An in-silico analysis of experimental designs to study ventricular function: A focus on the right ventricle</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mitchel J. Colebank, Naomi C. Chesler</p>

<i>In-vivo</i> studies of pulmonary vascular disease and pulmonary hypertension (PH) have provided key insight into the progression of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. Additional <i>in-silico</i> experiments using multiscale computational models have provided further details into biventricular mechanics and hemodynamic function in the presence of PH, yet few have assessed whether model parameters are practically identifiable prior to data collection. Moreover, none have used modeling to devise synergistic experimental designs. To address this knowledge gap, we conduct a practical identifiability analysis of a multiscale cardiovascular model across four simulated experimental designs. We determine a set of parameters using a combination of Morris screening and local sensitivity analysis, and test for practical identifiability using profile likelihood-based confidence intervals. We employ Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to quantify parameter and model forecast uncertainty in the presence of noise corrupted data. Our results show that model calibration to only RV pressure suffers from practical identifiability issues and suffers from large forecast uncertainty in output space. In contrast, parameter and model forecast uncertainty is substantially reduced once additional left ventricular (LV) pressure and volume data is included. A comparison between single point systolic and diastolic LV data and continuous, time-dependent LV pressure-volume data reveals that any information from the LV substantially reduces parameter and forecast uncertainty, encouraging at least some quantitative data from both ventricles for future experimental studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Forebrain nuclei linked to woodpecker territorial drum displays mirror those that enable vocal learning in songbirds</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eric R. Schuppe, Lindsey Cantin, Mukta Chakraborty, Matthew T. Biegler, Electra R. Jarvis, Chun-Chun Chen, Erina Hara, Mads F. Bertelsen, Christopher C. Witt, Erich D. Jarvis, Matthew J. Fuxjager</p>

Vocal learning is thought to have evolved in 3 orders of birds (songbirds, parrots, and hummingbirds), with each showing similar brain regions that have comparable gene expression specializations relative to the surrounding forebrain motor circuitry. Here, we searched for signatures of these same gene expression specializations in previously uncharacterized brains of 7 assumed vocal non-learning bird lineages across the early branches of the avian family tree. Our findings using a conserved marker for the song system found little evidence of specializations in these taxa, except for woodpeckers. Instead, woodpeckers possessed forebrain regions that were anatomically similar to the pallial song nuclei of vocal learning birds. Field studies of free-living downy woodpeckers revealed that these brain nuclei showed increased expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) when males produce their iconic drum displays, the elaborate bill-hammering behavior that individuals use to compete for territories, much like birdsong. However, these specialized areas did not show increased IEG expression with vocalization or flight. We further confirmed that other woodpecker species contain these brain nuclei, suggesting that these brain regions are a common feature of the woodpecker brain. We therefore hypothesize that ancient forebrain nuclei for refined motor control may have given rise to not only the song control systems of vocal learning birds, but also the drumming system of woodpeckers.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Metabolic reconstitution of germ-free mice by a gnotobiotic microbiota varies over the circadian cycle</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel Hoces, Jiayi Lan, Wenfei Sun, Tobias Geiser, Melanie L. Stäubli, Elisa Cappio Barazzone, Markus Arnoldini, Tenagne D. Challa, Manuel Klug, Alexandra Kellenberger, Sven Nowok, Erica Faccin, Andrew J. Macpherson, Bärbel Stecher, Shinichi Sunagawa, Renato Zenobi, Wolf-Dietrich Hardt, Christian Wolfrum, Emma Slack</p>

The capacity of the intestinal microbiota to degrade otherwise indigestible diet components is known to greatly improve the recovery of energy from food. This has led to the hypothesis that increased digestive efficiency may underlie the contribution of the microbiota to obesity. OligoMM12-colonized gnotobiotic mice have a consistently higher fat mass than germ-free (GF) or fully colonized counterparts. We therefore investigated their food intake, digestion efficiency, energy expenditure, and respiratory quotient using a novel isolator-housed metabolic cage system, which allows long-term measurements without contamination risk. This demonstrated that microbiota-released calories are perfectly balanced by decreased food intake in fully colonized versus gnotobiotic OligoMM12 and GF mice fed a standard chow diet, i.e., microbiota-released calories can in fact be well integrated into appetite control. We also observed no significant difference in energy expenditure after normalization by lean mass between the different microbiota groups, suggesting that cumulative small differences in energy balance, or altered energy storage, must underlie fat accumulation in OligoMM12 mice. Consistent with altered energy storage, major differences were observed in the type of respiratory substrates used in metabolism over the circadian cycle: In GF mice, the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was consistently lower than that of fully colonized mice at all times of day, indicative of more reliance on fat and less on glucose metabolism. Intriguingly, the RER of OligoMM12-colonized gnotobiotic mice phenocopied fully colonized mice during the dark (active/eating) phase but phenocopied GF mice during the light (fasting/resting) phase. Further, OligoMM12-colonized mice showed a GF-like drop in liver glycogen storage during the light phase and both liver and plasma metabolomes of OligoMM12 mice clustered closely with GF mice. This implies the existence of microbiota functions that are required to maintain normal host metabolism during the resting/fasting phase of circadian cycle and which are absent in the OligoMM12 consortium.

                <p>by Franziska Müller, Francesco De Virgiliis, Guiping Kong, Luming Zhou, Elisabeth Serger, Jessica Chadwick, Alexandros Sanchez-Vassopoulos, Akash Kumar Singh, Muthusamy Eswaramoorthy, Tapas K. Kundu, Simone Di Giovanni</p>

The interruption of spinal circuitry following spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts neural activity and is followed by a failure to mount an effective regenerative response resulting in permanent neurological disability. Functional recovery requires the enhancement of axonal and synaptic plasticity of spared as well as injured fibres, which need to sprout and/or regenerate to form new connections. Here, we have investigated whether the epigenetic stimulation of the regenerative gene expression program can overcome the current inability to promote neurological recovery in chronic SCI with severe disability. We delivered the CBP/p300 activator CSP-TTK21 or vehicle CSP weekly between week 12 and 22 following a transection model of SCI in mice housed in an enriched environment. Data analysis showed that CSP-TTK21 enhanced classical regenerative signalling in dorsal root ganglia sensory but not cortical motor neurons, stimulated motor and sensory axon growth, sprouting, and synaptic plasticity, but failed to promote neurological sensorimotor recovery. This work provides direct evidence that clinically suitable pharmacological CBP/p300 activation can promote the expression of regeneration-associated genes and axonal growth in a chronic SCI with severe neurological disability.

                Background: Biochemical and biophysical factors jointly regulate the cellular dynamics in many physiological processes. It is therefore imperative to include multiplexed microenvironment cues when employing in vitro cell-based assays to model physiological processes. Methods: To meet this need, we have developed a modular platform of 3D cell culture, Modular Control of Microenvironment for Cell Migration and Culture Assay (MC3A), that incorporates directed chemical and mechanical cues in the forms of chemotaxis and contact guidance, respectively. Taking advantage of the functionalities of MC3A, we study the migration and morphology of breast cancer cells in 3D engineered extracellular matrix (ECM) following a serum gradient for chemotaxis. Results: We show that when chemotaxis is facilitated by contact guidance in the same direction as the serum gradient, cells demonstrate dimensional-reduction in their motility and highly elongated ellipsoidal shape. When the direction of ECM alignment diverges from the direction of serum gradient, chemotactic motion is significantly suppressed, and cells are generally more protrusive and rounded in their morphology. Conclusions: These examples demonstrate MC3A as a powerful tool for engineering complex microenvironments of cells that will advance the state-of-the-art of cell-based analysis in drug development, regenerative medicine, and other research areas in bioengineering.

                Background: In language learning, reading is a skill that enables interaction with a text in whatever field of knowledge the learner is pursuing. Readers tend to use strategies such as comprehension, interpretation and conception of decoding written language and texts to enhance their reading capacity. This research explores the reading strategies applied by Saudi English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners and compares the reading abilities of male and female EFL students. Methods: The study interviewed three EFL students about the reading strategies they applied while reading passages and texts. Then an International English Language Testing System (IELTS) reading test was handed over to 26 randomly selected students. Results: The study found that the reading strategies used by the students interviewed involved skimming, scanning, guessing the meaning from context, identifying the mean idea, and summarizing the body of the text in question. Moreover, the study revealed that both male and female students scored low in the IELTS tests that the researchers conducted. The average mean score they reached was 7.15 out of 20. However, even in the low scoring ratio, female students (M=7.69) outperformed male students (M= 6.62) and the difference between them remained significant, P=.000. Conclusions: The study recommends that the language instructors help EFL learners in developing their reading strategies and applying them every time they read any text.

                Background: Staphylococcus aureus is commonly found in dairy cows and is a source of contamination in milk. S. aureus that are resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics (especially cefoxitin) are referred to as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The spread of MRSA cannot be separated from sanitation management during milking; it can originate from milk collected from the udder or from the hands of farmers during the milking process. The purpose of this study was to examine the level of MRSA contamination in dairy cow's milk and farmer's hand. Methods: A total of 109 samples of dairy cow’s milk and 41 samples of farmer’s hand swabs were collected at a dairy farm in Probolinggo, East Java, Indonesia. Samples were cultured and purified using mannitol salt agar (MSA). The profile of S. aureus resistance was established by disk diffusion test using a disk of beta-lactam antibiotics, namely oxacillin and cefoxitin. Results: The S. aureus isolates that were resistant to oxacillin and cefoxitin antibiotics were then tested for oxacillin resistance screening agar base (ORSAB) as a confirmation test for MRSA identity. S. aureus isolates suspected to be MRSA were then tested genotypically by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to detect the presence of the mecA gene. The results of the isolation and identification found 80 isolates (53.33%) of S. aureus. The results of the resistance test found that 42 isolates (15%) of S. aureus were resistant to oxacillin and 10 isolates (12.5%) were resistant to cefoxitin. The ORSAB test found as many as 20 isolates (47.62%) were positive for MRSA. In PCR testing to detect the presence of the mecA gene, three isolates (30%) were positive for the mecA gene. Conclusions: This study shows that several S. aureus isolates were MRSA and had the gene encoding mecA in dairy farms.

                Background: Knowing the needs of the bioimaging community with respect to research data management (RDM) is essential for identifying measures that enable adoption of the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for microscopy and bioimage analysis data across disciplines. As an initiative within Germany's National Research Data Infrastructure, we conducted this community survey in summer 2021 to assess the state of the art of bioimaging RDM and the community needs. Methods: An online survey was conducted with a mixed question-type design. We created a questionnaire tailored to relevant topics of the bioimaging community, including specific questions on bioimaging methods and bioimage analysis, as well as more general questions on RDM principles and tools. 203 survey entries were included in the analysis covering the perspectives from various life and biomedical science disciplines and from participants at different career levels. Results: The results highlight the importance and value of bioimaging RDM and data sharing. However, the practical implementation of FAIR practices is impeded by technical hurdles, lack of knowledge, and insecurity about the legal aspects of data sharing. The survey participants request metadata guidelines and annotation tools and endorse the usage of image data management platforms. At present, OMERO (Open Microscopy Environment Remote Objects) is the best known and most widely used platform. Most respondents rely on image processing and analysis, which they regard as the most time-consuming step of the bioimage data workflow. While knowledge about and implementation of electronic lab notebooks and data management plans is limited, respondents acknowledge their potential value for data handling and publication. Conclusion: The bioimaging community acknowledges and endorses the value of RDM and data sharing. Still, there is a need for information, guidance, and standardization to foster the adoption of FAIR data handling. This survey may help inspiring targeted measures to close this gap.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess whether post-stroke epilepsy (PSE) is associated with neuroimaging findings of hemosiderin in a case–control study, and whether the addition of hemosiderin markers improves the risk stratification models of PSE.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a post-hoc analysis of the PROgnosis of POST-Stroke Epilepsy study enrolling PSE patients at National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center, Osaka, Japan, from November 2014 to September 2019. PSE was diagnosed when one unprovoked seizure was experienced &gt;7 days after the index stroke, as proposed by the International League Against Epilepsy. As controls, consecutive acute stroke patients with no history or absence of any late seizure or continuing antiseizure medications at least 3 months after stroke were retrospectively enrolled during the same study period. We examined cortical microbleeds and cortical superficial siderosis (cSS) using gradient-echo T2*-weighted images. A logistic regression model with ridge penalties was tuned using 10-fold cross-validation. We added the item of cSS to the existing models (SeLECT and CAVE) for predicting PSE and evaluated performance of new models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The study included 180 patients with PSE (67 women; median age 74 years) and 1,183 controls (440 women; median age 74 years). The cSS frequency was higher in PSE than control groups (48.9% vs 5.7%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Compared with the existing models, the new models with cSS (SeLECT-S and CAVE-S) demonstrated significantly better predictive performance of PSE (net reclassification improvement 0.63 [<i>p</i> = 0.004] for SeLECT-S and 0.88 [<i>p</i> = 0.001] for CAVE-S at the testing data).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Cortical superficial siderosis was associated with PSE, stratifying stroke survivors at high risk of PSE. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to identify subtypes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) by comparing patterns of neurodegeneration using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and explore their phenotypes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging in 488 clinically well-characterized patients with ALS and 338 control subjects. Measurements of whole-brain cortical thickness and white matter connectome fractional anisotropy were adjusted for disease-unrelated variation. A probabilistic network-based clustering algorithm was used to divide patients into subgroups of similar neurodegeneration patterns. Clinical characteristics and cognitive profiles were assessed for each subgroup. In total, 512 follow-up scans were used to validate clustering results longitudinally.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The clustering algorithm divided patients with ALS into 3 subgroups of 187, 163, and 138 patients. All subgroups displayed involvement of the precentral gyrus and are characterized, respectively, by (1) pure motor involvement (pure motor cluster [PM]), (2) orbitofrontal and temporal involvement (frontotemporal cluster [FT]), and (3) involvement of the posterior cingulate cortex, parietal white matter, temporal operculum, and cerebellum (cingulate-parietal–temporal cluster [CPT]). These subgroups had significantly distinct clinical profiles regarding male-to-female ratio, age at symptom onset, and frequency of bulbar symptom onset. FT and CPT revealed higher rates of cognitive impairment on the Edinburgh cognitive and behavioral ALS screen (ECAS). Longitudinally, clustering remained stable: at 90.4% of their follow-up visits, patients clustered in the same subgroup as their baseline visit.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>ALS can manifest itself in 3 main patterns of cerebral neurodegeneration, each associated with distinct clinical characteristics and cognitive profiles. Besides the pure motor and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)-like variants of ALS, a new neuroimaging phenotype has emerged, characterized by posterior cingulate, parietal, temporal, and cerebellar involvement.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The simplicity of XGBoost algorithm versus the complexity of Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Networks algorithms in urban forest classification [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The availability of urban forest is under serious threat, especially in developing countries where urbanization is taking place rapidly. Meanwhile, there are many classifier algorithms available to monitor the extent of the urban forest. However, we need to assess the performance of each classifier to understand its complexity and accuracy. Methods: This study proposes a novel procedure using R language with RStudio software to assess four different classifiers based on different numbers of training datasets to classify the urban forest within the campus environment. The normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) were then employed to compare the accuracy of each classifier. Results: This study found that the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier outperformed the other three classifiers, with an RMSE value of 1.56. While the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were in second, third, and fourth place with RMSE values of 4.33, 6.81, and 7.45 respectively. Conclusions: The XGBoost algorithm is the most suitable for urban forest classification with limited data training. This study is easy to reproduce since the code is available and open to the public.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Biopsychosocial factors associated with depression in the elderly: A systematic literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: One of the most common mental illnesses worldwide and that has significant negative effects on well-being and physical health, is depression. Many factors that affect the occurrence of depression are biopsychosocial. Elderly people have high risk factors for depression. This study aims to review and find a gap in current evidence of biopsychosocial factors affecting depression in the elderly. Methods: We conducted an advanced search on PubMed database between October and November 2021. We screened the bibliographies of the articles from the database search using a set of inclusion criteria: studies with quantitative design; elderly population sample; exploration of at least one biopsychosocial factor; depression as the outcome or dependent variable; written in English; and published between 2011 and 2021. Results: We found 54 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, five papers discussed biopsychosocial factors, 18 discussed biological and psychological/social factors, five discussed psychosocial factors, and the rest of the studies discussed one component of biopsychosocial factors. Biological factors influencing elderly depression include being female, having health problems or low health status, older age, genetics, brain structure, and biomarkers, taking certain drugs, and lack of or inability to carry out daily activities. Psychosocial factors include lack of social support, low education level, financial problems, single/unmarried, lack of contact with family/friends, living alone, low self-perceived health, stressful life events, loneliness, and losing hobbies. From the literature search, it was also found that there are biopsychosocial factors that have not been studied and are expected to be able to make references for future research. From this literature review, we found gaps in the availability of evidence about biopsychosocial factors that require further research. Conclusions: Knowing the biopsychosocial factors that affect them can help to prevent depression in the elderly.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Paravertebral vs. Epidural Analgesia for Liver Surgery (PEALS): Protocol for a randomized controlled pilot study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Perioperative thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is commonly used in hepatectomy patients since it is opioid-sparing and reduces cardiorespiratory complications. However, TEA has a high failure rate and is associated with potentially devastating complications (particularly spinal haematoma) and the risk is likely increased with hepatectomy. Thus, some centres favour systemic opioid-based modalities which, in turn, are associated with inferior analgesia and well-known risks/side-effects. Hence, alternative analgesic methods are desirable. Paravertebral block (PVB) has been used in liver resection with advantages including hemodynamic stability, low failure rates, and low risk of spinal haematoma. Our purpose is to conduct a blinded, pilot RCT with hepatectomy patients randomised to receive TEA or PVB for perioperative analgesia. Our hypothesis is that opioid consumption, time to first analgesic request, and pain scores will be comparable between groups, but PVB patients will require fewer perioperative vasopressors/blood products, and have fewer adverse events and a shorter hospital stay. Methods: With ethics approval, this non-inferiority, pilot RCT with a convenience sample of 50 hepatectomy patients will examine whether PVB imparts analgesia comparable to TEA but with fewer adverse effects. Primary outcomes are surrogates of analgesia for 72 h postoperatively (i.e., opioid consumption, time to first analgesic request and pain scores at rest and with coughing); Secondary outcomes are blood products/fluids administered; side effects/complications until 72 h postoperatively; length of hospital stay. The results will be used to plan a large multicentre trial comparing TEA vs. PVB in hepatectomy patients. This study has a high potential to positively impact the quality/safety of patient care.

                We describe the case report of an Osteosarcoma patient, with a Li-Fraumeni Syndrome, presenting with a pathological femoral fracture. The patient was treated with a multidisciplinary approach associating neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy with excisional surgery. The femoral reconstruction consisted of a ``Capasquelet'' reconstruction combining an induced membrane and a vascularized fibula allograft allowing a good functional result with an early weight-bearing. We managed to complete our histological analysis in this patient, in order to evaluate the tumor vascularization. Indeed, using the syngeneic osteosarcoma MOS-J mouse model, we highlighted previously that CD31+/\ensuremath{\alpha }-SMA+ vessels may be indicators of vasculature normalization and therefore may be used as specific markers of a good therapeutic response. Thus, we search for its interest in this specific case as preliminary work. The aim was to assess the feasibility and technical validity of the vascularization analysis of a human osteosarcoma tumor specimen. Therefore, we propose an immunohistochemistry methodology  with multiplexed immunofluorescence to assess the vascularization as a promising marker in human osteosarcoma tissue.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Hippocampal fear engrams modulate ethanol‐induced maladaptive contextual generalization in mice</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The compounding symptomatology of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and co-occurring mental health disorders gives rise to interactions of maladaptive neurobiological processes, the etiology of which are elusive. Here, we devised an optogenetic strategy aimed at rescuing maladaptive fear processing in male c57BL/6 mice that underwent a chronic ethanol administration and forced abstinence paradigm. In the first experiment, we confirmed that fear acquisition and maladaptive contextual generalization was potentiated in ethanol-exposed mice during fear conditioning and exposure to a novel environment, respectively. In the second experiment, using an activity-dependent tet-tag system, we labeled the neural ensemble selectively activated by contextual fear conditioning in the dorsal hippocampus with an inhibitory opsin to attenuate behavioral dysfunctions resulting from ethanol exposure. We found that acute optogenetic perturbations during exposure to a novel environment suppressed maladaptive generalization in ethanol-exposed mice. These results provide further evidence for a crucial link between ethanol exposure and impaired fear memory processing by providing cellular and behavioral insights into the neural circuitry underlying AUD and maladaptive fear processing.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A special class of neurons in the hippocampal formation broadly known as the spatial cells, whose subcategories include place cells, grid cells, and head direction cells, are considered to be the building blocks of the brain's map of the spatial world. We present a general, deep learning-based modeling framework that describes the emergence of the spatial-cell responses and can also explain responses that involve a combination of path integration and vision. The first layer of the model consists of head direction (HD) cells that code for the preferred direction of the agent. The second layer is the path integration (PI) layer with oscillatory neurons: displacement of the agent in a given direction modulates the frequency of these oscillators. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the PI-cell responses showed the emergence of cells with grid-like spatial periodicity. We show that the Bessel functions could describe the response of these cells. The output of the PI layer is used to train a stack of autoencoders. Neurons of both the layers exhibit responses resembling grid cells and place cells. The paper concludes by suggesting the wider applicability of the proposed modeling framework beyond the two simulated studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Muscarinic and N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor blockade reveal differences in hippocampal local field potentials in mice with low cholinergic tone</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We hypothesize that hippocampal local field potentials in acetylcholine (ACh)-deficient mutant mice, compared to wild-type (WT) mice, will show lower sensitivity to muscarinic cholinergic antagonist scopolamine (5 mg/kg i.p.) but higher sensitivity to NMDA receptor antagonist 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP, 10 mg/kg i.p.). Recordings were made during walk and awake-immobility (IMM) in WT mice, and in mice with forebrain knockout (KO) of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) gene, or heterozygous knockdown of VAChT gene (KD). Scopolamine or CPP did not significantly alter walk theta frequency, which was higher in KD than WT/KO mice. Scopolamine decreased theta power peak rise during walk in WT/KD mice but not in KO mice, while CPP suppressed theta peak rise more in WT/KO mice than KD mice. During IMM, scopolamine decreased gamma1 (γ1, 30–58 Hz) power more in KD/WT mice than KO mice, while delta (1–4 Hz) power and delta-gamma cross-frequency coherence (CFC) were increased in all mouse groups during IMM or walk. During walk, scopolamine increased delta and beta (13–30 Hz) power and decreased gamma2 (γ2, 62–100 Hz) power and theta-γ2 CFC more in WT/KD than KO mice. Theta-γ2, but not theta-γ1, CFC increased with theta-peak-frequency in WT/KD mice, and was suppressed by scopolamine at high theta (8–10 Hz) frequency; theta-γ2 CFC in KO mice was not significantly altered by scopolamine. CPP decreased beta and gamma power more in KD/KO mice compared to WT mice, while delta power and delta-gamma CFC were increased in all mouse groups. ACh deficiency exacerbates the attenuation of beta and gamma power by CPP. We conclude that both muscarinic and NMDA transmission contribute toward hippocampal theta, beta, and gamma power, and a decrease in gamma power or theta-gamma CFC may be associated with loss of arousal and cognitive functions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is a brain region involved in critical cognitive functions including memory, planning, and spatial navigation and is commonly affected in neurodegenerative diseases. Subregions of RSC are typically described as Brodmann areas 29 and 30, which are defined by cytoarchitectural features. Using immunofluorescence, we studied the distributions of neurons immunoreactive for NeuN, latexin, and calcium binding proteins (calbindin, calretinin, and parvalbumin) in RSC of <i>Carollia perspicillata</i>, Seba's short-tailed fruit bat. We observed that latexin was specifically present in areas 29a and 29b but not 29c and 30. We further identified distribution patterns of calcium binding proteins that group areas 29a and 29b separately from areas 29c and 30. We conclude first that latexin is a useful marker to classify subregions of RSC and second that these subregions contain distinct patterns of neuronal immunoreactivity for calcium binding proteins. Given the long lifespan of <i>Carollia</i>, bat RSC may be a useful model in studying age-related neurodegeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Learning‐related changes in cellular activity within mouse dentate gyrus during trace eyeblink conditioning</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Because the dentate gyrus serves as the first site for information processing in the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit, it an important structure for the formation of associative memories. Previous findings in rabbit had recorded populations of cells within dentate gyrus that may bridge the temporal gap between stimuli to support memory formation during trace eyeblink conditioning, an associative learning task. However, this previous work was unable to identify the types of cells demonstrating this type of activity. To explore these changes further, we did in vivo single-neuron recording in conjunction with physiological determination of cell types to investigate the functional role of granule cells, mossy cells, and interneurons in dentate gyrus during learning. Tetrode recordings were performed in young-adult mice during training on trace eyeblink conditioning, a hippocampal-dependent temporal associative memory task. Conditioned mice were able to successfully learn the task, with male mice learning at a faster rate than female mice. In the conditioned group, granule cells tended to show an increase in firing rate during conditioned stimulus presentation while mossy cells showed a decrease in firing rate during the trace interval and the unconditioned stimulus. Interestingly, populations of interneurons demonstrated learning-related increases and decreases in activity that began at onset of the conditioned stimulus and persisted through the trace interval. The current study also found a significant increase in theta power during stimuli presentation in conditioned animals, and this change in theta decreased over time. Ultimately, these data suggest unique involvement of granule cells, mossy cells, and interneurons in dentate gyrus in the formation of a trace associative memory. This work expands our knowledge of dentate gyrus function, helping to discern how aging and disease might disrupt this process.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Effect of intra‐BLA overexpression of IGF‐1 on the expression of a contextual fear memory trace</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), among others are known for their critical involvement in learning and memory processes. IGF-1 regulates cognitive functions, synapse density, neurotransmission, and adult neurogenesis and induces structural and synaptic plasticity-specific changes. Although IGF-1 has been suggested to participate in different memory processes, its role in memories associated with negative emotional experiences still remains to be elucidated. The principal aim of the present study was to test whether IGF-1 overexpression using adenoviral vectors in basolateral amygdala (BLA) influences both the expression and formation of contextual fear memory, as well as the hippocampal structural plasticity associated with such memory trace. We found that IGF-1 overexpression promotes the formation and expression of a specific contextual fear memory trace, and such effect persisted at least 7 days after recall. Moreover, the overexpression of this growth factor in BLA upregulates the activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway in this brain structure. In addition, intra-BLA IGF-1 overexpression causes dorsal hippocampus (DH) structural plasticity modifications promoting changes in the proportion of mature dendritic spines in the CA1 region, after a weak conditioning protocol. The present findings contribute to the knowledge underlying BLA-DH trace memory of fear and reveal important new insights into the neurobiology and neurochemistry of fear acquisition modulated by IGF-1 overexpression. The understanding of how IGF-1 modulates the formation of a fear contextual trace may pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies focused on fear, anxiety, and trauma-related disorders.</p>

Although evolutionary-conserved plasticity factors are required independently of cell division, Wnt signaling activity is context dependent. Dichotomic interactions between SOX-2 and Wnt may control re-differentiation timing.

Knockdown of ESCRT-III/Vps4 complex proteins restores nucleoporin levels and nucleocytoplasmic transport and suppresses neurodegeneration.

                Aging may affect immunological function with increased propensity for autoimmunity. Fukushima et al. show that interaction between CD153 and CD30 causes reciprocal expansion of age-related T and B cell subsets. Association of CD153 with TCR/CD3 induces the activation of even refractory senescence-associated T cells. Antibody-mediated blockade of CD153/CD30 interaction ameliorates lupus.

                The pathogen Candida albicans uses filamentous hyphae to escape from immune phagocytes. By developing an imaging assay to quantify hyphal escape, Olivier et al. implicate three mechanisms: Candida makes a pore-forming toxin that permeabilizes macrophage membranes and triggers two host lytic pathways that further facilitate its escape.

                Here, Jugder et al. show that the V. cholerae master high cell density regulator HapR represses pathogen tryptophan consumption. This provides host enterocytes precursors for serotonin synthesis, which activates intestinal innate immune signaling and prolongs host survival. Thus, V. cholerae HapR promotes a commensal relationship with the host.
