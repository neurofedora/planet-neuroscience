<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Inflammation contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) alleviates mitochondrial apoptosis in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated PC-12 cells, and to further explore the mechanism involved. Prepared PC-12 cells were treated with IGF-1, Mdivi-1 (DRP1 blocker), LY294002 (PI3K blocker), betulinic acid (NF-κB activator) or their combinations. Mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP generation were then measured to assess mitochondrial function. The rate of apoptosis was determined using flow cytometry. The expression of several apoptosis proteins (i.e. Bax, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3) and signaling proteins (i.e. p-GSK3β, NF-κB and NLRP3) was measured using western blotting. Compared with the control cells, the LPS-treated cells showed evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction, increased apoptosis and upregulation of apoptosis proteins, which were significantly alleviated by Mdivi-1. These findings indicate that neuronal apoptosis was activated partly through the mitochondrial pathway. IGF-1 treatment inhibited mitochondrial apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in the LPS-treated cells. The reagent also increased the expression of p-GSK3β and decreased the expression of NF-κB and NLRP3. Both LY294002 and betulinic acid reversed the protective effect of IGF-1. In addition, LY294002 affected the expression of the three signaling proteins, while betulinic acid only affected the expression of NF-κB and NLRP3. These findings indicated a GSK3β/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway was existed and was involved in the protective mechanism of IGF-1. In conclusion, IGF-1 alleviated mitochondrial apoptosis through GSK3β/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway in LPS-treated PC-12 cells.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The existence of Gram-negative bacteria in the brain, regardless of underlying immune status has been demonstrated by recent studies. The colocalization of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with Aβ<sub class="a-plus-plus">1-40/42</sub> in amyloid plaques supports the hypothesis that brain microbes may be the cause, triggering chronic neuroinflammation, leading to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). To investigate the behavioral changes induced by infectious neuroinflammation, we chose the third ventricle as the site of a single LPS injection (20 μg or 80 μg) in male Wistar rats to avoid mechanical injury to forebrain structures while inducing widespread inflammation throughout the brain. Chronic neuroinflammation induced by LPS resulted in depressive-like behaviors and the impairment of spatial learning; however, there was no evidence of the development of pathological hallmarks (e.g., the phosphorylation of tau) for 10 months following LPS injection. The acceleration of cholesterol metabolism via CYP46A1 and the retardation of cholesterol synthesis via HMGCR were observed in the hippocampus of rats treated with either low-dose or high-dose LPS. The rate-limiting enzymes of cholesterol metabolism (CYP46A1) in SH-SY5Y cells and synthesis (HMGCR) in U251 cells were altered by inflammation stimulators, including LPS, IL-1β, and TNF-α, through the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. The data suggest that chronic neuroinflammation provoked by the administration of LPS into the third ventricle may induce depressive-like symptoms and that the loss of cholesterol might be a biomarker of chronic neuroinflammation. The lack of pathological hallmarks of AD in our model indicates that Gram-negative bacteria infection might not be a single cause of AD.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Twins studies indicate that many individual factors are associated with genetic polymorphisms in tobacco use, dependence vulnerability, and the ability to quit smoking. Opioid receptor delta-type 1 (OPRD1) is one of the most important genes in the opioid pathway. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the association of variants located in the intron 1 of the OPRD1 gene, including rs2236857, rs2236855, and rs760589, with susceptibility to nicotine dependence among northern Iranians. DNA of 426 individuals, including 224 smokers and 202 healthy people, were extracted with the salting-out standard technique, qualified with Agarose gel, then quantified with Nanodrop, and finally genotyped by Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) PCR. All statistical analyses were performed by SNPAlyze version 8.1 and SPSS version 20. Results revealed no significant association of all three studied variants with the susceptibility to nicotine dependence in any models of inheritance. However, there were five haplotypes with an overall frequency higher than 0.05; no significant impact of any of them on nicotine dependence was observed. Altogether, rs2236857, rs2236855, and rs760589 were not associated with nicotine dependence among northern Iranians.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">To study the effect of photobiomodulation (PBM) on axon regeneration and secretion change of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) under oxidative stress after spinal cord injury (SCI), and further explore the effect of changes in DRG secretion caused by PBM on the polarization of macrophages. The PBM-DRG model was constructed to perform PBM on neurons under oxidative stress simulated in vitro. And the irradiation conditions were as follows: wavelength, 810 nm; power density, 2 mW/cm<sup class="a-plus-plus">2</sup>; irradiation area, 4.5 cm<sup class="a-plus-plus">2</sup>; and irradiation time, 440 s. Then resulted in an energy of 4 J (2 mW/cm<sup class="a-plus-plus">2</sup> × 4.5 cm<sup class="a-plus-plus">2</sup> × 440 s). About 100 μM H<sub class="a-plus-plus">2</sub>0<sub class="a-plus-plus">2</sub> was added to the culture medium to simulate oxidative stress after SCI. An ROS (reactive oxygen species) assay kit was used to measure ROS contend in the DRG. The survival level of the neurons was measured using the CCK-8 method, and the axon regeneration of neurons was observed by using immunofluorescence. The secretion level of CCL2 from DRG was determined by RT-qPCR and ELISA. Further culturing macrophages of DRG-conditioned medium culture, the expression level of iNOS and Arg-1 in macrophages was assessed using Western blot analysis. The expression level of TNF-α and IL-1β was determined by ELISA. After adding the neutralizing antibody of CCL2 to the DRG neuron-conditioned medium following PBM irradiation to culture macrophages to observe the effects on macrophage polarization and secretion. PBM could reduce ROS levels in neurons, increase neuronal survival under oxidative stress, and promote neuronal axon regeneration. In addition, PBM could also promote CCL2 secretion by DRG under oxidative stress. By constructing a DRG supernatant-M1 macrophage adoptive culture model, we found that the supernatant of DRG after PBM intervention could reduce the expression level of iNOS and the secretion of TNF-α and IL-1β in M1 macrophages; at the same time, it could also up-regulate the expression of Arg-1, one of the markers of M2 macrophages. Furthermore, these effects could be prevented by the addition of neutralizing antibodies of CCL2. PBM could promote survival and axonal regeneration of DRG under SCI oxidative stress, increase the secretion level of CCL2 by DRG, and this change can reduce the polarization of macrophages to M1, further indicating that PBM could promote spinal cord injury repair.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Cypermethrin activates microglia, which is found to be decisive in neurodegeneration in the experimental rats. While the involvement of microglial activation in toxicant-induced neurodegeneration is reported, the effect of low concentration of cypermethrin on the expression of inflammatory proteins from the rat primary microglia is not yet properly understood. The study intended to delineate the effect of low concentration of cypermethrin on the expression and release of proteins from the microglia. Rat primary microglial cells were treated with cypermethrin to check the expression of inflammatory proteins. Cypermethrin-treated microglia conditioned media and cells were collected to measure the expression and release of inflammatory proteins. Cypermethrin augmented the protein kinase C-δ (PKC-δ), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and p42/44, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, and MMP-9 levels in the cell lysate and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels in the microglia conditioned media. Pre-treatment with minocycline, a microglial activation inhibitor or rottlerin, a PKC-δ inhibitor, notably reduced the release of TNF-α in the conditioned media and expression of iNOS protein in the microglia. Minocycline reduced the expression of PKC-δ, phosphorylated p38 and p42/44 MAPKs, MMP-3, and MMP-9 proteins in the microglia. While cypermethrin-treated conditioned media induced the toxicity in the rat primary neurons, minocycline or rottlerin reduced the cypermethrin treated microglia conditioned media-induced toxicity. The outcomes of the present study suggest that cypermethrin activates microglia and releases TNF-α and IL-1β as well as up-regulates the expression of PKC-δ, iNOS, phosphorylated p38 and p42/44 MAPKs, MMP-3, and MMP-9 proteins, which could contribute to neurodegeneration.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposit in the parenchyma is a major characteristic in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and the impaired glymphatic clearance contributes to the Aβ accumulation. It was reported that L-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) showed the potential neuroprotective effect in the rodent models of AD. The effects of NBP on the glymphatic system were explored in this study. In the wild-type mice, both CSF tracer influx and perivascular drainage increased after NBP treatment compared with vehicle treatment. Moreover, NBP promoted the perivascular drainage of Aβ via increased cerebral pulsation, which could be inhibited by propranolol. Then, we studied the potential of 3-month NBP treatment on Aβ deposits in 8-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice. NBP daily treatments remarkably improved cognitive behavior in <span class="a-plus-plus internal-ref refid-sec7">Morris water maze</span>. Furthermore, NBP could reduce Aβ deposition and decrease parenchymal Aβ levels. In addition, NBP markedly improved the perivascular AQP4 localization. Our results indicated that NBP could enhance the glymphatic clearance and reduce parenchymal Aβ deposit in the APP/PS1 mice, suggesting that it may have potential in the treatment of AD.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating traumatic event worldwide. Work from the past decade has highlighted the key involvement of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in SCI. Nevertheless, the molecular action of lncRNA H19 in SCI is still not fully understood. The levels of H19, microRNA (miR)-325-3p, and neuronal differentiation 4 (NEUROD4) were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or western blot. Flow cytometry was performed to assess cell apoptosis. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and IL-6 were detected using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Targeted relationships among H19, miR-325-3p, and NEUROD4 were confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), or RNA pull-down assays. Our data showed that H19 level was overexpressed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated BV2 cells. H19 silencing alleviated LPS-evoked cell apoptosis and inflammation. Mechanistically, H19 in BV2 cells directly targeted miR-325-3p, and NEUROD4 was a direct target of miR-325-3p. Moreover, miR-325-3p was a functional target of H19 in regulating cell apoptosis and inflammation induced by LPS. Enforced expression of miR-325-3p relieved LPS-evoked cell apoptosis and inflammation through reducing NEUROD4. Furthermore, H19 in BV2 cells regulated NEUROD4 expression through targeting miR-325-3p. Our results identified that the silencing of H19 attenuated LPS-evoked microglia cell apoptosis and inflammation after SCI at least partially through targeting the miR-325-3p/NEUROD4 axis, highlighting a novel approach for SCI management.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Repeated exposure to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligands, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), reduces responses of monocytes/macrophages to LPS (LPS/endotoxin tolerance). Microglial exposure to Aβ deposits, a TLR4 ligand, may cause “Aβ/LPS tolerance,” leading to decreased Aβ clearance. We demonstrated that microglial activation by LPS is diminished in Aβ deposit-bearing 12-month-old model mice of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), compared with non-AD mice and Aβ deposit-free 2-month-old AD mice. Because miR-146a plays a predominant role in inducing TLR tolerance in macrophages and because miR-146a in extracellular vesicles (EVs) shed by inflammatory macrophages increases in circulation, we investigated potential roles of miR-146a and inflammatory EVs in inducing TLR tolerance in microglia and in altering expression of inflammatory AD risk genes. We found that miR-146a upregulation induces TLR tolerance and alters expression of inflammatory AD risk genes in response to LPS treatment in BV2 microglia. LPS brain injection altered expression of the AD risk genes in 12-month-old AD mice but not in non-AD littermates. EVs from inflammatory macrophages polarize BV2 microglia to M1 phenotype and induce TLR tolerance. Microglia exposed to Aβ in the brain show reduced cytokine responses to systemic inflammation due to peripheral LPS injection, indicating TLR/Aβ tolerance in microglia. Our results suggest that increased miR-146a induces microglial Aβ/LPS tolerance and that circulating EVs shed by inflammatory macrophages contribute to microglial Aβ/LPS tolerance, leading to reduced Aβ clearance. Our study also suggests that altered expression of inflammatory AD risk genes may contribute to AD development via the same molecular mechanism underlying LPS tolerance.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Glioma is a prevalent primary brain tumor. Temozolomide (TMZ) has been used to treat glioma. However, the resistance of TMZ to glioma poses heavy burden to glioma treatment. In this study, the effects of glioma resistance to TMZ and underlying mechanism were revealed. The expression levels of circ-VPS18, microRNA-370 (miR-370) and runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The protein expression of RUNX1, multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), and multi-drug resistance gene-1 (MDR1) was determined by western blot. The functional effects of circ-VPS18 knockdown on TMZ sensitivity and glioma progression were revealed by cell counting kit-8 proliferation (CCK-8), flow cytometry, and transwell assays. The impacts of circ-VPS18 deletion on TMZ sensitivity in vivo were illustrated by in vivo tumor formation assay. The binding relationship between miR-370 and circ-VPS18 or RUNX1 was predicted by starBase v2.0 online database and identified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Circ-VPS18 expression and the mRNA and protein levels of RUNX1 were dramatically upregulated, and miR-370 expression was significantly downregulated in glioma cells, TMZ-resistant glioma tissues, or tissue compared with control groups. Functionally, circ-VPS18 knockdown improved TMZ sensitivity, induced cell apoptosis, whereas repressed cell viability, migration and invasion in U251/TR and LN229/TR cells, which was reversed by miR-370 inhibitor. Additionally, RUNX1 overexpression hindered the effects of miR-370 on TMZ sensitivity and glioma progression. Circ-VPS18 knockdown enhanced TMZ sensitivity in vivo. Mechanistically, circ-VPS18 functioned as a sponge of miR-370 and miR-370 targeted RUNX1. Circ-VPS18 knockdown improved TMZ sensitivity and repressed glioma progression by sponging miR-370 to downregulate RUNX1 expression, which provided a new insight in further studying glioma resistance to TMZ.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Alzheimer’s disease (AD) poses a significant threat to human life and health. The intraneuronal accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques in the brains of AD patients results in neuronal cell death, which is a key factor that triggers multiple changes in the pathogenesis of AD. The inhibition of Aβ-induced neuronal cell death may potentially help in the intervention and treatment of AD. Our previous study reported that tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 1 (TNFAIP1) is induced by and promotes Aβ<sub class="a-plus-plus">25–35</sub>-induced neurotoxicity in mouse neuronal cells, but the roles and regulatory mechanisms of TNFAIP1 are still largely unknown. In this study, our experimental results show that TNFAIP1 and p-TNFAIP1 (phosphorylation of TNFAIP1 at Ser280) are overexpressed in the neurons of the cortex and hippocampus in the brains of APP/PS1 mice, and the transcription factor NF-κB is involved in the Aβ-induced upregulation of TNFAIP1. Moreover, our results suggest that TNFAIP1 contributes to the Aβ-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm), and neuronal cell death in human SH-SY5Y cells. We further revealed that Aβ increases the binding of TNFAIP1 to RhoB, and knockdown of RhoB attenuates the TNFAIP1-induced apoptosis of human SH-SY5Y cells. These data suggest that TNFAIP1 is closely associated with AD pathogenesis, and overexpression of TNFAIP1 in the neurons of the brains of AD patients plays a role in apoptosis, at least in part, via RhoB signaling.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Migraine is a prevalent disorder in humans and represents one of the top 10 causes of years lived with disability. Several genetic and environmental factors are involved in the pathobiology of migraine. A number of studies have underscored the role of dysregulated immune reactions.

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Women with epilepsy are at increased risk of sexual dysfunction. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the effect of antiepileptic drugs on sexual function and satisfaction in women with epilepsy. In this cross-sectional study, 80 married women with epilepsy who were under treatment with antiepileptic drugs for at least 1 year were evaluated. Sexual function in patients was assessed using the Female Sexual Function Index. The mean age (± standard deviation [SD]) of women was 28.8 (± 5.9) years. The mean (± SD) duration of epilepsy was 8.6 (± 4.1) years. Thirteen women (16.2%) had focal epilepsy and 67 (83.7%) had generalized epilepsy. The mean (± SD) overall sexual performance of patients was 20.5 (± 4.7). Fifteen patients (21.3%) had decreased sexual function and 78.2% had unfavorable sexual performance. Generalized epilepsy, multi-drug regimen, disease duration of more than 10 years, and age &gt; 30 years were associated with sexual dysfunction. Due to the high prevalence of sexual dysfunction in women with epilepsy, special attention should be given to appropriate management of these patients.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">This study presented two Chinese adult female patients who were diagnosed with adult-onset Krabbe disease (KD) and reviewed this disease in Chinese patients. Two young female adults in their 20s were enrolled in this study. Clinical data, including symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, and laboratory studies were collected. Sequence alignment and structural modeling were carried out to analyze the pathogenesis of the disease. Both patients were adult-onset and both had a mild clinical course, presented with spastic weakness. The MRI study showed demyelination confined to the corticospinal tracts and parieto-occipital white matter. The β-galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity was obviously decreased in both patients. Gene test of GALC showed that both patients were compound heterozygotes; proband I was a carrier of p.L634S (c.1901 T &gt; C) and p.I250T (c.749 T &gt; C), while proband II was a carrier of p.L634S (c.1901 T &gt; C) and a new variant of c.283_284del. Molecular analysis revealed the variants may influence the function of GALC. We provided two Chinese adult-onset KD, and the clinical and genetic characteristics of proband II was especially rare due to asymmetric symptoms, spinal cord involvement, and the identification of a new point mutation c.283_284del in the GALC gene. Variant c.749 T &gt; C can present mild syndromes except for severe cases. c.283_284del is a new variant that may occur in adult-onset type.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Previous studies have shown that lncRNA NEAT1 and miR-29b are closely associated with repair of the injured spinal cord. However, the mechanism by which lncRNA NEAT1 promotes regeneration after spinal cord injury by regulating miR-29b has not been reported. To explore this mechanism, we established a rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI). The experimental rats were randomly assigned to one of six groups: the sham, model, si-NEAT1, miR-29b, si-NEAT1 + negative control and si-NEAT1 + si-miR-29b groups. The hind limb motor function of the rats was evaluated on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 after modelling using the BBB rating scale. Seven days after the operation, attenuation of pathological changes in injured spinal cord tissues was evaluated by HE staining. Anterior horn neurons and cavities in the injured area were counted by Nissl staining. In addition, the TUNEL assay was employed to study neuronal apoptosis in the anterior horn, and the expression of the apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bax was analysed by western blotting. Finally, the protein expression of GFAP, NCAM, GAP43, and SCG10 was measured by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. BBB scores revealed that decreasing the level of NEAT1 improved the hind limb motor function of the rats by increasing miR-29b expression. H&amp;E and Nissl staining showed that silencing NEAT1 attenuated lesions in the spinal cord and decreased the number of cavities in the injured spinal cord by upregulating miR-29b. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting suggested that silencing NEAT1 significantly downregulated GFAP expression and upregulated GAP43, SCG10 and NCAM expression by inducing overexpression of miR-29b. The TUNEL assay and western blotting also showed that silencing NEAT1 attenuated neuronal apoptosis.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">It has been suggested that dysregulation of hormones is associated with schizophrenia (SCZ). This study aimed to measure the serum levels of progesterone and testosterone in 125 SCZ patients at different stages of treatment and 96 healthy control (HC) subjects. Our results showed that first-episode drug-free SCZ patients had significantly increased testosterone levels when compared with HC subjects, and chronic medication, but not short-term medication, further increased the serum testosterone levels in the patients. Further analysis suggested that the sex of the patients did not affect testosterone levels. In contrast, serum progesterone levels did not show significant differences between first-episode, drug-free SCZ patients and controls, and the antipsychotics increased progesterone levels in the male SCZ patients, but not female patients. Interestingly, our analyses demonstrated that the serum progesterone levels were negatively correlated with PANSS total score and PNASS positive score, suggesting a correlation between blood hormone levels and disease severity in SCZ patients. Taken together, our data showed differential changes in serum testosterone and progesterone levels in SCZ patients with or without antipsychotics, and our results suggest that increased sex hormone levels may be a defensive response to protect the human body under stress.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most lethal malignancies of the central nervous system characterized by high mortality rate. The complexity of GBM pathogenesis, progression, and prognosis is not fully understood yet. GBM-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry several oncogenic elements that facilitate GBM progression. The purpose of this study was to identify systems level molecular signatures from GBM-derived EVs using integrative analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data generated from plasma and serum samples. The dataset contained 19 samples in total, of which 15 samples were from plasma (11 GBM patients and 4 healthy samples) and 4 samples were from serum (2 GBM and 2 healthy samples). We carried out statistical analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs, protein–protein interaction networks, module analysis, transcription factors and target gene regulatory networks analysis, and identification of hub genes. The differential expression of the identified hub genes were validated with the independent TCGA-GBM dataset. We have identified a few crucial genes and pathways associated with GBM prognosis and therapy resistance. The DEGs identified from plasma were associated with inflammatory processes and viral infection. On the other hand, the hub genes identified from the serum samples were significantly associated with protein ubiquitinylation processes and cytokine signaling regulation. The findings indicate that GBM-derived plasma and serum DEGs may be associated with distinct cellular processes and pathways which facilitate GBM progression. The findings will provide better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of GBM pathogenesis and progression. These results can further be utilized for developing and validating minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic molecular biomarkers for GBM.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNSs) are commonly used to prevent weight gain and development of metabolic diseases associated with consumption of high-energy diets. Recent studies have demonstrated that these compounds may have unwanted detrimental effects under specific circumstances in vivo. In particular, an association between NNS consumption and changes in signaling pathways involved in the hunger-satiety system in the brain has been reported. Nonetheless, the extent of alterations in brain signaling pathways associated with consumption of these compounds has not been determined. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of frequent consumption of NNSs on the expression of proteins involved in signaling pathways related to appetite control in the brain in vivo. Eight-week-old BALB/c mice were supplemented with sucrose, sucralose, or steviol glycosides in their daily drinking water for 6 weeks. Subsequently, total brain protein extracts were used to analyze the expression of total and phosphorylated JAK2, STAT5, ERK 1/2, JNK, as well as SHP-2 and POMC, by western blot. Serum concentrations of leptin and α-MSH were quantified by ELISA. Results show that consumption of NNSs promotes significant changes in these signaling pathways, reducing the expression of pSTAT5/STAT5, pERK 1/2, SHP-2, and pJNK/JNK in male mice supplemented with steviol glycosides. Furthermore, consumption of steviol glycosides induced a decrease of α-MSH in male mice. In contrast, steviol glycosides induced overexpression of pSTAT5, pERK, and SHP-2 in females. These data suggest that chronic consumption of NNSs promotes sex-specific changes in signaling pathways related to the central hunger-satiety system in vivo.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">As an important endogenous growth factor, PDGF-BB can effectively promote neurogenesis, thus is considered as a potential agent for Parkinson’s disease (PD) therapy. However, the protective function of PDGF-BB on neuronal cells, especially the molecular mechanism, remains less clear, which is needed to explore before its clinical practice. In this study, we investigated the function and mechanism of PDGF-BB against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup>) toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, a widely used cellular tool for PD-related molecular study. Our results indicated that PDGF-BB exerts a prominent protective effect against neurotoxin MPP<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup>-triggered ROS generation and cellular loss. We further dissected the molecular mechanism involved in this process by using specific pharmacological inhibitors and validated that the distinct signaling pathways PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β and MEK/ERK are involved in the process against MPP<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup> toxicity upon PDGF-BB treatment. We also detected that activation of upstream PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β and MER/ERK signaling pathways contribute to phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the downstream effector cyclic response element-binding protein (CREB), a known transcription factor to exhibit neuroprotective and growth-promoting effects. Using genetic approach, we further confirmed that the activation of CREB is involved in PDGF-BB-mediated protection in MPP<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup>-exposed SH-SY5Y cells. Together, these data demonstrated the protective effect of PDGF-BB in MPP<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup>-mediated toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells and verified the involved molecular mechanism in PDGF-BB-mediated neuroprotection.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive demyelination due to deficiency of the enzyme arylsulfatase A (ARSA) in leukocytes, and consequently leads to impaired degradation and accumulation of cerebroside-3-sulfate (sulfatide). This study aimed to sequence the <em class="a-plus-plus">ARSA</em> gene in a total of 43 patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy descendant from 40 Egyptian families. In addition, four carrier parents from two families with children who had died from MLD came to the clinic for genetic analysis. Prenatal diagnosis was performed for four families with molecularly diagnosed MLD sibs. Different mutations were characterized in our cohort, including missense, nonsense, splice, and deletion. Overall, 21 different mutations in the <em class="a-plus-plus">ARSA</em> gene were detected, with 12 novel mutations, i.e. p.Arg60Pro, p.Tyr65*, p.Val112Asp, p.Arg116*, p.Gly124Asp, p.Pro193Ser, p.Gln238*, p.Gln456*, p.Thr276Lys, and p.Gly311Arg, in addition to two new acceptor splice-site mutations 685-1G &gt; A and c.954_956 delCTT. The amniotic fluid samples revealed two carrier fetuses with heterozygous monoallelic mutations, and two affected fetuses had the homozygous biallelic mutations. In conclusion, the current study sheds light on the underlying <em class="a-plus-plus">ARSA</em> gene defect, with an expansion of the mutation spectrum. To our knowledge, this is the first molecular study of MLD among the Egyptian population.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) refers to the entire spectrum of vascular brain pathologies that contribute to cognitive deficits, ranging from subjective cognitive decline to dementia. The main pathologies in VCI are infarcts and white matter hyperintensities due to ischemia. VCI rodent models can be divided into surgical models (e.g., MCAO, BCAO, BCAS, 2-VO, 4-VO) and genetic models (e.g., SHR/SP, T2DM, CAA, CADASIL) based on construction methods. However, no single model can fully recapitulate the pathogenesis of VCI, and choosing the appropriate model for different research purposes would be of crucial importance. Here, we have summarized the commonly used rodent VCI models and discussed their advantages and limitations to provide a necessary reference for selecting suitable animal models to investigate the molecular pathways involved in VCI and develop therapeutic interventions.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Although several pieces of evidence have indicated the ability of the serotonin-7 receptor (5-HTR<sub class="a-plus-plus">7</sub>) to modulate N-methyl-<sub class="a-plus-plus">D</sub>-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation, the possible impact on ketamine anesthesia has not been examined directly. The purpose of the present study is thus to investigate the possible role of the 5-HTR<sub class="a-plus-plus">7</sub> in ketamine anesthesia using a 5-HTR<sub class="a-plus-plus">7</sub> agonist and/or antagonist. The influence of a 5-HTR<sub class="a-plus-plus">7</sub> agonist/antagonist on ketamine anesthesia for behavioral impact was assessed by testing potential anesthetic parameters. Its functional impact was assessed by mRNA expression with real-time PCR and immunostaining in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of mice. Two different doses of ketamine—high and low—were administered to induce anesthesia. In the high-dose ketamine-applied group in particular, the administration of both the 5-HTR<sub class="a-plus-plus">7</sub> agonist and antagonist intensified the anesthetic effect of ketamine. The reflection of the change in anesthesia parameters to 5-HTR<sub class="a-plus-plus">7</sub> expression was observed as an increase in the hippocampus and a decrease in the prefrontal cortex in the anesthetized groups by stimulation of 5-HTR<sub class="a-plus-plus">7</sub>. It is noteworthy that the results of NMDAR expressions are parallel to the results of the 5-HTR<sub class="a-plus-plus">7</sub> expressions of both the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. The 5-HTR<sub class="a-plus-plus">7</sub> may play a role in ketamine anesthesia. It may act through NMDAR in ketamine anesthesia, depending on the parallelism between both receptors.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus-ventrolateral part (VMNvl) is an estradiol-sensitive structure that controls sex-specific behavior. Electrical reactivity of VMNvl neurons to hypoglycemia infers that cellular energy stability is monitored there. Current research investigated the hypothesis that estradiol elicits sex-dimorphic patterns of VMNvl metabolic sensor activation and gluco-regulatory neurotransmission during hypoglycemia. Rostral-, middle-, and caudal-VMNvl tissue was separately micropunch-dissected from letrozole (Lz)- or vehicle-injected male and estradiol- or vehicle-implanted ovariectomized (OVX) female rats for Western blot analysis of total and phosphorylated 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) protein expression and gluco-stimulatory [neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS); steroidogenic factor-1 (SF1) or -inhibitory (glutamate decarboxylase<sub class="a-plus-plus">65/67</sub> (GAD)] transmitter marker proteins after <em class="a-plus-plus">sc</em> insulin (INS) or vehicle injection. In both sexes, hypoglycemic up-regulation of phosphoAMPK was estradiol-dependent in rostral and middle, but not caudal VMNvl. AMPK activity remained elevated after recovery from hypoglycemia over the rostro-caudal VMNvl in female, but only in the rostral segment in male. In each sex, hypoglycemia correspondingly augmented or suppressed nNOS profiles in rostral and middle versus caudal VMNvl; these segmental responses persisted longer in female. Rostral and middle segment SF1 protein was inhibited by estradiol-independent mechanisms in hypoglycemic males, but increased by estradiol-reliant mechanisms in female. After INS injection, GAD expression was inhibited in the male rostral VMNvl without estradiol involvement, but this hormone was required for broader suppression of this profile in the female. Neuroanatomical variability of VMNvl metabolic transmitter reactivity to hypoglycemia underscores the existence of functionally different subgroups in that structure. The regional distribution and estradiol sensitivity of hypoglycemia-sensitive VMNvl neurons of each neurochemical phenotype evidently vary between sexes.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The mechanisms of the complex pathophysiology of Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) are still insufficiently clarified. The role of oxidative stress as an etiological factor has been proposed and demonstrated in vitro, but without conclusive data that rely on clinical samples. The aim of the study was to evaluate and characterize the existence of oxidative stress in the plasma of LHON patients and healthy individuals. Whole mitochondrial genome sequencing has been performed in order to identify primary LHON mutations. For the assessment of oxidative stress, the following biomarkers were determined in plasma: total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS), and oxidative stress index (OSI), while oxidative damage of cellular proteins was estimated by quantifying advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP). All three primary LHON mutations (m.3460G &gt; A, m.11778G &gt; A and m.14484 T &gt; C) were identified as a genetic cause of the disease, where the most prevalent one was m.11778G &gt; A. LHON patients have a highly significant increase of TOS and a marked decrease of TAS levels, which suggests the existence of substantial oxidative stress. OSI is high in LHON patients, which definitely implies the presence of redox imbalance. Elevated level of AOPP in LHON patients refers to the significant deleterious effects of oxidative stress on cellular proteins. Oxidative stress parameters do not significantly differ between LHON individuals with different primary mutations. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic LHON patients have an augmented level of oxidative stress which suggests that primary mutations exhibit a pro-oxidative phenotype. Gender and smoking habit significantly influence examined biochemical parameters when LHON patients are compared with the control group. Different mitochondrial haplogroups are characterized by altered levels of OSI in LHON group. The absence of physiological correlations between redox parameters reflects the deregulation of homeostatic oxidative/antioxidative balance in LHON patients. This is the greatest series of LHON patients that were evaluated for oxidative stress and the first case-controlled study that evaluated TOS, TAS, OSI, and AOPP and their influence on disease phenotype. It is evident that the presence of oxidative stress represents an important pathophysiological event in LHON and that it could potentially serve as a circulatory biomarker for a therapy efficacy understanding.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Hypoxia-inducible factor-3α (<em class="a-plus-plus">HIF-3α</em>), a member of HIF family, can mediate adaptive responses to low oxygen and ischemia. It is believed that HIF plays crucial roles in stroke-related diseases. However, there are no reports on the association between HIF-3α genetic variants and ischemic stroke (IS) susceptibility. Therefore, we examined the association between <em class="a-plus-plus">HIF-</em>3α gene polymorphisms (rs3826795, rs2235095, and rs3764609) and IS risk. The study population included 302 controls and 310 patients with ischemic stroke. Three polymorphisms in <em class="a-plus-plus">HIF-</em>3α (rs3826795, rs2235095, and rs3764609) were genotyped using SNPscan technique. Our study showed a strong association of rs3826795 in HIF-3α with the risk of IS. The genotype and allele frequencies were shown to differ between the two groups. The rs3826795 in an intron of <em class="a-plus-plus">HIF-3α</em> was related to a prominent increased IS risk (AA vs GG adjusted odd ratio [OR], 2.21; 95% confidence intervals [95% CI], 1.10–4.44; <em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> = 0.03; AA vs AG/GG OR = 1.74, 95% CI, 1.02–2.97, <em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> = 0.04; A vs G OR = 1.48, 95% CI, 1.05–2.07, <em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> = 0.02). Logistic regression analysis suggested that rs3826795 posed a risk factor for IS in addition to common factors. Furthermore, when compared to controls, increased levels of homocysteic acid and level of non-esterified fatty acid were found in the cases (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> &lt; 0.01). However, no significant association was found between rs2235095 or rs3264609 and IS risk. These findings indicated that the rs3826795 polymorphism may be a potential target for predicting the risk of IS.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Atherosclerotic plaque instability is a major cause of ischemic stroke. Researchers must develop novel strategies for the detection and treatment of unstable atherosclerotic plaque (UAP)-related stroke. We aimed to identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets of UAP-related stroke. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of UAP, ischemic stroke and smoking were identified by microarray analyses from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway functional enrichment analyses of DEGs were performed to analyze plaque destabilization and ischemic stroke physiopathology. An integrative analysis of UAP, ischemic stroke and smoking DEGs and functional annotations was performed to identify the underlying physiopathology and hub genes in UAP-related stroke and the relationship with smoking. Online search databases were applied to confirm hub gene biofunctions and their relationships with atherosclerosis and cerebrovascular diseases. Following integrative analysis, 18 co-DEGs of UAP and ischemic stroke, including 17 upregulated and one downregulated, were identified. Inflammation, immunity, extracellular matrix degradation, blood coagulation, apoptosis and nerve degeneration were the primary physiopathological processes in UAP-related stroke. Hub genes included MMP9, ITGAM, CCR1, NCF2 and CD163, among which MMP9 and ITGAM were top 10 genes for both UAP and stroke. Smoking may upregulate MMP9, NCF2, C5AR1 and ANPEP to accelerate plaque destabilization and UAP-related stroke. MMP9, ITGAM, CCR1, NCF2, CD163, hsa-miR-3123 and hsa-miR-144-3p are potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of UAP-related stroke. MMP9 and ITGAM are potential therapeutic targets of UAP-related stroke, which will contribute to the development of novel management strategies.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The main objective of current work was to determine the effects of treadmill-running and swimming exercise on passive avoidance learning (PAL) and blood biochemical parameters in rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. Male Wistar rats were divided into the following 6 groups (<em class="a-plus-plus">N</em> = 6–8 per group): CON, healthy rats without exercise (<em class="a-plus-plus">N</em> = 8); STZ, diabetic rats without exercise (<em class="a-plus-plus">N</em> = 8); CON-SE, healthy rats subjected to swimming exercise (2 months; <em class="a-plus-plus">N</em> = 6); STZ-SE, diabetic rats subjected to swimming exercise (2 months; <em class="a-plus-plus">N</em> = 7); CON-TE, healthy rats subjected to treadmill exercise (2 months; <em class="a-plus-plus">N</em> = 8); STZ-TE, diabetic rats subjected to treadmill exercise (2 months; <em class="a-plus-plus">N</em> = 8). Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg STZ. Our results showed that STZ decreased the step-through latency in the retention test (STLr) and increased the time spent in the dark compartment (TDC) when compared with the CON group. However, treadmill-running and swimming exercise in STZ-treated rats increased the STLr and decreased the TDC when compared with STZ-treated rats without exercise in PAL. Blood low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglyceride (TG) levels in the STZ group were significantly higher than those in the CON group, whereas plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and levels of catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were lower in the STZ group compared with the CON group. The levels of LDL and TG decreased and the levels of TAC, CAT, and GPx increased in the exercise groups in comparison with the STZ group. The present results indicate that regular exercise enhances learning and memory in diabetic rats and that these effects may occur through activation of the antioxidant system.</p>

Beginning with studies on crypsis and camouflage, the hypothesis that predators can generate evolutionary change in their prey has a long and rich history (1).

<p>by Fleur Zeldenrust, Boris Gutkin, Sophie Denéve</p>

Cortical networks show a large heterogeneity of neuronal properties. However, traditional coding models have focused on homogeneous populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Here, we analytically derive a class of recurrent networks of spiking neurons that close to optimally track a continuously varying input online, based on two assumptions: 1) every spike is decoded linearly and 2) the network aims to reduce the mean-squared error between the input and the estimate. From this we derive a class of predictive coding networks, that unifies encoding and decoding and in which we can investigate the difference between homogeneous networks and heterogeneous networks, in which each neurons represents different features and has different spike-generating properties. We find that in this framework, ‘type 1’ and ‘type 2’ neurons arise naturally and networks consisting of a heterogeneous population of different neuron types are both more efficient and more robust against correlated noise. We make two experimental predictions: 1) we predict that integrators show strong correlations with other integrators and resonators are correlated with resonators, whereas the correlations are much weaker between neurons with different coding properties and 2) that ‘type 2’ neurons are more coherent with the overall network activity than ‘type 1’ neurons.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6BuYyKmf5kI" width="1" />

<i>Plasmodium</i> species, the causative agent of malaria, have a complex life cycle involving two hosts. The sporozoite life stage is characterized by an extended phase in the mosquito salivary glands followed by free movement and rapid invasion of hepatocytes in the human host. This transmission stage has been the subject of many transcriptomics and proteomics studies and is also targeted by the most advanced malaria vaccine. We applied Bayesian data integration to determine which proteins are not only present in sporozoites but are also specific to that stage. Transcriptomic and proteomic <i>Plasmodium</i> data sets from 26 studies were weighted for how representative they are for sporozoites, based on a carefully assembled gold standard for <i>Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)</i> proteins known to be present or absent during the sporozoite life stage. Of 5418 <i>Pf</i> genes for which expression data were available at the RNA level or at the protein level, 975 were identified as enriched in sporozoites and 90 specific to them. We show that <i>Pf</i> sporozoites are enriched for proteins involved in type II fatty acid synthesis in the apicoplast and GPI anchor synthesis, but otherwise appear metabolically relatively inactive in the salivary glands of mosquitos. Newly annotated hypothetical sporozoite-specific and sporozoite-enriched proteins highlight sporozoite-specific functions. They include PF3D7_0104100 that we identified to be homologous to the prominin family, which in human has been related to a quiescent state of cancer cells. We document high levels of genetic variability for sporozoite proteins, specifically for sporozoite-specific proteins that elicit antibodies in the human host. Nevertheless, we can identify nine relatively well-conserved sporozoite proteins that elicit antibodies and that together can serve as markers for previous exposure. Our understanding of sporozoite biology benefits from identifying key pathways that are enriched during this life stage. This work can guide studies of molecular mechanisms underlying sporozoite biology and potential well-conserved targets for marker and drug development.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oSUJkj0SPjI" width="1" />

<p>How does your brain decide what you will do next? Over the past few decades
compelling evidence has emerged that the basal ganglia, a collection of nuclei
in the fore- and mid-brain of all vertebrates, are vital to action selection.
Gurney, Prescott, and Redgrave published an influential computational account
of this idea in Biological Cybernetics in 2001. Here we take a look back at
this pair of papers, outlining the "GPR" model contained therein, the context
of that model's development, and the influence it has had over the past twenty
years. Tracing its lineage into models and theories still emerging now, we are
encouraged that the GPR model is that rare thing, a computational model of a
brain circuit whose advances were directly built on by others.

to evolve instances for optimization problems that pose difficulties for one
algorithm while being rather easy for a competitor and vice versa. Typically,
this is achieved by either minimizing or maximizing the performance difference
or ratio which serves as the fitness function. Repeating this process is useful
to gain insights into strengths/weaknesses of certain algorithms or to build a
set of instances with strong performance differences as a foundation for
automatic per-instance algorithm selection or configuration. We contribute to
this branch of research by proposing fitness-functions to evolve instances that
show large performance differences for more than just two algorithms
simultaneously. As a proof-of-principle, we evolve instances of the
multi-component Traveling Thief Problem~(TTP) for three incomplete TTP-solvers.
Our results point out that our strategies are promising, but unsurprisingly
their success strongly relies on the algorithms' performance complementarity.

<p>Liquid State Machines are brain inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) with
random reservoir connectivity and bio-mimetic neuronal and synaptic models.
Reservoir computing networks are proposed as an alternative to deep neural
networks to solve temporal classification problems. Previous studies suggest
2nd order (double exponential) synaptic waveform to be crucial for achieving
high accuracy for TI-46 spoken digits recognition. The proposal of long-time
range (ms) bio-mimetic synaptic waveforms is a challenge to compact and power
efficient neuromorphic hardware. In this work, we analyze the role of synaptic
orders namely: {\delta} (high output for single time step), 0th (rectangular
with a finite pulse width), 1st (exponential fall) and 2nd order (exponential
rise and fall) and synaptic timescales on the reservoir output response and on
the TI-46 spoken digits classification accuracy under a more comprehensive
parameter sweep. We find the optimal operating point to be correlated to an
optimal range of spiking activity in the reservoir. Further, the proposed 0th
order synapses perform at par with the biologically plausible 2nd order
synapses. This is substantial relaxation for circuit designers as synapses are
the most abundant components in an in-memory implementation for SNNs. The
circuit benefits for both analog and mixed-signal realizations of 0th order
synapse are highlighted demonstrating 2-3 orders of savings in area and power
consumptions by eliminating Op-Amps and Digital to Analog Converter circuits.
This has major implications on a complete neural network implementation with
focus on peripheral limitations and algorithmic simplifications to overcome
them.

<p>To achieve the low latency, high throughput, and energy efficiency benefits
of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), reducing the memory and compute requirements
when running on a neuromorphic hardware is an important step. Neuromorphic
architecture allows massively parallel computation with variable and local
bit-precisions. However, how different bit-precisions should be allocated to
different layers or connections of the network is not trivial. In this work, we
demonstrate how a layer-wise Hessian trace analysis can measure the sensitivity
of the loss to any perturbation of the layer's weights, and this can be used to
guide the allocation of a layer-specific bit-precision when quantizing an SNN.
In addition, current gradient based methods of SNN training use a complex
neuron model with multiple state variables, which is not ideal for compute and
memory efficiency. To address this challenge, we present a simplified neuron
model that reduces the number of state variables by 4-fold while still being
compatible with gradient based training. We find that the impact on model
accuracy when using a layer-wise bit-precision correlated well with that
layer's Hessian trace. The accuracy of the optimal quantized network only
dropped by 0.2%, yet the network size was reduced by 58%. This reduces memory
usage and allows fixed-point arithmetic with simpler digital circuits to be
used, increasing the overall throughput and energy efficiency.

<p>Recent advances in natural language processing and computer vision have led
to AI models that interpret simple scenes at human levels. Yet, we do not have
a complete understanding of how humans and AI models differ in their
interpretation of more complex scenes. We created a dataset of complex scenes
that contained human behaviors and social interactions. AI and humans had to
describe the scenes with a sentence. We used a quantitative metric of
similarity between scene descriptions of the AI/human and ground truth of five
other human descriptions of each scene. Results show that the machine/human
agreement scene descriptions are much lower than human/human agreement for our
complex scenes. Using an experimental manipulation that occludes different
spatial regions of the scenes, we assessed how machines and humans vary in
utilizing regions of images to understand the scenes. Together, our results are
a first step toward understanding how machines fall short of human visual
reasoning with complex scenes depicting human behaviors.

<p>Neuromorphic computing is a non-von Neumann computing paradigm that performs
computation by emulating the human brain. Neuromorphic systems are extremely
energy-efficient and known to consume thousands of times less power than CPUs
and GPUs. They have the potential to drive critical use cases such as
autonomous vehicles, edge computing and internet of things in the future. For
this reason, they are sought to be an indispensable part of the future
computing landscape. Neuromorphic systems are mainly used for spike-based
machine learning applications, although there are some non-machine learning
applications in graph theory, differential equations, and spike-based
simulations. These applications suggest that neuromorphic computing might be
capable of general-purpose computing. However, general-purpose computability of
neuromorphic computing has not been established yet. In this work, we prove
that neuromorphic computing is Turing-complete and therefore capable of
general-purpose computing. Specifically, we present a model of neuromorphic
computing, with just two neuron parameters (threshold and leak), and two
synaptic parameters (weight and delay). We devise neuromorphic circuits for
computing all the {\mu}-recursive functions (i.e., constant, successor and
projection functions) and all the {\mu}-recursive operators (i.e., composition,
primitive recursion and minimization operators). Given that the {\mu}-recursive
functions and operators are precisely the ones that can be computed using a
Turing machine, this work establishes the Turing-completeness of neuromorphic
computing.

<p>Despite the unresolved 'dying ReLU problem', the classical ReLU activation
function (AF) has been extensively applied in Deep Neural Networks (DNN), in
particular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), for image classification. The
common gradient issues of ReLU pose challenges in applications on academy and
industry sectors. Recent approaches for improvements are in a similar direction
by just proposing variations of the AF, such as Leaky ReLU (LReLU), while
maintaining the solution within the same unresolved gradient problems. In this
paper, the Absolute Leaky ReLU (ALReLU) AF, a variation of LReLU, is proposed,
as an alternative method to resolve the common 'dying ReLU problem' on NN-based
algorithms for supervised learning. The experimental results demonstrate that
by using the absolute values of LReLU's small negative gradient, has a
significant improvement in comparison with LReLU and ReLU, on image
classification of diseases such as COVID-19, text and tabular data
classification tasks on five different datasets.

<p>Recent empirical and theoretical studies have shown that many learning
algorithms -- from linear regression to neural networks -- can have test
performance that is non-monotonic in quantities such the sample size and model
size. This striking phenomenon, often referred to as "double descent", has
raised questions of if we need to re-think our current understanding of
generalization. In this work, we study whether the double-descent phenomenon
can be avoided by using optimal regularization. Theoretically, we prove that
for certain linear regression models with isotropic data distribution,
optimally-tuned $\ell_2$ regularization achieves monotonic test performance as
we grow either the sample size or the model size. We also demonstrate
empirically that optimally-tuned $\ell_2$ regularization can mitigate double
descent for more general models, including neural networks. Our results suggest
that it may also be informative to study the test risk scalings of various
algorithms in the context of appropriately tuned regularization.

<p>Lindenmayer systems (L-systems) are a formal grammar system, where the most
notable feature is a set of rewriting rules that are used to replace every
symbol in a string in parallel; by repeating this process, a sequence of
strings is produced. Some symbols in the strings may be interpreted as
instructions for simulation software. Thus, the sequence can be used to model
the steps of a process. Currently, creating an L-system for a specific process
is done by hand by experts through much effort. The inductive inference problem
attempts to infer an L-system from such a sequence of strings generated by an
unknown system; this can be thought of as an intermediate step to inferring
from a sequence of images. This paper evaluates and analyzes different genetic
algorithm encoding schemes and mathematical properties for the L-system
inductive inference problem. A new tool, the Plant Model Inference Tool for
Context-Free L-systems (PMIT-D0L) is implemented based on these techniques.
PMIT-D0L has been successfully evaluated on 28 known L-systems, with alphabets
up to 31 symbols and a total sum of 281 symbols across the rewriting rules.
PMIT-D0L can infer even the largest of these L-systems in less than a few
seconds.

<p>Network neuroscience shed some light on the functional and structural
modifications occurring to the brain associated with the phenomenology of
schizophrenia. In particular, resting-state functional networks have helped our
understanding of the illness by highlighting the global and local alterations
within the cerebral organization. We investigated the robustness of the brain
functional architecture in forty-four medicated schizophrenic patients and
forty healthy comparators through an advanced network analysis of resting-state
functional magnetic resonance imaging data. The networks in patients showed
more resistance to disconnection than in healthy controls, with an evident
discrepancy between the two groups in the node degree distribution computed
along a percolation process. Despite a substantial similarity of the basal
functional organization between the two groups, the expected hierarchy of
healthy brains modular organization is crumbled in schizophrenia, showing a
peculiar arrangement of the functional connections, characterized by several
topologically equivalent backbones.

<p>Streams of action potentials or long depolarizations evoke a massive exocytosis of transmitters and peptides from the surface of dendrites, axons and cell bodies of different neuron types. Such mode of exocytosis is known as extrasynaptic for occurring without utilization of synaptic structures. Most transmitters and all peptides can be released extrasynaptically. Neurons may discharge their contents with relative independence from the axon, soma and dendrites. Extrasynaptic exocytosis takes fractions of a second in varicosities or minutes in the soma or dendrites, but its effects last from seconds to hours. Unlike synaptic exocytosis, which is well localized, extrasynaptic exocytosis is diffuse and affects neuronal circuits, glia and blood vessels. Molecules that are liberated may reach extrasynaptic receptors microns away. The coupling between excitation and exocytosis follows a multistep mechanism, different from that at synapses, but similar to that for the release of hormones. The steps from excitation to exocytosis have been studied step by step for the vital transmitter serotonin in leech Retzius neurons. The events leading to serotonin exocytosis occur similarly for the release of other transmitters and peptides in central and peripheral neurons. Extrasynaptic exocytosis occurs commonly onto glial cells, which react by releasing the same or other transmitters. In the last section, we discuss how illumination of the retina evokes extrasynaptic release of dopamine and ATP. Dopamine contributes to light-adaptation; ATP activates glia, which mediates an increase in blood flow and oxygenation. A proper understanding of the workings of the nervous system requires the understanding of extrasynaptic communication.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a severely debilitating neurodegenerative disease, affecting the motor system, leading to resting tremor, cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, walking and gait difficulties, and postural instability. The severe loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta causes striatal dopamine deficiency and the presence of Lewy bodies indicates a pathological hallmark of PD. Although the current treatment of PD aims to preserve dopaminergic neurons or to replace dopamine depletion in the brain, it is notable that complete recovery from the disease is yet to be achieved. Given the complexity and multisystem effects of PD, the underlying mechanisms of PD pathogenesis are yet to be elucidated. The advancement of medical technologies has given some insights in understanding the mechanism and potential treatment of PD with a special interest in the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) to unravel the pathophysiology of PD. In PD patients, it was found that striatal brain tissue and dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra demonstrated dysregulated miRNAs expression profiles. Hence, dysregulation of miRNAs may contribute to the pathogenesis of PD through modulation of PD-associated gene and protein expression. This review will discuss recent findings on PD-associated miRNAs dysregulation, from the regulation of PD-associated genes, dopaminergic neuron survival, α-synuclein-induced inflammation and circulating miRNAs. The next section of this review also provides an update on the potential uses of miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic tools for PD.</p>

Objective<p>To explore the effect of combining repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and conventional rehabilitation on the recovery of consciousness in patients in a persistent vegetative state (PVS).</p>Methods<p>A total of 48 patients in a PVS were randomly divided into a treatment and control group. Patients in the treatment group were treated with rTMS to stimulate the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and patients in the control group were treated with false stimulation. All patients were evaluated using scales and neuroelectrophysiological assessment before treatment, after 30 days of treatment, and following 60 days of treatment.</p>Results<p>Based on the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) and electroencephalogram (EEG) grading indexes, the treatment group was significantly higher than those of the control group after 30 and 60 days of treatment. The average difference in the three measurements between the two groups before treatment, at 30 days, and 60 days was 0.04, 1.54, and 2.09 for CRS-R and 0.08, −0.83, and −0.62 for EEG indexes, respectively. The latency periods of each wave of the brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) in the treatment group were shorter than those in the control group after 30 and 60 days of treatment. In both groups, the BAEP scores after 30 days of treatment were significantly higher than the scores before treatment, and the scores after 60 days of treatment were higher than the scores after 30 days.</p>Conclusion<p>In patients in a PVS, rTMS assists in the recovery of consciousness function.</p>

<p>Studies on Parkinson disease (PD) have mostly focused on the central nervous system—specifically, on the loss of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons and associated motor dysfunction. However, the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is gaining prominence in PD research, with increasing clinical attention being paid to non-motor symptoms. Researchers found abnormal deposition of α-synuclein and neuroinflammation in the PNS. Attempts have been made to use these pathological changes during the clinical diagnosis of PD. Animal studies demonstrated that combined transplantation of autologous peripheral nerves and cells with tyrosine hydroxylase activity can reduce dopaminergic neuronal damage, and similar effects were observed in some clinical trials. In this review, we will systematically explain PNS performance in PD pathology and its clinical diagnostic research, describe PNS experimental results [especially Schwann cell (SC) transplantation in the treatment of PD animal models] and the results of clinical trials, and discuss future directions. The mechanism by which SCs produce such a therapeutic effect and the safety of transplantation therapy are briefly described.</p>

<p>A passive brain–computer interface (BCI) based upon functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) brain signals is used for earlier detection of human drowsiness during driving tasks. This BCI modality acquired hemodynamic signals of 13 healthy subjects from the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DPFC) of the brain. Drowsiness activity is recorded using a continuous-wave fNIRS system and eight channels over the right DPFC. During the experiment, sleep-deprived subjects drove a vehicle in a driving simulator while their cerebral oxygen regulation (CORE) state was continuously measured. Vector phase analysis (VPA) was used as a classifier to detect drowsiness state along with sleep stage-based threshold criteria. Extensive training and testing with various feature sets and classifiers are done to justify the adaptation of threshold criteria for any subject without requiring recalibration. Three statistical features (mean oxyhemoglobin, signal peak, and the sum of peaks) along with six VPA features (trajectory slopes of VPA indices) were used. The average accuracies for the five classifiers are 90.9% for discriminant analysis, 92.5% for support vector machines, 92.3% for nearest neighbors, 92.4% for both decision trees, and ensembles over all subjects’ data. Trajectory slopes of CORE vector magnitude and angle: m(|R|) and m(∠R) are the best-performing features, along with ensemble classifier with the highest accuracy of 95.3% and minimum computation time of 40 ms. The statistical significance of the results is validated with a p-value of less than 0.05. The proposed passive BCI scheme demonstrates a promising technique for online drowsiness detection using VPA along with sleep stage classification.</p>

<p>The quality of arm movements typically improves in the sub-acute phase of stroke affecting the upper extremity. Here, we used whole arm kinematic analysis during reaching movements to distinguish whether these improvements are due to true recovery or to compensation. Fifty-three participants with post-acute stroke performed ∼80 reaching movement tests during 4 weeks of training with the ArmeoSpring exoskeleton. All participants showed improvements in end-effector performance, as measured by movement smoothness. Four ArmeoSpring angles, shoulder horizontal (SH) rotation, shoulder elevation (SE), elbow rotation, and forearm rotation, were recorded and analyzed. We first characterized healthy joint coordination patterns by performing a sparse principal component analysis on these four joint velocities recorded during reaching tests performed by young control participants. We found that two dominant joint correlations [SH with elbow rotation and SE with forearm rotation] explained over 95% of variance of joint velocity data. We identified two clusters of stroke participants by comparing the evolution of these two correlations in all tests. In the “Recoverer” cluster (N = 19), both joint correlations converged toward the respective correlations for control participants. Thus, Recoverers relearned how to generate smooth end-effector movements while developing joint movement patterns similar to those of control participants. In the “Compensator” cluster (N = 34), at least one of the two joint correlations diverged from the corresponding correlation of control participants. Compensators relearned how to generate smooth end-effector movements by discovering various new compensatory movement patterns dissimilar to those of control participants. New compensatory patterns included atypical decoupling of the SE and forearm joints, and atypical coupling of the SH rotation and elbow joints. There was no difference in clinical impairment level between the two groups either at the onset or at the end of training as assessed with the Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer scale. However, at the start of training, the Recoverers showed significantly faster improvements in end-effector movement smoothness than the Compensators. Our analysis can be used to inform neurorehabilitation clinicians on how to provide movement feedback during practice and suggest avenues for refining exoskeleton robot therapy to reduce compensatory patterns.</p>

<p>Meditation is an umbrella term for a number of mental training practices designed to improve the monitoring and regulation of attention and emotion. Some forms of meditation are now being used for clinical intervention. To accompany the increased clinical interest in meditation, research investigating the neural basis of these practices is needed. A central hypothesis of contemplative neuroscience is that meditative states, which are unique on a phenomenological level, differ on a neurophysiological level. To identify the electrophysiological correlates of meditation practice, the electrical brain activity of highly skilled meditators engaging in one of six meditation styles (shamatha, vipassana, zazen, dzogchen, tonglen, and visualization) was recorded. A mind-wandering task served as a control. Lempel–Ziv complexity showed differences in nonlinear brain dynamics (entropy) during meditation compared with mind wandering, suggesting that meditation, regardless of practice, affects neural complexity. In contrast, there were no differences in power spectra at six different frequency bands, likely due to the fact that participants engaged in different meditation practices. Finally, exploratory analyses suggest neurological differences among meditation practices. These findings highlight the importance of studying the electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of different meditative practices.</p>

<p>Introduction: Pathological tremor is the most common motor disorder in adults and characterized by involuntary, rhythmic muscular contraction leading to shaking movements in one or more parts of the body. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) and biomechanical loading using wearable orthoses have emerged as effective and non-invasive methods for tremor suppression. A variety of upper-limb orthoses for tremor suppression have been introduced; however, a systematic review of the mechanical design, algorithms for tremor extraction, and the experimental design is still missing.</p><p>Methods: To address this gap, we applied a standard systematic review methodology to conduct a literature search in the PubMed and PMC databases. Inclusion criteria and full-text access eligibility were used to filter the studies from the search results. Subsequently, we extracted relevant information, such as suppression mechanism, system weights, degrees of freedom (DOF), algorithms for tremor estimation, experimental settings, and the efficacy.</p><p>Results: The results show that the majority of tremor-suppression orthoses are active with 47% prevalence. Active orthoses are also the heaviest with an average weight of 561 ± 467 g, followed by semi-active 486 ± 395 g, and passive orthoses 191 ± 137 g. Most of the orthoses only support one DOF (54.5%). Two-DOF and three-DOF orthoses account for 33 and 18%, respectively. The average efficacy of tremor suppression using wearable orthoses is 83 ± 13%. Active orthoses are the most efficient with an average efficacy of 83 ± 8%, following by the semi-active 77 ± 19%, and passive orthoses 75 ± 12%. Among different experimental setups, bench testing shows the highest efficacy at 95 ± 5%, this value dropped to 86 ± 8% when evaluating with tremor-affected subjects. The majority of the orthoses (92%) measured voluntary and/or tremorous motions using biomechanical sensors (e.g., IMU, force sensor). Only one system was found to utilize EMG for tremor extraction.</p><p>Conclusions: Our review showed an improvement in efficacy of using robotic orthoses in tremor suppression. However, significant challenges for the translations of these systems into clinical or home use remain unsolved. Future challenges include improving the wearability of the orthoses (e.g., lightweight, aesthetic, and soft structure), and user control interfaces (i.e., neural machine interface). We also suggest addressing non-technical challenges (e.g., regulatory compliance, insurance reimbursement) to make the technology more accessible.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.578644">What to Expect When the Unexpected Becomes Expected: Harmonic Surprise and Preference Over Time in Popular Music</a></h4>

<p>Previous work demonstrates that music with more surprising chords tends to be perceived as more enjoyable than music with more conventional harmonic structures. In that work, harmonic surprise was computed based upon a static distribution of chords. This would assume that harmonic surprise is constant over time, and the effect of harmonic surprise on music preference is similarly static. In this study we assess that assumption and establish that the relationship between harmonic surprise (as measured according to a specific time period) and music preference is not constant as time goes on. Analyses of harmonic surprise and preference from 1958 to 1991 showed increased harmonic surprise over time, and that this increase was significantly more pronounced in preferred songs. Separate analyses showed similar increases over the years from 2000 to 2019. As such, these findings provide evidence that the human perception of tonality is influenced by exposure. Baseline harmonic expectations that were developed through listening to the music of “yesterday” are violated in the music of “today,” leading to preference. Then, once the music of “today” provides the baseline expectations for the music of “tomorrow,” more pronounced violations—and with them, higher harmonic surprise values—become associated with preference formation. We call this phenomenon the “Inflationary-Surprise Hypothesis.” Support for this hypothesis could impact the understanding of how the perception of tonality, and other statistical regularities, are developed in the human brain.</p>

<p>Neural circuits in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) play a pivotal role in the learning and memory formation, and processing of emotionally salient experiences, particularly aversive ones. A diverse population of GABAergic neurons present in the BLA orchestrate local circuits to mediate emotional memory functions. Targeted manipulation of GABAergic neuronal subtypes has shed light on cell-type specific functional roles in the fear learning and memory, revealing organizing principles for the operation of inhibitory circuit motifs in the BLA.</p>

<p>The role of the dopaminergic pathway in general anesthesia and its potential mechanisms are still unknown. In this study, we usedc-Fos staining combined with calcium fiber photometry recording to explore the activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons(VTA-DA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons during sevoflurane anesthesia. A genetically encoded dopamine (DA) sensor was used to investigate thefunction of the NAc in sevoflurane anesthesia. Chemogenetics and optogenetics were used to explore the role of the VTA-DA in sevofluraneanesthesia. Electroencephalogram (EEG) spectra, time of loss of righting reflex (LORR) and recovery of righting reflex (RORR) were recorded asassessment indicators. We found that VTA-DA and NAc neurons were inhibited during the induction period and were activated during the recoveryperiod of sevoflurane anesthesia. The fluorescence signals of dopamine decreased in the induction of and increased in the emergence from sevoflurane anesthesia.Activation of VTA-DA and the VTA<sup>DA</sup>-NAc pathway delayed the induction and facilitated the emergence accompanying with thereduction of delta band and the augmentation of the gamma band. These data demonstrate that VTA-DA neurons play a critical role in modulating sevofluraneanesthesia via the VTA<sup>DA</sup>-NAc pathway.</p>

<p>Odor stimuli consist of thousands of possible molecules, each molecule with many different properties, each property a dimension of the stimulus. Processing these high dimensional stimuli would appear to require many stages in the brain to reach odor perception, yet, in mammals, after the sensory receptors this is accomplished through only two regions, the olfactory bulb and olfactory cortex. We take a first step toward a fundamental understanding by identifying the sequence of local operations carried out by microcircuits in the pathway. Parallel research provided strong evidence that processed odor information is spatial representations of odor molecules that constitute odor images in the olfactory bulb and odor objects in olfactory cortex. Paleontology provides a unique advantage with evolutionary insights providing evidence that the basic architecture of the olfactory pathway almost from the start ∼330 million years ago (mya) has included an overwhelming input from olfactory sensory neurons combined with a large olfactory bulb and olfactory cortex to process that input, driven by olfactory receptor gene duplications. We identify a sequence of over 20 microcircuits that are involved, and expand on results of research on several microcircuits that give the best insights thus far into the nature of the high dimensional processing.</p>

<p>Small alterations in the level of extracellular H<sup>+</sup> can profoundly alter neuronal activity throughout the nervous system. In this study, self-referencing H<sup>+</sup>-selective microelectrodes were used to examine extracellular H<sup>+</sup> fluxes from individual astrocytes. Activation of astrocytes cultured from mouse hippocampus and rat cortex with extracellular ATP produced a pronounced increase in extracellular H<sup>+</sup> flux. The ATP-elicited increase in H<sup>+</sup> flux appeared to be independent of bicarbonate transport, as ATP increased H<sup>+</sup> flux regardless of whether the primary extracellular pH buffer was 26 mM bicarbonate or 1 mM HEPES, and persisted when atmospheric levels of CO<sub>2</sub> were replaced by oxygen. Adenosine failed to elicit any change in extracellular H<sup>+</sup> fluxes, and ATP-mediated increases in H<sup>+</sup> flux were inhibited by the P2 inhibitors suramin and PPADS suggesting direct activation of ATP receptors. Extracellular ATP also induced an intracellular rise in calcium in cultured astrocytes, and ATP-induced rises in both calcium and H<sup>+</sup> efflux were significantly attenuated when calcium re-loading into the endoplasmic reticulum was inhibited by thapsigargin. Replacement of extracellular sodium with choline did not significantly reduce the size of the ATP-induced increases in H<sup>+</sup> flux, and the increases in H<sup>+</sup> flux were not significantly affected by addition of EIPA, suggesting little involvement of Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchangers in ATP-elicited increases in H<sup>+</sup> flux. Given the high sensitivity of voltage-sensitive calcium channels on neurons to small changes in levels of free H<sup>+</sup>, we hypothesize that the ATP-mediated extrusion of H<sup>+</sup> from astrocytes may play a key role in regulating signaling at synapses within the nervous system.</p>

<p>Although mice locate resources using turbulent airborne odor plumes, the stochasticity and intermittency of fluctuating plumes create challenges for interpreting odor cues in natural environments. Population activity within the olfactory bulb (OB) is thought to process this complex spatial and temporal information, but how plume dynamics impact odor representation in this early stage of the mouse olfactory system is unknown. Limitations in odor detection technology have made it difficult to measure plume fluctuations while simultaneously recording from the mouse's brain. Thus, previous studies have measured OB activity following controlled odor pulses of varying profiles or frequencies, but this approach only captures a subset of features found within olfactory plumes. Adequately sampling this feature space is difficult given a lack of knowledge regarding which features the brain extracts during exposure to natural olfactory scenes. Here we measured OB responses to naturally fluctuating odor plumes using a miniature, adapted odor sensor combined with wide-field GCaMP6f signaling from the dendrites of mitral and tufted (MT) cells imaged in olfactory glomeruli of head-fixed mice. We precisely tracked plume dynamics and imaged glomerular responses to this fluctuating input, while varying flow conditions across a range of ethologically-relevant values. We found that a consistent portion of MT activity in glomeruli follows odor concentration dynamics, and the strongest responding glomeruli are the best at following fluctuations within odor plumes. Further, the reliability and average response magnitude of glomerular populations of MT cells are affected by the flow condition in which the animal samples the plume, with the fidelity of plume following by MT cells increasing in conditions of higher flow velocity where odor dynamics result in intermittent whiffs of stronger concentration. Thus, the flow environment in which an animal encounters an odor has a large-scale impact on the temporal representation of an odor plume in the OB. Additionally, across flow conditions odor dynamics are a major driver of activity in many glomerular networks. Taken together, these data demonstrate that plume dynamics structure olfactory representations in the first stage of odor processing in the mouse olfactory system.</p>

<p>The transcription factor Nurr1 is a member of the steroid hormone nuclear receptor superfamily. Ablation of Nurr1 expression arrests mesencephalic dopamine neuron differentiation while attenuation of Nurr1 in the subiculum and hippocampus impairs learning and memory. Additionally, reduced Nurr1 expression has been reported in patients with Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. In order to better understand the overall function of Nurr1 in the brain, quantitative immunohistochemistry was used to measure cellular Nurr1 protein expression, across Nurr1 immunoreactive neuronal populations. Additionally, neuronal Nurr1 expression levels were compared between different brain regions in wild-type mice (+/+) and Nurr1 heterozygous mice (+/−). Regional Nurr1 protein was also investigated at various time points after a seizure induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). Nurr1 protein is expressed in various regions throughout the brain, however, a wide range of Nurr1 expression levels were observed among various neuronal populations. Neurons in the parietal and temporal cortex (secondary somatosensory, insular, auditory, and temporal association cortex) had the highest relative Nurr1 expression (100%) followed closely by the claustrum/dorsal endopiriform cortex (85%) and then subiculum (76%). Lower Nurr1 protein levels were found in neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area (39%) followed by CA1 (25%) and CA3 (19%) of the hippocampus. Additionally, in the parietal and temporal cortex, two distinct populations of high and medium Nurr1 expressing neurons were observed. Comparisons between +/− and +/+ mice revealed Nurr1 protein was reduced in +/− mice by 27% in the parietal/temporal cortex, 49% in the claustrum/dorsal endopiriform cortex, 25% in the subiculum, 33% in substantia nigra pars compacta, 22% in ventral tegmental area, and 21% in CA1 region of the hippocampus. Based on these data, regional mechanisms appear to exist which can compensate for a loss of a Nurr1 allele. Following a single PTZ-induced seizure, Nurr1 protein in the dentate gyrus peaked around 2 h and returned to baseline by 8 h. Since altered Nurr1 expression has been implicated in neurologic disorders and Nurr1 agonists have showed protective effects, understanding regional protein expression of Nurr1, therefore, is necessary to understand how changes in Nurr1 expression can alter brain function.</p>

<p>The liver-derived hormone hepcidin, a member of the defensin family of antimicrobial peptides, plays an important role in host defense and innate immunity due to its broad antibacterial and antiviral properties. Ferritin, an iron storage protein is often associated with iron deficiency, hypoferritinemia, hypoxia, and immune complications, which are all significant concerns for systemic infection in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Down’s syndrome (DS) dementia. Serum and post-mortem brain samples were collected from AD, DS and age-matched control subjects. Serum samples were analyzed with ELISA for ferritin, hepcidin and IL-6. Additionally, post-mortem brain sections were assessed by immunohistochemistry for iron-related and inflammatory proteins. A significant increase in serum hepcidin levels was found in DS, compared to controls and AD subjects (p &lt; 0.0001). Hepcidin protein was visible in the epithelial cells of choroid plexus, meningeal macrophages and in the astrocytes close to the endothelium of blood vessels. Hepcidin co-localized with IL-6, indicating its anti-inflammatory properties. We found significant correlation between hypoferritinemia and elevated levels of serum hepcidin in AD and DS. Hepcidin can be transported via macrophages and the majority of the vesicular hepcidin enters the brain via a compromised blood brain barrier (BBB). Our findings provide further insight into the molecular implications of the altered iron metabolism in acute inflammation, and can aid towards the development of preventive strategies and novel treatments in the fight against neuroinflammation.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.626127">Delirium: A Marker of Vulnerability in Older People</a></h4>

<p>Delirium is an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome and one of the most common presenting symptoms of acute medical illnesses in older people. Delirium can be triggered by a single cause, but in most cases, it is multifactorial as it depends on the interaction between predisposing and precipitating factors. Delirium is highly prevalent in older patients across various settings of care and correlates with an increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes. Several pathophysiological mechanisms may contribute to its onset, including neurotransmitter imbalance, neuroinflammation, altered brain metabolism, and impaired neuronal network connectivity. Several screening and diagnostic tools for delirium exist, but they are unfortunately underutilized. Additionally, the diagnosis of delirium superimposed on dementia poses a formidable challenge – especially if dementia is severe. Non-pharmacological approaches for the prevention and multidomain interventions for the treatment of delirium are recommended, given that there is currently no robust evidence of drugs that can prevent or resolve delirium. This article aims to review the current understanding about delirium in older people. To achieve this goal, we will describe the epidemiology and outcomes of the syndrome, the pathophysiological mechanisms that are supposed to be involved, the most commonly used tools for screening and diagnosis, and prevention strategies and treatments recommended. This review is intended as a brief guide for clinicians in hospital wards to improve their knowledge and practice. At the end of the article, we propose an approach to improve the quality of care provided to older patients throughout a systematic detection of delirium.</p>

Background<p>Accumulating evidence has revealed that peripheral immunity is involved in Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the results regarding the percentage of T-cell subsets are inconsistent, and the changes of immunoglobins levels have been seldom studied in PD patients.</p>Methods<p>Serum levels of the percentage of T-cell subsets and immunoglobulins were measured in 761 PD patients and 761 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. The correlations between the variables of peripheral immune activation (PIA) and the clinical characteristics of PD were analyzed using correlation analysis.</p>Results<p>The pooled results showed that PD patients had higher proportional levels of CD3+ T and CD4+ T lymphocytes than healthy controls. CD8+ T cell percentages were similar in PD patients and controls, and the CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly higher in the PD population. No significant differences in IgG, IgA, or IgM levels between these two groups were found. CD4+ T cell percentage was inversely correlated with the H&amp;Y stage, and IgG level was positively correlated with disease duration and UPDRS part III. Subgroup analyses showed that these associations existed in female patients, but not in male patients.</p>Conclusion<p>The enhanced immune activation in the peripheral system is indicated in PD, and dynamic alterations in CD4+ T cell percentage and IgG level suggest an active role for peripheral immunity in the disease progression, especially in female PD patients.</p>

ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters constitute the largest family of primary active transporters involved in a multitude of physiological processes and human diseases. Despite considerable efforts, it remains unclear how ABC transporters harness the chemical energy of ATP to drive substrate transport across cell membranes. Here, by random nonstandard peptide integrated discovery (RaPID), we leveraged combinatorial macrocyclic peptides that target a heterodimeric ABC transport complex and explore fundamental principles of the substrate translocation cycle. High-affinity peptidic macrocycles bind conformationally selective and display potent multimode inhibitory effects. The macrocycles block the transporter either before or after unidirectional substrate export along a single conformational switch induced by ATP binding. Our study reveals mechanistic principles of ATP binding, conformational switching, and energy transduction for substrate transport of ABC export systems. We highlight the potential of <i>de novo</i> macrocycles as effective inhibitors for membrane proteins implicated in multidrug resistance, providing avenues for the next-generation of pharmaceuticals.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65715">Epigenetic analysis of Paget's disease of bone identifies differentially methylated loci that predict disease status</a></h4>

Paget's Disease of Bone (PDB) is characterized by focal increases in disorganized bone remodeling. This study aims to characterize PDB associated changes in DNA methylation profiles in patients' blood. Meta-analysis of data from the discovery and cross-validation set, each comprising of 116 PDB cases and 130 controls, revealed significant differences in DNA methylation at 14 CpG sites, 4 CpG islands, and 6 gene-body regions. These loci, including two characterized as functional through expression quantitative trait-methylation (eQTM) analysis, were associated with functions related to osteoclast differentiation, mechanical loading, immune function, and viral infection. A multivariate classifier based on discovery samples was found to discriminate PDB cases and controls from the cross-validation with a sensitivity of 0.84, specificity of 0.81, and an area under curve of 92.8%. In conclusion, this study has shown for the first time that epigenetic factors contribute to the pathogenesis of PDB and may offer diagnostic markers for prediction of the disease.

Self-specific CD8+ T cells can escape clonal deletion, but the properties and capabilities of such cells in a physiological setting are unclear. We characterized polyclonal CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for the melanocyte antigen tyrosinase-related protein 2 (Trp2) in mice expressing or lacking this enzyme (due to deficiency in <i>Dct</i>, which encodes Trp2). Phenotypic and gene expression profiles of pre-immune Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells were similar; the size of this population was only slightly reduced in wild-type (WT) compared to <i>Dct</i>-deficient (<i>Dct</i><sup>-/-</sup>) mice. Despite comparable initial responses to Trp2 immunization, WT Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells showed blunted expansion and less readily differentiated into a CD25+ proliferative population. Functional self-tolerance clearly emerged when assessing immunopathology: adoptively transferred WT Trp2/K<sup>b</sup>-specific cells mediated vitiligo much less efficiently. Hence, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell self-specificity is poorly predicted by precursor frequency, phenotype or even initial responsiveness, while deficient activation-induced CD25 expression and other gene expression characteristics may help to identify functionally tolerant cells.

IL-33 is an alarmin required for resistance to the parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>, but its role in innate resistance to this organism is unclear. Infection with <i>T. gondii</i> promotes increased stromal cell expression of IL-33 and levels of parasite replication correlate with release of IL-33 in affected tissues. In response to infection, a subset of innate lymphoid cells (ILC) emerges composed of IL-33R<sup>+</sup> NK cells and ILC1s. In <i>Rag1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice, where NK cells and ILC1 production of IFN-g mediates innate resistance to <i>T. gondii</i>, the loss of the IL-33R resulted in reduced ILC responses and increased parasite replication. Furthermore, administration of IL-33 to <i>Rag1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice resulted in a marked decrease in parasite burden, increased production of IFN-g and the recruitment and expansion of inflammatory monocytes associated with parasite control. These protective effects of exogenous IL-33 were dependent on endogenous IL-12p40 and the ability of IL-33 to enhance ILC production of IFN-g. These results highlight that IL-33 synergizes with IL-12 to promote ILC-mediated resistance to <i>T. gondii</i>.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64811">The transcription factor Rreb1 regulates epithelial architecture, invasiveness and vasculogenesis in early mouse embryos</a></h4>

Ras-responsive element-binding protein 1 (Rreb1) is a zinc-finger transcription factor acting downstream of RAS signaling. <i>Rreb1</i> has been implicated in cancer and Noonan-like RASopathies. However, little is known about its role in mammalian non-disease states. Here, we show that Rreb1 is essential for mouse embryonic development. Loss of <i>Rreb1</i> led to a reduction in the expression of vasculogenic factors, cardiovascular defects and embryonic lethality. During gastrulation, the absence of <i>Rreb1</i> also resulted in the upregulation of cytoskeleton-associated genes, a change in the organization of F-ACTIN and adherens junctions within the pluripotent epiblast, and perturbed epithelial architecture. Moreover, <i>Rreb1<sup> </sup></i>mutant cells ectopically exited the epiblast epithelium through the underlying basement membrane, paralleling cell behaviors observed during metastasis. Thus, disentangling the function of Rreb1 in development should shed light on its role in cancer and other diseases involving loss of epithelial integrity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64056">Molecular insights into substrate recognition and discrimination by the N-terminal domain of Lon AAA+ protease</a></h4>

The Lon AAA+ protease (LonA) is a ubiquitous ATP-dependent proteolytic machine, which selectively degrades damaged proteins or native proteins carrying exposed motifs (degrons). Here we characterize the structural basis for substrate recognition and discrimination by the N-terminal domain (NTD) of LonA. The results reveal that the six NTDs are attached to the hexameric LonA chamber by flexible linkers such that the formers tumble independently of the latter. Further spectral analyses show that the NTD selectively interacts with unfolded proteins, protein aggregates, and degron-tagged proteins by two hydrophobic patches of its N-lobe, but not intrinsically disordered substrate, α-casein. Moreover, the NTD selectively binds to protein substrates when they are thermally induced to adopt unfolded conformations. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that NTDs enable LonA to perform protein quality control to selectively degrade proteins in damaged states and suggest that substrate discrimination and selective degradation by LonA are mediated by multiple NTD interactions.

High dimensional cytometry is an innovative tool for immune monitoring in health and disease, it has provided novel insight into the underlying biology as well as biomarkers for a variety of diseases. However, the analysis of large multiparametric datasets usually requires specialist computational knowledge. Here we describe <i>ImmunoCluster (https://github.com/kordastilab/ImmunoCluster) </i>an R package for immune profiling cellular heterogeneity in high dimensional liquid and imaging mass cytometry, and flow cytometry data, designed to facilitate computational analysis by a non-specialist. The analysis framework implemented within <i>ImmunoCluster </i>is readily scalable to millions of cells and provides a variety of visualization and analytical approaches, as well as a rich array of plotting tools that can be tailored to users' needs. The protocol consists of three core computational stages: 1, data import and quality control; 2, dimensionality reduction and unsupervised clustering; and 3, annotation and differential testing, all contained within an R-based open-source framework.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62825">Response-based outcome predictions and confidence regulate feedback processing and learning</a></h4>

Influential theories emphasize the importance of predictions in learning: we learn from feedback to the extent that it is surprising, and thus conveys new information. Here we explore the hypothesis that surprise depends not only on comparing current events to past experience, but also on online evaluation of performance via internal monitoring. Specifically, we propose that people leverage insights from response-based performance monitoring – outcome predictions and confidence – to control learning from feedback. In line with predictions from a Bayesian inference model, we find that people who are better at calibrating their confidence to the precision of their outcome predictions learn more quickly. Further in line with our proposal, EEG signatures of feedback processing are sensitive to the accuracy of, and confidence in, post-response outcome predictions. Taken together, our results suggest that online predictions and confidence serve to calibrate neural error signals to improve the efficiency of learning.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62524">Flagellar energetics from high-resolution imaging of beating patterns in tethered mouse sperm</a></h4>

We demonstrate a technique for investigating the energetics of flagella or cilia. We record the planar beating of tethered mouse sperm at high-resolution. Beating waveforms are reconstructed using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition of the centerline tangent-angle profiles. Energy conservation is employed to obtain the mechanical power exerted by the dynein motors from the observed kinematics. A large proportion of the mechanical power exerted by the dynein motors is dissipated internally by the motors themselves. There could also be significant dissipation within the passive structures of the flagellum. The total internal dissipation is considerably greater than the hydrodynamic dissipation in the aqueous medium outside. The net power input from the dynein motors in sperm from <i>Crisp2</i>-knockout mice is significantly smaller than in wildtype samples, indicating that ion-channel regulation by cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs) controls energy flows powering the axoneme.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56481">EEG-based detection of the locus of auditory attention with convolutional neural networks</a></h4>

In a multi-speaker scenario, the human auditory system is able to attend to one particular speaker of interest and ignore the others. It has been demonstrated that it is possible to use electroencephalography (EEG) signals to infer to which speaker someone is attending by relating the neural activity to the speech signals. However, classifying auditory attention within a short time interval remains the main challenge. We present a convolutional neural network-based approach to extract the locus of auditory attention (left/right) without knowledge of the speech envelopes. Our results show that it is possible to decode the locus of attention within 1 to 2 s, with a median accuracy of around 81%. These results are promising for neuro-steered noise suppression in hearing aids, in particular in scenarios where per-speaker envelopes are unavailable.

Temperament is an innate, stable predisposition towards particular emotional and behavioral responses. In humans, certain temperaments are associated with a heightened risk of developing anxiety later in life. Non-human animals, including rodents, also exhibit innate, stable dispositions; these are referred to as behavioral phenotypes. The interaction between behavioral phenotype and early life adverse events is critical for the development of maladaptive anxiety. Rodent studies of typically developing animals have identified a number of mechanisms that protect against aversive experiences in early life. One such mechanism is an early life quiescence of threat learning, which protects against the effects of stress and facilitates safety and attachment learning. However, little is known about the factors that alleviate the effects of early life aversive events on phenotypes vulnerable to pathological anxiety. Here, we examined threat learning and the stress response in selectively-bred infant rats that show an anxiety-like phenotype relative to typically developing animals. We investigated the potential roles of maternal presence and the anxiolytic neurotrophic factor fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) in regulating threat learning and the stress response in infant anxiety-like phenotype animals. We observed that rats selectively-bred for anxiety-like behaviors could acquire conditioned freezing earlier in life than typically developing animals. FGF2 administration on postnatal day 1 (PND 1) and maternal presence during threat conditioning were both capable of suppressing this early emergence of conditioned freezing. However, neither FGF2 nor maternal presence during threat conditioning were associated with reduced corticosterone levels during threat conditioning. Our results suggest that although an anxiety-like phenotype may be associated with early threat learning, environmental factors (such as maternal presence) and pharmacological intervention (such as modulation of the FGF2 system) may be capable of counteracting that early aversive learning. Interventions in vulnerable infants may thus decrease the impact of aversive events.

The aim of this study was to test whether post-stroke oral administration of a small molecule p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) modulator (LM11A-31) can augment neuronal survival and improve recovery in a mouse model of stroke. Mice were administered LM11A-31 for up to 12 weeks, beginning 1 week after stroke. Metabolomic analysis revealed that after 2 weeks of daily treatment, mice that received LM11A-31 were distinct from vehicle treated mice by principal component analysis, and had higher levels of glutamate, serotonin, acetylcholine, and dopamine in their ipsilateral hemisphere. LM11A-31 treatment also improved redox homeostasis by restoring reduced glutathione. It also offset a stroke induced reduction in glycolysis by increasing acetyl-CoA. There was no effect on cytokine levels in the infarct. At 13 weeks following stroke, adaptive immune cell infiltration in the infarct was unchanged in LM11A-31 treated mice, indicating that LM11A-31 does not alter the chronic inflammatory response to stroke at the site of the infarct. However, LM11A-31 treated mice had less brain atrophy, neurodegeneration, tau pathology, and microglial activation in other regions of the ipsilateral hemisphere. These findings correlated with improved recovery of motor function on a ladder test, improved sensorimotor and cognitive abilities on a nesting test, and less impulsivity in an open field test. These data support small molecule modulation of the p75 neurotrophin receptor for preserving neuronal health and function during stroke recovery.

The process of deciding what a sensory stimulus is and how to act on that decision seem distinct, yet they appear to be coupled at the neural level. Neurons in the parietal cortex of monkeys represent both the integration of evidence toward a decision and the behavior used to report the decision. This raises the possibility that monkeys evaluate sensory percepts in terms of their motor affordances rather than their abstract identity. It is not clear how monkeys can evaluate sensory percepts when unaware of the motor actions they bear upon. We investigated this by training monkeys to make perceptual decisions about the direction of motion in a noisy random-dot display. They learned to associate leftward and rightward with two colors, and to select from a pair of colored targets, which were displayed after the motion at unpredictable locations. Surprisingly we found that monkeys postpone decision formation until the pertinent motor actions are revealed. Neurons in parietal cortex represent the accumulation of evidence sampled from short term memory of the motion display. The findings demonstrate that abstract decisions are framed in terms of their motor affordances and highlight the capacity for integration of evidence from memory.

Classical views suggest that experienced affect is related to a specific bodily response (Fingerprint hypothesis), whereas recent perspectives challenge this view postulating that similar affective experiences rather evoke different physiological responses. To further advance this debate in the field, we used representational similarity analysis to investigate the correspondence between subjective affect (arousal and valence ratings) and physiological reactions (skin conductance response [SCR], startle blink response, heart rate and corrugator activity) across various emotion induction contexts (picture viewing task, sound listening task and imagery task). Significant similarities were exclusively observed between SCR and arousal in the picture viewing task. However, none of the other physiological measures showed a significant relation with valence and arousal ratings in any of the tasks. These findings tend to support the populations hypothesis, suggesting that there is no clear match between the evoked physiological responses and the experienced subjective affect between individuals.

Pupil size is a commonly used proxy for waking brain states such as arousal, and has been related to activity modulations in cortical sensory areas. Here, we asked whether the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), which provides sensory input to the visual cortex, is modulated by pupil-indexed arousal. Observing that the pupil size oscillates at multiple timescales, we developed a method to show that the spiking mode of the dLGN is predicted by pupil size oscillations over several of these timescales. Overall, we found that tonic spikes preferentially occurred during pupil dilation, while bursts occurred during contraction. These preferences could not be explained solely by pupil size per se or by the locomotion of the animal, and were also present during periods of stimulus viewing. We conclude that dLGN spiking activity is modulated by pupil-indexed arousal processes on various timescales, influencing the mode in which sensory signals are passed on to the cortex.

Long-term alcohol use results in behavioral deficits including impaired working memory, elevated anxiety, and blunted inhibitory control that are associated with prefrontal cortical (PFC) dysfunction. Preclinical observations demonstrate multiple impairments in GABAergic neurotransmission onto deep-layer principal cells (PCs) in prelimbic cortex that suggest dependence-related cortical dysfunction is the product of elevated excitability in these cells. Despite accumulating evidence showing alcohol-induced changes in interneuron signaling onto PCs differ between sexes, there is limited data explicitly evaluating sex-specific ethanol effects on excitatory signaling onto deep-layer PCs that may further contribute to deficits in PFC-dependent behaviors. To address this, we conducted electrophysiological and behavioral tests in both male and female Sprague-Dawley rats to evaluate the effects of chronic ethanol exposure. Among our observations, we report a marked enhancement in glutamatergic signaling onto deep-layer PCs in male, but not female, rats after alcohol exposure. This phenomenon was furthermore specific to a sub-class of PC, sub-cortically projecting Type-A cells, and coincided with enhanced anxiety-like behavior, but no observable deficit in working memory. In contrast, female rats displayed an alcohol-induced facilitation in working memory performance with no change in expression of anxiety-like behavior. Together, these results suggest fundamental differences in alcohol effects on cell activity, cortical sub-circuits, and PFC-dependent behaviors across male and female rats.

Background: Non-specific low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common chronic pain conditions and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are known mediators for chronicity of LBP. Sensitization of dorsal horn neurons (DHNs) is a significant element that contributes to chronic LBP. Repeated restraint stress in adult animals is known to cause manifest DHN sensitization when combined with a short-lasting nociceptive input. Objective: In this study, we investigated whether repeated restraint stress in early adolescence leads to a long-term sensitization of DHNs and if an additional mild-nociceptive input by intramuscular nerve growth factor (NGF) leads to further sensitization. Methods: Adolescent Wistar rats were stressed repeatedly in a narrow plastic restrainer, 1 hour per day for 12 consecutive days. Control animals were handled but not restrained. In adulthood, rats were treated with intramuscular injections of saline or NGF (short-lasting mild-nociceptive input) into the lumbar multifidus muscle (L5). Behavioral tests for pain sensitivity were performed before, after stress and inconjunction with intramuscular injections. Rats were transcardially perfused and immunohistochemistry was performed on lumbar (L2) spinal segments. Results: Adolescent restraint stress significantly lowered the low back pressure pain threshold (PPT) immediately after the stress (p&lt;0.0001) and was maintained throughout adulthood (p&lt;0.05). Additionally, paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) was significantly lowered by stress (p&lt;0.0001) but normalized towards adulthood. An NGF injection in adulthood in previously stressed animals lowered the PPT (Cohen d=0.87) and increased microglia marker (Iba-1) immunoreactive area in the superficial DHN (p&lt;0.01) with a trend in increased feret diameter of the immunoreactive cell (p=0.05). Conclusions: Our adolescence stress model induced behavioral signs of sensitization and enhanced sensitivity to further sensitization and dorsal horn microglia activation by subsequent mild nociceptive input (NGF injection). These findings help to understand certain aspects of how adolescent stress might predispose to exacerbation of pain with an additional insult.

We previously developed single App knock-in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), harboring the Swedish and Beyreuther/Iberian mutations with or without the Arctic mutation (AppNL-G-F and AppNL-F mice). These models showed amyloid peptide (A{beta}) pathology, neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment in an age-dependent manner. The former line exhibits extensive pathology as early as 6 months but is unsuitable for investigating A{beta} metabolism and clearance because the Arctic mutation renders A{beta} resistant to proteolytic degradation and prone to aggregation. In particular, it is inapplicable to preclinical immunotherapy studies due to its discrete affinity for anti-A{beta} antibodies. The weakness of the latter model is that it may take as long as 18 months for the pathology to become prominent. We have thus generated a new model that exhibits early deposition of wild-type human A{beta} by crossbreeding the AppNL-F line with the Psen1P117L/WT line. We show that the effects of the pathogenic mutations in the App and Psen1 genes are additive or synergistic. This new mouse model showed more cored plaque pathology and neuroinflammation than AppNL-G-F mice and will help accelerate the development of disease-modifying therapies to treat preclinical AD.

Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by expansion of the trinucleotide repeat region within the ATXN3/MJD gene. Mutation of ATXN3 causes formation of neurotoxic ataxin-3 protein aggregates, neurodegeneration and motor deficits. Here we investigated the therapeutic potential of sodium butyrate (SB), the sodium salt of butyric acid, a metabolite naturally produced by gut microbiota, on cultured SH-SY5Y cells and transgenic zebrafish expressing human ataxin-3 containing 84 glutamine (Q) residues to model MJD. MJD SH-SY5Y cells were found to contain ataxin-3 oligomeric species and protein aggregates. Interestingly, treatment with SB decreased the size of detergent-insoluble ataxin-3 aggregates in vitro. Further investigation revealed that SB treatment increased activity of the autophagy protein quality control pathway in the MJD cells and decreased presence of ataxin-3 oligomers in an autophagy-dependent manner. Treatment with SB was also beneficial in vivo through induction of autophagy and improving swimming performance in transgenic MJD zebrafish. Co-treating the MJD zebrafish with SB and chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, prevented the beneficial effects of SB, suggesting that the improved swimming performance was autophagy-dependent . Furthermore, intraperitoneal injection of SB to wild type mice resulted in increased levels of neuronal LC3B levels, indicating induction of autophagy within the brain. Collectively, our findings suggest that SB can induce activity of the autophagy pathway and can produce beneficial effects in vitro and in vivo. We propose that treatment with sodium butyrate warrants further investigation for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases underpinned by proteinopathy mechanisms, including MJD.

Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), a common drug-resistant epilepsy in adults, is primarily a limbic network disorder associated with predominant unilateral hippocampal pathology. Structural MRI has provided an in vivo window into whole-brain grey matter pathology in TLE relative to controls, by either mapping (i) atypical inter-hemispheric asymmetry or (ii) regional atrophy. However, similarities and differences of both atypical asymmetry and regional atrophy measures have not been systematically investigated. Here, we addressed this gap using the multi-site ENIGMA-Epilepsy dataset comprising MRI brain morphological measures in 732 TLE patients and 1,418 healthy controls. We compared spatial distributions of grey matter asymmetry and atrophy in TLE, contextualized their topographies relative to spatial gradients in cortical microstructure and functional connectivity, and examined clinical associations using machine learning. We identified a marked divergence in the spatial distribution of atypical inter-hemispheric asymmetry and regional atrophy mapping. The former revealed a temporo-limbic disease signature while the latter showed diffuse and bilateral patterns. Our findings were robust across individual sites and patients. Cortical atrophy was significantly correlated with disease duration and age at seizure onset, while degrees of asymmetry did not show a significant relationship to these clinical variables. Our findings highlight that the mapping of atypical inter-hemispheric asymmetry and regional atrophy tap into two complementary aspects of TLE-related pathology, with the former revealing primary substrates in ipsilateral limbic circuits and the latter capturing bilateral disease effects. These findings refine our notion of the neuropathology of TLE and may inform future discovery and validation of complementary MRI biomarkers in TLE.

We show here that the dynamics of the synaptic scaffold molecule SAP102 are negatively regulated by JNK inhibition, that SAP102 is a direct phosphorylation target of JNK3, and that SAP102 regulation by JNK is restricted to neurons that harbour mature synapses. We further demonstrate that SAP102 and JNK3 cooperate in the regulated trafficking of kainate receptors to the cell membrane. Specifically, we observe that SAP102, JNK3, and the kainate receptor subunit GluK2 exhibit overlapping expression at synaptic sites, and that modulating JNK activity influences the surface expression of the kainate receptor subunit GluK2 in a neuronal context. We also show that SAP102 participates in this process in a JNK-dependent fashion. In summary, our data support a model in which JNK-mediated regulation of SAP102 influences the dynamic trafficking of kainate receptors to postsynaptic sites, and thus shed light on common pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the cognitive developmental defects associated with diverse mutations.

Alternative splicing of the gene MAPT produces several isoforms of tau protein. Overexpression of these isoforms is characteristic of tauopathies, which are currently untreatable neurodegenerative diseases. Though non-canonical functions of tau have drawn interest, the role of tau isoforms in these diseases has not been fully examined and may reveal new details of tau-driven pathology. In particular, tau has been shown to promote activation of transposable elements -- highly regulated nucleotide sequences that replicate throughout the genome and can promote immunologic responses and cellular stress. This study examined tau isoforms roles in promoting cell damage and dysregulation of genes and transposable elements at a family-specific and locus-specific level. We performed immunofluorescence, Western blot and cytotoxicity assays, along with paired-end RNA sequencing on differentiated SH-SY5Y cells infected with lentiviral constructs of tau isoforms and treated with amyloid-beta oligomers. Our transcriptomic findings were validated using publicly available RNA-sequencing data from Alzheimers disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and control human samples from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership for AD (AMP-AD). Significance for biochemical assays was determined using Wilcoxon ranked-sum tests and false discovery rate. Transcriptome analysis was conducted through DESeq2 and the TEToolkit suite available from the Hammell lab at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Our analyses show overexpression of different tau isoforms and their interactions with amyloid-beta in SH-SY5Y cells result in isoform-specific changes in the transcriptome, with locus-specific transposable element dysregulation patterns paralleling those seen in patients with Alzheimers disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. Locus-level transposable element expression showed increased dysregulation of L1 and Alu sites, which have been shown to drive pathology in other neurological diseases. We also demonstrated differences in rates of cell death in SH-SY5Y cells depending on tau isoform overexpression. These results demonstrate the importance of examining tau isoforms role in neurodegeneration and of further examining transposable element dysregulation in tauopathies.

Mutations of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are an important cause of inherited diseases that can severely affect the tissue's homeostasis and integrity. The m.3243A&gt;G mutation is the most commonly observed across mitochondrial disorders and is linked to multisystemic complications, including cognitive deficits. In line with in vitro experiments demonstrating the m.3243A&gt;G's negative impact on neuronal energy production and integrity, m.3243A&gt;G patients show cerebral gray matter tissue changes. However, its impact on the most neuron-dense, and therefore energy-consuming brain structure - the cerebellum - remains elusive. In this work, we used high resolution structural and functional data acquired using 7 Tesla MRI to characterize the neurodegenerative and functional signatures of the cerebellar cortex in m.3243A&gt;G patients. Our results reveal altered tissue integrity within distinct clusters across the cerebellar cortex, apparent by their significantly reduced volume and longitudinal relaxation rate compared to healthy controls, indicating macroscopic atrophy and microstructural pathology. Spatial characterization reveals that these changes occur especially in regions related to the frontoparietal brain network that is involved in information processing and selective attention. In addition, based on resting-state fMRI data, these clusters exhibit reduced functional connectivity to frontal and parietal cortical regions, especially in patients characterized by (i) a severe disease phenotype and (ii) reduced information processing speed and attention control. Combined with our previous work, these results provide crucial insights into the neuropathological changes and a solid base to guide longitudinal studies aimed to track disease progression.

Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) is a process by which neurons adjust synaptic strengths to compensate for various perturbations and which allows to stabilize neuronal activity. Yet, whether the highly diverse synapses harboring a neuron respond uniformly to a same perturbation is unclear and the underlying molecular determinants remain to be identified. Here, using patch-clamp recordings, immunolabeling and imaging approaches, we report that the ability of individual synapses to undergo HSP in response to activity-deprivation paradigms depends on the local expression of the spine apparatus related protein synaptopodin (SP) acting as a synaptic tag to promote AMPA receptor synaptic accumulation and spine growth. Gain and loss-of-function experiments indicate that this process relies on the local de-repression of SP translation by miR124 which supports both non-uniform and synapse-autonomous HSP induced by global or input-specific activity deprivation, respectively. Our findings uncover an unexpected synaptic-tagging mechanism for HSP, whose molecular actors are intriguingly shared with Hebbian plasticity and linked to multiple neurological diseases.

The neural circuits that support human cognition are a topic of enduring interest. Yet, the lack of tools available to map human brain circuits has precluded our ability to trace the human and non-human primate connectome. We harnessed high-resolution connectomic, anatomic, and transcriptomic data to investigate the evolution and development of frontal cortex circuitry. We applied machine learning to RNA sequencing data to find corresponding ages between humans and macaques and to compare the development of circuits across species. We transcriptionally defined neural circuits by testing for associations between gene expression and white matter maturation. We then considered transcriptional and structural growth to test whether frontal cortex circuit maturation is unusually extended in humans relative to other species. We also considered gene expression and high-resolution diffusion MR tractography of adult brains to test for cross-species variation in frontal cortex circuits. We found that frontal cortex circuitry development is extended in primates, and concomitant with an expansion in cortico-cortical pathways compared with mice in adulthood. Importantly, we found that these parameters varied relatively little across humans and studied primates. These data identify a surprising collection of conserved features in frontal cortex circuits across humans and Old World monkeys. Our work demonstrates that integrating transcriptional and connectomic data across temporal dimensions is a robust approach to trace the evolution of brain connectomics in primates.

Empathy for pain engages both shared affective responses and self-other distinction. In this study, we addressed the highly debated question of whether neural responses previously linked to affect sharing could result from the perception of salient affective displays. Moreover, we investigated how affect sharing and self-other distinction interact to determine our response to a pain that is either genuine, or merely pretended. We found stronger activations in regions associated with affect sharing (anterior insula, aIns, and anterior mid-cingulate cortex, aMCC) as well as with affective self-other distinction (right supramarginal gyrus, rSMG), in participants watching video clips of genuine vs. pretended facial expressions of pain. Using dynamic causal modeling (DCM), we then assessed the neural dynamics between the right aIns and rSMG in these two conditions. This revealed a reduced inhibitory effect on the aIns to rSMG connection for genuine compared to pretended pain. For genuine pain only, brain-to-behavior regression analyses highlighted a linkage between this inhibitory effect on the one hand, and pain ratings as well as empathic traits on the other. These findings imply that if the pain of others is genuine and thus calls for an appropriate empathic response, neural responses in the aIns indeed seem related to affect sharing and self-other distinction is engaged to avoid empathic over-arousal. In contrast, if others merely pretend to be in pain, the perceptual salience of their painful expression results in neural responses that are down-regulated to avoid inappropriate affect sharing and social support.

Objective: Optogenetics involves delivery of light-sensitive opsins to the target brain region, as well as introduction of optical and electrical devices to manipulate and record neural activity, respectively, from the targeted neural population. Combining these functionalities in a single implantable device is of great importance for a precise investigation of neural networks while minimizing tissue damage. Approach: We report on the development, characterization, and in vivo validation of a multifunctional optrode that combines a silicon-based neural probe with an integrated microfluidic channel, and an optical glass fiber in a compact assembly. The silicon probe comprises an 11-m-wide fluidic channel and 32 recording electrodes (diameter 30 m) on a tapered probe shank with a length, thickness, and maximum width of 7.5 mm, 50 m, and 150 m, respectively. The size and position of fluidic channels, electrodes, and optical fiber can be precisely tuned according to the in vivo application. Main results: With a total system weight of 0.97 g, our multifunctional optrode is suitable for chronic in vivo experiments requiring simultaneous drug delivery, optical stimulation, and neural recording. We demonstrate the utility of our device in optogenetics by injecting a viral vector carrying a ChR2-construct in the prefrontal cortex and subsequent photostimulation of the transfected neurons while recording neural activity from both the target and adjacent regions in a freely moving rat. Additionally, we demonstrate a pharmacological application of our device by injecting GABA antagonist bicuculline in an anesthetized rat brain and simultaneously recording the electrophysiological response. Significance: Our triple-modality device enables a single-step optogenetic surgery. In comparison to conventional multi-step surgeries, our approach achieves higher spatial specificity while minimizing tissue damage.

Recent evidence suggests that nanoorganization of proteins within synapses may control the strength of communication between neurons in the brain. The unique subsynaptic distribution of glutamate receptors, which cluster in nanoalignment with presynaptic sites of glutamate release, supports this idea. However, testing it has been difficult because mechanisms controlling subsynaptic organization remain unknown. Reasoning that transcellular interactions could position AMPA receptors, we targeted a key transsynaptic adhesion molecule implicated in controlling AMPAR number, LRRTM2, using engineered, rapid proteolysis. Severing the LRRTM2 extracellular domain led quickly to nanoscale de-clustering of AMPARs away from release sites, not prompting their escape from synapses until much later. This rapid remodeling of AMPAR position produced significant deficits in evoked, but not spontaneous, postsynaptic receptor activation. These results dissociate receptor numbers from their nanopositioning in determination of synaptic function, and support the novel concept that adhesion molecules acutely position AMPA receptors to dynamically control synaptic strength.

In biological neuronal networks, information representation and processing are achieved through plasticity learning rules that have been empirically characterized as sensitive to second and higher-order statistics in spike trains. However, most models in both computational neuroscience and machine learning aim to convert diverse statistical properties in inputs into first-order statistics in outputs, like in modern deep learning tools. In the context of classification, such schemes have merit for inputs like static images, but they are not well suited to capture the temporal structure in time series. In contrast, the recently developed covariance perceptron uses second-order statistics by mapping input covariances to output covariances in a consistent fashion. Here, we explore the applicability of covariance-based perceptron readouts in reservoir computing networks to classify synthetic multivariate time series structured at different statistical orders (first and second). We show that the second-order framework outperforms or matches the classical mean paradigm in terms of accuracy. We expose nontrivial relationships between input, reservoir and output dynamics, which suggest an important role for recurrent connectivity in transforming information representations in biologically inspired architectures. Finally, we solve a real automatic speech recognition task for the classification of spoken digits to further demonstrate the potential of covariance-based decoding.

BACKGROUND: The molecular pathomechanisms of major depressive disorder (MDD) are still not completely understood. Here, we follow the hypothesis, that mitochondrial dysfunction which is inevitably associated with bioenergetic misbalance is a risk factor that contributes to the susceptibility of an individual to develop MDD. MDD can be regarded as disease of the mind as well as of the body. Thus, we focused on mitochondrial and cellular function in reprogrammed neural cells from MDD patients and healthy controls. METHODS: We investigated molecular mechanisms related to mitochondrial and cellular functions in induced neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) as well as in neurons, which were reprogrammed from fibroblasts of depressed patients and non-depressed controls, respectively. RESULTS: We found significantly lower basal respiration rates and a less hyperpolarized mitochondrial membrane potential in NPCs derived from MDD patients. These findings are in line with our earlier observations in patient-derived fibroblasts (1). Furthermore, we differentiated MDD and control NPCs into iPS-neurons and analyzed their passive biophysical and active electrophysiological properties. Interestingly, MDD patient-derived iPS-neurons showed significantly lower membrane capacitance, a more depolarized membrane potential, and increased spontaneous electrical activity. This is the first report showing functional differences in MDD patient-derived and control NPCs and iPS-neurons. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that functional differences evident in fibroblasts from depressed patients are also present after reprogramming and differentiation to induced-NPCs and iPS-neurons and might be associated with the aetiology of major depressive disorder.

Whole slide scanning technology has enabled the generation of high-resolution images of complete tissue sections. However, commonly used analysis software is often unable to handle the large data files produced. Here we present a method using the open-source software QuPath to detect, classify and quantify fluorescently-labelled cells (microglia and pericytes) in whole coronal brain tissue sections. Whole brain sections from both male and female NG2DsRed x CX3CR1+/GFP mice were analysed. Small regions of interest were selected and manual counts were compared to counts generated from an automated approach, across a range of detection parameters. The optimal parameters for detecting cells and classifying them as microglia or pericytes in each brain region were determined and applied to annotations corresponding to the entire cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and hypothalamus in each section. 3.71% of all detected cells were classified as pericytes, however this proportion was significantly higher in the thalamus (6.39%) than in other regions. In contrast, microglia (4.45% of total cells) were more abundant in the cortex (5.54%). No differences were detected between male and female mice. In conclusion, QuPath offers a user-friendly, rapid and accurate solution to whole-slide image analysis which could lead to important new discoveries in both health and disease.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes acute and lasting impacts on the brain, driving pathology along anatomical, cellular, and behavioral dimensions. Rodent models offer the opportunity to study TBI in a controlled setting, and enable analysis of the temporal progression that occurs from injury to recovery. We applied transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis, characterize gene expression and in ipsilateral hippocampus at 1 and 14 days following moderate lateral fluid percussion (LFP) injury. This approach enabled us to identify differential gene expression (DEG) modules with distinct expression trajectories across the two time points. The major DEG modules represented genes that were up- or downregulated acutely, but largely recovered by 14 days. As expected, DEG modules with acute upregulation were associated with cell death and astrocytosis. Interestingly, acutely downregulated DEGs related to neurotransmission mostly recovered by two weeks. Upregulated DEG modules related to inflammation were not necessarily elevated acutely, but were strongly upregulated after two weeks. We identified a smaller DEG module with delayed upregulation at 14 days including genes related to cholesterol metabolism and amyloid beta clearance. Finally, differential expression was paralleled by changes in H3K4me3 at the promoters of differentially expressed genes at one day following TBI. Following TBI, changes in cell viability, function and ultimately behavior are dynamic processes. Our results show how transcriptomics in the preclinical setting has the potential to identify biomarkers for injury severity and/or recovery, to identify potential therapeutic targets, and, in the future, to evaluate efficacy of an intervention beyond measures of cell death or spatial learning.

Diverse sensory systems, from audition to thermosensation, feature a separation of inputs into ON (increments) and OFF (decrements) signals. In the Drosophila visual system, separate ON and OFF pathways compute the direction of motion, yet anatomical and functional studies have identified some crosstalk between these channels. We used this well-studied circuit to ask whether the motion computation depends on ON-OFF pathway crosstalk. Using whole-cell electrophysiology we recorded visual responses of T4 (ON) and T5 (OFF) cells and discovered that both cell types are also directionally selective in response to non-preferred contrast motion. We mapped T4s' and T5s' composite ON-OFF receptive fields and found they share a similar spatiotemporal structure. We fit a biophysical model to these receptive fields that accurately predicts directionally selective T4 and T5 responses to both ON and OFF moving stimuli. This model also provides a detailed mechanistic explanation for the directional-preference inversion in response to a prominent visual illusion, a result we corroborate with electrophysiological recordings and behavioral responses of flying flies.

Because it is difficult to directly observe the morphology of the living cochlea, our ability to infer the mechanical functioning of the living ear has been limited. Nearly all of our knowledge about cochlear morphology comes from postmortem tissue that was fixed and processed using procedures that possibly distort the structures and fluid spaces of the organ of Corti. In this study, optical coherence tomography was employed to obtain in vivo and postmortem micron-scale volumetric images of the high-frequency hook region of the gerbil cochlea through the round-window membrane. The anatomical structures and fluid spaces of the organ of Corti were segmented and quantified in vivo and over a 90-minute postmortem period. The results show that some aspects of the organ of Corti are significantly altered over the course of death, such as the volumes of the fluid spaces, whereas the dimensions of other features change very little. We postulate that the fluid space of the outer tunnel and its surrounding tectal cells form a resonant structure that can affect the motion of the reticular lamina and thereby have a profound effect on outer-hair-cell transduction and thus cochlear amplification. In addition, the in vivo fluid pressure of the inner spiral sulcus is postulated to effectively inflate the connected sub-tectorial gap between the tectorial membrane and the reticular lamina. This gap height decreases after death, which is hypothesized to reduce and disrupt hair-cell transduction.

We present a measurement probe consisting of four platinum electrodes fused into soda-lime glass. The probe is based on a four-terminal sensing technique that uses separate pairs of current-carrying and voltage-sensing electrodes and performs more accurate measurements than the simpler and more usual two-terminal sensing technique. The electrodes are aranged within an area of 1 mm2 allowing for local characterization of different brain tissues. The operation of the probe is demonstrated in situ on post mortem porcine brain tissue by measuring the impedance spectra of grey and white matter in a frequency range of 1 kHz &lt; &lt; 1 MHz. The conductivity and relative permittivity are derived from the impedance spectra using the geometry factor of the probe. The geometry factor is obtained experimentally by measuring the impedances of an electrolytical dilution series with known conductivities. The obtained conductivity of grey matter is in the order of 0.11 S/m and of white matter is in the order of 0.07 S/m over the acquired frequency range.

Psychophysical data indicates humans can discriminate visual scenes based on their skewness - the ratio of dark and bright patches within a visual scene. It was also shown that on a phenomenological level this skew discrimination is described by the so-called Blackshot mechanism, which accentuates strong negative contrasts within a scene. Here we demonstrate that the neuronal correlate of the Blackshot mechanism is the asymmetric gain of the cone phototransduction cascade, which is higher for strong negative contrasts than for strong positive contrasts. We recorded from goldfish cone photoreceptors and found that the asymmetry in the phototransduction gain leads to higher amplitude of the responses to negatively than to positively skewed light stimuli. This asymmetry in the amplitude was present in the photocurrent, voltage response and cone synaptic output. Additionally, we found that stimulus skewness leads to a subtle change in photoreceptor kinetics. For negatively skewed stimuli, the cone's impulse response functions peak later than for positively skewed stimulus. However, stimulus skewness does not affect the cone's overall integration time.

Perceptual similarities, or distances between sensory stimuli provide valuable information about the structure and geometry of sensory spaces, and typically are measured in humans but rarely in other species. However, understanding the neural computations responsible for sensory representations requires the monitoring and sometime manipulating of neural activity, which is more readily achieved in non-human experimental models. Here we develop a behavioral paradigm that allows for the quantifying of perceptual similarity between sensory stimuli in mice using olfaction as a model system.

Drug and alcohol use during adolescence is common, and data in both humans and preclinical animal models clearly indicate drug exposure during adolescence increases the risk of substance use and other mental health disorders later in life. Adolescence is a period of social, emotional, and cognitive development, and is characterized by increased exploratory behavior, risk-taking, and peer-centered social interactions. These are thought to be behavioral manifestations of developmental plasticity in reward regions of the brain. Human data indicate that adolescence is not a unitary developmental period, but rather different neural and behavioral sequelae can be observed in early vs. late adolescence. However, most studies with rodent models examine a single adolescent age compared to a mature adult age, and often only in males. Herein, we sought to determine whether the acute response to the opioid morphine would also differ across adolescence, and by sex. By quantifying c-Fos positive cells, a proxy for neural activity, at different stages during adolescence (pre-, early, mid-, and late adolescence) and in multiple reward regions (prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, caudate/putamen), we determined that acute morphine can either reduce or increase c-Fos expression dependent on adolescent age, sex, and brain region. These data suggest that heterogeneity in the consequences of adolescent opioid exposure may be due to the interaction between age- and sex-specific developmental profiles of reward processing in individual brain regions. In future studies, it will be important to add age within adolescence as an independent variable to fully capture the consequences of healthy or abnormal reward-related neural development.

Microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain, are exquisitely sensitive to dynamic changes in the brain environment. We used single cell RNA sequencing to define glial responses in the early postnatal somatosensory cortex after partial whisker lesion, revealing transcriptomic shifts in both astrocytes and microglia during the resulting topographic remapping. The most distinct change was the emergence of a type I interferon (IFN-I) responsive microglia population that was rare in the resting cortex but expanded 20-fold after whisker deprivation. The top gene candidate in this cluster, Ifitm3, marked a conserved but transient subset of microglia that were in the process of phagocytosing whole cells. IFITM3 protein identified this subset in vivo, where it was enriched in early microglial phagosomes. Loss of canonical IFN-I signaling in Ifnar1-/- animals resulted in abnormal 'bubble' microglia with deficient phagolysosomal processing. In a meta-analysis of transcriptomes, we identified the IFN-I signature in microglia across a range of pathologies. We identified phagocytic IFITM3+ microglia in two murine disease models: SARS-CoV-2 infection and Alzheimer's Disease. These data reveal the potential of transcriptional profiling after defined perturbation to elicit transient microglial states, and identify a novel role for IFN-I signaling in regulating microglial phagocytosis.

Self-initiated movements are known to be preceded by the readiness potential or RP, a gradual increase in surface-negativity of cortical potentials that can begin up to 1 second or more before movement onset. The RP has been extensively studied for decades, and yet we still lack a clear understanding of its functional role. Attempts to model the RP as an accumulation-to-bound process suggest that this signal is a by-product of time-locking to crests in neural noise rather than the outcome of a pre-conscious decision to initiate a movement. One parameter of the model accounts for the imperative to move now, with cued movements having a strong imperative and purely spontaneous movements having no imperative. Two different variants of the model have been proposed, and both predict a decrease in the (negative) amplitude of the early RP as the imperative grows stronger. In order to test this empirically, we conducted an experiment where subjects produced self-initiated movements under varying levels of time pressure, and we investigated the amplitude, shape, and latency of the RP as a function of the imperative to move, operationalized as a time limit. We identified distinct changes in the amplitude of the early RP that grew non-linearly as the time limit grew shorter. Thus these data did not support the prediction made by the model. In addition, our results confirm that the shape of the RP is not stereotypically negative, being either positive or absent in about half of the subjects.

When Darwin visited the Galapagos archipelago, he observed that, in spite of the islands’ physical similarity, members of species that had dispersed to them recently were beginning to diverge from each other. He postulated that these divergences must have resulted primarily from interactions with sets of other species that had also diverged across these otherwise similar islands. By extrapolation, if Darwin is correct, such complex interactions must be driving species divergences across all ecosystems. However, many current general ecological theories that predict observed distributions of species in ecosystems do not take the details of between-species interactions into account. Here we quantify, in sixteen forest diversity plots (FDPs) worldwide, highly significant negative density-dependent (NDD) components of both conspecific and heterospecific between-tree interactions that affect the trees’ distributions, growth, recruitment, and mortality. These interactions decline smoothly in significance with increasing physical distance between trees. They also tend to decline in significance with increasing phylogenetic distance between the trees, but each FDP exhibits its own unique pattern of exceptions to this overall decline. Unique patterns of between-species interactions in ecosystems, of the general type that Darwin postulated, are likely to have contributed to the exceptions. We test the power of our null-model method by using a deliberately modified data set, and show that the method easily identifies the modifications. We examine how some of the exceptions, at the Wind River (USA) FDP, reveal new details of a known allelopathic effect of one of the Wind River gymnosperm species. Finally, we explore how similar analyses can be used to investigate details of many types of interactions in these complex ecosystems, and can provide clues to the evolution of these interactions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aGgdgDmNtHU" width="1" />

The recently reported “UK variant” (B.1.1.7) of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be more infectious than previously circulating strains as a result of several changes, including the N501Y mutation. We present a 2.9-Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the complex between the ACE2 receptor and N501Y spike protein ectodomains that shows Y501 inserted into a cavity at the binding interface near Y41 of ACE2. This additional interaction provides a structural explanation for the increased ACE2 affinity of the N501Y mutant, and likely contributes to its increased infectivity. However, this mutation does not result in large structural changes, enabling important neutralization epitopes to be retained in the spike receptor binding domain. We confirmed this through biophysical assays and by determining cryo-EM structures of spike protein ectodomains bound to 2 representative potent neutralizing antibody fragments.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/1tJUCtjdGAw" width="1" />

Lateral flow devices (LFDs) are quickly being implemented for use in large-scale population surveillance programs for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the United Kingdom. These programs have been piloted in city-wide screening in the city of Liverpool and are now being rolled out to support care home visits and the return home of University students for the Christmas break. Here, we present data on the performance of LFDs to test almost 8,000 students at the University of Birmingham between December 2 and December 9, 2020. The performance is validated against almost 800 samples using PCR performed in the University Pillar 2 testing lab and theoretically validated on thousands of Pillar 2 PCR testing results performed on low-prevalence care home testing samples. Our data show that LFDs do not detect infections presenting with PCR Ct values over 29 to 30 as determined using the Thermo Fisher TaqPath asssay. This may be of particular importance in detecting individuals that are either at the early, or late stages of infection, and reinforces the need for frequent, recurrent testing.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/1co_SRrjWdA" width="1" />

Mechanosensory neurons in the human tongue and hard palate were identified using immunohistochemical methods. In fungiform taste papillae, Meissner‐like corpuscles were found within the lamina propria and putative mechanosensory neurons were identified that surround taste buds. In filiform non‐taste papillae, end bulbs of Krause were the predominant sensory ending. Novel sensory endings were also identified, including subepithelial neuronal densities and the endings of myelinated neurons that innervate the epithelium. In the hard‐palate mucosa, Meissner corpuscles and glomerular endings were identified in the lamina propria, and Merkel‐cell neurite complexes were identified in epithelia. This rich cadre of neuronal endings is poised to mediate mechanosensory control of feeding and speech.







Abstract
The oral somatosensory system relays essential information about mechanical stimuli to enable oral functions such as feeding and speech. The neurochemical and anatomical diversity of sensory neurons across oral cavity sites have not been systematically compared. To address this gap, we analyzed healthy human tongue and hard‐palate innervation. Biopsies were collected from 12 volunteers and underwent fluorescent immunohistochemistry (≥2 specimens per marker/structure). Afferents were analyzed for markers of neurons (βIII tubulin), myelinated afferents (neurofilament heavy, NFH), and Merkel cells and taste cells (keratin 20, K20). Hard‐palate innervation included Meissner corpuscles, glomerular endings, Merkel cell‐neurite complexes, and free nerve endings. The organization of these somatosensory endings is reminiscent of fingertips, suggesting that the hard palate is equipped with a rich repertoire of sensory neurons for pressure sensing and spatial localization of mechanical inputs, which are essential for speech production and feeding. Likewise, the tongue is innervated by afferents that impart it with exquisite acuity and detection of moving stimuli that support flavor construction and speech. Filiform papillae contained end bulbs of Krause, as well as endings that have not been previously reported, including subepithelial neuronal densities, and NFH+ neurons innervating basal epithelia. Fungiform papillae had Meissner corpuscles and densities of NFH+ intraepithelial neurons surrounding taste buds. The differing compositions of sensory endings within filiform and fungiform papillae suggest that these structures have distinct roles in mechanosensation. Collectively, this study has identified previously undescribed neuronal endings in human oral tissues and provides an anatomical framework for understanding oral mechanosensory functions.

These are the identified wide‐field and medium‐field amacrine cells that made synapses onto a broad thorny ganglion cell (purple) in central macaque retina. The wide field amacrine cells included three wiry amacrine cells (green), a semilunar cell (aqua), and a stellate wavy cell (yellow). The medium‐field cells included a starburst amacrine cell (red) and a spiny amacrine cell (orange). These amacrine cell inputs are expected to mediate the responses of the broad thorny ganglion cells to stimuli outside their classical receptive fields.







Abstract
In primates, broad thorny retinal ganglion cells are highly sensitive to small, moving stimuli. They have tortuous, fine dendrites with many short, spine‐like branches that occupy three contiguous strata in the middle of the inner plexiform layer. The neural circuits that generate their responses to moving stimuli are not well‐understood, and that was the goal of this study. A connectome from central macaque retina was generated by serial block‐face scanning electron microscopy, a broad thorny cell was reconstructed, and its synaptic inputs were analyzed. It received fewer than 2% of its inputs from both ON and OFF types of bipolar cells; the vast majority of its inputs were from amacrine cells. The presynaptic amacrine cells were reconstructed, and seven types were identified based on their characteristic morphology. Two types of narrow‐field cells, knotty bistratified Type 1 and wavy multistratified Type 2, were identified. Two types of medium‐field amacrine cells, ON starburst and spiny, were also presynaptic to the broad thorny cell. Three types of wide‐field amacrine cells, wiry Type 2, stellate wavy, and semilunar Type 2, also made synapses onto the broad thorny cell. Physiological experiments using a macaque retinal preparation in vitro confirmed that broad thorny cells received robust excitatory input from both the ON and the OFF pathways. Given the paucity of bipolar cell inputs, it is likely that amacrine cells provided much of the excitatory input, in addition to inhibitory input.

<p>The sciences of natural and artificial intelligence are fundamentally
connected. Brain-inspired human-engineered AI are now the standard for
predicting human brain responses during vision, and conversely, the brain
continues to inspire invention in AI. To promote even deeper connections
between these fields, we here release the 2021 edition of the Algonauts Project
Challenge: How the Human Brain Makes Sense of a World in Motion
(<a href="http://algonauts.csail.mit.edu/">this http URL</a>). We provide whole-brain fMRI responses
recorded while 10 human participants viewed a rich set of over 1,000 short
video clips depicting everyday events. The goal of the challenge is to
accurately predict brain responses to these video clips. The format of our
challenge ensures rapid development, makes results directly comparable and
transparent, and is open to all. In this way it facilitates interdisciplinary
collaboration towards a common goal of understanding visual intelligence. The
2021 Algonauts Project is conducted in collaboration with the Cognitive

<p>Computing diverse sets of high-quality solutions has gained increasing
attention among the evolutionary computation community in recent years. It
allows practitioners to choose from a set of high-quality alternatives. In this
paper, we employ a population diversity measure, called the high-order entropy
measure, in an evolutionary algorithm to compute a diverse set of high-quality
solutions for the Traveling Salesperson Problem. In contrast to previous
studies, our approach allows diversifying segments of tours containing several
edges based on the entropy measure. We examine the resulting evolutionary
diversity optimisation approach precisely in terms of the final set of
solutions and theoretical properties. Experimental results show significant
improvements compared to a recently proposed edge-based diversity optimisation
approach when working with a large population of solutions or long segments.

<p>Deep learning has rapidly become a widespread tool in both scientific and
commercial endeavors. Milestones of deep learning exceeding human performance
have been achieved for a growing number of tasks over the past several years,
across areas as diverse as game-playing, natural-language translation, and
medical-image analysis. However, continued progress is increasingly hampered by
the high energy costs associated with training and running deep neural networks
on electronic processors. Optical neural networks have attracted attention as
an alternative physical platform for deep learning, as it has been
theoretically predicted that they can fundamentally achieve higher energy
efficiency than neural networks deployed on conventional digital computers.
Here, we experimentally demonstrate an optical neural network achieving 99%
accuracy on handwritten-digit classification using ~3.2 detected photons per
weight multiplication and ~90% accuracy using ~0.64 photons (~$2.4 \times
10^{-19}$ J of optical energy) per weight multiplication. This performance was
achieved using a custom free-space optical processor that executes
matrix-vector multiplications in a massively parallel fashion, with up to ~0.5
million scalar (weight) multiplications performed at the same time. Using
commercially available optical components and standard neural-network training
methods, we demonstrated that optical neural networks can operate near the
standard quantum limit with extremely low optical powers and still achieve high
accuracy. Our results provide a proof-of-principle for low-optical-power
operation, and with careful system design including the surrounding electronics
used for data storage and control, open up a path to realizing optical
processors that require only $10^{-16}$ J total energy per scalar
multiplication -- which is orders of magnitude more efficient than current
digital processors.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13424">Policy Manifold Search: Exploring the Manifold Hypothesis for Diversity-based Neuroevolution. (arXiv:2104.13424v1 [cs.LG])</a></h4>

<p>Neuroevolution is an alternative to gradient-based optimisation that has the
potential to avoid local minima and allows parallelisation. The main limiting
factor is that usually it does not scale well with parameter space
dimensionality. Inspired by recent work examining neural network intrinsic
dimension and loss landscapes, we hypothesise that there exists a
low-dimensional manifold, embedded in the policy network parameter space,
around which a high-density of diverse and useful policies are located. This
paper proposes a novel method for diversity-based policy search via
Neuroevolution, that leverages learned representations of the policy network
parameters, by performing policy search in this learned representation space.
Our method relies on the Quality-Diversity (QD) framework which provides a
principled approach to policy search, and maintains a collection of diverse
policies, used as a dataset for learning policy representations. Further, we
use the Jacobian of the inverse-mapping function to guide the search in the
representation space. This ensures that the generated samples remain in the
high-density regions, after mapping back to the original space. Finally, we
evaluate our contributions on four continuous-control tasks in simulated
environments, and compare to diversity-based baselines.

<p>Despite the recent success of reconciling spike-based coding with the error
backpropagation algorithm, spiking neural networks are still mostly applied to
tasks stemming from sensory processing, operating on traditional data
structures like visual or auditory data. A rich data representation that finds
wide application in industry and research is the so-called knowledge graph - a
graph-based structure where entities are depicted as nodes and relations
between them as edges. Complex systems like molecules, social networks and
industrial factory systems can be described using the common language of
knowledge graphs, allowing the usage of graph embedding algorithms to make
context-aware predictions in these information-packed environments. We propose
a spike-based algorithm where nodes in a graph are represented by single spike
times of neuron populations and relations as spike time differences between
populations. Learning such spike-based embeddings only requires knowledge about
spike times and spike time differences, compatible with recently proposed
frameworks for training spiking neural networks. The presented model is easily
mapped to current neuromorphic hardware systems and thereby moves inference on
knowledge graphs into a domain where these architectures thrive, unlocking a
promising industrial application area for this technology.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217">Hopfield Networks is All You Need. (arXiv:2008.02217v3 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>We introduce a modern Hopfield network with continuous states and a
corresponding update rule. The new Hopfield network can store exponentially
(with the dimension of the associative space) many patterns, retrieves the
pattern with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. It has
three types of energy minima (fixed points of the update): (1) global fixed
point averaging over all patterns, (2) metastable states averaging over a
subset of patterns, and (3) fixed points which store a single pattern. The new
update rule is equivalent to the attention mechanism used in transformers. This
equivalence enables a characterization of the heads of transformer models.
These heads perform in the first layers preferably global averaging and in
higher layers partial averaging via metastable states. The new modern Hopfield
network can be integrated into deep learning architectures as layers to allow
the storage of and access to raw input data, intermediate results, or learned
prototypes. These Hopfield layers enable new ways of deep learning, beyond
fully-connected, convolutional, or recurrent networks, and provide pooling,
memory, association, and attention mechanisms. We demonstrate the broad
applicability of the Hopfield layers across various domains. Hopfield layers
improved state-of-the-art on three out of four considered multiple instance
learning problems as well as on immune repertoire classification with several
hundreds of thousands of instances. On the UCI benchmark collections of small
classification tasks, where deep learning methods typically struggle, Hopfield
layers yielded a new state-of-the-art when compared to different machine
learning methods. Finally, Hopfield layers achieved state-of-the-art on two
drug design datasets. The implementation is available at:

<p>The performance of acquisition functions for Bayesian optimisation to locate
the global optimum of continuous functions is investigated in terms of the
Pareto front between exploration and exploitation. We show that Expected
Improvement (EI) and the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) always select solutions
to be expensively evaluated on the Pareto front, but Probability of Improvement
is not guaranteed to do so and Weighted Expected Improvement does so only for a
restricted range of weights.
</p>
<p>We introduce two novel $\epsilon$-greedy acquisition functions. Extensive
empirical evaluation of these together with random search, purely exploratory,
and purely exploitative search on 10 benchmark problems in 1 to 10 dimensions
shows that $\epsilon$-greedy algorithms are generally at least as effective as
conventional acquisition functions (e.g., EI and UCB), particularly with a
limited budget. In higher dimensions $\epsilon$-greedy approaches are shown to
have improved performance over conventional approaches. These results are borne
out on a real world computational fluid dynamics optimisation problem and a
robotics active learning problem. Our analysis and experiments suggest that the
most effective strategy, particularly in higher dimensions, is to be mostly
greedy, occasionally selecting a random exploratory solution.

<p>The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is located within the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC), and processes and facilitates goal-directed behaviors relating to emotion, reward, and motor control. However, it is unclear how ACC neurons dynamically encode motivated behavior during locomotion. In this study, we examined how information for locomotion and behavioral outcomes is temporally represented by individual and ensembles of ACC neurons in mice during a self-paced locomotor reward-based task. By recording and analyzing the activity of ACC neurons with a microdrive tetrode array while the mouse performed the locomotor task, we found that more than two-fifths of the neurons showed phasic activity relating to locomotion or the reward behavior. Some of these neurons showed significant differences in their firing rate depending on the behavioral outcome. Furthermore, by applying a demixed principal component analysis, the ACC population activity was decomposed into components representing locomotion and the previous/future outcome. These results indicated that ACC neurons dynamically integrate motor and behavioral inputs during goal-directed behaviors.</p>

<p>Metal ion dyshomeostasis and disparate levels of biometals like zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and selenium (Se) have been implicated as a potential causative factor for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In this study, we have enrolled 129 children (aged 2–4 years) in North America, of which 64 children had a diagnosis of ASD and 65 were controls. Hair, nail, and blood samples were collected and quantitatively analyzed for Zn, Cu and Se using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Of the analyzed biometals, serum Se (116.83 ± 14.84 mcg/mL) was found to be significantly lower in male ASD cases compared to male healthy controls (128.21 ± 9.11 mcg/mL; p &lt; 0.005). A similar trend was found for nail Se levels in ASD (1.01 ± 0.15 mcg/mL) versus that of controls (1.11 ± 0.17 mcg/mL) with a p-value of 0.0132 using a stratified Wilcoxon rank sum testing. The level of Se in ASD cohort was co-analyzed for psychometric correlation and found a negative correlation between total ADOS score and serum Se levels. However, we did not observe any significant difference in Zn, Cu, and Zn/Cu ratio in ASD cases versus controls in this cohort of North American children. Further studies are recommended to better understand the biology of the relationship between Se and ASD status.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.646072">MicroRNAs Instruct and Maintain Cell Type Diversity in the Nervous System</a></h4>

<p>Characterizing the diverse cell types that make up the nervous system is essential for understanding how the nervous system is structured and ultimately how it functions. The astonishing range of cellular diversity found in the nervous system emerges from a small pool of neural progenitor cells. These progenitors and their neuronal progeny proceed through sequential gene expression programs to produce different cell lineages and acquire distinct cell fates. These gene expression programs must be tightly regulated in order for the cells to achieve and maintain the proper differentiated state, remain functional throughout life, and avoid cell death. Disruption of developmental programs is associated with a wide range of abnormalities in brain structure and function, further indicating that elucidating their contribution to cellular diversity will be key to understanding brain health. A growing body of evidence suggests that tight regulation of developmental genes requires post-transcriptional regulation of the transcriptome by microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that function by binding to mRNA targets containing complementary sequences and repressing their translation into protein, thereby providing a layer of precise spatial and temporal control over gene expression. Moreover, the expression profiles and targets of miRNAs show great specificity for distinct cell types, brain regions and developmental stages, suggesting that they are an important parameter of cell type identity. Here, we provide an overview of miRNAs that are critically involved in establishing neural cell identities, focusing on how miRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression modulates neural progenitor expansion, cell fate determination, cell migration, neuronal and glial subtype specification, and finally cell maintenance and survival.</p>

<p>Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a rare, progressive disease that affects photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells with blindness as a final outcome. Despite high medical and social impact, there is currently no therapeutic options to slow down the progression of or cure the disease. The development of effective therapies was largely hindered by high genetic heterogeneity, inaccessible disease tissue, and unfaithful model organisms. The fact that components of ubiquitously expressed splicing factors lead to the retina-specific disease is an additional intriguing question. Herein, we sought to correlate the retinal cell-type-specific disease phenotype with the splicing profile shown by a patient with autosomal recessive RP, caused by a mutation in pre-mRNA splicing factor 8 (PRPF8). In order to get insight into the role of PRPF8 in homeostasis and disease, we capitalize on the ability to generate patient-specific RPE cells and reveal differentially expressed genes unique to RPE cells. We found that spliceosomal complex and ribosomal functions are crucial in determining cell-type specificity through differential expression and alternative splicing (AS) and that PRPF8 mutation causes global changes in splice site selection and exon inclusion that particularly affect genes involved in these cellular functions. This finding corroborates the hypothesis that retinal tissue identity is conferred by a specific splicing program and identifies retinal AS events as a framework toward the design of novel therapeutic opportunities.</p>

<p>Segmentation of brain images from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) is an indispensable step in clinical practice. Morphological changes of sub-cortical brain structures and quantification of brain lesions are considered biomarkers of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders and used for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring disease progression. In recent years, deep learning methods showed an outstanding performance in medical image segmentation. However, these methods suffer from generalisability problem due to inter-centre and inter-scanner variabilities of the MRI images. The main objective of the study is to develop an automated deep learning segmentation approach that is accurate and robust to the variabilities in scanner and acquisition protocols. In this paper, we propose a transductive transfer learning approach for domain adaptation to reduce the domain-shift effect in brain MRI segmentation. The transductive scenario assumes that there are sets of images from two different domains: (1) source—images with manually annotated labels; and (2) target—images without expert annotations. Then, the network is jointly optimised integrating both source and target images into the transductive training process to segment the regions of interest and to minimise the domain-shift effect. We proposed to use a histogram loss in the feature level to carry out the latter optimisation problem. In order to demonstrate the benefit of the proposed approach, the method has been tested in two different brain MRI image segmentation problems using multi-centre and multi-scanner databases for: (1) sub-cortical brain structure segmentation; and (2) white matter hyperintensities segmentation. The experiments showed that the segmentation performance of a pre-trained model could be significantly improved by up to 10%. For the first segmentation problem it was possible to achieve a maximum improvement from 0.680 to 0.799 in average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) metric and for the second problem the average DSC improved from 0.504 to 0.602. Moreover, the improvements after domain adaptation were on par or showed better performance compared to the commonly used traditional unsupervised segmentation methods (FIRST and LST), also achieving faster execution time. Taking this into account, this work presents one more step toward the practical implementation of deep learning algorithms into the clinical routine.</p>

<p>The reconstruction of electrophysiological sources within the brain is sensitive to the constructed head model, which depends on the positioning accuracy of anatomical landmarks known as fiducials. In this work, we propose an algorithm for the automatic detection of fiducial landmarks of EEG electrodes on the 3D human head model. Our proposal combines a dimensional reduction approach with a perspective projection from 3D to 2D object space; the eye and ear automatic detection in a 2D face image by two cascades of classifiers and geometric transformations to obtain 3D spatial coordinates of the landmarks and to generate the head coordinate system, This is accomplished by considering the characteristics of the scanner information. Capturing the 3D model of the head is done with Occipital Inc. ST01 structure sensor and the implementation of our algorithm was carried out on MATLAB R2018b using the Computer Vision Toolbox and the FieldTrip Toolbox. The experimental results were aimed at recursively exploring the efficacy of the facial feature detectors as a function of the projection angle; they show that robust results are obtained in terms of false acceptance rate. Our proposal is an initial step of an approach for the automatic digitization of electrode locations. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method detects anatomical facial landmarks automatically, accurately, and rapidly.</p>

<p>Purpose: This study is aimed to preliminary investigate whether transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) could affect explosive power considering genetic background in sport subjects.</p><p>Methods: Seventeen healthy sports volunteers with at least 3 years of sports activities participated in the experiment. After 2 weeks of familiarization performed without any stimulation, each participant received either 50 Hz-tACS or sham-tACS. Before and after stimulation, subjects performed the following tests: (1) the squat jump with the hands on the hips (SJ); (2) countermovement jump with the hands on the hips (CMJ); (3) countermovement jump with arm swing (CMJ-AS); (4) 15-s Bosco’s test; (5) seated backward overhead medicine ball throw (SBOMBT); (6) seated chest pass throw (SCPT) with a 3-kg rubber medicine ball; and (7) hand-grip test. Additionally, saliva samples were collected from each participant. Genotyping analysis was carried out by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).</p><p>Results: No significant differences were found in sport performance of subjects after 50 Hz-tACS. Additionally, we did not find any influence of genetic background on tACS-related effect on physical performance. These results suggest that tACS at gamma frequency is not able to induce an after-effect modulating sport performance. Further investigations with larger sample size are needed in order to understand the potential role of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques (NIBS) in motor performances.</p><p>Conclusions: Gamma-tACS applied before the physical performance fails to improve explosive power in sport subjects.</p>

<p>Early life stress (ELS) precedes alterations to neuro-immune activation, which may mediate an increased risk for stress-related psychiatric disorders, potentially through alterations of central kynurenine pathway (KP) metabolites, the latter being relatively unexplored. We hypothesized that ELS in a non-human primate model would lead to a reduction of neuroprotective and increases of neurotoxic KP metabolites. Twelve adult female bonnet macaques reared under conditions of maternal variable foraging demand (VFD) were compared to 27 age- and weight-matched non-VFD-exposed female controls. Baseline behavioral observations of social affiliation were taken over a 12-week period followed by the first cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample. Subjects were then either exposed to a 12-week repeated separation paradigm (RSP) or assigned to a “no-RSP” condition followed by a second CSF. We used high-performance liquid chromatography for kynurenine (KYN), tryptophan, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, kynurenic acid (KYNA), and anthranilic acid (ANTH) as a proxy for quinolinic acid determination. At baseline, social affiliation scores were reduced in VFD-reared versus control subjects. CSF log KYNA and log KYNA/KYN ratio were lower in VFD-reared versus control subjects. CSF log KYNA/KYN was positively correlated with CSF log ANTH in VFD only (r = 0.82). Controlling for log KYNA/KYN, log ANTH was elevated in VFD-reared subjects versus controls. CSF log KYNA/KYN obtained post-RSP was positively correlated with mean social affiliation scores during RSP, specifically in VFD. ELS is associated with a reduced neuroprotective and increased neurotoxic pathway products. That the two contrasting processes are paradoxically correlated following ELS suggests a cross-talk between two opposing KP enzymatic systems.</p>

<p>Mirror training (MT) is an observation-based motor learning strategy. Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is an accelerated form of excitatory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) that has been used to enhance the cortical excitability of the motor cortices. This study aims to investigate the combined effects of iTBS with MT on the resting state functional connectivity at alpha frequency band in healthy adults. Eighteen healthy adults were randomized into one of three groups—Group 1: iTBS plus MT, Group 2: iTBS plus sham MT, and Group 3: sham iTBS plus MT. Participants in Groups 1 and 3 observed the mirror illusion of the moving (right) hand in a plain mirror for four consecutive sessions, one session/day, while participants in Group 2 received the same training with a covered mirror. Real or sham iTBS was applied daily over right motor cortex prior to the training. Resting state electroencephalography (EEG) at baseline and post-training was recorded when participants closed their eyes. The mixed-effects model demonstrated a significant interaction effect in the coherence between FC4 and C4 channels, favoring participants in Group 1 over Group 3 (Δβ = −0.84, p = 0.048). A similar effect was also found in the coherence between FC3 and FC4 channels favoring Group 1 over Group 3 (Δβ = −0.43, p = 0.049). In contrast to sham iTBS combined with MT, iTBS combined with MT may strengthen the functional connectivity between bilateral premotor cortices and ipsilaterally within the motor cortex of the stimulated hemisphere. In contrast to sham MT, real MT, when combined with iTBS, might diminish the connectivity among the contralateral parietal–frontal areas.</p>

<p>Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), also referred to as NG2-glia, are the most proliferative cell type in the adult central nervous system. While the primary role of OPCs is to serve as progenitors for oligodendrocytes, in recent years, it has become increasingly clear that OPCs fulfil a number of other functions. Indeed, independent of their role as stem cells, it is evident that OPCs can regulate the metabolic environment, directly interact with and modulate neuronal function, maintain the blood brain barrier (BBB) and regulate inflammation. In this review article, we discuss the state-of-the-art tools and investigative approaches being used to characterize the biology and function of OPCs. From functional genetic investigation to single cell sequencing and from lineage tracing to functional imaging, we discuss the important discoveries uncovered by these techniques, such as functional and spatial OPC heterogeneity, novel OPC marker genes, the interaction of OPCs with other cells types, and how OPCs integrate and respond to signals from neighboring cells. Finally, we review the use of in vitro assay to assess OPC functions. These methodologies promise to lead to ever greater understanding of this enigmatic cell type, which in turn will shed light on the pathogenesis and potential treatment strategies for a number of diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and gliomas.</p>

<p>From the bipolar cells to higher brain visual centers, signals in the vertebrate visual system are transmitted along parallel on and off pathways. These two pathways are spatially segregated along the depth axis of the retina. Yet, to our knowledge, there is no way to directly assess this anatomical stratification in vivo. Here, employing ultrahigh resolution visible light Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging in humans, we report a stereotyped reflectivity pattern of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) that parallels IPL stratification. We characterize the topography of this reflectivity pattern non-invasively in a cohort of normal, young adult human subjects. This proposed correlate of IPL stratification is accessible through non-invasive ocular imaging in living humans. Topographic variations should be carefully considered when designing studies in development or diseases of the visual system.</p>

<p>Stroke is a leading cause of death and long-term disability worldwide. Current therapeutic options are limited in terms of their time for implementation and efficacy in promoting recovery. Cell transplantation has been shown to have promise in several animal models however significant challenges remain, including the optimal source of cells to promote neural repair. Here, we report on the use of a population of human ESC derived, cortically specified, neuroepithelial precursor cells (cNEPs) that are neurally restricted in their lineage potential. CNEPs have the potential to give rise to mature neural cell types following transplantation, including neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. With a view towards translation, we sought to determine whether this human cell source was effective in promoting improved functional outcomes following stroke. Undifferentiated cNEPs were transplanted in a pre-clinical endothelin-1 (ET-1) model of ischemic motor cortical stroke in immunocompromised SCID-beige mice and cellular and functional outcomes were assessed. We demonstrate that cNEP transplantation in the acute phase (4 days post-stroke) improves motor function as early as 20 days post-stroke, compared to stroke-injured, non-transplanted mice. At the time of recovery, a small fraction (&lt;6%) of the transplanted cNEPs are observed within the stroke injury site. The surviving cells expressed the immature neuronal marker, doublecortin, with no differentiation into mature neural phenotypes. At longer survival times (40 days), the majority of recovered, transplanted mice had a complete absence of surviving cNEPS. Hence, human cNEPs grafted at early times post-stroke support the observed functional recovery following ET-1 stroke but their persistence is not required, thereby supporting a by-stander effect rather than cell replacement.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.669073">Elovl5 Expression in the Central Nervous System of the Adult Mouse</a></h4>

<p>ELOVL5 (Elongase of Very-Long Fatty Acid 5) gene encodes for an enzyme that elongates long chain fatty acids, with a marked preference for polyunsaturated molecules. In particular, it plays an essential role in the elongation of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, precursors for long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Mutations of ELOVL5 cause the spino-cerebellar ataxia type 38 (SCA38), a rare autosomal neurological disease characterized by gait abnormality, dysarthria, dysphagia, hyposmia and peripheral neuropathy, conditions well represented by a mouse model with a targeted deletion of this gene (Elovl5<sup>–/–</sup> mice). However, the expression pattern of this enzyme in neuronal and glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS) is still uninvestigated. This work is aimed at filling this gap of knowledge by taking advantage of an Elovl5-reporter mouse line and immunofluorescence analyses on adult mouse CNS sections and glial cell primary cultures. Notably, Elovl5 appears expressed in a region- and cell type-specific manner. Abundant Elovl5-positive cells were found in the cerebellum, brainstem, and primary and accessory olfactory regions, where mitral cells show the most prominent expression. Hippocampal pyramidal cells of CA2/CA3 where also moderately labeled, while in the rest of the telencephalon Elovl5 expression was high in regions related to motor control. Analysis of primary glial cell cultures revealed Elovl5 expression in oligodendroglial cells at various maturation steps and in microglia, while astrocytes showed a heterogeneous in vivo expression of Elovl5. The elucidation of Elovl5 CNS distribution provides relevant information to understand the physiological functions of this enzyme and its PUFA products, whose unbalance is known to be involved in many pathological conditions.</p>

<p>It has been demonstrated that in adulthood rodents show newly born neurons in the subgranular layer (SGL) of the dentate gyrus (DG), and in the subventricular zone (SVZ). The neurons generated in the SVZ migrate through the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to the olfactory bulb. One of the markers of newly generated neurons is doublecortin (DCX). The degu similarly shows significant numbers of DCX-labeled neurons in the SGL, SVZ, and RMS. Further, most of the nuclei of these DCX-expressing neurons are also labeled by proliferating nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Ki67. Finally, whereas in rats and mice DCX-labeled neurons are predominantly present in the SGL and SVZ, with only a few DCX neurons present in piriform cortex, the degu also shows significant numbers of DCX expressing neurons in areas outside of SVZ, DG, and PC. Many areas of neocortex in degu demonstrate DCX-labeled neurons in layer II, and most of these neurons are found in the limbic cortices. The DCX-labeled cells do not stain with NeuN, indicating they are immature neurons.</p>

<p>There is growing consensus that certain lifestyles can contribute to cognitive impairment and dementia, but the physiological steps that link a harmful lifestyle to its negative impact are not always evident. It is also unclear whether all lifestyles that contribute to dementia do so through the same intermediary steps. This article will focus on three lifestyles known to be risk factors for dementia, namely obesity, sedentary behavior, and insufficient sleep, and offer a unifying hypothesis proposing that lifestyles that negatively impact cognition do so through the same sequence of events: inflammation, small vessel disease, decline in cerebral perfusion, and brain atrophy. The hypothesis will then be tested in a recently identified risk factor for dementia, namely hearing deficit. If further studies confirm this sequence of events leading to dementia, a significant change in our approach to this debilitating and costly condition may be necessary, possible, and beneficial.</p>

<p>Background: Although numerous studies have suggested that the gradually increasing selective preference for positive information over negative information in older adults depends on cognitive control processes, few have reported the characteristics of different attention stages in the emotional processing of older individuals. The present study used a real-time eye-tracking technique to disentangle the attentional engagement and disengagement processes involved in age-related positivity effect (PE).</p><p>Methods: Eye movement data from a spatial-cueing task were obtained for 32 older and 32 younger healthy participants. The spatial-cueing task with varied cognitive loads appeared to be an effective way to explore the role of cognitive control during the attention engagement and disengagement stages of emotion processing.</p><p>Results: Compared with younger adults, older participants showed more positive gaze preferences when cognitive resources were sufficient for face processing at the attention engagement stage. However, the age-related PE was not observed at the attention disengagement stage because older adults had more difficulty disengaging from fearful faces than did the younger adults due to the consumption of attention by the explicit target judgment.</p><p>Conclusion: The present study highlights how cognitive control moderates positive gaze preferences at different attention processing stages. These findings may have far-reaching implications for understanding, preventing, and intervening in unsuccessful aging and, thus, in promoting active and healthy aging.</p>

<p>To perform brain asymmetry studies in large neuroimaging archives, reliable and automatic detection of the interhemispheric fissure (IF) is needed to first extract the cerebral hemispheres. The detection of the IF is often referred to as mid-sagittal plane estimation, as this plane separates the two cerebral hemispheres. However, traditional planar estimation techniques fail when the IF presents a curvature caused by existing pathology or a natural phenomenon known as brain torque. As a result, midline estimates can be inaccurate. In this study, a fully unsupervised midline estimation technique is proposed that is comprised of three main stages: head angle correction, control point estimation and midline generation. The control points are estimated using a combination of intensity, texture, gradient, and symmetry-based features. As shown, the proposed method automatically adapts to IF curvature, is applied on a slice-to-slice basis for more accurate results and also provides accurate delineation of the midline in the septum pellucidum, which is a source of failure for traditional approaches. The method is compared to two state-of-the-art methods for midline estimation and is validated using 75 imaging volumes (~3,000 imaging slices) acquired from 38 centers of subjects with dementia and vascular disease. The proposed method yields the lowest average error across all metrics: Hausdorff distance (HD) was 0.32 ± 0.23, mean absolute difference (MAD) was 1.10 ± 0.38 mm and volume difference was 7.52 ± 5.40 and 5.35 ± 3.97 ml, for left and right hemispheres, respectively. Using the proposed method, the midline was extracted for 5,360 volumes (~275K images) from 83 centers worldwide, acquired by GE, Siemens and Philips scanners. An asymmetry index was proposed that automatically detected outlier segmentations (which were &lt;1% of the total dataset). Using the extracted hemispheres, hemispheric asymmetry texture biomarkers of the normal-appearing brain matter (NABM) were analyzed in a dementia cohort, and significant differences in biomarker means were found across SCI and MCI and SCI and AD.</p>

<p>Background: Older adults with hypertension often had diminished walking performance. The underlying mechanism through which hypertension affects walking performance, however, has not been fully understood. We here measured the complexity of the continuous systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure fluctuation, grade of white matter lesions (WMLs), and cognitive function and used structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the interrelationships between hypertension, BP complexity, WMLs, cognitive function, and walking speed in single- and dual-task conditions.</p><p>Methods: A total of 152 older adults with age &gt; 60 years (90 hypertensive and 62 normotensive participants) completed one MRI scan of brain structure, a finger BP assessment of at least 10 min, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) to assess cognitive function, and 10-meter walking tests in single (i.e., normal walking) and dual tasks (i.e., walking while performing a serial subtraction of three from a random three-digit number). The grade of WMLs was assessed using the total score of Fazekas scale; the complexity of SBP and DBP was measured using multiscale entropy (MSE), and the walking performance was assessed by walking speed in single- and dual-task conditions.</p><p>Results: As compared to normotensives, hypertensive older adults had significantly slower walking speed, lower complexity of SBP and DBP, greater grade of WMLs, and poorer cognitive function (p &lt; 0.03). Those with lower BP complexity (β &gt; 0.31, p &lt; 0.003), greater WML grade (β &lt; −0.39, p &lt; 0.0002), and/or poorer cognitive function (β &lt; −0.39, p &lt; 0.0001) had slower walking speed in single- and/or dual-task conditions. The SEM model demonstrated significant total effects of hypertension on walking speed, and such effects were mediated by BP complexity only, or BP complexity, WML grade, and cognitive function together.</p><p>Conclusion: This study demonstrates the cross-sectional association between the complexity of continuous beat-to-beat BP fluctuation, WML grade, cognitive function, and walking speed in hypertensive and normotensive older adults, revealing a potential mechanism that hypertension may affect walking performance in older adults through diminished BP complexity, increased WML grade, and decreased cognitive function, and BP complexity is an important factor for such effects. Future longitudinal studies are warranted to confirm the findings in this study.</p>

<p>Alzheimer disease (AD) is an aging-related disorder linked to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The main pathologic feature of AD is the presence of extracellular senile plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain. In neurodegenerative diseases, the unfolded protein response (UPR) induced by ER stress ensures cell survival. Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) protects against ER stress and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. MANF is expressed in neurons of the brain and spinal cord. However, there have been no investigations on MANF expression in the brain of AD patients. This was addressed in the present study by immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and quantitative analyses of postmortem brain specimens. We examined the localization and expression levels of MANF in the inferior temporal gyrus of the cortex (ITGC) in AD patients (n = 5), preclinical (pre-)AD patients (n = 5), and age-matched non-dementia controls (n = 5) by double immunofluorescence labeling with antibodies against the neuron-specific nuclear protein neuronal nuclei (NeuN), ER chaperone protein 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), and MANF. The results showed that MANF was mainly expressed in neurons of the ITGC in all 3 groups; However, the number of MANF-positive neurons was significantly higher in pre-AD (Braak stage III/IV) and AD (Braak stage V/VI) patients than that in the control group. Thus, MANF is overexpressed in AD and pre-AD, suggesting that it can serve as a diagnostic marker for early stage disease.</p>

Background<p>Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε2 is a protective genetic factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the potential interaction effects between the APOE ε2 allele and disease status on the intrinsic brain activity remain elusive.</p>Methods<p>We identified 73 healthy control (HC) with APOE ε3/ε3, 61 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects with APOE ε3/ε3, 24 HC with APOE ε2/ε3, and 10 MCI subjects with APOE ε2/ε3 from the ADNI database. All subjects underwent a resting-state functional MRI and Fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). We used a fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) to explore the spontaneous brain activity. Based on the mixed-effects analysis, we explored the interaction effects between the APOE ε2 allele versus disease status on brain activity and metabolism in a voxel-wise fashion (GRF corrected, p &lt; 0.01), followed by post hoc two-sample t-tests (Bonferroni corrected, p &lt; 0.05). We then investigated the relationship between the mean imaging metrics and cognitive abilities.</p>Results<p>There are no significant differences in gender, age, or education among the four groups. The interaction effect on brain activity was located in the inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Post hoc analysis showed that APOE ε2/ε3 MCI had an increased IPL fALFF than APOE ε3/ε3 MCI. Regarding the APOE ε2 allele effects, we found that ε2 carriers had a decreased fALFF in the transverse temporal gyrus than non-carriers. Also, FDG-PET results showed a lower SUVR of the frontal lobe in APOE ε2 carriers than non-carriers. Furthermore, fALFF of IPL was correlated with the visuospatial function (r = −0.16, p &lt; 0.05).</p>Conclusion<p>APOE ε2 carriers might have a better brain reservation when coping with AD-related pathologies.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/68274">GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor auxiliary subunits modulate Cav2.3-mediated release from medial habenula terminals</a></h4>

The synaptic connection from medial habenula (MHb) to interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) is critical for emotion-related behaviors, and uniquely expresses R-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Cav2.3) and auxiliary GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor (GBR) subunits, the K<sup>+</sup>-channel tetramerization domain-containing proteins (KCTDs). Activation of GBRs facilitates or inhibits transmitter release from MHb terminals depending on the IPN subnucleus, but the role of KCTDs is unknown. We therefore examined the localization and function of Cav2.3, GBRs, and KCTDs in this pathway in mice. We show in heterologous cells that KCTD8 and KCTD12b directly bind to Cav2.3 and that KCTD8 potentiates Cav2.3 currents in the absence of GBRs. In the rostral IPN, KCTD8, KCTD12b and Cav2.3 co-localize at the presynaptic active zone. Genetic deletion indicated a bidirectional modulation of Cav2.3-mediated release by these KCTDs with a compensatory increase of KCTD8 in the active zone in KCTD12b-deficient mice. The interaction of Cav2.3 with KCTDs therefore scales synaptic strength independent of GBR activation.

The human genome encodes thousands of non-coding RNAs. Many of these terminate early and are then rapidly degraded, but how their transcription is restricted is poorly understood. In a screen for protein-coding gene transcriptional termination factors, we identified ZC3H4. Its depletion causes upregulation and extension of hundreds of unstable transcripts, particularly antisense RNAs and those transcribed from so-called super-enhancers. These loci are occupied by ZC3H4, suggesting that it directly functions in their transcription. Consistently, engineered tethering of ZC3H4 to reporter RNA promotes its degradation by the exosome. ZC3H4 is predominantly metazoan - interesting when considering its impact on enhancer RNAs that are less prominent in single-celled organisms. Finally, ZC3H4 loss causes a substantial reduction in cell proliferation, highlighting its overall importance. In summary, we identify ZC3H4 as playing an important role in restricting non-coding transcription in multi-cellular organisms.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64457">The causal role of auditory cortex in auditory working memory</a></h4>

Working memory (WM), the ability to actively hold information in memory over a delay period of seconds, is a fundamental constituent of cognition. Delay-period activity in sensory cortices has been observed in WM tasks, but whether and when the activity plays a functional role for memory maintenance remains unclear. Here we investigated the causal role of auditory cortex (AC) for memory maintenance in mice performing an auditory WM task. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that AC neurons were active not only during the presentation of the auditory stimulus but also early in the delay period. Furthermore, optogenetic suppression of neural activity in AC during the stimulus epoch and early delay period impaired WM performance, whereas suppression later in the delay period did not. Thus, AC is essential for information encoding and maintenance in auditory WM task, especially during the early delay period.

Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) is a vascular sarcoma that metastasizes early in its clinical course and lacks an effective medical therapy. The TAZ-CAMTA1 and YAP-TFE3 fusion proteins are chimeric transcription factors and initiating oncogenic drivers of EHE. A combined proteomic/genetic screen in human cell lines identified YEATS2 and ZZZ3, components of the Ada2a-containing histone acetyltransferase (ATAC) complex, as key interactors of both fusion proteins despite the dissimilarity of the C terminal fusion partners CAMTA1 and TFE3. Integrative next generation sequencing approaches in human and murine cell lines showed that the fusion proteins drive a unique transcriptome by simultaneously hyperactivating a TEAD-based transcriptional program and modulating the chromatin environment via interaction with the ATAC complex. Interaction of the ATAC complex with both fusion proteins indicates that it is a key oncogenic driver and unifying enzymatic therapeutic target for this sarcoma. This study presents an approach to mechanistically dissect how chimeric transcription factors drive the formation of human cancers.

We demonstrate a critical role for ERK signaling in microglia in Alzheimer’s disease using a preclinical model of Alzheimer’s disease pathology and quantitative studies of postmortem human brains.

Abstract
The importance of mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway signaling in regulating microglia‐mediated neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. We examined the role of MAPK signaling in microglia using a preclinical model of AD pathology and quantitative proteomics studies of postmortem human brains. In multiplex immunoassay analyses of MAPK phosphoproteins in acutely isolated microglia and brain tissue from 5xFAD mice, we found phosphorylated extracellular signal‐regulated kinase (ERK) was the most strongly upregulated phosphoprotein within the MAPK pathway in acutely isolated microglia, but not whole‐brain tissue from 5xFAD mice. The importance of ERK signaling in primary microglia cultures was next investigated using transcriptomic profiling and functional assays of amyloid‐β and neuronal phagocytosis, which confirmed that ERK is a critical regulator of IFNγ‐mediated pro‐inflammatory activation of microglia, although it was also partly important for constitutive microglial functions. Phospho‐ERK was an upstream regulator of disease‐associated microglial gene expression (Trem2, Tyrobp), as well as several human AD risk genes (Bin1, Cd33, Trem2, Cnn2), indicative of the importance of microglial ERK signaling in AD pathology. Quantitative proteomic analyses of postmortem human brain showed that ERK1 and ERK2 were the only MAPK proteins with increased protein expression and positive associations with neuropathological grade. In a human brain phosphoproteomic study, we found evidence for increased flux through the ERK signaling pathway in AD. Overall, our analyses strongly suggest that ERK phosphorylation, particularly in microglia in mouse models, is a regulator of pro‐inflammatory immune responses in AD pathogenesis.

The lateral hypothalamus (LH) is a center for the control of wakefulness. The present study reveals an important role of excitatory LH glutamatergic neurons in controlling wakefulness. Activation of LH glutamatergic neurons induces rapid transitions from sleep to wakefulness and maintains wakefulness, whereas their inhibition decreases wakefulness and increases sleep.

Abstract
The lateral hypothalamus (LH) plays a key role in the maintenance of cortical activation and wakefulness. In the LH, the two main neuronal cell populations consist of excitatory glutamatergic neurons and inhibitory GABAergic neurons. Recent studies have shown that inhibitory LH GABAergic neurons are wake‐promoting. However, the mechanism by which excitatory LH glutamatergic neurons contribute to sleep‐wake regulation remains unclear. Using fiber photometry in male mice, we demonstrated that LH glutamatergic neurons exhibited high activities during both wakefulness and rapid eye movement sleep. Chemogenetic activation of LH glutamatergic neurons induced an increase in wakefulness that lasted for 6 hr, whereas suppression of LH glutamatergic neuronal activity caused a reduction in wakefulness. Brief optogenetic activation of LH glutamatergic neurons induced an immediate transition from slow‐wave sleep to wakefulness, and long‐lasting optogenetic stimulation of these neurons maintained wakefulness. Moreover, we found that LH‐locus coeruleus/parabrachial nucleus and LH‐basal forebrain projections mediated the wake‐promoting effects of LH glutamatergic neurons. Taken together, our data indicate that LH glutamatergic neurons are essential for the induction and maintenance of wakefulness. The results presented here may advance our understanding of the role of LH in the control of wakefulness.

Using genetic deletion in mice, we demonstrate that extracellular signal‐regulated kinase 5 (Erk5) plays important roles in central sensitization in formalin‐induced inflammatory pain. Extracellular signal‐regulated kinase 2 and Erk5 are involved in discrete but parallel mechanisms underlying central sensitization in the early second phase of formalin‐induced nociceptive behaviors. 

Abstract
Nervous systems are designed to become extra sensitive to afferent nociceptive stimuli under certain circumstances such as inflammation and nerve injury. How pain hypersensitivity comes about is key issue in the field since it ultimately results in chronic pain. Central sensitization represents enhanced pain sensitivity due to increased neural signaling within the central nervous system (CNS). Particularly, much evidence indicates that underlying mechanism of central sensitization is associated with the change of spinal neurons. Extracellular signal‐regulated kinases have received attention as key molecules in central sensitization. Previously, we revealed the isoform‐specific function of extracellular signal‐regulated kinase 2 (Erk2) in spinal neurons for central sensitization using mice with Cre‐loxP‐mediated deletion of Erk2 in the CNS. Still, how extracellular signal‐regulated kinase 5 (Erk5) in spinal neurons contributes to central sensitization has not been directly tested, nor is the functional relevance of Erk5 and Erk2 known. Here, we show that Erk5 and Erk2 in the CNS play redundant and/or distinct roles in central sensitization, depending on the plasticity context (cell types, pain types, time, etc.). We used male mice with Erk5 deletion specifically in the CNS and found that Erk5 plays important roles in central sensitization in a formalin‐induced inflammatory pain model. Deletion of both Erk2 and Erk5 leads to greater attenuation of central sensitization in this model, compared to deletion of either isoform alone. Conversely, Erk2 but not Erk5 plays important roles in central sensitization in neuropathic pain, a type of chronic pain caused by nerve damage. Our results suggest the elaborate mechanisms of Erk signaling in central sensitization.

Chronic epilepsy resulted in behavioral excitability, decreased basal synaptic transmission, and synaptophysin expression, which was ameliorated by exposure to enriched environment.

Abstract
Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of focal epilepsies. Pharmacoresistance and comorbidities pose significant challenges to its treatment necessitating the development of non‐pharmacological approaches. In an earlier study, exposure to enriched environment (EE) reduced seizure frequency and duration and ameliorated chronic epilepsy‐induced depression in rats. However, the cellular basis of beneficial effects of EE remains unknown. Accordingly, in the current study, we evaluated the effects of EE in chronic epilepsy‐induced changes in behavioral hyperexcitability, synaptic transmission, synaptophysin (SYN), and calbindin (CB) expression, hippocampal subfield volumes and cell density in male Wistar rats. Epilepsy was induced by lithium–pilocarpine‐induced status epilepticus. Chronic epilepsy resulted in behavioral hyperexcitability, decreased basal synaptic transmission, increased paired‐pulse facilitation ratio, decreased hippocampal subfields volumes. Moreover, epileptic rats showed decreased synaptophysin and CB expression in the hippocampus. Six weeks post‐SE, epileptic rats were exposed to EE for 2 weeks, 6 hr/day. EE significantly reduced the behavioral hyperexcitability and restored basal synaptic transmission correlating with increased expression of SYN and CB. Our results reaffirm the beneficial effects of EE on behavior in chronic epilepsy and establishes some of the putative cellular mechanisms. Since drug resistance and comorbidities are a major concern in TLE, we propose EE as a potent non‐pharmacological treatment modality to mitigate these changes in chronic epilepsy.

Abstract
Stroke‐related damage to the crossed lateral corticospinal tract causes motor deficits in the contralateral (paretic) limb. To restore functional movement in the paretic limb, the nervous system may increase its reliance on ipsilaterally descending motor pathways, including the uncrossed lateral corticospinal tract, the reticulospinal tract, the rubrospinal tract, and the vestibulospinal tract. Our knowledge about the role of these pathways for upper limb motor recovery is incomplete, and even less is known about the role of these pathways for lower limb motor recovery. Understanding the role of ipsilateral motor pathways to paretic lower limb movement and recovery after stroke may help improve our rehabilitative efforts and provide alternate solutions to address stroke‐related impairments. These advances are important because walking and mobility impairments are major contributors to long‐term disability after stroke, and improving walking is a high priority for individuals with stroke. This perspective highlights evidence regarding the contributions of ipsilateral motor pathways from the contralesional hemisphere and spinal interneuronal pathways for paretic lower limb movement and recovery. This perspective also identifies opportunities for future research to expand our knowledge about ipsilateral motor pathways and provides insights into how this information may be used to guide rehabilitation.

GNX‐4728, a mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor, does not protect against hypoxia‐ischemia induced neuronal necrosis in piglet putamen (indicated by bolt strike zone). Acute depletion of mitochondrial SOD2 and developmental differences in mitochondrial proteins, such as CypD, may limit the efficacy of mitochondrial‐targeted drugs for neonatal brain injury.

Abstract
Neonatal hypoxic‐ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) causes significant morbidity despite treatment with therapeutic hypothermia. Mitochondrial dysfunction may drive the mechanisms underlying neuronal cell death, thereby making mitochondria prime targets for neuroprotection. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is one such target within mitochondria. In adult animal models, mPTP inhibition is neuroprotective. However, evidence for mPTP inhibition in neonatal models of neurologic disease is less certain. We tested the therapeutic efficacy of the mPTP small molecule inhibitor GNX‐4728 and examined the developmental presence of brain mPTP proteins for drug targeting in a neonatal piglet model of hypoxic‐ischemic brain injury. Male neonatal piglets were randomized to hypoxia‐ischemia (HI) or sham procedure with GNX‐4728 (15 mg/kg, IV) or vehicle (saline/cyclodextrin/DMSO, IV). GNX‐4728 was administered as a single dose within 5 min after resuscitation from bradycardic arrest. Normal, ischemic, and injured neurons were counted in putamen and somatosensory cortex using hematoxylin and eosin staining. In separate neonatal and juvenile pigs, western blots of putamen mitochondrial‐enriched fractions were used to evaluate mitochondrial integrity and the presence of mPTP proteins. We found that a single dose of GNX‐4728 did not protect putamen and cortical neurons from cell death after HI. However, loss of mitochondrial matrix integrity occurred within 6h after HI, and while mPTP components are present in the neonatal brain their levels were significantly different compared to that of a mature juvenile brain. Thus, the neonatal brain mPTP may not be a good target for current neurotherapeutic drugs that are developed based on adult mitochondria.

The study revealed a significant reduction of frequency and severity of seizure in patients of generalized epilepsy with generalized onset motor seizures in adults who were treated with valproate and melatonin

Abstract
Epilepsy treatment is challenging because of multiple impediments like lack of efficacy of monotherapy, adverse drug reactions, and different comorbidities. Add‐on therapy to first‐line antiepileptics may be the option to overcome therapeutic hurdles. The present randomized, double‐blind, add‐on placebo‐controlled clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of add‐on melatonin in the treatment of generalized epilepsy with generalized onset motor seizure in adults. The control group (n = 52) received add‐on placebo, and the test group (n = 52) received add‐on melatonin (3 mg/day) with valproate (20 mg/kg in two divided doses). Clinical evaluation of seizure frequency, Chalfont‐National Hospital seizure severity scale (NHS3), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), quality of life in epilepsy inventory, Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), and biochemical estimation of serum neuron‐specific enolase (NSE) and glutathione reductase were done at baseline and compared with follow‐up at 8 weeks. Among 104 patients randomized [mean (SD) age of 27.6 (11.5); 84 (80.8%) male], 88 (84.6%) completed the trial. The responder rate and seizure‐free rate in the test group were significantly (p = 0.006 and 0.034) higher than the control group. There was a significantly higher reduction in the frequency of seizures (p = 0.016) and NHS3 (−2.39; 95%CI: −4.56 to −0.21; p = 0.032) in the test group compared to the control group. Similarly, improvement in PSQI (−1.40; 95%CI: −2.64 to −0.15; p = 0.029) was significantly better in the test group. There was no significant difference in the change in ESS (p = 0.621) and quality of life scoring (p = 0.456) between the study groups. The decrease in serum NSE was significantly higher with the test group compared to the control group (−2.01; 95% CI: −3.74 to −0.27; p = 0.024). Add‐on melatonin increased serum glutathione reductase significantly (p = 0.038), but there was no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.685). Add‐on melatonin with valproate for generalized epilepsy with generalized onset motor seizures in adults can achieve a significantly better clinical outcome by reducing the seizure frequency, severity and attaining a better seizure‐free rate in comparison to the control group.

Abstract
Ground state depletion followed by individual molecule return microscopy (GSDIM) has been used in the past to study the nanoscale distribution of protein co‐localization in living cells. We now demonstrate the successful application of GSDIM to archival human brain tissue sections including from Alzheimer's disease cases as well as experimental tissue samples from mouse and zebrafish larvae. Presynaptic terminals and microglia and their cell processes were visualized at a resolution beyond diffraction‐limited light microscopy, allowing clearer insights into their interactions in situ. The procedure described here offers time and cost savings compared to electron microscopy and opens the spectrum of molecular imaging using antibodies and super‐resolution microscopy to the analysis of routine formalin‐fixed paraffin sections of archival human brain. The investigation of microglia–synapse interactions in dementia will be of special interest in this context.

Schematic drawing of the olfactory system. Olfactory mucosa contains olfactory receptor neurons (yellow), extending from the olfactory epithelia to the olfactory bulb (OB). Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) ensheath axons of olfactory receptor neurons until they reach glomeruli. Two subtypes of OECs residing within olfactory mucosa (OM) and OB and named accordingly as OM‐OECs (purple) and OB‐OECs (blue), respectively. Two subtypes of OECs with their secretions, affecting neuronal repair on spinal cord injuries (SCI) differently. OM‐OECs secrete molecules related to extracellular matrix remodeling such as laminin, fibronectin, matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), and transforming growth factor‐β3 (TGF‐β3). Meanwhile, OB‐OECs secrete molecules promoting neuronal proliferation and axonal growth such as NGF, GDNF, BDNF neuregulin, and other neurotrophins

Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is generally the consequence of physical damage, which may result in devastating consequences such as paraplegia or paralysis. Some certain candidates for SCI repair are olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), which are unique glial cells located in the transition region of the peripheral nervous system and central nervous system and perform neuron regeneration in the olfactory system throughout life. Culture studies have clarified many properties of OECs, but their mechanisms of actions are not fully understood. Successful results achieved in animal models showcased that SCI treatment with OEC transplants is suitable for clinical trials. However, clinical trials are limited by difficulties like cell acquisition for autograft transplantation. Despite the improvements in both animal and clinical studies so far, there is still insufficient information about the mechanism of actions, adverse effects, proper application methods, effective subtypes, and sources of cells. This review summarizes pre‐clinical and clinical literature focused on the cellular characterization of both OECs in vitro and post‐transplantation. We highlight the roles and effects of OECs on (a) the injury‐induced glial milieu, (b) neuronal growth/regeneration, and (c) functional recovery after injury. Due to the shown benefits of OECs with in vitro and animal studies and a limited number of clinical trials, where safety and effectivity were shown, it is necessary to conduct more studies on OECs to obtain effective and feasible treatment methods.

Abstract
Glutamate transporter proteins, expressed on both neurons and glia, serve as the main gatekeepers that dictate the spatial and temporal actions of extracellular glutamate. Glutamate is essential to the function of the healthy brain yet paradoxically contributes to the toxicity associated with many neurodegenerative diseases. Rapid transporter‐mediated glutamate uptake, primarily occurring at astrocytic processes, tightens the efficiency of excitatory network activity and prevents toxic glutamate build‐up in the extracellular space. Glutamate transporter dysfunction is thought to underlie myriad central nervous system (CNS) diseases including Alzheimer and Huntington disease. Over the past few decades, techniques such as biochemical uptake assays and electrophysiological recordings of transporter currents from individual astrocytes have revealed the remarkable ability of the CNS to efficiently clear extracellular glutamate. In more recent years, the rapidly evolving glutamate‐sensing “sniffers” now allow researchers to visualize real‐time glutamate transients on a millisecond time scale with single synapse spatial resolution in defined cell populations. As we transition to an increased reliance on optical‐based methods of glutamate visualization and quantification, it is of utmost importance to understand not only the advantages that glutamate biosensors bring to the table but also the associated caveats and their implications for data interpretation. In this review, we summarize the strengths and limitations of the commonly used methods to quantify glutamate uptake. We then discuss what these techniques, when viewed as a complementary whole, have told us about the brain's ability to regulate glutamate levels, in both health and in the context of neurodegenerative disease.

Two‐dimensional (2D) gene expression snapshots cannot properly reflect the volumes, positions, or overlapped domains of multiple genes in tissues that are organized in three‐dimensional (3D) naturally. Novel approach, combing fluorescent antisense mRNA labeling, confocal z‐stack acquisition, and 3D image alignment tool, has uncovered what have been overlooked by 2D images.

Abstract
The conserved bilateral habenular nuclei (HA) in vertebrate diencephalon develop into compartmentalized structures containing neurons derived from different cell lineages. Despite extensive studies demonstrated that zebrafish larval HA display distinct left–right (L‐R) asymmetry in gene expression and connectivity, the spatial gene expression domains were mainly obtained from two‐dimensional (2D) snapshots of colorimetric RNA in situ hybridization staining which could not properly reflect different HA neuronal lineages constructed in three‐dimension (3D). Combing the tyramide‐based fluorescent mRNA in situ hybridization, confocal microscopy and customized imaging processing procedures, we have created spatial distribution maps of four genes for 4‐day‐old zebrafish and in sibling fish whose L‐R asymmetry was spontaneously reversed. 3D volumetric analyses showed that ratios of cpd2, lov, ron, and nrp1a expression in L‐R reversed HA were reversed according to the parapineal positions. However, the quantitative changes of gene expression in reversed larval brains do not mirror the gene expression level in the obverse larval brains. There were a total 87.78% increase in lov+nrp1a+ and a total 12.45% decrease in lov+ron+ double‐positive neurons when the L‐R asymmetry of HA was reversed. Thus, our volumetric analyses of the 3D maps indicate that changes of HA neuronal cell fates are associated with the reversal of HA laterality. These changes likely account for the behavior changes associated with HA laterality alterations.

Open Practical Laboratories in Neurosciences are outreach activities aimed towards middle schoo students in the Brazilian Amazon, discussing neuroscience topics. The outreach led to immediate benefits on attitudes towards science and scientists, which led to better understanding of the neurosciences.

Abstract
The Open Practical Laboratory in the Neurosciences is an outreach program that seeks to improve the knowledge of the neurosciences by elementary school students and to promote better attitudes in relation to neuroscience, science in general, and scientists. It consists in practical and demonstration activities on the theme of the neurosciences. This outreach strategy was applied in four public schools in a municipality in Southeastern Pará, Brazil characterized by low performance in educational reviews in Brazil. Students from both sexes from 9th grade (last grade before high school) were enrolled in the program. The outreach program improved students’ knowledge about the neurosciences, and promoted better attitudes in relation to science and scientists, in comparison to students who did not go through the activities. Results suggest that scientific outreach strategies can produce results beyond immediate increases in knowledge, promoting better attitudes in relation to science.

Traumatic contusion to the primary somatosensory and motor cortices is delivered to the exposed left forebrain. Sensorimotor dysfunction is tested every other day for the first week post‐injury (PI) and weekly thereafter up to 8 weeks PI. The impacted cortical area was harvested at 4 hours (h), 12h, 24h, 7 days (d), 14d, and 8 weeks PI and sampled for cytokine and chemokine levels using multiplex electro‐chemiluminescent immunoassays.

Abstract
Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States. Acute trauma to the brain triggers chronic secondary injury mechanisms that contribute to long‐term neurological impairment. We have developed a single, unilateral contusion injury model of sensorimotor dysfunction in adult mice. By targeting a topographically defined neurological circuit with a mild impact, we are able to track sustained behavioral deficits in sensorimotor function in the absence of tissue cavitation or neuronal loss in the contused cortex of these mice. Stereological histopathology and multiplex enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay proteomic screening confirm contusion resulted in chronic gliosis and the robust expression of innate immune cytokines and monocyte attractant chemokines IL‐1β, IL‐5, IL‐6, TNFα, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL10, CCL2, and CCL3 in the contused cortex. In contrast, the expression of neuroinflammatory proteins with adaptive immune functions was not significantly modulated by injury. Our data support widespread activation of innate but not adaptive immune responses, confirming an association between sensorimotor dysfunction with innate immune activation in the absence of tissue or neuronal loss in our mice.

<p>by Anna Laddach, Joseph Chi Fung Ng, Franca Fraternali</p>

Missense variants are present amongst the healthy population, but some of them are causative of human diseases. A classification of variants associated with “healthy” or “diseased” states is therefore not always straightforward. A deeper understanding of the nature of missense variants in health and disease, the cellular processes they may affect, and the general molecular principles which underlie these differences is essential to offer mechanistic explanations of the true impact of pathogenic variants. Here, we have formalised a statistical framework which enables robust probabilistic quantification of variant enrichment across full-length proteins, their domains, and 3D structure-defined regions. Using this framework, we validate and extend previously reported trends of variant enrichment in different protein structural regions (surface/core/interface). By examining the association of variant enrichment with available functional pathways and transcriptomic and proteomic (protein half-life, thermal stability, abundance) data, we have mined a rich set of molecular features which distinguish between pathogenic and population variants: Pathogenic variants mainly affect proteins involved in cell proliferation and nucleotide processing and are enriched in more abundant proteins. Additionally, rare population variants display features closer to common than pathogenic variants. We validate the association between these molecular features and variant pathogenicity by comparing against existing in silico variant impact annotations. This study provides molecular details into how different proteins exhibit resilience and/or sensitivity towards missense variants and provides the rationale to prioritise variant-enriched proteins and protein domains for therapeutic targeting and development. The ZoomVar database, which we created for this study, is available at fraternalilab.kcl.ac.uk/ZoomVar. It allows users to programmatically annotate missense variants with protein structural information and to calculate variant enrichment in different protein structural regions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0DgtYVlHHq4" width="1" />

<p>by David Pantoja-Uceda, Cristiana Stuani, Douglas V. Laurents, Ann E. McDermott, Emanuele Buratti, Miguel Mompeán</p>

Transactive response DNA-binding Protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) assembles various aggregate forms, including biomolecular condensates or functional and pathological amyloids, with roles in disparate scenarios (e.g., muscle regeneration versus neurodegeneration). The link between condensates and fibrils remains unclear, just as the factors controlling conformational transitions within these aggregate species: Salt- or RNA-induced droplets may evolve into fibrils or remain in the droplet form, suggesting distinct end point species of different aggregation pathways. Using microscopy and NMR methods, we unexpectedly observed in vitro droplet formation in the absence of salts or RNAs and provided visual evidence for fibrillization at the droplet surface/solvent interface but not the droplet interior. Our NMR analyses unambiguously uncovered a distinct amyloid conformation in which Phe-Gly motifs are key elements of the reconstituted fibril form, suggesting a pivotal role for these residues in creating the fibril core. This contrasts the minor participation of Phe-Gly motifs in initiation of the droplet form. Our results point to an intrinsic (i.e., non-induced) aggregation pathway that may exist over a broad range of conditions and illustrate structural features that distinguishes between aggregate forms.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qxuZfjMzSJg" width="1" />

<p>by Rebecca R. Helm</p>

Life on the ocean’s surface connects worlds. From shallow waters to the deep sea, the open ocean to rivers and lakes, numerous terrestrial and marine species depend on the surface ecosystem and the organisms found therein. Organisms that live freely at the surface, termed “neuston,” include keystone organisms like the golden seaweed <i>Sargassum</i> that makes up the Sargasso Sea, floating barnacles, snails, nudibranchs, and cnidarians. Many ecologically and economically important fish species live as or rely upon neuston. Species at the surface are not distributed uniformly; the ocean’s surface harbors unique neustonic communities and ecoregions found at only certain latitudes and only in specific ocean basins. But the surface is also on the front line of climate change and pollution. Despite the diversity and importance of the ocean’s surface in connecting disparate habitats, and the risks it faces, we know very little about neustonic life. This Essay will introduce you to the neuston, their connections to diverse habitats, the threats they face, and new opportunities for research and discovery at the air-sea interface.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/fSSDTi67MjA" width="1" />

Layer 6 corticothalamic neurons (L6 CThNs) in primary somatosensory cortex of the rodent are morphologically diverse. This study shows that one class of L6 CThNs receives more widespread presynaptic inputs than the other and projects to different regions of the thalamic reticular nucleus, suggesting that these two types of L6 CThNs represent distinct information streams in somatosensory cortex.







ABSTRACT
Although corticothalamic neurons (CThNs) represent the largest source of synaptic input to thalamic neurons, their role in regulating thalamocortical interactions remains incompletely understood. CThNs in sensory cortex have historically been divided into two types, those with cell bodies in layer 6 (L6) that project back to primary sensory thalamic nuclei and those with cell bodies in layer 5 (L5) that project to higher order thalamic nuclei and subcortical structures. Recently, diversity among L6 CThNs has increasingly been appreciated. In the rodent somatosensory cortex, two major classes of L6 CThNs have been identified: one projecting to the ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPM‐only L6 CThNs) and one projecting to both VPM and the posterior medial nucleus (VPM/POm L6 CThNs). Using rabies‐based tracing methods in mice, we asked whether these L6 CThN populations integrate similar synaptic inputs. We found that both types of L6 CThNs received local input from somatosensory cortex and thalamic input from VPM and POm. However, VPM/POm L6 CThNs received significantly more input from a number of additional cortical areas, higher order thalamic nuclei, and subcortical structures. We also found that the two types of L6 CThNs target different functional regions within the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). Together, our results indicate that these two types of L6 CThNs represent distinct information streams in the somatosensory cortex and suggest that VPM‐only L6 CThNs regulate, via their more restricted circuits, sensory responses related to a cortical column while VPM/POm L6 CThNs, which are integrated into more widespread POm‐related circuits, relay contextual information.

Memory formation requires initiation of new protein synthesis as well as protein synthesis in dendrites, but it is unknown whether initiation can happen within dendritic spines. We combined immunolabeling with serial section 3D electron microscopy to examine the distribution of three initiation factors, eIF4E, eIF4G1, and eIF2α in dendritic spines of the lateral amygdala during formation of a Pavlovian conditioning memory. Top row: Electron micrographs showing labeled spines (arrows) with synapses (arrowheads). Bottom left: Segment of dendrite reconstructed from serial sections with synapses shown in red. Bottom right: The percentage of spines containing labeling for eIF4E was higher after training, but there were no differences for eIF4G1 or eIF2α labeling.







Abstract
Local translation can provide a rapid, spatially targeted supply of new proteins in distal dendrites to support synaptic changes that underlie learning. Learning and memory are especially sensitive to manipulations of translational control mechanisms, particularly those that target the initiation step, and translation initiation at synapses could be a means of maintaining synapse specificity during plasticity. Initiation predominantly occurs via recruitment of ribosomes to the 5′ mRNA cap by complexes of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), and the interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G1 is a particularly important target of translational control pathways. Pharmacological inhibition of eIF4E–eIF4G1 binding impairs formation of memory for aversive Pavlovian conditioning as well as the accompanying increase in polyribosomes in the heads of dendritic spines in the lateral amygdala (LA). This is consistent with a role for initiation at synapses in memory formation, but whether eIFs are even present near synapses is unknown. To determine whether dendritic spines contain eIFs and whether eIF distribution is affected by learning, we combined immunolabeling with serial section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) volume reconstructions of LA dendrites after Pavlovian conditioning. Labeling for eIF4E, eIF4G1, and eIF2α—another key target of regulation—occurred in roughly half of dendritic spines, but learning effects were only found for eIF4E, which was upregulated in the heads of dendritic spines. Our results support the possibility of regulated translation initiation as a means of synapse‐specific protein targeting during learning and are consistent with the model of eIF4E availability as a central point of control.

<p>Image classification models can depend on multiple different semantic
attributes of the image. An explanation of the decision of the classifier needs
to both discover and visualize these properties. Here we present StylEx, a
method for doing this, by training a generative model to specifically explain
multiple attributes that underlie classifier decisions. A natural source for
such attributes is the StyleSpace of StyleGAN, which is known to generate
semantically meaningful dimensions in the image. However, because standard GAN
training is not dependent on the classifier, it may not represent these
attributes which are important for the classifier decision, and the dimensions
of StyleSpace may represent irrelevant attributes. To overcome this, we propose
a training procedure for a StyleGAN, which incorporates the classifier model,
in order to learn a classifier-specific StyleSpace. Explanatory attributes are
then selected from this space. These can be used to visualize the effect of
changing multiple attributes per image, thus providing image-specific
explanations. We apply StylEx to multiple domains, including animals, leaves,
faces and retinal images. For these, we show how an image can be modified in
different ways to change its classifier output. Our results show that the
method finds attributes that align well with semantic ones, generate meaningful
image-specific explanations, and are human-interpretable as measured in
user-studies.

<p>Minimizing cross-entropy is a widely used method for training artificial
neural networks. Many training procedures based on backpropagation use
cross-entropy directly as their loss function. Instead, this theoretical essay
investigates a dual process model with two processes, in which one process
minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence while its dual counterpart minimizes
the Shannon entropy. Postulating that learning consists of two dual processes
complementing each other, the model defines an equilibrium state for both
processes in which the loss function assumes its minimum. An advantage of the
proposed model is that it allows deriving the optimal learning rate and
momentum weight to update network weights for backpropagation. Furthermore, the
model introduces the golden ratio and complex numbers as important new concepts
in machine learning.

<p>Pooling different opinions and weighting them according to their reliability
is conducive to making good decisions. We demonstrate that single cortical
neurons, through the biophysics of conductance-based coupling, perform such
complex probabilistic computations via their natural dynamics. While the
effective computation can be described as a feedforward process, the
implementation critically relies on the bidirectional current flow along the
dendritic tree. We suggest that dendritic membrane potentials and conductances
encode opinions and their associated reliabilities, on which the soma acts as a
decision maker. Furthermore, we derive gradient-based plasticity rules,
allowing neurons to learn to represent desired target distributions and to
weight afferents according to their reliability. Our theory shows how neurons
perform Bayes-optimal cue integration. It also explains various experimental
findings, both on the system and on the single-cell level, and makes new,
testable predictions for intracortical neuron and synapse dynamics.

<p>In practise, it is often desirable to provide the decision-maker with a rich
set of diverse solutions of decent quality instead of just a single solution.
In this paper we study evolutionary diversity optimization for the knapsack
problem (KP). Our goal is to evolve a population of solutions that all have a
profit of at least $(1-\varepsilon)\cdot OPT$, where OPT is the value of an
optimal solution. Furthermore, they should differ in structure with respect to
an entropy-based diversity measure. To this end we propose a simple
$(\mu+1)$-EA with initial approximate solutions calculated by a well-known
FPTAS for the KP. We investigate the effect of different standard mutation
operators and introduce biased mutation and crossover which puts strong
probability on flipping bits of low and/or high frequency within the
population. An experimental study on different instances and settings shows
that the proposed mutation operators in most cases perform slightly inferior in
the long term, but show strong benefits if the number of function evaluations
is severely limited.

<p>When designing a benchmark problem set, it is important to create a set of
benchmark problems that are a good generalization of the set of all possible
problems. One possible way of easing this difficult task is by using
artificially generated problems. In this paper, one such single-objective
continuous problem generation approach is analyzed and compared with the COCO
benchmark problem set, a well know problem set for benchmarking numerical
optimization algorithms. Using Exploratory Landscape Analysis and Singular
Value Decomposition, we show that such representations allow us to further
explore the relations between the problems by applying visualization and
correlation analysis techniques, with the goal of decreasing the bias in
benchmark problem assessment.

<p>Raman spectroscopy is a powerful and non-invasive method for analysis of
chemicals and detection of unknown substances. However, Raman signal is so weak
that background noise can distort the actual Raman signal. These baseline
shifts that exist in the Raman spectrum might deteriorate analytical results.
In this paper, a modified version of active contour models in one-dimensional
space has been proposed for the baseline correction of Raman spectra. Our
technique, inspired by principles of physics and heuristic optimization
methods, iteratively deforms an initialized curve toward the desired baseline.
The performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated and compared with
similar techniques using simulated Raman spectra. The results showed that the
1D active contour model outperforms many iterative baseline correction methods.
The proposed algorithm was successfully applied to experimental Raman spectral
data, and the results indicate that the baseline of Raman spectra can be
automatically subtracted.

<p>This article describes a neural model of the anatomy, neurophysiology, and functions of intrinsic and extrinsic theta rhythms in the brains of multiple species. Topics include how theta rhythms were discovered; how theta rhythms organize brain information processing into temporal series of spatial patterns; how distinct theta rhythms occur within area CA1 of the hippocampus and between the septum and area CA3 of the hippocampus; what functions theta rhythms carry out in different brain regions, notably CA1-supported functions like learning, recognition, and memory that involve visual, cognitive, and emotional processes; how spatial navigation, adaptively timed learning, and category learning interact with hippocampal theta rhythms; how parallel cortical streams through the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) represent the end-points of the What cortical stream for perception and cognition and the Where cortical stream for spatial representation and action; how the neuromodulator acetylcholine interacts with the septo-hippocampal theta rhythm and modulates category learning; what functions are carried out by other brain rhythms, such as gamma and beta oscillations; and how gamma and beta oscillations interact with theta rhythms. Multiple experimental facts about theta rhythms are unified and functionally explained by this theoretical synthesis.</p>

<p>Neurons in the barrel cortex respond preferentially to stimulation of one principal whisker and weakly to several adjacent whiskers. Such integration exists already in layer 4, the pivotal recipient layer of thalamic inputs. Previous studies show that cortical neurons gradually adapt to repeated whisker stimulations and that layer 4 neurons exhibit whisker specific adaptation and no apparent interactions with other whiskers. This study aimed to study the specificity of adaptation of layer 2/3 cortical cells. Towards this aim, we compared the synaptic response of neurons to either repetitive stimulation of one of two responsive whiskers or when repetitive stimulation of the two whiskers was interleaved. We found that in most layer 2/3 cells adaptation is whisker-specific. These findings indicate that despite the multi-whisker receptive fields in the cortex, the adaptation process for each whisker-pathway is mostly independent of other whiskers. A mechanism allowing high responsiveness in complex environments.</p>

<p>This study described the developmental and behavioral characteristics of children identified with idiopathic sensory processing disorder (SPD) as well as the relations among specific types of SPD as proposed by the nosology presented by Miller et al. (2007), adaptive behavior profiles, and behaviors associated with mental functioning. A retrospective, non-experimental design applying descriptive and correlational analyses was used. Data were obtained from clinic medical records of 78 children ages 2 to 7 years who were identified with sensory processing problems affecting daily life, but who did not meet criteria for any other neurodevelopmental or mental disorders following a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation. Results revealed that all SPD types as described by current typologies were well represented with the most common being the over-responsivity sensory modulation subtype. Within the sample, 53% of the children displayed more than one SPD type. Atypical externalizing and internalizing behavior scores associated with various mental disorders as measured by the child behavior checklist (CBCL) fell in the borderline dysfunctional range. Adaptive behavior for all developmental domains was below average, and the severity of SPD symptoms moderately and positively correlated with behaviors associated with mental disorders, and with lower adaptive behavior performance. It was concluded that symptoms characteristic of the various types of idiopathic SPD overlap substantially suggesting that current typologies may include more types/subtypes than are necessary or clinically useful. Children with SPD share similar, but often less severe pathological behaviors associated with other mental or related neurodevelopmental disorders. Psychometrically sound measures of SPD are needed, and further study of the neural mechanisms involved in sensory processing deficits is vital for validating idiopathic SPD as its own diagnostic entity.</p>

<p>In this paper, we propose a graphlet-based topological algorithm for the investigation of the brain network at resting state (RS). To this aim, we model the brain as a graph, where (labeled) nodes correspond to specific cerebral areas and links are weighted connections determined by the intensity of the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Then, we select a number of working graphlets, namely, connected and non-isomorphic induced subgraphs. We compute, for each labeled node, its Graphlet Degree Vector (GDV), which allows us to associate a GDV matrix to each one of the 133 subjects of the considered sample, reporting how many times each node of the atlas “touches” the independent orbits defined by the graphlet set. We focus on the 56 independent columns (i.e., non-redundant orbits) of the GDV matrices. By aggregating their count all over the 133 subjects and then by sorting each column independently, we obtain a sorted node table, whose top-level entries highlight the nodes (i.e., brain regions) most frequently touching each of the 56 independent graphlet orbits. Then, by pairwise comparing the columns of the sorted node table in the top-k entries for various values of k, we identify sets of nodes that are consistently involved with high frequency in the 56 independent graphlet orbits all over the 133 subjects. It turns out that these sets consist of labeled nodes directly belonging to the default mode network (DMN) or strongly interacting with it at the RS, indicating that graphlet analysis provides a viable tool for the topological characterization of such brain regions. We finally provide a validation of the graphlet approach by testing its power in catching network differences. To this aim, we encode in a Graphlet Correlation Matrix (GCM) the network information associated with each subject then construct a subject-to-subject Graphlet Correlation Distance (GCD) matrix based on the Euclidean distances between all possible pairs of GCM. The analysis of the clusters induced by the GCD matrix shows a clear separation of the subjects in two groups, whose relationship with the subject characteristics is investigated.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of age-related dementia. Despite decades of research, the etiology and pathogenesis of AD are not well understood. Brain glucose hypometabolism has long been recognized as a prominent anomaly that occurs in the preclinical stage of AD. Recent studies suggest that glycolytic metabolism, the cytoplasmic pathway of the breakdown of glucose, may play a critical role in the development of AD. Glycolysis is essential for a variety of neural activities in the brain, including energy production, synaptic transmission, and redox homeostasis. Decreased glycolytic flux has been shown to correlate with the severity of amyloid and tau pathology in both preclinical and clinical AD patients. Moreover, increased glucose accumulation found in the brains of AD patients supports the hypothesis that glycolytic deficit may be a contributor to the development of this phenotype. Brain hyperglycemia also provides a plausible explanation for the well-documented link between AD and diabetes. Humans possess three primary variants of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene – ApoE<sup>∗</sup>ϵ2, ApoE<sup>∗</sup>ϵ3, and ApoE<sup>∗</sup>ϵ4 – that confer differential susceptibility to AD. Recent findings indicate that neuronal glycolysis is significantly affected by human ApoE isoforms and glycolytic robustness may serve as a major mechanism that renders an ApoE2-bearing brain more resistant against the neurodegenerative risks for AD. In addition to AD, glycolytic dysfunction has been observed in other neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, strengthening the concept of glycolytic dysfunction as a common pathway leading to neurodegeneration. Taken together, these advances highlight a promising translational opportunity that involves targeting glycolysis to bolster brain metabolic resilience and by such to alter the course of brain aging or disease development to prevent or reduce the risks for not only AD but also other neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Microbial infections have been linked to the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. The present study aimed to synthesise and assess global evidence of microbial pathogenesis and pathophysiology in AD (MPP-AD) and associated neurodegenerative conditions using integrated science mapping and content analytics to explore the associated research landscape. Relevant MPP-AD documents were retrieved from Web of Science and Scopus according to PRISMA principles and analysed for productivity/trend linked to authors/countries, thematic conceptual framework, and international collaborative networks. A total of 258 documents published from 136 sources to 39.42 average citations/document were obtained on MPP-AD. The co-authors per document were 7.6, and the collaboration index was 5.71. The annual research outputs increased tremendously in the last 6 years from 2014 to 2019, accounting for 66% compared with records in the early years from 1982 to 1990 (16%). The USA (n = 71, freq. = 30.34%), United Kingdom (n = 32, freq. = 13.68%) and China (n = 27, 11.54%) ranked in first three positions in term of country's productivity. Four major international collaboration clusters were found in MPP-AD research. The country collaboration network in MPP-AD was characteristic of sparse interaction and acquaintanceship (density = 0.11, diameter = 4). Overall, international collaboration is globally inadequate [centralisation statistics: degree (40.5%), closeness (4%), betweenness (23%), and eigenvector (76.7%)] against the robust authors' collaboration index of 5.71 in MPP-AD research. Furthermore, four conceptual thematic frameworks (CTF) namely, CTF#1, roles of microbial/microbiome infection and dysbiosis in cognitive dysfunctions; CTF#2, bacterial infection specific roles in dementia; CTF#3, the use of yeast as a model system for studying MPP-AD and remediation therapy; and CFT#4, flow cytometry elucidation of amyloid-beta and aggregation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae model. Finally, aetiology-based mechanisms of MPP-AD, namely, gut microbiota, bacterial infection, and viral infection, were comprehensively discussed. This study provides an overview of MPP-AD and serves as a stepping stone for future preparedness in MPP-AD-related research.</p>

<p>Effective diagnosis and prognosis of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) provides a basis for family counseling, decision-making, and the design of rehabilitation programs. However, effective and objective bedside evaluation is a challenging problem. In this study, we explored electroencephalography (EEG) response tracking sound rhythms as potential neural markers for DOC evaluation. We analyzed the responses to natural speech and tones modulated at 2 and 41 Hz. At the population level, patients with positive outcomes (DOC-P) showed higher cortical synchronization to modulated tones at 41 Hz compared with patients with negative outcomes (DOC-N). At the individual level, phase coherence to modulated tones at 41 Hz was significantly correlated with Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) and Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) scores. Furthermore, SVM classifiers, trained using phase coherences in higher frequency bands or combination of the low frequency aSSR and speech tracking responses, performed very well in diagnosis and prognosis of DOC. These findings show that EEG response to auditory rhythms is a potential tool for diagnosis, severity, and prognosis of DOC.</p>

<p>Background: Losing one’s only child may lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), of which re-experiencing is the core symptom. However, neuroimaging studies of sex differences in re-experiencing in the context of the trauma of losing one’s only child and PTSD are scarce; comparisons of the functional networks from the hippocampal subfields to the thalamus might clarify the neural basis.</p><p>Methods: Thirty couples without any psychiatric disorder who lost their only child (non-PTSD group), 55 patients with PTSD, and 50 normal controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The functional connectivity (FC) from the hippocampal subregions to the thalamus and the correlations of FC with re-experiencing symptoms were analyzed within and between the sexes.</p><p>Results: Compared with husbands without PTSD, wives without PTSD had higher re-experiencing symptoms and weaker FC between the right hippocampal cornu ammonis 3 (RCA3) and the right thalamus (RT; RCA3-RT). Moreover, only the correlation between the RCA3-RT FC and re-experiencing in wives without PTSD was significant. Among the three groups, only the RCA3-RT FC in female subjects was markedly different. Additionally, the RCA3-RT FC in wives without PTSD was remarkably lower relative to female patients with PTSD.</p><p>Conclusion: Wives without PTSD who lost their only child had worse re-experiencing symptoms relative to their husbands, which was associated with the FC alteration between the hippocampal subregions and the thalamus. Importantly, the low level of the RCA3-RT FC may play a potentially protective role against the development of PTSD in wives who have lost their only child.</p>

<p>The prevalence of mobile phone addiction (MPA) has increased rapidly in recent years, and it has had a certain negative impact on emotions (e.g., anxiety and depression) and cognitive capacities (e.g., executive control and working memory). At the level of neural circuits, the continued increase in activity in the brain regions associated with addiction leads to neural adaptations and structural changes. At present, the spontaneous brain microstates that could be negatively influenced by MPA are unclear. In this study, the temporal characteristics of four resting-state electroencephalogram (RS-EEG) microstates (MS1, MS2, MS3, and MS4) related to mobile phone addiction tendency (MPAT) were investigated using the Mobile Phone Addiction Tendency Scale (MPATS). We attempted to analyze the correlation between MPAT and corresponding microstates and provide evidence to explain the brain and behavioral changes caused by MPA. The results showed that the total score of the MPATS was positively correlated with the duration of MS1, related to phonological processing and negatively correlated with the duration of MS2, related to visual or imagery processing, and MS4, related to the attentional network; the score of the withdrawal symptoms subscale was additionally associated with duration of MS3, related to the cingulo-opercular emotional network. Based on these results, we believe that MPAT may have some negative effects on attentional networks and sensory brain networks; moreover, withdrawal symptoms may induce some negative emotions.</p>

<p>This study aims to decode the hemodynamic responses (HRs) evoked by multiple sound-categories using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The six different sounds were given as stimuli (English, non-English, annoying, nature, music, and gunshot). The oxy-hemoglobin (HbO) concentration changes are measured in both hemispheres of the auditory cortex while 18 healthy subjects listen to 10-s blocks of six sound-categories. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks were used as a classifier. The classification accuracy was 20.38 ± 4.63% with six class classification. Though LSTM networks’ performance was a little higher than chance levels, it is noteworthy that we could classify the data subject-wise without feature selections.</p>

<p>Similar to visual perception, auditory perception also has a clearly described “pop-out” effect, where an element with some extra feature is easier to detect among elements without an extra feature. This phenomenon is better known as auditory perceptual asymmetry. We investigated such asymmetry between shorter or longer duration, and level or falling of pitch of linguistic stimuli that carry a meaning in one language (Estonian), but not in another (Russian). For the mismatch negativity (MMN) experiment, we created four different types of stimuli by modifying the duration of the first vowel [ɑ] (170, 290 ms) and pitch contour (level vs. falling pitch) of the stimuli words (‘SATA,’ ‘SAKI’). The stimuli were synthesized from Estonian words (‘SATA,’ ‘SAKI’) and follow the Estonian language three-way quantity system, which incorporates tonal features (falling pitch contour) together with temporal patterns. This made the meaning of the word dependent on the combination of both features and allows us to compare the relative contribution of duration and pitch contour in discrimination of language stimuli in the brain via MMN generation. The participants of the experiment were 12 Russian native speakers with little or no experience in Estonian and living in Estonia short-term, and 12 Estonian native speakers (age 18–27 years). We found that participants’ perception of the linguistic stimuli differed not only according to the physical features but also according to their native language, confirming that the meaning of the word interferes with the early automatic processing of phonological features. The GAMM and ANOVA analysis of the reversed design results showed that the deviant with longer duration among shorter standards elicited a MMN response with greater amplitude than the short deviant among long standards, while changes in pitch contour (falling vs. level pitch) produced neither strong MMN nor asymmetry. Thus, we demonstrate the effect of language background on asymmetric perception of linguistic stimuli that aligns with those of previous studies (Jaramillo et al., 2000), and contributes to the growing body of knowledge supporting auditory perceptual asymmetry.</p>

Objective<p>This study explored whether acupuncture affects the maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and the acquisition of motor skills following repetitive sequential visual isometric pinch task (SVIPT) training.</p>Methods<p>Thirty-six participants were recruited. The changes in the aftereffects induced by intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) and followed acupuncture were tested by the amplitude motor evoked potential (MEP) at pre-and-post-iTBS for 30 min and at acupuncture-in and -off for 30 min. Secondly, the effects of acupuncture on SVIPT movement in inducing error rate and learning skill index were tested.</p>Results<p>Following one session of iTBS, the MEP amplitude was increased and maintained at a high level for 30 min. The facilitation of MEP was gradually decreased to the baseline level during acupuncture-in and did not return to a high level after needle extraction. The SVIPT-acupuncture group had a lower learning skill index than those in the SVIPT group, indicating that acupuncture intervention after SVIPT training may restrain the acquisition ability of one’s learning skills.</p>Conclusion<p>Acupuncture could reverse the LTP-like plasticity of the contralateral motor cortex induced by iTBS. Subsequent acupuncture may negatively affect the efficacy of the acquisition of learned skills in repetitive exercise training.</p>

<p>It is well known that communication between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is critical for various cognitive and behavioral functions. However, the exact role of these structures in spatial coordination remains to be clarified. Here we sought to determine the involvement of the mPFC and the vHPC in the spatial retrieval of a previously learned active place avoidance task in adult male Long-Evans rats, using a combination of unilateral and bilateral local muscimol inactivations. Moreover, we tested the role of the vHPC-mPFC pathway by performing combined ipsilateral and contralateral inactivations. Our results showed not only bilateral inactivations of either structure, but also the combined inactivations impaired the retrieval of spatial memory, whereas unilateral one-structure inactivations did not yield any effect. Remarkably, muscimol injections in combined groups exerted similar deficits, regardless of whether the inactivations were contralateral or ipsilateral. These findings confirm the importance of these structures in spatial cognition and emphasize the importance of the intact functioning of the vHPC-mPFC pathway.</p>

<p>Influenza viruses until today are a leading cause of worldwide severe pandemics and represent a major threat to human and animal health. Although the primary target of influenza viruses is the lung, infection may manifest with acute and even chronic neurological complications (e.g., status epilepticus, encephalopathies, and encephalitis) potentially increasing the long-term risk for neurodegenerative diseases. We previously described that a peripheral influenza A virus (IAV) infection caused by non-neurotropic H3N2 (maHK68) variant leads to long-term neuroinflammation and synapse loss together with impaired memory formation in young adult mice. Processes of neuroinflammation have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and prolonged or excessive innate immune responses are considered a risk factor for AD. Here, the role of purely peripheral IAV infection for the development and progression of AD in a transgenic mouse model (APP/PS1) was investigated. At 2 months of age, mice were infected with H3N2 IAV and the detailed analysis of microglia morphology revealed neuroinflammation in the hippocampus already of 6 months old non-infected APP/PS1 mice together with impaired spatial learning, however, microglia activation, amyloid-β plaques load and cognitive impairments were even more pronounced in APP/PS1 mice upon H3N2 infection. Moreover, CA1 hippocampal dendritic spine density was reduced even at 120 dpi compared to wild-type and also to non-infected APP/PS1 mice, whereas neuronal cells number was not altered. These findings demonstrate that non-neurotropic H3N2 IAV infection as a peripheral immune stimulation may exacerbate AD symptoms possibly by triggering microglial hyperactivation.</p>

<p>Pheromone receptors (PRs) of moths are expressed on the dendritic membrane of odorant receptor neurons (ORNs) housed in the long trichoid sensilla (TS) of antennae and are essential to sex pheromone reception. The function of peripheral neurons of Mythimna separata in recognizing sex pheromones is still unclear. In this study, electroantennogram recordings were performed from male and female antennae of M. separata, and showed that the major component of sex pheromones, (Z)-11-hexadecenal (Z11–16:Ald), evoked the strongest response of male antennae with significant differences between sexes. Single sensillum recording was used to record responses of neurons housed in TS of male M. separata. The results revealed four types of TS with three neurons housed in each type, based on profiles of responses to sex pheromone components and pheromone analogs. ORN-B of type-I TS was specifically tuned to the major sex pheromone component Z11–16:Ald; ORN-Bs in type-III and type-IV TSs were, respectively, activated by minor components (Z)-11-hexadecen-1-yl acetate (Z11–16:OAc) and hexadecenal (16:Ald); and ORNs in type-II TS were mainly activated by the sex pheromone analogs. We further cloned full-length sequences of six putative PR genes and an Orco gene. Functional characterization of PRs in the Xenopus oocyte system demonstrated that male antennae-biased MsepPR1 responded strongly to (Z)-9-tetradecenal (Z9-14:Ald), suggesting that MsepPR1 may be expressed in type-II TS. MsepPR6 was exclusively tuned to (Z)-9-tetradecen-1-yl acetate (Z9–14:OAc). MsepPR2 and MsepPR4 showed no responses to any tested components. Female antennae-biased MespPR5 was broadly tuned to Z9–14:Ald, Z9–14:OAc, Z11–16:Ald, and (Z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol (Z11–16:OH). Our results further enriched the sex pheromone recognition mechanism in the peripheral nervous system of moth M. separata.</p>

<p>TRPM4 is a non-selective cation channel activated by intracellular calcium and permeable to monovalent cations. This channel participates in the control of neuronal firing, neuronal plasticity, and neuronal death. TRPM4 depolarizes dendritic spines and is critical for the induction of NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Despite its functional importance, no subcellular localization or expression during postnatal development has been described in this area. To examine the localization and expression of TRPM4, we performed duplex immunofluorescence and patch-clamp in brain slices at different postnatal ages in C57BL/6J mice. At P0 we found TRPM4 is expressed with a somatic pattern. At P7, P14, and P35, TRPM4 expression extended from the soma to the apical dendrites but was excluded from the axon initial segment. Patch-clamp recordings showed a TRPM4-like current active at the resting membrane potential from P0, which increased throughout the postnatal development. This current was dependent on intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (I<sub>CAN</sub>) and sensitive to 9-phenanthrol (9-Ph). Inhibiting TRPM4 with 9-Ph hyperpolarized the membrane potential at P14 and P35, with no effect in earlier stages. Together, these results show that TRPM4 is expressed in CA1 pyramidal neurons in the soma and apical dendrites and associated with a TRPM4-like current, which depolarizes the neurons. The expression, localization, and function of TRPM4 throughout postnatal development in the CA1 hippocampal may underlie an important mechanism of control of membrane potential and action potential firing during critical periods of neuronal development, particularly during the establishment of circuits.</p>

<p>Music-based interventions seem to enhance motor, sensory and cognitive functions in Parkinson’s disease (PD), but the underlying action mechanisms are still largely unknown. This electroencephalography (EEG) study aimed to investigate the effective connectivity patterns characterizing PD in the resting state and during music listening. EEG recordings were obtained from fourteen non-demented PD patients and 12 healthy controls, at rest and while listening to three music tracks. Theta- and alpha-band power spectral density and multivariate partial directed coherence were computed. Power and connectivity measures were compared between patients and controls in the four conditions and in music vs. rest. Compared to controls, patients showed enhanced theta-band power and slightly enhanced alpha-band power, but markedly reduced theta- and alpha-band interactions among EEG channels, especially concerning the information received by the right central channel. EEG power differences were partially reduced by music listening, which induced power increases in controls but not in patients. Connectivity differences were slightly compensated by music, whose effects largely depended on the track. In PD, music enhanced the frontotemporal inter-hemispheric communication. Our findings suggest that PD is characterized by enhanced activity but reduced information flow within the EEG network, being only partially normalized by music. Nevertheless, music capability to facilitate inter-hemispheric communication might underlie its beneficial effects on PD pathophysiology and should be further investigated.</p>

<p>There is a growing evidence describing a decline in adaptive homeostasis in aging-related diseases affecting the central nervous system (CNS), many of which are characterized by the appearance of non-native protein aggregates. One signaling pathway that allows cell adaptation is the integrated stress response (ISR), which senses stress stimuli through four kinases. ISR activation promotes translational arrest through the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) and the induction of a gene expression program to restore cellular homeostasis. However, depending on the stimulus, ISR can also induce cell death. One of the ISR sensors is the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase [protein kinase R (PKR)], initially described as a viral infection sensor, and now a growing evidence supports a role for PKR on CNS physiology. PKR has been largely involved in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathological process. Here, we reviewed the antecedents supporting the role of PKR on the efficiency of synaptic transmission and cognition. Then, we review PKR’s contribution to AD and discuss the possible participation of PKR as a player in the neurodegenerative process involved in aging-related pathologies affecting the CNS.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/69040">Common virulence gene expression in adult first-time infected malaria patients and severe cases</a></h4>

Sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes to host endothelium through the parasite-derived PfEMP1 adhesion proteins is central to the development of malaria pathogenesis. PfEMP1 proteins have diversified and expanded to encompass many sequence variants conferring each parasite a similar array of human endothelial receptor binding phenotypes. Here, we analyzed RNA-seq profiles of parasites isolated from 32 P. falciparum infected adult travelers returning to Germany. Patients were categorized into either malaria naïve (n=15) or pre-exposed (n=17), and into severe (n=8) or non-severe (n=24) cases. For differential expression analysis of PfEMP1-encoding var gene transcripts were de novo assembled from RNA-seq data and, in parallel, var expressed sequence tags were analyzed and used to predict the encoded domain composition of the transcripts. Both approaches showed in concordance that severe malaria was associated with PfEMP1 containing the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR)-binding CIDRα1 domain, whereas CD36-binding PfEMP1 was linked to non-severe malaria outcomes. First-time infected adults were more likely to develop severe symptoms and tended to be infected for a longer period. Thus, parasites with more pathogenic PfEMP1 variants are more common in patients with a naïve immune status and/or adverse inflammatory host responses to first infections favors growth of EPCR-binding parasites.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/66898">Electrical synaptic transmission requires a postsynaptic scaffolding protein</a></h4>

Electrical synaptic transmission relies on neuronal gap junctions containing channels constructed by Connexins. While at chemical synapses neurotransmitter-gated ion channels are critically supported by scaffolding proteins, it is unknown if channels at electrical synapses require similar scaffold support. Here, we investigated the functional relationship between neuronal Connexins and Zonula Occludens 1 (ZO1), an intracellular scaffolding protein localized to electrical synapses. Using model electrical synapses in zebrafish Mauthner cells, we demonstrated that ZO1 is required for robust synaptic Connexin localization, but Connexins are dispensable for ZO1 localization. Disrupting this hierarchical ZO1/Connexin relationship abolishes electrical transmission and disrupts Mauthner cell-initiated escape responses. We found that ZO1 is asymmetrically localized exclusively postsynaptically at neuronal contacts where it functions to assemble intercellular channels. Thus, forming functional neuronal gap junctions requires a postsynaptic scaffolding protein. The critical function of a scaffolding molecule reveals an unanticipated complexity of molecular and functional organization at electrical synapses.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61346">Optimal evolutionary decision-making to store immune memory</a></h4>

The adaptive immune system provides a diverse set of molecules that can mount specific responses against a multitude of pathogens. Memory is a key feature of adaptive immunity, which allows organisms to respond more readily upon re-infections. However, differentiation of memory cells is still one of the least understood cell fate decisions. Here, we introduce a mathematical framework to characterize optimal strategies to store memory to maximize the utility of immune response over an organism's lifetime. We show that memory production should be actively regulated to balance between affinity and cross-reactivity of immune receptors for an effective protection against evolving pathogens. Moreover, we predict that specificity of memory should depend on the organism's lifespan, and shorter-lived organisms with fewer pathogenic encounters should store more cross-reactive memory. Our framework provides a baseline to gauge the efficacy of immune memory in light of an organism's coevolutionary history with pathogens.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61254">The final step of 40S ribosomal subunit maturation is controlled by a dual key lock</a></h4>

Preventing premature interaction of pre-ribosomes with the translation apparatus is essential for translational accuracy. Hence, the final maturation step releasing functional 40S ribosomal subunits, namely processing of the 18S ribosomal RNA 3' end, is safeguarded by the protein DIM2, which both interacts with the endoribonuclease NOB1 and masks the rRNA cleavage site. To elucidate the control mechanism that unlocks NOB1 activity, we performed cryo-EM analysis of late human pre-40S particles purified using a catalytically-inactive form of the ATPase RIO1. These structures, together with in vivo and in vitro functional analyses, support a model in which ATP-loaded RIO1 cooperates with ribosomal protein RPS26/eS26 to displace DIM2 from the 18S rRNA 3' end, thereby triggering final cleavage by NOB1; release of ADP then leads to RIO1 dissociation from the 40S subunit. This dual key lock mechanism requiring RIO1 and RPS26 guarantees the precise timing of pre-40S particle conversion into translation-competent ribosomal subunits.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60270">Compartment-specific opioid receptor signaling is selectively modulated by different Dynorphin peptides</a></h4>

Many signal transduction systems have an apparent redundancy built into them, where multiple physiological agonists activate the same receptors. Whether this is true redundancy, or whether this provides an as-yet unrecognized specificity in downstream signaling, is not well understood. We address this question using the kappa opioid receptor (KOR), a physiologically relevant G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is activated by multiple members of the Dynorphin family of opioid peptides. We show that two related peptides, Dynorphin A and Dynorphin B, bind and activate KOR to similar extents in mammalian neuroendocrine cells and rat striatal neurons, but localize KOR to distinct intracellular compartments and drive different post-endocytic fates of the receptor. Strikingly, localization of KOR to the degradative pathway by Dynorphin A induces sustained KOR signaling from these compartments. Our results suggest that seemingly redundant endogenous peptides can fine-tune signaling by regulating the spatiotemporal profile of KOR signaling.

Abstract
N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptors (NMDARs) can be considered to be the de facto “plasticity” receptors in the brain due to their central role in the activity‐dependent modification of neuronal morphology and synaptic transmission. Since the 1980s, research on NMDARs has focused on the second messenger properties of calcium and the downstream signaling pathways that mediate alterations in neural form and function. Recently, NMDARs were shown to drive activity‐dependent synaptic plasticity without calcium influx. How this “nonionotropic” plasticity occurs in vitro is becoming clearer, but research on its involvement in behavior and cognition is in its infancy. There is a partial overlap in the downstream signaling molecules that are involved in ionotropic and nonionotropic NMDAR‐dependent plasticity. Given this, and prior studies of the cognitive impacts of ionotropic NMDAR plasticity, a preliminary model explaining how NMDAR nonionotropic plasticity affects learning and memory can be established. We hypothesize that nonionotropic NMDAR plasticity takes part in latent memory encoding in immature rodents through nonassociative depression of synaptic efficacy, and possibly shrinking of dendritic spines. Further, the late postnatal alteration in NMDAR composition in the hippocampus appears to reduce nonionotropic signaling and remove a restriction on memory retrieval. This framework substantially alters the canonical model of NMDAR involvement in spatial cognition and hippocampal maturation and provides novel and exciting inroads for future studies.

An important model system for understanding genes, neurons and behavior, the nematode worm <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> naturally moves through a variety of complex postures, for which estimation from video data is challenging. We introduce an open-source Python package, WormPose, for 2D pose estimation in <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>, including self-occluded, coiled shapes. We leverage advances in machine vision afforded from convolutional neural networks and introduce a synthetic yet realistic generative model for images of worm posture, thus avoiding the need for human-labeled training. WormPose is effective and adaptable for imaging conditions across worm tracking efforts. We quantify pose estimation using synthetic data as well as N2 and mutant worms in on-food conditions. We further demonstrate WormPose by analyzing long (∼ 8 hour), fast-sampled (∼ 30 Hz) recordings of on-food N2 worms to provide a posture-scale analysis of roaming/dwelling behaviors.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7FfoBN84TIc" width="1" />

MgtE is a Mg<sup>2+</sup> channel conserved in organisms ranging from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, including humans, and plays an important role in Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. The previously determined MgtE structures in the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound, closed-state, and structure-based functional analyses of MgtE revealed that the binding of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions to the MgtE cytoplasmic domain induces channel inactivation to maintain Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. There are no structures of the transmembrane (TM) domain for MgtE in Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free conditions, and the pore-opening mechanism has thus remained unclear.
Here, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the MgtE-Fab complex in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions. The Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free MgtE TM domain structure and its comparison with the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound, closed-state structure, together with functional analyses, showed the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent pore opening of MgtE on the cytoplasmic side and revealed the kink motions of the TM2 and TM5 helices at the glycine residues, which are important for channel activity. Overall, our work provides structure-based mechanistic insights into the channel gating of MgtE.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/v-tah9CPryg" width="1" />

<p>by Jiajun Huang, Xiaoyu Zhao, Xiang Li, Jiwei Peng, Weihao Yang, Shengli Mi</p>

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is responsible for most cases of the kidney cancer. Previous research showed that low serum levels of cholesterol level positively correlate with poorer RCC-specific survival outcomes. However, the underlying mechanisms and functional significance of the role of cholesterol in the development of RCC remain obscure. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) plays a pivotal role in RCC development as it is the key rate-limiting enzyme of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. In this study, we demonstrated that the inhibition of HMGCR could accelerate the development of RCC tumors by lactate accumulation and angiogenesis in animal models. We identified that the inhibition of HMGCR led to an increase in glycolysis via the regulated HSP90 expression levels, thus maintaining the levels of a glycolysis rate-limiting enzyme, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). Based on these findings, we reversed the HMGCR inhibition-induced tumor growth acceleration in RCC xenograft mice by suppressing glycolysis. Furthermore, the coadministration of Shikonin, a potent PKM2 inhibitor, reverted the tumor development induced by the HMGCR signaling pathway.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/DQBtRZniGSI" width="1" />

<p>The Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm has undergone countless
modifications and adaptations since its original formulation in 1995. Some of
these have become mainstream whereas many others have not been adopted and
faded away. Thus, a myriad of alternative formulations have been proposed to
the extent that the question arises as to what the basic features of an
algorithm must be to belong in the PSO family. The aim of this paper is to
establish what defines a PSO algorithm and to attempt to formulate it in such a
way that it encompasses many existing variants. Therefore, different versions
of the method may be posed as settings within the proposed unified framework.
In addition, the proposed formulation generalises, decouples and incorporates
features to the method providing more flexibility to the behaviour of each
particle. The closed forms of the trajectory difference equation are obtained,
different types of behaviour are identified, stochasticity is decoupled, and
traditionally global features such as sociometries and constraint-handling are
re-defined as particle's attributes.

<p>Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a biological process in which the
precise order and timing of neuronal spikes affect the degree of synaptic
modification. While there has been numerous research focusing on the role of
STDP in neural coding, the functional implications of STDP at the macroscopic
level in the brain have not been fully explored yet. In this work, we propose
that STDP in an ensemble of spiking neurons renders storing high dimensional
information in the form of a `memory plane'. Neural activity based on STDP
transforms periodic spatio-temporal input patterns into the corresponding
memory plane, where the stored information can be dynamically revived with a
proper cue. Using the dynamical systems theory that shows the analytic relation
between the input and the memory plane, we were able to demonstrate a specific
memory process for high-dimensional associative data sets. In the
auto-associative memory task, a group of images that were continuously streamed
to the system can be retrieved from the oscillating neural state. The second
application deals with the process of semantic memory components that are
embedded from sentences. The results show that words can recall multiple
sentences simultaneously or one exclusively, depending on their grammatical
relations. This implies that the proposed framework is apt to process multiple
groups of associative memories with a composite structure.

<p>The steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is one of the most widely
used modalities in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) due to its many advantages.
However, the existence of harmonics and the limited range of responsive
frequencies in SSVEP make it challenging to further expand the number of
targets without sacrificing other aspects of the interface or putting
additional constraints on the system. This paper introduces a novel
multi-frequency stimulation method for SSVEP and investigates its potential to
effectively and efficiently increase the number of targets presented. The
proposed stimulation method, obtained by the superposition of the stimulation
signals at different frequencies, is size-efficient, allows single-step target
identification, puts no strict constraints on the usable frequency range, can
be suited to self-paced BCIs, and does not require specific light sources. In
addition to the stimulus frequencies and their harmonics, the evoked SSVEP
waveforms include frequencies that are integer linear combinations of the
stimulus frequencies. Results of decoding SSVEPs collected from nine subjects
using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) with only the frequencies and
harmonics as reference, also demonstrate the potential of using such a
stimulation paradigm in SSVEP-based BCIs.

<p>Designing optimal soft modular robots is difficult, due to non-trivial
interactions between morphology and controller. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs),
combined with physical simulators, represent a valid tool to overcome this
issue. In this work, we investigate algorithmic solutions to improve the
Quality Diversity of co-evolved designs of Tensegrity Soft Modular Robots
(TSMRs) for two robotic tasks, namely goal reaching and squeezing trough a
narrow passage. To this aim, we use three different EAs, i.e., MAP-Elites and
two custom algorithms: one based on Viability Evolution (ViE) and NEAT
(ViE-NEAT), the other named Double Map MAP-Elites (DM-ME) and devised to seek
diversity while co-evolving robot morphologies and neural network (NN)-based
controllers. In detail, DM-ME extends MAP-Elites in that it uses two distinct
feature maps, referring to morphologies and controllers respectively, and
integrates a mechanism to automatically define the NN-related feature
descriptor. Considering the fitness, in the goal-reaching task ViE-NEAT
outperforms MAP-Elites and results equivalent to DM-ME. Instead, when
considering diversity in terms of "illumination" of the feature space, DM-ME
outperforms the other two algorithms on both tasks, providing a richer pool of
possible robotic designs, whereas ViE-NEAT shows comparable performance to
MAP-Elites on goal reaching, although it does not exploit any map.

<p>Many platforms for benchmarking optimization algorithms offer users the
possibility of sharing their experimental data with the purpose of promoting
reproducible and reusable research. However, different platforms use different
data models and formats, which drastically inhibits identification of relevant
data sets, their interpretation, and their interoperability. Consequently, a
semantically rich, ontology-based, machine-readable data model is highly
desired.
</p>
<p>We report in this paper on the development of such an ontology, which we name
OPTION (OPTImization algorithm benchmarking ONtology). Our ontology provides
the vocabulary needed for semantic annotation of the core entities involved in
the benchmarking process, such as algorithms, problems, and evaluation
measures. It also provides means for automated data integration, improved
interoperability, powerful querying capabilities and reasoning, thereby
enriching the value of the benchmark data. We demonstrate the utility of OPTION
by annotating and querying a corpus of benchmark performance data from the BBOB
workshop data - a use case which can be easily extended to cover other
benchmarking data collections.

<p>The brain must extract behaviorally relevant latent variables from the
signals streamed by the sensory organs. Such latent variables are often encoded
in the dynamics that generated the signal rather than in the specific
realization of the waveform. Therefore, one problem faced by the brain is to
segment time series based on underlying dynamics. We present two algorithms for
performing this segmentation task that are biologically plausible, which we
define as acting in a streaming setting and all learning rules being local. One
algorithm is model-based and can be derived from an optimization problem
involving a mixture of autoregressive processes. This algorithm relies on
feedback in the form of a prediction error, and can also be used for
forecasting future samples. In some brain regions, such as the retina, the
feedback connections necessary to use the prediction error for learning are
absent. For this case, we propose a second, model-free algorithm that uses a
running estimate of the autocorrelation structure of the signal to perform the
segmentation. We show that both algorithms do well when tasked with segmenting
signals drawn from autoregressive models with piecewise-constant parameters. In
particular, the segmentation accuracy is similar to that obtained from
oracle-like methods in which the ground-truth parameters of the autoregressive
models are known. We provide implementations of our algorithms at
https://github.com/ttesileanu/bio-time-series.

<p>Brain stimulation is a core method in neuroscience. Numerous non-invasive
brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques are currently in use in basic and clinical
research, and recent advances promise the ability to non-invasively access deep
brain structures. While encouraging, there is a surprising gap in our
understanding of precisely how NIBS perturbs neural activity throughout an
interconnected network, and how such perturbed neural activity ultimately links
to behaviour. In this review, we will consider why non-human primate (NHP)
models of NIBS are ideally situated to address this gap in knowledge, and will
consider why the oculomotor network that moves our line of sight offers a
particularly valuable platform in which to empirically test hypothesis
regarding NIBS-induced changes in brain and behaviour. NHP models of NIBS will
enable investigation of the complex, dynamic effects of brain stimulation
across multiple hierarchically interconnected brain areas, networks, and
effectors. By establishing such links between brain and behavioural output,
work in NHPs can help optimize experimental and therapeutic approaches, improve
NIBS efficacy, and reduce side-effects of NIBS.

<p>Astronauts experience post-flight disturbances in postural and locomotor control due to sensorimotor adaptations during spaceflight. These alterations may have adverse consequences if a rapid egress is required after landing. Although current exercise protocols can effectively mitigate cardiovascular and muscular deconditioning, the benefits to post-flight sensorimotor dysfunction are limited. Furthermore, some exercise capabilities like treadmill running are currently not feasible on exploration spaceflight vehicles. Thus, new in-flight operational countermeasures are needed to mitigate postural and locomotor control deficits after exploration missions. Data from spaceflight and from analog studies collectively suggest that body unloading decreases the utilization of proprioceptive input, and this adaptation strongly contributes to balance dysfunction after spaceflight. For example, on return to Earth, an astronaut’s vestibular input may be compromised by adaptation to microgravity, but their proprioceptive input is compromised by body unloading. Since proprioceptive and tactile input are important for maintaining postural control, keeping these systems tuned to respond to upright balance challenges during flight may improve functional task performance after flight through dynamic reweighting of sensory input. Novel approaches are needed to compensate for the challenges of balance training in microgravity and must be tested in a body unloading environment such as head down bed rest. Here, we review insights from the literature and provide observations from our laboratory that could inform the development of an in-flight proprioceptive countermeasure.</p>

<p>The past decade has seen a rapid acceleration in the discovery of new genetic causes of ALS, with more than 20 putative ALS-causing genes now cited. These genes encode proteins that cover a diverse range of molecular functions, including free radical scavenging (e.g., SOD1), regulation of RNA homeostasis (e.g., TDP-43 and FUS), and protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (e.g., ubiquilin-2 and cyclin F) and autophagy (TBK1 and sequestosome-1/p62). It is likely that the various initial triggers of disease (either genetic, environmental and/or gene-environment interaction) must converge upon a common set of molecular pathways that underlie ALS pathogenesis. Given the complexity, it is not surprising that a catalog of molecular pathways and proteostasis dysfunctions have been linked to ALS. One of the challenges in ALS research is determining, at the early stage of discovery, whether a new gene mutation is indeed disease-specific, and if it is linked to signaling pathways that trigger neuronal cell death. We have established a proof-of-concept proteogenomic workflow to assess new gene mutations, using CCNF (cyclin F) as an example, in cell culture models to screen whether potential gene candidates fit the criteria of activating apoptosis. This can provide an informative and time-efficient output that can be extended further for validation in a variety of in vitro and in vivo models and/or for mechanistic studies. As a proof-of-concept, we expressed cyclin F mutations (K97R, S195R, S509P, R574Q, S621G) in HEK293 cells for label-free quantitative proteomics that bioinformatically predicted activation of the neuronal cell death pathways, which was validated by immunoblot analysis. Proteomic analysis of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from patient fibroblasts bearing the S621G mutation showed the same activation of these pathways providing compelling evidence for these candidate gene mutations to be strong candidates for further validation and mechanistic studies (such as E3 enzymatic activity assays, protein–protein and protein–substrate studies, and neuronal apoptosis and aberrant branching measurements in zebrafish). Our proteogenomics approach has great utility and provides a relatively high-throughput screening platform to explore candidate gene mutations for their propensity to cause neuronal cell death, which will guide a researcher for further experimental studies.</p>

<p>Tau is a microtubule-associated protein for which the physiological functions remain a topic of vigorous investigation. Additionally, tau is a central player in the pathogenesis of several diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and several frontotemporal dementias. A critical variable to understanding tau in physiological and disease contexts is its normal localization within cells of the adult CNS. Tau is often described as an axon-specific (or enriched) and neuron-specific protein with little to no expression in glial cells, all of which are untrue. Understanding normal tau distribution also impacts interpretation of experimental results and hypotheses regarding its role in disease. Thus, we set out to help clarify the normal localization of tau in the adult CNS of middle-aged rats and rhesus macaque using the hippocampus as a representative brain structure. The physiological concentration of tau in the rat hippocampus was 6.6 μM and in white matter was 3.6 μM as determined by quantitative sandwich ELISAs. We evaluated the cellular localization of tau using multiple tau-specific antibodies with epitopes to different regions, including Tau1, Tau5, Tau7, R1, and two novel primate-specific antibodies NT9 and NT15. In the rat and monkey, tau was localized within the somatodendritic and axonal compartments, as well as a subset of neuronal nuclei. Semi-quantitative fluorescence intensity measurements revealed that depending on the specific reagent used the somatodendritic tau is relatively equal to, higher than, or lower than axonal tau, highlighting differential labeling of tau with various antibodies despite its distribution throughout the neuron. Tau was strongly expressed in mature oligodendrocytes and displayed little to no expression in oligodendrocyte precursor cells, astrocytes or microglia. Collectively, the data indicate tau is ∼3 – 7 μM under physiological conditions, is not specifically enriched in axons, and is normally found in both neurons and mature oligodendrocytes in the adult CNS. The full landscape of tau distribution is not revealed by all antibodies suggesting availability of the epitopes is different within specific neuronal compartments. These findings set the stage for better understanding normal tau distributions and interpreting data regarding the presence of tau in different compartments or cell types within disease conditions.</p>

Introduction<p>Freezing of gait (FOG) is one of the most common walking problems in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Impaired cognitive function is believed to play an important role in developing and aggravating FOG in PD. But some evidence suggests that motor function discrepancy may affect testing results. Therefore, we think it is necessary for PD-FOG(+) and PD-FOG(−) patients to complete neuropsychological tests under similar motor conditions.</p>Methods<p>This study recruited 44 idiopathic PD patients [PD-FOG(+) n = 22, PD-FOG(−) n = 22] and 20 age-matched healthy controls (HC). PD-FOG(+) and PD-FOG(−) patients were matched for age, year of education, and Hoehn and Yahr score (H&amp;Y). All participants underwent a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological assessment, and demographical and clinical information was also collected.</p>Results<p>PD patients showed poorer cognitive function, higher risks of depression and anxiety, and more neuropsychiatric symptoms compared with HC. When controlling for age, years of education, and H&amp;Y, there were no statistical differences in cognitive function between PD-FOG(+) and PD-FOG(−) patients. But PD-FOG(+) patients had worse motor and non-motor symptoms than PD-FOG(−) patients. PD patients whose motor symptoms initiated with rigidity and initiated unilaterally were more likely to experience FOG.</p>Conclusion<p>Traditional neuropsychological testing may not be sensitive enough to detect cognitive impairment in PD. Motor symptoms initiated with rigidity and initiated unilaterally might be an important predictor of FOG.</p>

<p>Disruption of the function of the primary motor cortex (M1) is thought to play a critical role in motor dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Detailed information regarding the specific aspects of M1 circuits that become abnormal is lacking. We recorded single units and local field potentials (LFPs) of M1 neurons in unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion rats and control rats to assess the impact of dopamine (DA) cell loss during rest and a forelimb reaching task. Our results indicated that M1 neurons can be classified into two groups (putative pyramidal neurons and putative interneurons) and that 6-OHDA could modify the activity of different M1 subpopulations to a large extent. Reduced activation of putative pyramidal neurons during inattentive rest and reaching was observed. In addition, 6-OHDA intoxication was associated with an increase in certain LFP frequencies, especially those in the beta range (broadly defined here as any frequency between 12 and 35 Hz), which become pathologically exaggerated throughout cortico-basal ganglia circuits after dopamine depletion. Furthermore, assessment of different spike-LFP coupling parameters revealed that the putative pyramidal neurons were particularly prone to being phase-locked to ongoing cortical oscillations at 12–35 Hz during reaching. Conversely, putative interneurons were neither hypoactive nor synchronized to ongoing cortical oscillations. These data collectively demonstrate a neuron type-selective alteration in the M1 in hemiparkinsonian rats. These alterations hamper the ability of the M1 to contribute to motor conduction and are likely some of the main contributors to motor impairments in PD.</p>

<p>Background: Cognitive Training (CT) may contribute to the maintenance and even enhancement of cognitive functions in healthy older adults.

<p>Dealing with phonological variations is important for speech processing. This article addresses whether phonological variations introduced by assimilatory processes are compensated for at the pre-lexical or lexical level, and whether the nature of variation and the phonological context influence this process. To this end, Swedish nasal regressive place assimilation was investigated using the mismatch negativity (MMN) component. In nasal regressive assimilation, the coronal nasal assimilates to the place of articulation of a following segment, most clearly with a velar or labial place of articulation, as in utan mej “without me” &gt; [ʉːtam mɛjː]. In a passive auditory oddball paradigm, 15 Swedish speakers were presented with Swedish phrases with attested and unattested phonological variations and contexts for nasal assimilation. Attested variations – a coronal-to-labial change as in utan “without” &gt; [ʉːtam] – were contrasted with unattested variations – a labial-to-coronal change as in utom “except” &gt; <sup>∗</sup>[ʉːtɔn] – in appropriate and inappropriate contexts created by mej “me” [mɛjː] and dej “you” [dɛjː]. Given that the MMN amplitude depends on the degree of variation between two stimuli, the MMN responses were expected to indicate to what extent the distance between variants was tolerated by the perceptual system. Since the MMN response reflects not only low-level acoustic processing but also higher-level linguistic processes, the results were predicted to indicate whether listeners process assimilation at the pre-lexical and lexical levels. The results indicated no significant interactions across variations, suggesting that variations in phonological forms do not incur any cost in lexical retrieval; hence such variation is compensated for at the lexical level. However, since the MMN response reached significance only for a labial-to-coronal change in a labial context and for a coronal-to-labial change in a coronal context, the compensation might have been influenced by the nature of variation and the phonological context. It is therefore concluded that while assimilation is compensated for at the lexical level, there is also some influence from pre-lexical processing. The present results reveal not only signal-based perception of phonological units, but also higher-level lexical processing, and are thus able to reconcile the bottom-up and top-down models of speech processing.</p>

<p>Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are proton-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels. They contribute to synaptic transmission, neuronal differentiation and neurodegeneration. ASICs have been mainly characterized in neurons from mice or rats and our knowledge of their properties in human neurons is scarce. Here, we functionally characterized ASICs in differentiating LUHMES cells, a human mesencephalic cell line with characteristics of dopaminergic neurons. We find that LUHMES cells express functional ASICs, predominantly homomeric ASIC1a. Expression starts early during differentiation with a striking surge in current amplitude at days 4–6 of differentiation, a time point where—based on published data—LUHMES cells start expressing synaptic markers. Peak ASIC expression therefore coincides with a critical period of LUHMES cell differentiation. It was associated with increased excitability, but not paralleled by an increase in ASIC1 mRNA or protein. In differentiating as well as in terminally differentiated LUHMES cells, ASIC activation by slight acidification elicited large currents, action potentials and a rise in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Applying the ASIC pore blocker diminazene during differentiation reduced the length of neurites, consistent with the hypothesis that ASICs play a critical role in LUHMES cell differentiation. In summary, our study establishes LUHMES cells as a valuable model to study the role of ASICs for neuronal differentiation and potentially also cell death in a human cell line.</p>

<p>Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease that is caused by a mutation of the NPC1 or NPC2 gene, in which un-esterified cholesterol and sphingolipids accumulate mainly in the liver, spleen, and brain. Abnormal lysosomal storage leads to cell damage, neurological problems, and premature death. The time of onset and severity of symptoms of NPC disease are highly variable. The molecular mechanisms that are responsible for NPC disease pathology are far from being understood. The present study generated and characterized a zebrafish mutant that lacks Npc2 protein that may be useful for studies at the organismal, cellular, and molecular levels and both small-scale and high-throughput screens. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we knocked out the zebrafish homolog of NPC2. Five-day-old npc2 mutants were morphologically indistinguishable from wildtype larvae. We found that live npc2<sup>–/–</sup> larvae exhibited stronger Nile blue staining. The npc2<sup>–/–</sup> larvae exhibited low mobility and a high anxiety-related response. These behavioral changes correlated with downregulation of the mcu (mitochondrial calcium uniporter) gene, ppp3ca (calcineurin) gene, and genes that are involved in myelination (mbp and mpz). Histological analysis of adult npc2<sup>–/–</sup> zebrafish revealed that pathological changes in the nervous system, kidney, liver, and pancreas correlated with inflammatory responses (i.e., the upregulation of il1, nfκβ, and mpeg; i.e., hallmarks of NPC disease). These findings suggest that the npc2 mutant zebrafish may be a model of NPC disease.</p>

<p>It was well documented that both the size of the dendritic field and receptive field of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are developmentally regulated in the mammalian retina, and visual stimulation is required for the maturation of the dendritic and receptive fields of mouse RGCs. However, it is not clear whether the developmental changes of the RGC receptive field correlate with the dendritic field and whether visual stimulation regulates the maturation of the dendritic field and receptive field of RGCs in a correlated manner. The present work demonstrated that both the dendritic and receptive fields of RGCs continuously develop after eye opening. However, the correlation between the developmental changes in the receptive field size and the dendritic field varies among different RGC types. These results suggest a continuous change of synaptic converging of RGC synaptic inputs in an RGC type-dependent manner. Besides, light deprivation impairs both the development of dendritic and receptive fields.</p>

<p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements of neurogranin (Ng) have emerged as a promising biomarker for cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) allele is by far the most consistent genetic risk factor for AD. However, it is not known whether the pathophysiological roles of Ng in MCI or AD are related to APOEε4. We stratified 250 participants from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database into cognitively normal (CN) ε4 negative (CN ε4−), CN ε4 positive (CN ε4+), MCI ε4 negative (MCI ε4−), MCI ε4 positive (MCI ε4+), AD ε4 negative (AD ε4−), and AD ε4 positive (AD ε4+). CSF Ng levels were significantly increased in APOE ε4 carriers compared to APOE ε4 non-carriers with MCI. In addition, CSF Ng identified MCI ε4+ versus CN ε4−, but not MCI ε4− versus CN ε4−. Similarly, CSF Ng negatively correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores at baseline in the MCI ε4+ group. Our findings support the use of CSF Ng as a biomarker of synaptic pathology for AD. We propose that the roles of CSF Ng in the pathophysiology of MCI may be related to APOE ε4.</p>

<p>Background: Increasing efforts have focused on the establishment of novel biomarkers for the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)-to-AD conversion. Behavioral changes over the course of healthy ageing, at disease onset and during disease progression, have been recently put forward as promising markers for the detection of MCI and AD. The present study examines whether the temporal characteristics of speech in a collaborative referencing task are associated with cognitive function and the volumes of brain regions involved in speech production and known to be reduced in MCI and AD pathology. We then explore the discriminative ability of the temporal speech measures for the classification of MCI and AD.</p><p>Method: Individuals with MCI, mild-to-moderate AD and healthy controls (HCs) underwent a structural MRI scan and a battery of neuropsychological tests. They also engaged in a collaborative referencing task with a caregiver. The associations between the conversational speech timing features, cognitive function (domain-specific) and regional brain volumes were examined by means of linear mixed-effect modeling. Genetic programming was used to explore the discriminative ability of the conversational speech features.</p><p>Results: MCI and mild-to-moderate AD are characterized by a general slowness of speech, attributed to slower speech rate and slower turn-taking in conversational settings. The speech characteristics appear to be reflective of episodic, lexico-semantic, executive functioning and visuospatial deficits and underlying volume reductions in frontal, temporal and cerebellar areas.</p><p>Conclusion: The implementation of conversational speech timing-based technologies in clinical and community settings may provide additional markers for the early detection of cognitive deficits and structural changes associated with MCI and AD.</p>

<p>Introduction: Research related to the automatic detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important, given the high prevalence of AD and the high cost of traditional diagnostic methods. Since AD significantly affects the content and acoustics of spontaneous speech, natural language processing, and machine learning provide promising techniques for reliably detecting AD. There has been a recent proliferation of classification models for AD, but these vary in the datasets used, model types and training and testing paradigms. In this study, we compare and contrast the performance of two common approaches for automatic AD detection from speech on the same, well-matched dataset, to determine the advantages of using domain knowledge vs. pre-trained transfer models.</p><p>Methods: Audio recordings and corresponding manually-transcribed speech transcripts of a picture description task administered to 156 demographically matched older adults, 78 with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and 78 cognitively intact (healthy) were classified using machine learning and natural language processing as “AD” or “non-AD.” The audio was acoustically-enhanced, and post-processed to improve quality of the speech recording as well control for variation caused by recording conditions. Two approaches were used for classification of these speech samples: (1) using domain knowledge: extracting an extensive set of clinically relevant linguistic and acoustic features derived from speech and transcripts based on prior literature, and (2) using transfer-learning and leveraging large pre-trained machine learning models: using transcript-representations that are automatically derived from state-of-the-art pre-trained language models, by fine-tuning Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT)-based sequence classification models.</p><p>Results: We compared the utility of speech transcript representations obtained from recent natural language processing models (i.e., BERT) to more clinically-interpretable language feature-based methods. Both the feature-based approaches and fine-tuned BERT models significantly outperformed the baseline linguistic model using a small set of linguistic features, demonstrating the importance of extensive linguistic information for detecting cognitive impairments relating to AD. We observed that fine-tuned BERT models numerically outperformed feature-based approaches on the AD detection task, but the difference was not statistically significant. Our main contribution is the observation that when tested on the same, demographically balanced dataset and tested on independent, unseen data, both domain knowledge and pretrained linguistic models have good predictive performance for detecting AD based on speech. It is notable that linguistic information alone is capable of achieving comparable, and even numerically better, performance than models including both acoustic and linguistic features here. We also try to shed light on the inner workings of the more black-box natural language processing model by performing an interpretability analysis, and find that attention weights reveal interesting patterns such as higher attribution to more important information content units in the picture description task, as well as pauses and filler words.</p><p>Conclusion: This approach supports the value of well-performing machine learning and linguistically-focussed processing techniques to detect AD from speech and highlights the need to compare model performance on carefully balanced datasets, using consistent same training parameters and independent test datasets in order to determine the best performing predictive model.</p>

<p>Aging causes perseveration (difficulty to switch between actions) in motor and cognitive tasks, suggesting that the same neural processes could govern these abilities in older adults. To test this, we evaluated the relation between independently measured motor and cognitive perseveration in young (21.4 ± 3.7 y/o) and older participants (76.5 ± 2.9 y/o). Motor perseveration was measured with a locomotor task in which participants had to transition between distinct walking patterns. Cognitive perseveration was measured with a card matching task in which participants had to switch between distinct matching rules. We found that perseveration in the cognitive and motor domains were positively related in older, but not younger individuals, such that participants exhibiting greater perseveration in the motor task also perseverated more in the cognitive task. Additionally, exposure reduces motor perseveration: older adults who had practiced the motor task could transition between walking patterns as proficiently as naïve, young individuals. Our results suggest an overlap in neural processes governing cognitive and motor perseveration with aging and that exposure can counteract the age-related motor perseveration.</p>

Protocol of a Randomized Controlled Trial of Language Training vs. Musical Training and Social Interaction in Elderly With Subjective Cognitive Decline</a></h4>

<p>Introduction: With aging comes a reduction of cognitive flexibility, which has been related to the development of late-life depression and progression of general cognitive decline. Several factors have been linked to attenuating such decline in cognitive flexibility, such as education, physical exercise and stimulating leisure activities. Speaking two or more languages has recently received abundant attention as another factor that may build up cognitive reserve, thereby limiting the functional implications of compromised cognition that accompany old age. With the number of older adults reaching record levels, it is important to attenuate the development of old-age disorders. Learning to speak a foreign language might offer a powerful tool in promoting healthy aging, but up to date effect studies are sparse. Here, the protocol that forms the foundation of the current study is presented. The present study aims to: (1) examine the effects of a foreign language training on cognitive flexibility and its neural underpinnings, and on mental health; and (2) assess the unique role of foreign language training vs. other cognitive or social programs.</p><p>Method: One-hundred and ninety-eight Dutch elderly participants reporting subjective cognitive decline are included and randomized to either a language intervention, a music intervention, or a social control intervention. During 3 to 6 months, the language group learns English, the music group learns to play the guitar and the social group participates in social meetings where art workshops are offered. At baseline, at a 3-month follow-up, and at 6 months after termination of the training program, clinical, cognitive and brain activity measurements (combined EEG and fNIRS methods) are taken to assess cognitive flexibility and mental health.</p><p>Discussion: This is the first trial addressing combined effects of language learning in elderly on cognition, language proficiency, socio-affective measures, and brain activity in the context of a randomized controlled trial. If successful, this study can provide insights into how foreign language training can contribute to more cognitively and mentally healthy years in older adulthood.</p><p>Clinical Trial Registration: The trial is registered at the Netherlands Trial Register, July 2, 2018, trial number NL7137. https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/7137.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/68353">Single mosquito metatranscriptomics identifies vectors, emerging pathogens and reservoirs in one assay</a></h4>

Mosquitoes are major infectious disease-carrying vectors. Assessment of current and future risks associated with the mosquito population requires knowledge of the full repertoire of pathogens they carry, including novel viruses, as well as their blood meal sources. Unbiased metatranscriptomic sequencing of individual mosquitoes offers a straightforward, rapid and quantitative means to acquire this information. Here, we profile 148 diverse wild-caught mosquitoes collected in California and detect sequences from eukaryotes, prokaryotes, 24 known and 46 novel viral species. Importantly, sequencing individuals greatly enhanced the value of the biological information obtained. It allowed us to a) speciate host mosquito, b) compute the prevalence of each microbe and recognize a high frequency of viral co-infections, c) associate animal pathogens with specific blood meal sources, and d) apply simple co-occurrence methods to recover previously undetected components of highly prevalent segmented viruses. In the context of emerging diseases, where knowledge about vectors, pathogens, and reservoirs is lacking, the approaches described here can provide actionable information for public health surveillance and intervention decisions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/68068">Simple biochemical features underlie transcriptional activation domain diversity and dynamic, fuzzy binding to Mediator</a></h4>

Gene activator proteins comprise distinct DNA-binding and transcriptional activation domains (ADs). Because few ADs have been described, we tested domains tiling all yeast transcription factors for activation <i>in vivo</i> and identified 150 ADs. By mRNA display, we showed that 73% of ADs bound the Med15 subunit of Mediator, and that binding strength was correlated with activation. AD-Mediator interaction <i>in vitro</i> was unaffected by a large excess of free activator protein, pointing to a dynamic mechanism of interaction. Structural modeling showed that ADs interact with Med15 without shape complementarity ('fuzzy' binding). ADs shared no sequence motifs, but mutagenesis revealed biochemical and structural constraints. Finally, a neural network trained on AD sequences accurately predicted ADs in human proteins and in other yeast proteins, including chromosomal proteins and chromatin remodeling complexes. These findings solve the longstanding enigma of AD structure and function and provide a rationale for their role in biology.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/67468">Variability in the Munc13-1 content of excitatory release site</a></h4>

The molecular mechanisms underlying the diversity of cortical glutamatergic synapses is still incompletely understood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that presynaptic active zones (AZs) are constructed from molecularly uniform, independent release sites (RSs), the number of which scales linearly with the AZ size. Paired recordings between hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and fast-spiking interneurons in acute slices from adult mice followed by quantal analysis demonstrate large variability in the number of RSs (<i>N</i>) at these connections. High resolution molecular analysis of functionally characterized synapses reveals variability in the content of one of the key vesicle priming factors – Munc13-1 – in AZs that possess the same <i>N</i>. Replica immunolabeling also shows a 3-fold variability in the total Munc13-1 content of AZs of identical size, and a 4-fold variability in the size and density of Munc13-1 clusters within the AZs. Our results provide evidence for quantitative molecular heterogeneity of RSs and support a model in which the AZ is built up from variable numbers of molecularly heterogeneous, but independent RSs.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/67425">Protomer alignment modulates specificity of RNA substrate recognition by Ire1</a></h4>

The unfolded protein response (UPR) maintains protein folding homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In metazoan cells, the Ire1 branch of the UPR initiates two functional outputs—non-conventional mRNA splicing and selective mRNA decay (RIDD). By contrast, Ire1 orthologs from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>and <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> are specialized for only splicing or RIDD, respectively. Previously, we showed that the functional specialization lies in Ire1's RNase activity, which is either stringently splice-site specific or promiscuous (W. Li et al., 2018). Here, we developed an assay that reports on Ire1's RNase promiscuity. We found that conversion of two amino acids within the RNase domain of <i>S. cerevisiae </i>Ire1 to their <i>S. pombe</i> counterparts rendered it promiscuous. Using biochemical assays and computational modeling, we show that the mutations rewired a pair of salt bridges at Ire1 RNase domain's dimer interface, changing its protomer alignment. Thus, Ire1 protomer alignment affects its substrates specificity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/67291">Constructing an adult orofacial premotor atlas in Allen mouse CCF</a></h4>

Premotor circuits in the brainstem project to pools of orofacial motoneurons to execute essential motor action such as licking, chewing, breathing, and in rodent, whisking. Previous transsynaptic tracing studies only mapped orofacial premotor circuits in neonatal mice, but the adult circuits remain unknown as a consequence of technical difficulties. Here we developed a three-step monosynaptic transsynaptic tracing strategy to identify premotor neurons controlling vibrissa, tongue protrusion, and jaw-closing muscles in the adult mouse. We registered these different groups of premotor neurons onto the Allen mouse brain common coordinate framework (CCF) and consequently generated a combined 3D orofacial premotor atlas, revealing unique spatial organizations of distinct premotor circuits. We further uncovered premotor neurons that simultaneously innervate multiple motor nuclei and, consequently, are likely to coordinate different muscles involved in the same orofacial motor actions. Our method for tracing adult premotor circuits and registering to Allen CCF is generally applicable and should facilitate the investigations of motor controls of diverse behaviors.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65902">Mechanistic theory predicts the effects of temperature and humidity on inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and other enveloped viruses</a></h4>

Ambient temperature and humidity strongly affect inactivation rates of enveloped viruses, but a mechanistic, quantitative theory of these effects has been elusive. We measure the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on an inert surface at nine temperature and humidity conditions and develop a mechanistic model to explain and predict how temperature and humidity alter virus inactivation. We find SARS-CoV-2 survives longest at low temperatures and extreme relative humidities (RH); median estimated virus half-life is &gt;24 hours at 10C and 40% RH, but ~1.5 hours at 27C and 65% RH. Our mechanistic model uses fundamental chemistry to explain why inactivation rate increases with increased temperature and shows a U-shaped dependence on RH. The model accurately predicts existing measurements of five different human coronaviruses, suggesting that shared mechanisms may affect stability for many viruses. The results indicate scenarios of high transmission risk, point to mitigation strategies, and advance the mechanistic study of virus transmission.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65856">CRISPR-based functional genomics in human dendritic cells</a></h4>

Dendritic cells (DCs) regulate processes ranging from antitumor and antiviral immunity to host-microbe communication at mucosal surfaces. It remains difficult, however, to genetically manipulate human DCs, limiting our ability to probe how DCs elicit specific immune responses. Here, we develop a CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing method for human monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) that mediates knockouts with a median efficiency of &gt;94% across &gt;300 genes. Using this method, we perform genetic screens in moDCs, identifying mechanisms by which DCs tune responses to lipopolysaccharides from the human microbiome. In addition, we reveal donor-specific responses to lipopolysaccharides, underscoring the importance of assessing immune phenotypes in donor-derived cells, and identify candidate genes that control this specificity, highlighting the potential of our method to pinpoint determinants of inter-individual variation in immunity. Our work sets the stage for a systematic dissection of the immune signaling at the host-microbiome interface and for targeted engineering of DCs for neoantigen vaccination.

Objective
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder. Males are on average ~ 1.5 times more likely to develop PD compared to females with European ancestry. Over the years genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic risk factors for PD, however it is unclear whether genetics contribute to disease etiology in a sex‐specific manner.


Methods
In an effort to study sex‐specific genetic factors associated with PD, we explored two large genetic datasets from the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium and the UK Biobank consisting of 13,020 male PD cases, 7,936 paternal proxy cases, 89,660 male controls, 7,947 female PD cases, 5,473 maternal proxy cases and 90,662 female controls. We performed GWAS meta‐analyses to identify distinct patterns of genetic risk contributing to disease in male versus female PD cases.


Results
In total 19 genome‐wide significant regions were identified and no sex‐specific effects were observed. A high genetic correlation between the male and female PD GWASes was identified (rg = 0.877) and heritability estimates were identical between male and female PD cases (~20%).


Interpretation
We did not detect any significant genetic differences between male or female PD cases. Our study does not support the notion that common genetic variation on the autosomes could explain the difference in prevalence of PD between males and females at least when considering the current sample size under study. Further studies are warranted to investigate the genetic architecture of PD explained by X and Y chromosomes and further evaluate environmental effects that could potentially contribute to PD etiology in male versus females.

Vaccine hesitancy is considered as one of the leading causes for the resurgence of vaccine preventable diseases. A non-negligible minority of parents does not fully adhere to the recommended vaccination schedule, leading their children to be partially immunized and at higher risk of contracting vaccine preventable diseases. Here, we leverage more than one million comments of 201,986 users posted from March 2008 to April 2019 on the public online forum BabyCenter US to learn more about such parents. For 32% with geographic location, we find the number of mapped users for each US state resembling the census population distribution with good agreement. We employ Natural Language Processing to identify 6884 and 10,131 users expressing their intention of following the recommended and alternative vaccination schedule, respectively RSUs and ASUs. From the analysis of their activity on the forum we find that ASUs have distinctly different interests and previous experiences with vaccination than RSUs. In particular, ASUs are more likely to follow groups focused on alternative medicine, are two times more likely to have experienced adverse events following immunization, and to mention more serious adverse reactions such as seizure or developmental regression. Content analysis of comments shows that the resources most frequently shared by both groups point to governmental domains (.gov). Finally, network analysis shows that RSUs and ASUs communicate between each other (indicating the absence of echo chambers), however with the latter group being more endogamic and favoring interactions with other ASUs. While our findings are limited to the specific platform analyzed, our approach may provide additional insights for the development of campaigns targeting parents on digital platforms.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LUxN24a33jc" width="1" />

<p>by Kai Röth, Shuai Shao, Julijana Gjorgjieva</p>

Sensory organs transmit information to downstream brain circuits using a neural code comprised of spikes from multiple neurons. According to the prominent efficient coding framework, the properties of sensory populations have evolved to encode maximum information about stimuli given biophysical constraints. How information coding depends on the way sensory signals from multiple channels converge downstream is still unknown, especially in the presence of noise which corrupts the signal at different points along the pathway. Here, we calculated the optimal information transfer of a population of nonlinear neurons under two scenarios. First, a lumped-coding channel where the information from different inputs converges to a single channel, thus reducing the number of neurons. Second, an independent-coding channel when different inputs contribute independent information without convergence. In each case, we investigated information loss when the sensory signal was corrupted by two sources of noise. We determined critical noise levels at which the optimal number of distinct thresholds of individual neurons in the population changes. Comparing our system to classical physical systems, these changes correspond to first- or second-order phase transitions for the lumped- or the independent-coding channel, respectively. We relate our theoretical predictions to coding in a population of auditory nerve fibers recorded experimentally, and find signatures of efficient coding. Our results yield important insights into the diverse coding strategies used by neural populations to optimally integrate sensory stimuli in the presence of distinct sources of noise.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uMJV6mqDdZg" width="1" />

The synchronized firings of active motor units (MUs) increase the oscillations of muscle force, observed as physiological tremors. This study aimed to investigate the effects of synchronizing the firings within three types of MUs (slow—S, fast resistant to fatigue–FR, and fast fatigable–FF) on the muscle force production using a mathematical model of the rat medial gastrocnemius muscle. The model was designed based on the actual proportion and physiological properties of MUs and motoneurons innervating the muscle. The isometric muscle and MU forces were simulated by a model predicting non-synchronized firing of a pool of 57 MUs (including 8 S, 23 FR, and 26 FF) to ascertain a maximum excitatory signal when all MUs were recruited into the contraction. The mean firing frequency of each MU depended upon the twitch contraction time, whereas the recruitment order was determined according to increasing forces (the size principle). The synchronization of firings of individual MUs was simulated using four different modes and inducing the synchronization of firings within three time windows (± 2, ± 4, and ± 6 ms) for four different combinations of MUs. The synchronization was estimated using two parameters, the correlation coefficient and the cross-interval synchronization index. The four scenarios of synchronization increased the values of the root-mean-square, range, and maximum force in correlation with the increase of the time window. Greater synchronization index values resulted in higher root-mean-square, range, and maximum of force outcomes for all MU types as well as for the whole muscle output; however, the mean spectral frequency of the forces decreased, whereas the mean force remained nearly unchanged. The range of variability and the root-mean-square of forces were higher for fast MUs than for slow MUs; meanwhile, the relative values of these parameters were highest for slow MUs, indicating their important contribution to muscle tremor, especially during weak contractions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MMvIEe796bA" width="1" />

<p>by Alejandro Lerer, Hans Supèr, Matthias S. Keil</p>

The visual system is highly sensitive to spatial context for encoding luminance patterns. Context sensitivity inspired the proposal of many neural mechanisms for explaining the perception of luminance (brightness). Here we propose a novel computational model for estimating the brightness of many visual illusions. We hypothesize that many aspects of brightness can be explained by a dynamic filtering process that reduces the redundancy in edge representations on the one hand, while non-redundant activity is enhanced on the other. The dynamic filter is learned for each input image and implements context sensitivity. Dynamic filtering is applied to the responses of (model) complex cells in order to build a gain control map. The gain control map then acts on simple cell responses before they are used to create a brightness map via activity propagation. Our approach is successful in predicting many challenging visual illusions, including contrast effects, assimilation, and reverse contrast with the same set of model parameters.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VeY42W5-nio" width="1" />

<p>by Tom Gallagher, Paul B. McCray Jr</p>

What transpires soon after inhaling Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the respiratory virus causing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)? Where does infection begin? What are the features of subsequent virus spread? How might host responses quickly contain infection? Two recently published manuscripts have evaluated infection in primary cultures of well-differentiated cells to address these questions and bring more light on the proviral and antiviral components operating during the initial days after SARS-CoV-2 exposure.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4eS0Sxaj6Ik" width="1" />

Programmed death cell receptor 1 (PD-1) is expressed on T cells upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) is expressed in most tumor environments, and its binding to PD-1 on T cells drives them to apoptosis or into a regulatory phenotype. The fact that PD-L1 itself is also expressed on T cells upon activation has been largely neglected. Here, we demonstrate that PD-L1 ligation on human CD25-depleted CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, combined with CD3/TCR stimulation, induces their conversion into highly suppressive T cells. Furthermore, this effect was most prominent in memory (CD45RA<sup>−</sup>CD45RO<sup>+</sup>) T cells. PD-L1 engagement on T cells resulted in reduced ERK phosphorylation and decreased AKT/mTOR/S6 signaling. Importantly, T cells from rheumatoid arthritis patients exhibited high basal levels of phosphorylated ERK and following PD-L1 cross-linking both ERK signaling and the AKT/mTOR/S6 pathway failed to be down modulated, making them refractory to the acquisition of a regulatory phenotype. Altogether, our results suggest that PD-L1 signaling on memory T cells could play an important role in resolving inflammatory responses; maintaining a tolerogenic environment and its failure could contribute to ongoing autoimmunity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Z5vrkKoDlp4" width="1" />

Cell death is a vital event in life. Infections and injuries cause lytic cell death, which gives rise to danger signals that can further induce cell death, inflammation, and tissue damage. The mevalonate (MVA) pathway is an essential, highly conserved and dynamic metabolic pathway. Here, we discover that farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), a metabolic intermediate of the MVA pathway, functions as a newly identified danger signal to trigger acute cell death leading to neuron loss in stroke. Harboring both a hydrophobic 15-carbon isoprenyl chain and a heavily charged pyrophosphate head, FPP leads to acute cell death independent of its downstream metabolic pathways. Mechanistically, extracellular calcium influx and the cation channel transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) exhibit essential roles in FPP-induced cell death. FPP activates TRPM2 opening for ion influx. Furthermore, in terms of a mouse model constructing by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), FPP accumulates in the brain, which indicates the function of the FPP and TRPM2 danger signal axis in ischemic injury. Overall, our data have revealed a novel function of the MVA pathway intermediate metabolite FPP as a danger signal via transient receptor potential cation channels.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/22YzXyZQW3E" width="1" />

Viral diseases pose major threats to humans and other animals, including the billions of chickens that are an important food source as well as a public health concern due to zoonotic pathogens. Unlike humans and other typical mammals, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of chickens can confer decisive resistance or susceptibility to many viral diseases. An iconic example is Marek’s disease, caused by an oncogenic herpesvirus with over 100 genes. Classical MHC class I and class II molecules present antigenic peptides to T lymphocytes, and it has been hard to understand how such MHC molecules could be involved in susceptibility to Marek’s disease, given the potential number of peptides from over 100 genes. We used a new in vitro infection system and immunopeptidomics to determine peptide motifs for the 2 class II molecules expressed by the MHC haplotype B2, which is known to confer resistance to Marek’s disease. Surprisingly, we found that the vast majority of viral peptide epitopes presented by chicken class II molecules arise from only 4 viral genes, nearly all having the peptide motif for BL2*02, the dominantly expressed class II molecule in chickens. We expressed BL2*02 linked to several Marek’s disease virus (MDV) peptides and determined one X-ray crystal structure, showing how a single small amino acid in the binding site causes a crinkle in the peptide, leading to a core binding peptide of 10 amino acids, compared to the 9 amino acids in all other reported class II molecules. The limited number of potential T cell epitopes from such a complex virus can explain the differential MHC-determined resistance to MDV, but raises questions of mechanism and opportunities for vaccine targets in this important food species, as well as providing a basis for understanding class II molecules in other species including humans.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qtXckE5WW1s" width="1" />

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with a strong genetic component. A growing number of variants and genes have been reported to be associated with PD; however, there is no database that integrate different type of genetic data, and support analyzing of PD-associated genes (PAGs). By systematic review and curation of multiple lines of public studies, we integrate multiple layers of genetic data (rare variants and copy-number variants identified from patients with PD, associated variants identified from genome-wide association studies, differentially expressed genes, and differential DNA methylation genes) and age at onset in PD. We integrated five layers of genetic data (8302 terms) with different levels of evidences from more than 3,000 studies and prioritized 124 PAGs with strong or suggestive evidences. These PAGs were identified to be significantly interacted with each other and formed an interconnected functional network enriched in several functional pathways involved in PD, suggesting these genes may contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. Furthermore, we identified 10 genes were associated with a juvenile-onset (age ≤ 30 years), 11 genes were associated with an early-onset (age of 30–50 years), whereas another 10 genes were associated with a late-onset (age &gt; 50 years). Notably, the AAOs of patients with loss of function variants in five genes were significantly lower than that of patients with deleterious missense variants, while patients with VPS13C (P = 0.01) was opposite. Finally, we developed an online database named Gene4PD (http://genemed.tech/gene4pd) which integrated published genetic data in PD, the PAGs, and 63 popular genomic data sources, as well as an online pipeline for prioritize risk variants in PD. In conclusion, Gene4PD provides researchers and clinicians comprehensive genetic knowledge and analytic platform for PD, and would also improve the understanding of pathogenesis in PD.</p>

<p>Cerebral perforating artery flow velocity and pulsatility can be measured using 7 tesla (T) MRI. Enabling these flow metrics on more widely available 3T systems would make them more employable. It is currently unknown whether these measurements can be performed at 3T MRI due to the lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate if flow velocity and pulsatility in the perforating arteries of the basal ganglia (BG) can be measured at 3T MRI and assess the agreement with 7T MRI measurements as reference. Twenty-nine subjects were included, of which 14 patients with aortic coarctation [median age 29 years (21–72)] and 15 controls [median age 27 years (22–64)]. Using a cardiac-gated 2D phase-contrast MRI sequence BG perforating arteries were imaged at 3T and 7T MRI and perforating artery density (N<sub>density</sub>, #/cm<sup>2</sup>), flow velocity (V<sub>mean</sub>, cm/s) and pulsatility index (PI) were determined. Agreement between scanner modalities was assessed using correlation and difference plots with linear regression. A p-value ≤ 0.05 indicated statistical significance. It was shown that perforating artery flow velocity and pulsatility can be measured at 3T MRI (N<sub>density</sub> = 0.21 ± 0.11; V<sub>mean</sub> = 6.04 ± 1.27; PI = 0.49 ± 0.19), although values differed from 7T MRI measurements (N<sub>density</sub> = 0.95 ± 0.21; V<sub>mean</sub> = 3.89 ± 0.56; PI = 0.28 ± 0.08). The number of detected arteries was lower at 3T (5 ± 3) than 7T MRI (24 ± 6), indicating that 3T MRI is on average a factor 4.8 less sensitive to detect cerebral perforating arteries. Comparison with 7T MRI as reference showed some agreement in N<sub>density</sub>, but little to no agreement for V<sub>mean</sub> and PI. Equalizing the modalities’ sensitivity by comparing the detected arteries on 7T MRI with the highest velocity with all vessels detected on 3T MRI, showed some improvement in agreement for PI, but not for V<sub>mean</sub>. This study shows that it is possible to measure cerebral perforating artery flow velocity and pulsatility at 3T MRI, although an approximately fivefold sample size is needed at 3T relative to 7T MRI for a given effect size, and the measurements should be performed with equal scanner field strength and protocol.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.663541">Neuroprotective Effects of Fingolimod Supplement on the Retina and Optic Nerve in the Mouse Model of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis</a></h4>

<p>Favorable effects exerted by long-term administration of fingolimod therapy in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients have been reported, but sporadic side effects, such as reversible macular edema, also have been recorded. The present study aimed to determine whether fingolimod therapy is beneficial to the visual system in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice. A decrease in demyelination and axon loss in the optic nerve as well as cellular infiltration, especially the recruited macrophages, was observed in EAE with fingolimod treatment. Fingolimod administration diminished hypergliosis of macroglia, including astrocytes and Müller cells in the retina and optic nerve in EAE. Microglia were hyperactivated in the retina and optic nerve in the EAE mice compared to controls, which could be alleviated by fingolimod treatment. Moreover, apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and oligodendrocytes in the optic nerve was significantly reduced with fingolimod treatment compared to that in the untreated EAE mice. These results suggested that fingolimod exerts neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects on the retina and optic nerve in a mouse model of EAE. Considering the paradox of favorable and side effects of fingolimod on visual system, we speculate that side effects including macular oedema caused by fingolimod during MS treatment is tendency to be vasogenic rather than hypergliosis in optic nerve and retina which warrants further neuroophthalmological investigation.</p>

<p>Electrical stimulation of specific small fibers (Aδ- and C-fibers) is used in basic studies on nociception and neuropathic pain and to diagnose neuropathies. For selective stimulation of small fibers, the optimal stimulation waveform parameters are an important aspect together with the study of electrode design. However, determining an optimal stimulation condition is challenging, as it requires the characterization of the response of the small fibers to electrical stimulation. The perception thresholds are generally characterized using single-pulse stimulation based on the strength-duration curve. However, this does not account for the temporal effects of the different waveforms used in practical applications. In this study, we designed an experiment to characterize the effects of multiple pulse stimulation and proposed a computational model that considers electrostimulation of fibers and synaptic effects in a multiscale model. The measurements of perception thresholds showed that the pulse dependency of the threshold was an exponential decay with a maximum reduction of 55%. In addition, the frequency dependence of the threshold showed a U-shaped response with a reduction of 25% at 30 Hz. Moreover, the computational model explained the synaptic effects, which were also confirmed by evoked potential recordings. This study further characterized the activation of small fibers and clarified the synaptic effects, demonstrating the importance of waveform selection.</p>

<p>Background: Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common symptom in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and can be difficult to treat with dopaminergic medications or with deep brain stimulation (DBS). Novel stimulation paradigms have been proposed to address suboptimal responses to conventional DBS programming methods. Burst-cycling deep brain stimulation (BCDBS) delivers current in various frequencies of bursts (e.g., 4, 10, or 15 Hz), while maintaining an intra-burst frequency identical to conventional DBS.</p><p>Objective: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of BCDBS in PD patients with FOG.</p><p>Methods: Ten PD subjects with STN or GPi DBS and complaints of FOG were recruited for this single center, single blinded within-subject crossover study. For each subject, we compared 4, 10, and 15 Hz BCDBS to conventional DBS during the PD medication-OFF state.</p><p>Results: There were no serious adverse events with BCDBS. It was feasible and straightforward to program BCDBS in the clinic setting. The benefit was comparable to conventional DBS in measures of FOG, functional mobility and in PD motor symptoms. BCDBS had lower battery consumption when compared to conventional DBS.</p><p>Conclusions: BCDBS was feasible, safe and well tolerated and it has potential to be a viable future DBS programming strategy.</p>

<p>Short-term limb immobilization results in skeletal muscle decline, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. This study aimed to determine the neurophysiologic basis of immobilization-induced skeletal muscle decline, and whether repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) could prevent any decline. Twenty-four healthy young males (20 ± 0.5 years) underwent unilateral limb immobilization for 72 h. Subjects were randomized between daily rTMS (n = 12) using six 20 Hz pulse trains of 1.5 s duration with a 60 s inter-train-interval delivered at 90% resting Motor Threshold (rMT), or Sham rTMS (n = 12) throughout immobilization. Maximal grip strength, EMG activity, arm volume, and composition were determined at 0 and 72 h. Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) were determined daily throughout immobilization to index motor excitability. Immobilization induced a significant reduction in motor excitability across time (−30% at 72 h; p &lt; 0.05). The rTMS intervention increased motor excitability at 0 h (+13%, p &lt; 0.05). Despite daily rTMS treatment, there was still a significant reduction in motor excitability (−33% at 72 h, p &lt; 0.05), loss in EMG activity (−23.5% at 72 h; p &lt; 0.05), and a loss of maximal grip strength (−22%, p &lt; 0.001) after immobilization. Interestingly, the increase in biceps (Sham vs. rTMS) (+0.8 vs. +0.1 mm, p &lt; 0.01) and posterior forearm (+0.3 vs. +0.0 mm, p &lt; 0.05) skinfold thickness with immobilization in Sham treatment was not observed following rTMS treatment. Reduced MEPs drive the loss of strength with immobilization. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation cannot prevent this loss of strength but further investigation and optimization of neuroplasticity protocols may have therapeutic benefit.</p>

Introduction<p>Although the motor signs of Parkinson’s disease (PD) are well defined, nonmotor symptoms, including higher-level language deficits, have also been shown to be frequent in patients with PD. In the present study, we used a lexical decision task (LDT) to find out whether access to the mental lexicon is impaired in patients with PD, and whether task performance is affected by bradykinesia.</p>Materials and Methods<p>Participants were 34 nondemented patients with PD, either without (off) medication (n = 16) or under optimum (on) medication (n = 18). A total of 19 age-matched control volunteers were also recruited. We recorded reaction times (RTs) to the LDT and a simple RT (control) task. In each task, stimuli were either visual or auditory. Statistical analyses consisted of repeated-measures analyses of variance and Tukey’s HSD post hoc tests.</p>Results<p>In the LDT, participants with PD both off and on medication exhibited intact access to the mental lexicon in both modalities. In the visual modality, patients off medication were just as fast as controls when identifying real words, but slower when identifying pseudowords. In the visual modality of the control task, RTs for pseudowords were significantly longer for PD patients off medication than for controls, revealing an unexpected but significant lexicality effect in patients that was not observed in the auditory modality. Performances of patients on medication did not differ from those of age-matched controls.</p>Discussion<p>Motor execution was not slowed in patients with PD either off or on medication, in comparison with controls. Regarding lexical access, patients off medication seemed to (1) have difficulty inhibiting a cognitive-linguistic process (i.e., reading) when it was not required (simple reaction time task), and (2) exhibit a specific pseudoword processing deficit in the LDT, which may have been related to impaired lateral word inhibition within the mental lexicon. These deficits seemed to be compensated by medication.</p>

<p>Cholinergic and noradrenergic neuromodulation of the synaptic transmission from cortical layer 6 of the primary somatosensory cortex to neurons in the posteromedial thalamic nucleus (PoM) was studied using an in vitro slice preparation from young rats. Cholinergic agonist carbachol substantially decreased the amplitudes of consecutive excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) evoked by a 20 Hz five pulse train. The decreased amplitude effect was counteracted by a parallel increase of synaptic frequency-dependent facilitation. We found this modulation to be mediated by muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. In the presence of carbachol the amplitudes of the postsynaptic potentials showed a higher trial-to-trial coefficient of variation (CV), which suggested a presynaptic site of action for the modulation. To substantiate this finding, we measured the failure rate of the excitatory postsynaptic currents in PoM cells evoked by “pseudominimal” stimulation of corticothalamic input. A higher failure-rate in the presence of carbachol indicated decreased probability of transmitter release at the synapse. Activation of the noradrenergic modulatory system that was mimicked by application of norepinephrine did not affect the amplitude of the first EPSP evoked in the five-pulse train, but later EPSPs were diminished. This indicated a decrease of the synaptic frequency-dependent facilitation. Treatment with noradrenergic α-2 agonist clonidine, α-1 agonist phenylephrine, or β-receptor agonist isoproterenol showed that the modulation may partly rely on α-2 adrenergic receptors. CV analysis did not suggest a presynaptic action of norepinephrine. We conclude that cholinergic and noradrenergic modulation act as different variable dynamic controls for the corticothalamic mechanism of the frequency-dependent facilitation in PoM.</p>

<p>Astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are known to play critical roles in the central nervous system development, homeostasis and response to injury. In addition to their well-defined functions in synaptic signaling, blood-brain barrier control and myelination, it is now becoming clear that both glial cells also actively produce a wide range of immune-regulatory factors and engage in an intricate communication with neurons, microglia or with infiltrated immune cells, thus taking a center stage in both inflammation and resolution processes occurring within the brain. Resolution of inflammation is operated by the superfamily of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs), that include lipoxins, resolvins, protectins and maresins, and that altogether activate a series of cellular and molecular events that lead to spontaneous regression of inflammatory processes and restoration of tissue homeostasis. Here, we review the manifold effects of SPMs on modulation of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, along with the mechanisms through which they either inhibit inflammatory pathways or induce the activation of protective ones. Furthermore, the possible role of SPMs in modulating the cross-talk between microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes is also summarized. This SPM-mediated mechanism uncovers novel pathways of immune regulation in the brain that could be further exploited to control neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>The ability to reliably repair spinal cord injuries (SCI) will be one of the greatest human achievements realized in regenerative medicine. Until recently, the cellular path to this goal has been challenging. However, as detailed developmental principles are revealed in mouse and human models, their application in the stem cell community brings trunk and spine embryology into efforts to advance human regenerative medicine. New models of posterior embryo development identify neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) as a major bifurcation point in generating the spinal cord and somites and is leading to production of cell types with the full range of axial identities critical for repair of trunk and spine disorders. This is coupled with organoid technologies including assembloids, circuitoids, and gastruloids. We describe a paradigm for applying developmental principles towards the goal of cell-based restorative therapies to enable reproducible and effective near-term clinical interventions.</p>

<p>This study highlights the importance of looking beyond the main effect of movement to study alterations in functional response in the presence of central nervous system pathologies such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Data show that MS selectively affects regional BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) responses to variable grip forces (GF). It is known that the anterior and posterior BA 4 areas (BA 4a and BA 4p) are anatomically and functionally distinct. It has also been shown in healthy volunteers that there are linear (first order, typical of BA 4a) and nonlinear (second to fourth order, typical of BA 4p) BOLD responses to different levels of GF applied during a dynamic motor paradigm. After modeling the BOLD response with a polynomial expansion of the applied GFs, the particular case of BA 4a and BA 4p were investigated in healthy volunteers (HV) and MS subjects. The main effect of movement (zeroth order) analysis showed that the BOLD signal is greater in MS compared with healthy volunteers within both BA 4 subregions. At higher order, BOLD-GF responses were similar in BA 4a but showed a marked alteration in BA 4p of MS subjects, with those with greatest disability showing the greatest deviations from the healthy response profile. Therefore, the different behaviors in HV and MS could only be uncovered through a polynomial analysis looking beyond the main effect of movement into the two BA 4 subregions. Future studies will investigate the source of this pathophysiology, combining the present fMRI paradigm with blood perfusion and nonlinear neuronal response analysis.</p>

Background<p>This study aimed to investigate the association between serum levels of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), a soluble form of an innate immune receptor expressed on the microglia, and brain volume in older adults.</p>Methods<p>The survey was conducted twice in Kurokawa-cho, Imari, Saga Prefecture, Japan, among people aged 65 years and older. We collected data from 596 residents. Serum sTREM2 level measurements, brain MRI, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and clinical dementia rating (CDR) were performed at Time 1 (2009–2011). Follow-up brain MRI, MMSE, and CDR were performed at Time 2 (2016–2017). The interval between Time 1 and Time 2 was approximately 7 years. Sixty-nine participants (16 men, mean age 72.69 ± 3.18 years; 53 women, mean age 72.68 ± 4.64 years) completed this study. We analyzed the correlation between serum sTREM2 levels (Time 1) and brain volume (Time 1, Time 2, and Time 1–Time 2 difference) using voxel-based morphometry implemented with Statistical Parametric Mapping.</p>Results<p>Participants in this study had lower MMSE and higher CDR scores 7 years after the baseline evaluation. However, analyses at the cluster level by applying multiple comparison corrections (family wise error; P &lt; 0.05) showed no correlation between serum sTREM2 levels and volume of different brain regions, either cross-sectional or longitudinal.</p>Conclusion<p>Serum sTREM2 level could not serve as an immune biomarker of aging-related volume changes in brain regions closely related to cognitive function in older adults aged 65 years and above.</p>

<p>Background: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) following anesthesia and surgery is a common and severe complication, especially in elderly patients. A pre-existing cognitive impairment may impart susceptibility to further cognitive dysfunction; the mechanism remains unclear. We hypothesized that the specific impacts of anesthesia and surgery on individuals with preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD) may render them more susceptible to an increase in the risk of cognitive impairment. The aim of this study was to compare the cognitive impairment between normal adult mice and those with preclinical AD after propofol anesthesia and surgery.</p><p>Methods: We performed abdominal surgery in cognitively pre-symptomatic, 5-month-old male mice with sporadic AD (apolipoprotein E4 allele, ApoE4-KI) and age-matched (C57BL/6J) controls. Propofol anesthesia (170 mg/kg) was induced via retro-orbital injection over 2 h. Morris water maze (MWM) and Y-maze tests were conducted 2 days before and 2, 4, and 7 days after surgery. The mean escape latencies and spontaneous alternation percentages were the major outcomes. Neuronal apoptosis in hippocampal sections was evaluated using the terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Hippocampal amyloid beta (Aβ) levels were assessed via quantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC).</p><p>Results: The control mice exhibited increased mean escape latencies of MWM at postoperative 2 and 4, but not at day 7; ApoE4-KI mice exhibited such increases at postoperative days 2, 4 and 7. Significant differences between ApoE4-KI and control mice in terms of the mean escape latencies were evident at days 2 and 7 (both P &lt; 0.05). However, performance on a non-hippocampal memory tasks (Y-maze test) did not differ. More TUNEL-positive neurons were evident in the hippocampal CA3 region of ApoE4-KI mice at postoperative days 2 and 4, but not at day 7 compared to the control group (both P &lt; 0.05). IHC revealed significantly elevated Aβ deposition in the hippocampal CA3 region of ApoE4-KI mice at postoperative days 4 and 7 compared to control mice (both P &lt; 0.05).</p><p>Conclusions: Propofol anesthesia followed by surgery induced persistent changes in cognition, and pathological hippocampal changes in pre-symptomatic, but vulnerable AD mice. It would be appropriate to explore whether preclinical AD patients are more vulnerable to POCD development.</p>

<p>by Jan Stenum, Cristina Rossi, Ryan T. Roemmich</p>

Human gait analysis is often conducted in clinical and basic research, but many common approaches (e.g., three-dimensional motion capture, wearables) are expensive, immobile, data-limited, and require expertise. Recent advances in video-based pose estimation suggest potential for gait analysis using two-dimensional video collected from readily accessible devices (e.g., smartphones). To date, several studies have extracted features of human gait using markerless pose estimation. However, we currently lack evaluation of video-based approaches using a dataset of human gait for a wide range of gait parameters on a stride-by-stride basis and a workflow for performing gait analysis from video. Here, we compared spatiotemporal and sagittal kinematic gait parameters measured with OpenPose (open-source video-based human pose estimation) against simultaneously recorded three-dimensional motion capture from overground walking of healthy adults. When assessing all individual steps in the walking bouts, we observed mean absolute errors between motion capture and OpenPose of 0.02 s for temporal gait parameters (i.e., step time, stance time, swing time and double support time) and 0.049 m for step lengths. Accuracy improved when spatiotemporal gait parameters were calculated as individual participant mean values: mean absolute error was 0.01 s for temporal gait parameters and 0.018 m for step lengths. The greatest difference in gait speed between motion capture and OpenPose was less than 0.10 m s<sup>−1</sup>. Mean absolute error of sagittal plane hip, knee and ankle angles between motion capture and OpenPose were 4.0°, 5.6° and 7.4°. Our analysis workflow is freely available, involves minimal user input, and does not require prior gait analysis expertise. Finally, we offer suggestions and considerations for future applications of pose estimation for human gait analysis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/r-92OwQVJvo" width="1" />

<p>by Ulkar Aghayeva, Abhishek Bhattacharya, Surojit Sural, Eliza Jaeger, Matthew Churgin, Christopher Fang-Yen, Oliver Hobert</p>

Many cell types display the remarkable ability to alter their cellular phenotype in response to specific external or internal signals. Such phenotypic plasticity is apparent in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> when adverse environmental conditions trigger entry into the dauer diapause stage. This entry is accompanied by structural, molecular, and functional remodeling of a number of distinct tissue types of the animal, including its nervous system. The transcription factor (TF) effectors of 3 different hormonal signaling systems, the insulin-responsive DAF-16/FoxO TF, the TGFβ-responsive DAF-3/SMAD TF, and the steroid nuclear hormone receptor, DAF-12/VDR, a homolog of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), were previously shown to be required for entering the dauer arrest stage, but their cellular and temporal focus of action for the underlying cellular remodeling processes remained incompletely understood. Through the generation of conditional alleles that allowed us to spatially and temporally control gene activity, we show here that all 3 TFs are not only required to initiate tissue remodeling upon entry into the dauer stage, as shown before, but are also continuously required to maintain the remodeled state. We show that DAF-3/SMAD is required in sensory neurons to promote and then maintain animal-wide tissue remodeling events. In contrast, DAF-16/FoxO or DAF-12/VDR act cell-autonomously to control anatomical, molecular, and behavioral remodeling events in specific cell types. Intriguingly, we also uncover non-cell autonomous function of DAF-16/FoxO and DAF-12/VDR in nervous system remodeling, indicating the presence of several insulin-dependent interorgan signaling axes. Our findings provide novel perspectives into how hormonal systems control tissue remodeling.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/KCzeoM6J2mE" width="1" />

<p>by Tsubasa Tanaka, Naoki Tani, Akira Nakamura</p>

The <i>Drosophila</i> germ plasm is responsible for germ cell formation. Its assembly begins with localization of <i>oskar</i> mRNA to the posterior pole of the oocyte. The <i>oskar</i> translation produces 2 isoforms with distinct functions: short Oskar recruits germ plasm components, whereas long Oskar remodels actin to anchor the components to the cortex. The mechanism by which long Oskar anchors them remains elusive. Here, we report that Yolkless, which facilitates uptake of nutrient yolk proteins into the oocyte, is a key cofactor for long Oskar. Loss of Yolkless or depletion of yolk proteins disrupts the microtubule alignment and <i>oskar</i> mRNA localization at the posterior pole of the oocyte, whereas microtubule-dependent localization of <i>bicoid</i> mRNA to the anterior and <i>gurken</i> mRNA to the anterior-dorsal corner remains intact. Furthermore, these mutant oocytes do not properly respond to long Oskar, causing defects in the actin remodeling and germ plasm anchoring. Thus, the yolk uptake is not merely the process for nutrient incorporation, but also crucial for <i>oskar</i> mRNA localization and cortical anchorage of germ plasm components in the oocyte.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4hWUnG5Fu1E" width="1" />

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and plastid DNA (ptDNA) encode vital bioenergetic apparatus, and mutations in these organelle DNA (oDNA) molecules can be devastating. In the germline of several animals, a genetic “bottleneck” increases cell-to-cell variance in mtDNA heteroplasmy, allowing purifying selection to act to maintain low proportions of mutant mtDNA. However, most eukaryotes do not sequester a germline early in development, and even the animal bottleneck remains poorly understood. How then do eukaryotic organelles avoid Muller’s ratchet—the gradual buildup of deleterious oDNA mutations? Here, we construct a comprehensive and predictive genetic model, quantitatively describing how different mechanisms segregate and decrease oDNA damage across eukaryotes. We apply this comprehensive theory to characterise the animal bottleneck with recent single-cell observations in diverse mouse models. Further, we show that gene conversion is a particularly powerful mechanism to increase beneficial cell-to-cell variance without depleting oDNA copy number, explaining the benefit of observed oDNA recombination in diverse organisms which do not sequester animal-like germlines (for example, sponges, corals, fungi, and plants). Genomic, transcriptomic, and structural datasets across eukaryotes support this mechanism for generating beneficial variance without a germline bottleneck. This framework explains puzzling oDNA differences across taxa, suggesting how Muller’s ratchet is avoided in different eukaryotes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/mrvsEqfgoh4" width="1" />

<p>by David S. Milner, Jeremy G. Wideman, Courtney W. Stairs, Cory D. Dunn, Thomas A. Richards</p>

The overarching trend in mitochondrial genome evolution is functional streamlining coupled with gene loss; therefore, gene acquisition by mitochondria is considered to be exceedingly rare. Selfish elements in the form of self-splicing introns occur in many organellar genomes, but the wider diversity of selfish elements, and how they persist in the DNA of organelles, has not been explored. In the mitochondrial genome of a marine heterotrophic katablepharid protist, we identify a functional type II restriction modification (RM) system originating from a horizontal gene transfer (HGT) event involving bacteria related to flavobacteria. This RM system consists of an HpaII-like endonuclease and a cognate cytosine methyltransferase (CM). We demonstrate that these proteins are functional by heterologous expression in both bacterial and eukaryotic cells. These results suggest that a mitochondrial-encoded RM system can function as a toxin–antitoxin selfish element and that such elements could be co-opted by eukaryotic genomes to drive biased organellar inheritance.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/z_T8RqQw6hU" width="1" />

<p>All perceptual and cognitive circuits in the human cerebral cortex are organized into layers. Specializations of a canonical laminar network of bottom-up, horizontal, and top-down pathways carry out multiple kinds of biological intelligence across different neocortical areas. This article describes what this canonical network is and notes that it can support processes as different as 3D vision and figure-ground perception; attentive category learning and decision-making; speech perception; and cognitive working memory (WM), planning, and prediction. These processes take place within and between multiple parallel cortical streams that obey computationally complementary laws. The interstream interactions that are needed to overcome these complementary deficiencies mix cell properties so thoroughly that some authors have noted the difficulty of determining what exactly constitutes a cortical stream and the differences between streams. The models summarized herein explain how these complementary properties arise, and how their interstream interactions overcome their computational deficiencies to support effective goal-oriented behaviors.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.647011">Spectrum Degradation of Hippocampal LFP During Euthanasia</a></h4>

<p>The hippocampal local field potential (LFP) exhibits a strong correlation with behavior. During rest, the theta rhythm is not prominent, but during active behavior, there are strong rhythms in the theta, theta harmonics, and gamma ranges. With increasing running velocity, theta, theta harmonics and gamma increase in power and in cross-frequency coupling, suggesting that neural entrainment is a direct consequence of the total excitatory input. While it is common to study the parametric range between the LFP and its complementing power spectra between deep rest and epochs of high running velocity, it is also possible to explore how the spectra degrades as the energy is completely quenched from the system. Specifically, it is unknown whether the 1/f slope is preserved as synaptic activity becomes diminished, as low frequencies are generated by large pools of neurons while higher frequencies comprise the activity of more local neuronal populations. To test this hypothesis, we examined rat LFPs recorded from the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex during barbiturate overdose euthanasia. Within the hippocampus, the initial stage entailed a quasi-stationary LFP state with a power-law feature in the power spectral density. In the second stage, there was a successive erosion of power from high- to low-frequencies in the second stage that continued until the only dominant remaining power was &lt;20 Hz. This stage was followed by a rapid collapse of power spectrum toward the absolute electrothermal noise background. As the collapse of activity occurred later in hippocampus compared with medial entorhinal cortex, it suggests that the ability of a neural network to maintain the 1/f slope with decreasing energy is a function of general connectivity. Broadly, these data support the energy cascade theory where there is a cascade of energy from large cortical populations into smaller loops, such as those that supports the higher frequency gamma rhythm. As energy is pulled from the system, neural entrainment at gamma frequency (and higher) decline first. The larger loops, comprising a larger population, are fault-tolerant to a point capable of maintaining their activity before a final collapse.</p>

Objective<p>Motor evoked potentials (MEP), obtained by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are a common tool in clinical research and diagnostic. Nevertheless, reports regarding the influence of filter settings on MEP are sparse. Here, we compared MEP amplitudes and signal to noise ratio (SNR) using multiple high pass filter (HPF) and notch filter settings.</p>Materials and Methods<p>Twenty healthy subjects were enrolled in the study. Recruitment curves were obtained with HPF settings varied at 10, 20, 50, and 100 Hz. The four HPF settings were tested both with and without 50 Hz active notch filter. Low pass filter was kept constant at 5 kHz.</p>Results<p>MEP amplitudes with HPF at 10 and 20 Hz were significantly higher than at 100 Hz, regardless of the notch filter. However, SNR did not differ among HPF settings. An active notch filter significantly improved SNR.</p>Conclusion<p>The reduction in MEP amplitudes with HPF above 20 Hz may be due to noise reduction, since the different HPF conditions did not alter SNR. Thus, higher HPF above 50 Hz may be an option to reduce noise, the use of a notch filter may even improve SNR.</p>Significance<p>Our findings are relevant for the selection of filter settings and might be of importance to any researcher who utilizes TMS-MEP.</p>

<p>Peak alpha frequency is known to vary not just between individuals, but also within an individual over time. While variance in this metric between individuals has been tied to working memory performance, less understood are how short timescale modulations of peak alpha frequency during task performance may facilitate behavior. This gap in understanding may be bridged by consideration of a key difference between individuals: sex. Inconsistent findings in the literature regarding the relationship between peak alpha frequency and cognitive performance, as well as known sex-related-differences in peak alpha frequency and its modulation motivated our hypothesis that cognitive and neural processes underlying working memory—modulation of peak alpha frequency in particular—may differ based upon sex. Targeting sex as a predictive factor, we analyzed the EEG data of participants recorded while they performed four versions of a visual spatial working memory task. A significant difference between groups was present: females modulated peak alpha frequency more than males. Task performance did not differ by sex, yet a relationship between accuracy and peak alpha frequency was present in males, but not in females. These findings highlight the importance of considering sex as a factor in the study of oscillatory activity, particularly to further understanding of the neural mechanisms that underlie working memory.</p>

<p>Previous research has demonstrated that regular exercise modulates motor cortical plasticity and cognitive function, but the influence of short-term high-intensity interval training (HIIT) remains unclear. In the present study, the effect of short-term HIIT on neuroplasticity and executive function was assessed in 32 sedentary females. Half of the participants undertook 2 weeks of HIIT. Paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (ppTMS) was used to measure motor cortical plasticity via short intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF). We further adapted the Stroop task using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to evaluate executive function in the participants. The results indicated that, compared with the control group, the HIIT group exhibited decreased ICF. In the Stroop task, the HIIT group displayed greater activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) even though no significant difference in task performance was observed. These findings indicate that short-term HIIT may modulate motor cortical plasticity and executive function at the neural level.</p>

<p>In recent years, the scientific and therapeutic fields for rare, genetic central nervous system (CNS) diseases such as leukodystrophies, or white matter disorders, have expanded significantly in part due to technological advancements in cellular and clinical screenings as well as remedial therapies using novel techniques such as gene therapy. However, treatments aimed at normalizing the pathological changes associated with leukodystrophies have especially been complicated due to the innate and variable effects of glial abnormalities, which can cause large-scale functional deficits in developmental myelination and thus lead to downstream neuronal impairment. Emerging research in the past two decades have depicted glial cells, particularly oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, as key, regulatory modulators in constructing and maintaining myelin function and neuronal viability. Given the significance of myelin formation in the developing brain, myelin repair in a time-dependent fashion is critical in restoring homeostatic functionality to the CNS of patients diagnosed with white matter disorders. Using Canavan Disease (CD) as a leukodystrophy model, here we review the hypothetical roles of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), one of the brain's most abundant amino acid derivatives, in Canavan disease's CNS myelinating pathology, as well as discuss the possible functions astrocytes serve in both CD and other leukodystrophies' time-sensitive disease correction. Through this analysis, we also highlight the potential remyelinating benefits of gene therapy for other leukodystrophies in which alternative CNS cell targeting for white matter disorders may be an applicable path for reparative treatment.</p>

<p>Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), were once considered quiescent cells that sat in readiness for reacting to disease and injury. Over the last decade, however, it has become clear that microglia play essential roles in maintaining the normal nervous system. The retina is an easily accessible part of the central nervous system and therefore much has been learned about the function of microglia from studies in the retina and visual system. Anatomically, microglia have processes that contact all synapses within the retina, as well as blood vessels in the major vascular plexuses. Microglia contribute to development of the visual system by contributing to neurogenesis, maturation of cone photoreceptors, as well as refining synaptic contacts. They can respond to neural signals and in turn release a range of cytokines and neurotrophic factors that have downstream consequences on neural function. Moreover, in light of their extensive contact with blood vessels, they are also essential for regulation of vascular development and integrity. This review article summarizes what we have learned about the role of microglia in maintaining the normal visual system and how this has helped in understanding their role in the central nervous system more broadly.</p>

<p>The uptake, transmission and processing of sensory olfactory information is modulated by inhibitory and excitatory receptors in the olfactory system. Previous studies have focused on the function of individual receptors in distinct brain areas, but the receptor architecture of the whole system remains unclear. Here, we analyzed the receptor profiles of the whole olfactory system of adult male mice. We examined the distribution patterns of glutamatergic (AMPA, kainate, mGlu<sub>2/3</sub>, and NMDA), GABAergic (GABA<sub>A</sub>, GABA<sub>A(BZ)</sub>, and GABA<sub>B</sub>), dopaminergic (D<sub>1/5</sub>) and noradrenergic (α<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>2</sub>) neurotransmitter receptors by quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography combined with an analysis of the cyto- and myelo-architecture. We observed that each subarea of the olfactory system is characterized by individual densities of distinct neurotransmitter receptor types, leading to a region- and layer-specific receptor profile. Thereby, the investigated receptors in the respective areas and strata showed a heterogeneous expression. Generally, we detected high densities of mGlu<sub>2/3</sub>Rs, GABA<sub>A(BZ)</sub>Rs and GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs. Noradrenergic receptors revealed a highly heterogenic distribution, while the dopaminergic receptor D<sub>1/5</sub> displayed low concentrations, except in the olfactory tubercle and the dorsal endopiriform nucleus. The similarities and dissimilarities of the area-specific multireceptor profiles were analyzed by a hierarchical cluster analysis. A three-cluster solution was found that divided the areas into the (1) olfactory relay stations (main and accessory olfactory bulb), (2) the olfactory cortex (anterior olfactory cortex, dorsal peduncular cortex, taenia tecta, piriform cortex, endopiriform nucleus, entorhinal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex) and the (3) olfactory tubercle, constituting its own cluster. The multimodal receptor-architectonic analysis of each component of the olfactory system provides new insights into its neurochemical organization and future possibilities for pharmaceutic targeting.</p>

<p>Cognitive impairment indicates disturbed brain physiology which can be due to various mechanisms including Alzheimer's pathology. Combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings (EEG-fMRI) can assess the interplay between complementary measures of brain activity and EEG changes to be localized to specific brain regions. We used a two-step approach, where we first examined changes related to a syndrome of mild cognitive impairment irrespective of pathology and then studied the specific impact of amyloid pathology. After detailed clinical and neuropsychological characterization as well as a positron emission tomography (PET) scans with the tracer 11-[C]-Pittsburgh Compound B to estimate cerebral amyloid deposition, 14 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (mean age 75.6 SD: 8.9) according to standard criteria and 21 cognitively healthy controls (HCS) (mean age 71.8 SD: 4.2) were assessed with EEG-fMRI. Thalamo-cortical alpha-fMRI signal coupling was only observed in HCS. Additional EEG-fMRI signal coupling differences between HCS and MCI were observed in parts of the default mode network, salience network, fronto-parietal network, and thalamus. Individuals with significant cerebral amyloid deposition (amyloid-positive MCI and HCS combined compared to amyloid-negative HCS) displayed abnormal EEG-fMRI signal coupling in visual, fronto-parietal regions but also in the parahippocampus, brain stem, and cerebellum. This finding was paralleled by stronger absolute fMRI signal in the parahippocampus and weaker absolute fMRI signal in the inferior frontal gyrus in amyloid-positive subjects. We conclude that the thalamocortical coupling in the alpha band in HCS more closely reflects previous findings observed in younger adults, while in MCI there is a clearly aberrant coupling in several networks dominated by an anticorrelation in the posterior cingulate cortex. While these findings may broadly indicate physiological changes in MCI, amyloid pathology was specifically associated with abnormal fMRI signal responses and disrupted coupling between brain oscillations and fMRI signal responses, which especially involve core regions of memory: the hippocampus, para-hippocampus, and lateral prefrontal cortex.</p>

Objective
Migraine is three times more common in women. CGRP plays a critical role in migraine pathology and causes female‐specific behavioral responses upon meningeal application. These effects are likely mediated through interactions of CGRP with signaling systems specific to females. Prolactin (PRL) levels have been correlated with migraine attacks. Here, we explore a potential interaction between CGRP and PRL in the meninges.


Methods
Prolactin, CGRP, and receptor antagonists CGRP8‐37 or Δ1‐9‐G129R‐hPRL were administered onto the dura of rodents followed by behavioral testing. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine PRL, CGRP and Prolactin receptor (Prlr) expression within the dura. Electrophysiology on cultured and back‐labeled trigeminal ganglia (TG) neurons was used to assess PRL‐induced excitability. Finally, the effects of PRL on evoked CGRP release from ex vivo dura were measured.


Results
We found that dural PRL produced sustained and long‐lasting migraine‐like behavior in cycling and ovariectomized female, but not male rodents. Prlr was expressed on dural afferent nerves in females with little‐to‐no presence in males. Consistent with this, PRL increased excitability only in female TG neurons innervating the dura and selectively sensitized CGRP release from female ex vivo dura. We demonstrate crosstalk between PRL and CGRP systems as CGRP8‐37 decreases migraine‐like responses to dural PRL. Reciprocally, Δ1‐9‐G129R‐hPRL attenuates dural CGRP‐induced migraine behaviors. Similarly, Prlr deletion from sensory neurons significantly reduced migraine‐like responses to dural CGRP.


Interpretation
This CGRP‐PRL interaction in the meninges is a mechanism by which these peptides could produce female‐selective responses and increase the prevalence of migraine in women. ANN NEUROL 2021

<p>by Yao Li, Lai-Sang Young</p>

This paper uses mathematical modeling to study the mechanisms of surround suppression in the primate visual cortex. We present a large-scale neural circuit alistic modeling work are used. The remaining parameters are chosen to produce model outputs that emulate experimentally observed size-tuning curves. Our two main results are: (i) we discovered the character of the long-range connections in Layer 6 responsible for surround effects in the input layers; and (ii) we showed that a net-inhibitory feedback, i.e., feedback that excites I-cells more than E-cells, from Layer 6 to Layer 4 is conducive to producing surround properties consistent with experimental data. These results are obtained through parameter selection and model analysis. The effects of nonlinear recurrent excitation and inhibition are also discussed. A feature that distinguishes our model from previous modeling work on surround suppression is that we have tried to reproduce realistic lengthscales that are crucial for quantitative comparison with data. Due to its size and the large number of unknown parameters, the model is computationally challenging. We demonstrate a strategy that involves first locating baseline values for relevant parameters using a linear model, followed by the introduction of nonlinearities where needed. We find such a methodology effective, and propose it as a possibility in the modeling of complex biological systems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bNCVOTWspsI" width="1" />

The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is essential for organ development, homeostasis, and regeneration. Dysfunction of this cascade drives several cancers. To control expression of pathway target genes, the G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) Smoothened (SMO) activates glioma-associated (GLI) transcription factors via an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that, rather than conforming to traditional GPCR signaling paradigms, SMO activates GLI by binding and sequestering protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunits at the membrane. This sequestration, triggered by GPCR kinase (GRK)-mediated phosphorylation of SMO intracellular domains, prevents PKA from phosphorylating soluble substrates, releasing GLI from PKA-mediated inhibition. Our work provides a mechanism directly linking Hh signal transduction at the membrane to GLI transcription in the nucleus. This process is more fundamentally similar between species than prevailing hypotheses suggest. The mechanism described here may apply broadly to other GPCR- and PKA-containing cascades in diverse areas of biology.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/kDoJwyIWoQQ" width="1" />

<p>This work studies the evolution of cortical networks during the transition from escape strategy to avoidance strategy in auditory discrimination learning in Mongolian gerbils trained by the well-established two-way active avoidance learning paradigm. The animals were implanted with electrode arrays centered on the surface of the primary auditory cortex and electrocorticogram (ECoG) recordings were made during performance of an auditory Go/NoGo discrimination task. Our experiments confirm previous results on a sudden behavioral change from the initial naïve state to an avoidance strategy as learning progresses. We employed two causality metrics using Granger Causality (GC) and New Causality (NC) to quantify changes in the causality flow between ECoG channels as the animals switched to avoidance strategy. We found that the number of channel pairs with inverse causal interaction significantly increased after the animal acquired successful discrimination, which indicates structural changes in the cortical networks as a result of learning. A suitable graph-theoretical model is developed to interpret the findings in terms of cortical networks evolving during cognitive state transitions. Structural changes lead to changes in the dynamics of neural populations, which are described as phase transitions in the network graph model with small-world connections. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of functional reorganization in sensory cortical areas as a possible neural contributor to behavioral changes.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an extrapyramidal disorder characterized by neuronal degeneration in several regions of the peripheral and central nervous systems. It is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s. It has become a major health problem, affecting 1% of the world population over 60 years old and 3% of people beyond 80 years. The main histological findings are intracellular Lewy bodies composed of misfolded α-synuclein protein aggregates and loss of dopaminergic neurons in the central nervous system. Neuroinflammation, apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, altered calcium homeostasis, abnormal protein degradation, and synaptic pathobiology have been put forward as mechanisms leading to cell death, α-synuclein deposition, or both. A progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra late in the neurodegeneration leads to developing motor symptoms like bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity. The renin–angiotensin system (RAS), which is involved in regulating blood pressure and body fluid balance, also plays other important functions in the brain. The RAS is involved in the autocrine and paracrine regulation of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic synapses. Dopamine depletion, as in PD, increases angiotensin II expression, which stimulates or inhibits dopamine synthesis and is released via AT1 or AT2 receptors. Furthermore, angiotensin II AT1 receptors inhibit D1 receptor activation allosterically. Therefore, the RAS may have an important modulating role in the flow of information from the brain cortex to the basal ganglia. High angiotensin II levels might even aggravate neurodegeneration, activating the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex, which leads to increased reactive oxygen species production.</p>

<p>Stress is a biologically relevant signal and can modulate hippocampal synaptic plasticity. The subiculum is the major output station of the hippocampus and serves as a critical hub in the stress response network. However, stress-associated synaptic plasticity in the ventral subiculum has not been adequately addressed. Therefore, we investigated the impact of a single exposure to an inherently stressful two-way active avoidance conditioning on the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA1—subiculum synapses in ventral hippocampal slices from young adult rats 1 day after stressor exposure. We found that acute stress enhanced LTP and lowered the induction threshold for a late-onset LTP at excitatory CA1 to subicular burst-spiking neuron synapses. This late-onset LTP was dependent on the activation of β-adrenergic and glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and independent of D1/D5 dopamine receptor activation. Thereby, we present a cellular mechanism that might contribute to behavioral stress adaptation after acute stressor exposure.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has generated a large number of publications in the medical and biological fields concerning the virus and its treatments, as well as in psychology, social sciences, and data sciences with regard to the spread of the virus. Surprisingly, far fewer neuroscientific articles have been published in this field of research and one might well ask whether the cognitive neurosciences have anything to say at all about this vital topic. In this article, we highlight a research perspective relating to differences in the individual perception of the pandemic in Western compared to Eastern countries. Although this problem is complex, multifaceted and subsumes many other social variables, we suggest that the cognitive neurosciences do have important and fundamental insights to contribute concerning the collective response observed within these populations. More precisely, we propose the hypothesis that differences in the propensity to adopt a holistic perception of contamination processes at the group level, involving brain structures that are also associated with perspective-taking and empathy such as, in particular, the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), could help explain the differences in the perception of the pandemic observed between Western and Eastern countries.</p>

<p>The pathogenesis of peritumoral brain edema (PTBE) in meningiomas remains unclear. The glymphatic system is recently recognized as a pathway for waste clearance and maintaining fluid balance in the brain parenchymal interstitium. We aimed to investigate if the PTBE volume of meningiomas correlates with their glymphatic function. A total of 80 meningioma patients (mean age, 58.8 years; 37 men) and 44 normal subjects (mean age 53.3 years; 23 men) who had preoperative diffusion-tensor imaging for calculation of the analysis along the perivascular space (ALPS) index were retrospectively included. Information collected from each patient included sex, age, tumor grade, Ki-67 index, tumor location, tumor volume, PTBE volume and ALPS index. Comparisons of ALPS index among meningiomas without PTBE, meningiomas with PTBE, and normal subjects were performed using analysis of covariance with Bonferroni correction and adjustments for age and sex. Pearson correlation coefficient and multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with PTBE volume. Group comparisons revealed that the ALPS index was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) in meningiomas without PTBE vs. meningiomas with PTBE and normal subjects. On the other hand, ALPS index was not different between meningiomas with PTBE and normal subjects. On Pearson correlation and multivariable linear regression analyses, the ALPS index was the only factor significantly (P &lt; 0.05) associated with PTBE volume. In conclusion, PTBE volume inversely correlated with ALPS index in meningiomas. PTBE formation in meningiomas may be related to glymphatic dysfunction.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD), caused by destruction of dopaminergic neurons in the brain, leads to motor symptoms like bradykinesia, tremor, and walking impairments. While most research effort focuses on changes in neuronal pathology we examined how muscle proteins were altered in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. A Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channel complex, consisting of ryanodine receptors (RYR), triadin (TRDN), and calsequestrin (CSQ1), is important for excitation-contraction coupling in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane in muscles. Thus, we investigated changes in the RYR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channel components in PD mice model. Based on a report that TRDN deletion impairs skeletal muscle function, we also investigated how the knock-down of TRDN affects other components of the RYR channel in the PD model. In this study, the expression levels of the components of RYR channels decreased in the quadriceps femoris muscle of MPTP-induced PD mice and in C2C12 cells treated with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium. We show that decreased TRDN levels decrease RYR and CSQ1 levels. These results suggest that the levels of proteins related to Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel function decreased in this model, which could impair muscle function. We conclude that muscle function alterations could add to the bradykinesia and tremor in this model of PD.</p>

<p>Rapid cost drops and advancements in next-generation sequencing have made profiling of cells at individual level a conventional practice in scientific laboratories worldwide. Single-cell transcriptomics [single-cell RNA sequencing (SC-RNA-seq)] has an immense potential of uncovering the novel basis of human life. The well-known heterogeneity of cells at the individual level can be better studied by single-cell transcriptomics. Proper downstream analysis of this data will provide new insights into the scientific communities. However, due to low starting materials, the SC-RNA-seq data face various computational challenges: normalization, differential gene expression analysis, dimensionality reduction, etc. Additionally, new methods like 10× Chromium can profile millions of cells in parallel, which creates a considerable amount of data. Thus, single-cell data handling is another big challenge. This paper reviews the single-cell sequencing methods, library preparation, and data generation. We highlight some of the main computational challenges that require to be addressed by introducing new bioinformatics algorithms and tools for analysis. We also show single-cell transcriptomics data as a big data problem.</p>

<p>More than half of the Top 10 supercomputing sites worldwide use GPU accelerators and they are becoming ubiquitous in workstations and edge computing devices. GeNN is a C++ library for generating efficient spiking neural network simulation code for GPUs. However, until now, the full flexibility of GeNN could only be harnessed by writing model descriptions and simulation code in C++. Here we present PyGeNN, a Python package which exposes all of GeNN's functionality to Python with minimal overhead. This provides an alternative, arguably more user-friendly, way of using GeNN and allows modelers to use GeNN within the growing Python-based machine learning and computational neuroscience ecosystems. In addition, we demonstrate that, in both Python and C++ GeNN simulations, the overheads of recording spiking data can strongly affect runtimes and show how a new spike recording system can reduce these overheads by up to 10×. Using the new recording system, we demonstrate that by using PyGeNN on a modern GPU, we can simulate a full-scale model of a cortical column faster even than real-time neuromorphic systems. Finally, we show that long simulations of a smaller model with complex stimuli and a custom three-factor learning rule defined in PyGeNN can be simulated almost two orders of magnitude faster than real-time.</p>

<p>The cerebral cortex is fundamental to the functioning of the mind and body. In vivo cortical morphology can be studied through magnetic resonance imaging in several ways, including reconstructing surface-based models of the cortex. However, existing software for surface-based statistical analyses cannot accommodate “big data” or commonly used statistical methods such as the imputation of missing data, extensive bias correction, and non-linear modeling. To address these shortcomings, we developed the QDECR package, a flexible and extensible R package for group-level statistical analysis of cortical morphology. QDECR was written with large population-based epidemiological studies in mind and was designed to fully utilize the extensive modeling options in R. QDECR currently supports vertex-wise linear regression. Design matrix generation can be done through simple, familiar R formula specification, and includes user-friendly extensions for R options such as polynomials, splines, interactions and other terms. QDECR can handle unimputed and imputed datasets with thousands of participants. QDECR has a modular design, and new statistical models can be implemented which utilize several aspects from other generic modules which comprise QDECR. In summary, QDECR provides a framework for vertex-wise surface-based analyses that enables flexible statistical modeling and features commonly used in population-based and clinical studies, which have until now been largely absent from neuroimaging research.</p>

<p>A deep investigation of proprioceptive processes is necessary to understand the relationship between sensory afferent inputs and motor outcomes. In this work, we investigate whether and how perception of wrist position is influenced by the direction along which the movement occurs. Most previous studies have tested Joint Position Sense (JPS) through 1 degree of freedom (DoF) wrist movements, such as flexion/extension (FE) or radial/ulnar deviation (RUD). However, the wrist joint has 3-DoF and many activities of daily living produce combined movements, requiring at least 2-DoF wrist coordination. For this reason, in this study, target positions involved movement directions that combined wrist flexion or extension with radial or ulnar deviation. The chosen task was a robot-aided Joint Position Matching (JPM), in which blindfolded participants actively reproduced a previously passively assumed target joint configuration. The JPM performance of 20 healthy participants was quantified through measures of accuracy and precision, in terms of both perceived target direction and distance along each direction of movement. Twelve different directions of movement were selected and both hands tested. The left and right hand led to comparable results, both target extents and directions were differently perceived according to the target direction on the FE/RUD space. Moreover, during 2-DoF combined movements, subjects’ perception of directions was impaired when compared to 1-DoF target movements. In summary, our results showed that human perception of wrist position on the FE/RUD space is symmetric between hands but not isotropic among movement directions.</p>

<p>Starting from the early 2000s, paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocols have been used in humans to study brain connectivity in motor and sensory networks by exploiting the intrinsic properties of timing-dependent cortical plasticity. In the last 10 years, PAS have also been developed to investigate the plastic properties of complex cerebral systems, such as the frontal ones, with promising results. In the present work, we review the most recent advances of this technique, focusing on protocols targeting frontal cortices to investigate connectivity and its plastic properties, subtending high-order cognitive functions like memory, decision-making, attentional, or emotional processing. Overall, current evidence reveals that PAS can be effectively used to assess, enhance or depress physiological connectivity within frontal networks in a timing-dependent way, in turn modulating cognitive processing in healthy and pathological conditions.</p>

<p>As a special occupational group, the working and living environments faced by seafarers are greatly different from those of land. It is easy to affect the psychological and physiological activities of seafarers, which inevitably lead to changes in the brain functional activities of seafarers. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the neural activity rules of seafarers’ brain. In view of this, this paper studied the seafarers’ brain alteration at the activated voxel level based on functional magnetic resonance imaging technology by comparing the differences in functional connectivities (FCs) between seafarers and non-seafarers. Firstly, the activated voxels of each group were obtained by independence component analysis, and then the distribution of these voxels in the brain and the common activated voxels between the two groups were statistically analyzed. Next, the FCs between the common activated voxels of the two groups were calculated and obtained the FCs that had significant differences between them through two-sample T-test. Finally, all FCs and FCs with significant differences (DFCs) between the common activated voxels were used as the features for the support vector machine to classify seafarers and non-seafarers. The results showed that DFCs between the activated voxels had better recognition ability for seafarers, especially for Precuneus_L and Precuneus_R, which may play an important role in the classification prediction of seafarers and non-seafarers, so that provided a new perspective for studying the specificity of neurological activities of seafarers.</p>

<p>As automobile manufacturers have begun to design, engineer, and test autonomous driving systems of the future, brain imaging with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can provide unique insights about cognitive processes associated with evolving levels of autonomy implemented in the automobile. Modern fNIRS devices provide a portable, relatively affordable, and robust form of functional neuroimaging that allows researchers to investigate brain function in real-world environments. The trend toward “naturalistic neuroscience” is evident in the growing number of studies that leverage the methodological flexibility of fNIRS, and in doing so, significantly expand the scope of cognitive function that is accessible to observation via functional brain imaging (i.e., from the simulator to on-road scenarios). While more than a decade’s worth of study in this field of fNIRS driving research has led to many interesting findings, the number of studies applying fNIRS during autonomous modes of operation is limited. To support future research that directly addresses this lack in autonomous driving research with fNIRS, we argue that a cogent distillation of the methods used to date will help facilitate and streamline this research of tomorrow. To that end, here we provide a methodological review of the existing fNIRS driving research, with the overarching goal of highlighting the current diversity in methodological approaches. We argue that standardization of these approaches will facilitate greater overlap of methods by researchers from all disciplines, which will, in-turn, allow for meta-analysis of future results. We conclude by providing recommendations for advancing the use of such fNIRS technology in furthering understanding the adoption of safe autonomous vehicle technology.</p>

<p>Humans possess the ability to extract highly organized perceptual structures from sequences of temporal stimuli. For instance, we can organize specific rhythmical patterns into hierarchical, or metrical, systems. Despite the evidence of a fundamental influence of the motor system in achieving this skill, few studies have attempted to investigate the organization of our motor representation of rhythm. To this aim, we studied—in musicians and non-musicians—the ability to perceive and reproduce different rhythms. In a first experiment participants performed a temporal order-judgment task, for rhythmical sequences presented via auditory or tactile modality. In a second experiment, they were asked to reproduce the same rhythmic sequences, while their tapping force and timing were recorded. We demonstrate that tapping force encodes the metrical aspect of the rhythm, and the strength of the coding correlates with the individual’s perceptual accuracy. We suggest that the similarity between perception and tapping-force organization indicates a common representation of rhythm, shared between the perceptual and motor systems.</p>

<p>In the present study, we examine the interactive effect of vowels on Mandarin fricative sibilants using a passive oddball paradigm to determine whether the HEIGHT features of vowels can spread on the surface and influence preceding consonants with unspecified features. The stimuli are two pairs of Mandarin words ([sa] ∼ [ʂa] and [su] ∼ [ʂu]) contrasting in vowel HEIGHT ([LOW] vs. [HIGH]). Each word in the same pair was presented both as standard and deviant, resulting in four conditions (/standard/<sub>[deviant]</sub>: /sa/<sub>[ʂa]</sub> ∼ /ʂa/<sub>[sa]</sub> and /su/<sub>[ʂu]</sub> ∼ /ʂu/<sub>[su]</sub>). In line with the Featurally Underspecified Lexicon (FUL) model, asymmetric patterns of processing were found in the [su] ∼ [ʂu] word pair where both the MMN (mismatch negativity) and LDN (late discriminative negativity) components were more negative in /su/<sub>[ʂu]</sub> (mismatch) than in /ʂu/<sub>[su]</sub> (no mismatch), suggesting the spreading of the feature [HIGH] from the vowel [u] to [ʂ] on the surface. In the [sa] ∼ [ʂa] pair, however, symmetric negativities (for both MMN and LDN) were observed as there is no conflict between the surface feature [LOW] from [a] to [ʂ] and the underlying specified feature [LOW] of [s]. These results confirm that not all features are fully specified in the mental lexicon: features of vowels can spread on the surface and influence surrounding unspecified segments.</p>

<p>Humans and some animal species are able to learn stimulus-response (S-R) associations by observing others' behavior. It saves energy and time and avoids the danger of trying the wrong actions. Observational learning (OL) depends on the capability of mapping the actions of others into our own behaviors, processing outcomes, and combining this knowledge to serve our goals. Observational learning plays a central role in the learning of social skills, cultural knowledge, and tool use. Thus, it is one of the fundamental processes in which infants learn about and from adults (Byrne and Russon, 1998). In this paper, we review current methodological approaches employed in observational learning research. We highlight the important role of the prefrontal cortex and cognitive flexibility to support this learning process, develop a new neural working model of observational learning, illustrate how imitation relates to observational learning, and provide directions for future research.</p>

<p>One of the most fundamental questions in the field of neuroscience is the emergence of synchronous behaviour in the brain, such as phase, anti-phase, and shift-phase synchronisation. In this work, we investigate how the connectivity between brain areas can influence the phase angle and the neuronal synchronisation. To do this, we consider brain areas connected by means of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, in which the neuron dynamics is given by the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model. Our simulations suggest that excitatory and inhibitory connections from one area to another play a crucial role in the emergence of these types of synchronisation. Thus, in the case of unidirectional interaction, we observe that the phase angles of the neurons in the receiver area depend on the excitatory and inhibitory synapses which arrive from the sender area. Moreover, when the neurons in the sender area are synchronised, the phase angle variability of the receiver area can be reduced for some conductance values between the areas. For bidirectional interactions, we find that phase and anti-phase synchronisation can emerge due to excitatory and inhibitory connections. We also verify, for a strong inhibitory-to-excitatory interaction, the existence of silent neuronal activities, namely a large number of excitatory neurons that remain in silence for a long time.</p>

<p>In this paper we present a Competitive Rate-Based Algorithm (CRBA) that approximates operation of a Competitive Spiking Neural Network (CSNN). CRBA is based on modeling of the competition between neurons during a sample presentation, which can be reduced to ranking of the neurons based on a dot product operation and the use of a discrete Expectation Maximization algorithm; the latter is equivalent to the spike time-dependent plasticity rule. CRBA's performance is compared with that of CSNN on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. The results show that CRBA performs on par with CSNN, while using three orders of magnitude less computational time. Importantly, we show that the weights and firing thresholds learned by CRBA can be used to initialize CSNN's parameters that results in its much more efficient operation.</p>

<p>Synapses in the cerebral cortex constantly change and this dynamic property regulated by the action of neuromodulators such as dopamine (DA), is essential for reward learning and memory. DA modulates spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), a cellular model of learning and memory, in juvenile rodent cortical neurons. However, it is unknown whether this neuromodulation also occurs at excitatory synapses of cortical neurons in mature adult mice or in humans. Cortical layer V pyramidal neurons were recorded with whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology and an extracellular stimulating electrode was used to induce STDP. DA was either bath-applied or optogenetically released in slices from mice. Classical STDP induction protocols triggered non-hebbian excitatory synaptic depression in the mouse or no plasticity at human cortical synapses. DA reverted long term synaptic depression to baseline in mouse via dopamine 2 type receptors or elicited long term synaptic potentiation in human cortical synapses. Furthermore, when DA was applied during an STDP protocol it depressed presynaptic inhibition in the mouse but not in the human cortex. Thus, DA modulates excitatory synaptic plasticity differently in human vs. mouse cortex. The data strengthens the importance of DA in gating cognition in humans, and may inform on therapeutic interventions to recover brain function from diseases.</p>

<p>Neutrophils are short-lived cells of the innate immune system and the first line of defense at the site of an infection and tissue injury. Pattern recognition receptors on neutrophils recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns or danger-associated molecular patterns, which recruit them to the destined site. Neutrophils are professional phagocytes with efficient granular constituents that aid in the neutralization of pathogens. In addition to phagocytosis and degranulation, neutrophils are proficient in creating neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that immobilize pathogens to prevent their spread. Because of the cytotoxicity of the associated granular proteins within NETs, the microbes can be directly killed once immobilized by the NETs. The role of neutrophils in infection is well studied; however, there is less emphasis placed on the role of neutrophils in tissue injury, such as traumatic spinal cord injury. Upon the initial mechanical injury, the innate immune system is activated in response to the molecules produced by the resident cells of the injured spinal cord initiating the inflammatory cascade. This review provides an overview of the essential role of neutrophils and explores the contribution of neutrophils to the pathologic changes in the injured spinal cord.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.660843">Mitochondrial CHCHD2: Disease-Associated Mutations, Physiological Functions, and Current Animal Models</a></h4>

<p>Rare mutations in the mitochondrial protein coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 2 (CHCHD2) are associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and other Lewy body disorders. CHCHD2 is a bi-organellar mediator of oxidative phosphorylation, playing crucial roles in regulating electron flow in the mitochondrial electron transport chain and acting as a nuclear transcription factor for a cytochrome c oxidase subunit (COX4I2) and itself in response to hypoxic stress. CHCHD2 also regulates cell migration and differentiation, mitochondrial cristae structure, and apoptosis. In this review, we summarize the known disease-associated mutations of CHCHD2 in Asian and Caucasian populations, the physiological functions of CHCHD2, how CHCHD2 mutations contribute to α-synuclein pathology, and current animal models of CHCHD2. Further, we discuss the necessity of continued investigation into the divergent functions of CHCHD2 and CHCHD10 to determine how mutations in these similar mitochondrial proteins contribute to different neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.649646">Intranasal Delivery of Collagen-Loaded Neprilysin Clears Beta-Amyloid Plaques in a Transgenic Alzheimer Mouse Model</a></h4>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is pathologically characterized by extracellular beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and intraneuronal tau tangles in the brain. A therapeutic strategy aims to prevent or clear these Aβ plaques and the Aβ-degrading enzyme neprilysin is a potent drug to degrade plaques. The major challenge is to deliver bioactive neprilysin into the brain via the blood-brain barrier. The aim of the present study is to explore if intranasal delivery of neprilysin can eliminate plaques in a transgenic AD mouse model (APP_SweDI). We will test if collagen or platelets are useful vehicles to deliver neprilysin into the brain. Using organotypic brain slices from adult transgenic APP_SweDI mice, we show that neprilysin alone or loaded in collagen hydrogels or in platelets cleared cortical plaques. Intransasal delivery of neprilysin alone increased small Aβ depositions in the middle and caudal cortex in transgenic mice. Platelets loaded with neprilysin cleared plaques in the frontal cortex after intranasal application. Intranasal delivery of collagen-loaded neprilysin was very potent to clear plaques especially in the middle and caudal parts of the cortex. Our data support that the Aβ degrading enzyme neprilysin delivered to the mouse brain can clear Aβ plaques and intranasal delivery (especially with collagen as a vehicle) is a fast and easy application. However, it must be considered that intranasal neprilysin may also activate more plaque production in the transgenic mouse brain as a side effect.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26089?af=R">Alpha‐Synuclein Oligomers and Neurofilament Light Chain Predict Phenoconversion of Pure Autonomic Failure</a></h4>

Objective
To explore the role of alpha‐synuclein (αSyn) oligomers and neurofilament light chain (NfL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with pure autonomic failure (PAF) as markers of future phenoconversion to multiple system atrophy (MSA).


Methods
Well‐characterized patients with PAF (n=32) were enrolled between June 2016 and February 2019 at Mayo Clinic Rochester and followed prospectively with annual visits to determine future phenoconversion to MSA, Parkinson's disease (PD), or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). ELISA was utilized to measure NfL and protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) to detect αSyn oligomers in CSF collected at baseline.


Results
Patients were followed for a median of 3.9 years. 5 patients converted to MSA, 2 to PD, and 2 to DLB. NfL at baseline was elevated only in patients who later developed MSA, perfectly separating those from future PD and DLB converters as well as non‐converters. ASyn‐PMCA was positive in all but 2 cases (94%). The PMCA reaction was markedly different in 5 samples with maximum fluorescence and reaction kinetics previously described in MSA patients; all of these patients later developed MSA.


Interpretation
αSyn‐PMCA is almost invariably positive in the CSF of patients with PAF establishing this condition as α‐synucleinopathy. Both NfL and the magnitude and reaction kinetics of αSyn PMCA faithfully predict which PAF patients will eventually phenoconvert to MSA. This finding has important implications not only for prognostication, but also for future trials of disease modifying therapies, allowing for differentiation of MSA from Lewy body synucleinopathies before motor symptoms develop.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/d_fuvUtzhhI/article">Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccination strategies with a delayed second dose</a></h4>

Two of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines currently approved in the United States require 2 doses, administered 3 to 4 weeks apart. Constraints in vaccine supply and distribution capacity, together with a deadly wave of COVID-19 from November 2020 to January 2021 and the emergence of highly contagious Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants, sparked a policy debate on whether to vaccinate more individuals with the first dose of available vaccines and delay the second dose or to continue with the recommended 2-dose series as tested in clinical trials. We developed an agent-based model of COVID-19 transmission to compare the impact of these 2 vaccination strategies, while varying the temporal waning of vaccine efficacy following the first dose and the level of preexisting immunity in the population. Our results show that for Moderna vaccines, a delay of at least 9 weeks could maximize vaccination program effectiveness and avert at least an additional 17.3 (95% credible interval [CrI]: 7.8–29.7) infections, 0.69 (95% CrI: 0.52–0.97) hospitalizations, and 0.34 (95% CrI: 0.25–0.44) deaths per 10,000 population compared to the recommended 4-week interval between the 2 doses. Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines also averted an additional 0.60 (95% CrI: 0.37–0.89) hospitalizations and 0.32 (95% CrI: 0.23–0.45) deaths per 10,000 population in a 9-week delayed second dose (DSD) strategy compared to the 3-week recommended schedule between doses. However, there was no clear advantage of delaying the second dose with Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines in reducing infections, unless the efficacy of the first dose did not wane over time. Our findings underscore the importance of quantifying the characteristics and durability of vaccine-induced protection after the first dose in order to determine the optimal time interval between the 2 doses.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/d_fuvUtzhhI" width="1" />

Abstract
Neurodegenerative movement disorders, such as Huntington's disease (HD), share a progressive and relentless course with increasing motor disability, linked with neuropsychiatric impairment. These diseases exhibit diverse pathophysiological processes and are a topic of intense experimental and clinical research due to the lack of therapeutic options. Restorative therapies are promising approaches with the potential to restore brain circuits. However, there were less compelling results in the few clinical trials. In this review, we discuss cell replacement therapies applied to animal models and HD patients. We thoroughly describe the initial trials using fetal neural tissue transplantation and recent approaches based on alternative cell sources tested in several animal models. Stem cells were shown to generate the desired neuron phenotype and/or provide growth factors to the degenerating host cells. Besides, genetic approaches such as RNA interference and the CRISPR/Cas9 system have been studied in animal models and human‐derived cells. New genetic manipulations have revealed the capability to control or counteract the effect of human gene mutations as described by the use of antisense oligonucleotides in a clinical trial. In HD, innovative strategies are at forefront of human testing and thus other brain genetic diseases may follow similar therapeutic strategies.

We have developed a method for the longitudinal intravital observation of changes in peripheral nerve fibers. This method provides a high‐resolution approach for investigating epidermal and dermal nerve terminals as well as nerve plexuses and were extremely stable for at least 28 days. Using the SNI model, we found that the degeneration of the peripheral nerve terminals and plexuses over 2–3 days was aligned closely with the initiation of mechanical hypersensitivity. In addition, we obtained clear images of sprouting in the lateral part of the paw, which may be related to the maintenance of neuropathic pain symptoms.







Abstract
Neuropathic pain is pain caused by damage to the somatosensory nervous system. Both degenerating injured nerves and neighboring sprouting nerves can contribute to neuropathic pain. However, the mesoscale changes in cutaneous nerve fibers over time after the loss of the parent nerve has not been investigated in detail. In this study, we followed the changes in nerve fibers longitudinally in the toe tips of mice that had undergone spared nerve injury (SNI). Nav1.8‐tdTomato, Thy1‐GFP and MrgD‐GFP mice were used to observe the small and large cutaneous nerve fibers. We found that peripheral nerve plexuses degenerated within three days of nerve injury, and free nerve endings in the epidermis degenerated within two days. The timing of degeneration paralleled the initiation of mechanical hypersensitivity. We also found that some of the Nav1.8‐positive nerve plexuses and free nerve endings in the fifth toe survived, and sprouting occurred mostly from 7–28 days. The timing of the sprouting of nerve fibers in the fifth toe paralleled the maintenance phase of mechanical hypersensitivity. Our results support the hypotheses that both injured and intact nerve fibers participate in neuropathic pain, and that, specifically, nerve degeneration is related to the initiation of evoked pain and nerve sprouting is related to the maintenance of evoked pain.

<p>A large focus of modern neuroscience has revolved around preselected brain regions of interest based on prior studies. While there are reasons to focus on brain regions implicated in prior work, the result has been a biased assessment of brain function. Thus, many brain regions that may prove crucial in a wide range of neurobiological problems, including neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders, have been neglected. Advances in neuroimaging and computational neuroscience have made it possible to make unbiased assessments of whole-brain function and identify previously overlooked regions of the brain. This review will discuss the tools that have been developed to advance neuroscience and network-based computational approaches used to further analyze the interconnectivity of the brain. Furthermore, it will survey examples of neural network approaches that assess connectivity in clinical (i.e., human) and preclinical (i.e., animal model) studies and discuss how preclinical studies of neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders can greatly benefit from the unbiased nature of whole-brain imaging and network neuroscience.</p>

<p>Neuroinflammation contributes to delayed (secondary) neurodegeneration following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) signaling may promote post-TBI neuroinflammation, thereby exacerbating secondary injury. This study investigated the pathogenic functions of TRAF6 signaling following TBI in vivo and in vitro. A rat TBI model was established by air pressure contusion while lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure was used to induce inflammatory-like responses in cultured astrocytes. Model rats were examined for cell-specific expression of TRAF6, NF-κB, phosphorylated (p)-NF-κB, MAPKs (ERK, JNK, and p38), p-MAPKs, chemokines (CCL2 and CXCL1), and chemokine receptors (CCR2 and CXCR2) by immunofluorescence, RT-qPCR, western blotting, and ELISA, for apoptosis by TUNEL staining, and spatial cognition by Morris water maze testing. These measurements were compared between TBI model rats receiving intracerebral injections of TRAF6-targeted RNAi vector (AAV9-TRAF6-RNAi), empty vector, MAPK/NF-κB inhibitors, or vehicle. Primary astrocytes were stimulated with LPS following TRAF6 siRNA or control transfection, and NF-κB, MAPKs, chemokine, and chemokine receptor expression levels evaluated by western blotting and ELISA. TRAF6 was expressed mainly in astrocytes and neurons of injured cortex, peaking 3 days post-TBI. Knockdown by AAV9-TRAF6-RNAi improved spatial learning and memory, decreased TUNEL-positive cell number in injured cortex, and downregulated expression levels of p-NF-κB, p-ERK, p-JNK, p-p38, CCL2, CCR2, CXCL1, and CXCR2 post-TBI. Inhibitors of NF-κB, ERK, JNK, and p38 significantly suppressed CCL2, CCR2, CXCL1, and CXCR2 expression following TBI. Furthermore, TRAF6-siRNA inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB, ERK, JNK, p38, CCL2, and CXCL1 upregulation in cultured astrocytes. Targeting TRAF6-MAPKs/NF-κB-chemokine signaling pathways may provide a novel therapeutic approach for reducing post-TBI neuroinflammation and concomitant secondary injury.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.532291">Occipital Horn Syndrome as a Result of Splice Site Mutations in ATP7A. No Activity of ATP7A Splice Variants Missing Exon 10 or Exon 15</a></h4>

<p>Disease-causing variants in ATP7A lead to two different phenotypes associated with copper deficiency; a lethal form called Menkes disease (MD), leading to early death, and a much milder form called occipital horn syndrome (OHS). Some investigators have proposed that an ATP7A transcript missing exon 10 leads to a partly active protein product resulting in the OHS phenotype. Here, we describe an individual with OHS, a biology professor, who survived until age 62 despite a splice site mutation, leading to skipping of exon 15. ATP7A transcripts missing exon 10, or exon 15 preserve the reading frame, but it is unknown if either of these alternative transcripts encode functional protein variants. We have investigated the molecular consequence of splice site mutations leading to skipping of exon 10 or exon 15 which have been identified in individuals with OHS, or MD. By comparing ATP7A expression in fibroblasts from three individuals with OHS (OHS-fibroblasts) to ATP7A expression in fibroblasts from two individuals with MD (MD-fibroblasts), we demonstrate that transcripts missing either exon 10 or exon 15 were present in similar amounts in OHS-fibroblasts and MD-fibroblasts. No ATP7A protein encoded from these transcripts could be detected in the OHS and MD fibroblast. These results, combined with the observation that constructs encoding ATP7A cDNA sequences missing either exon 10, or exon 15 were unable to complement the high iron requirement of the ccc2Δ yeast strain, provide evidence that neither a transcript missing exon 10 nor a transcript missing exon 15 results in functional ATP7A protein. In contrast, higher amounts of wild-type ATP7A transcript were present in the OHS-fibroblasts compared with the MD-fibroblasts. We found that the MD-fibroblasts contained between 0 and 0.5% of wild-type ATP7A transcript, whereas the OHS-fibroblasts contained between 3 and 5% wild-type transcripts compared with the control fibroblasts. In summary these results indicate that protein variants encoded by ATP7A transcripts missing either exon 10 or exon 15 are not functional and not responsible for the OHS phenotype. In contrast, expression of only 3-5% of wild-type transcript compared with the controls permits the OHS phenotype.</p>

<p>The paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) is a small but highly connected nucleus of the dorsal midline thalamus. The PVT has garnered recent attention as a context-sensitive node within the thalamocortical arousal system that modulates state-dependent motivated behaviors. Once considered related to generalized arousal responses with non-specific impacts on behavior, accumulating evidence bolsters the contemporary view that discrete midline thalamic subnuclei belong to specialized corticolimbic and corticostriatal circuits related to attention, emotions, and cognition. However, the functional connectivity patterns of the human PVT have yet to be mapped. Here, we combined high-quality, high-resolution 7T and 3T resting state MRI data from 121 young adult participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and thalamic subnuclei atlas masks to investigate resting state functional connectivity of the human PVT. The 7T results demonstrated extensive positive functional connectivity with the brainstem, midbrain, ventral and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), anterior and posterior cingulate, ventral striatum, hippocampus, and amygdala. These connections persist upon controlling for functional connectivity of the rest of the thalamus. Whole-brain contrasts provided further evidence that, compared to three nearby midline thalamic subnuclei, functional connectivity of the PVT is strong with the hippocampus, amygdala, ventral and dorsal mPFC, and middle temporal gyrus. These findings suggest that, even during rest, the human PVT is functionally coupled with many regions known to be structurally connected to rodent and non-human primate PVT. Further, cosine similarity analysis results suggested the PVT is integrated into the default mode network (DMN), an intrinsic connectivity network associated with episodic memory and self-referential thought. The current work provides a much-needed foundation for ongoing and future work examining the functional roles of the PVT in humans.</p>

<p>We derive a theoretical construct that allows for the characterisation of both scalable and scale free systems within the dynamic causal modelling (DCM) framework. We define a dynamical system to be “scalable” if the same equation of motion continues to apply as the system changes in size. As an example of such a system, we simulate planetary orbits varying in size and show that our proposed methodology can be used to recover Kepler’s third law from the timeseries. In contrast, a “scale free” system is one in which there is no characteristic length scale, meaning that images of such a system are statistically unchanged at different levels of magnification. As an example of such a system, we use calcium imaging collected in murine cortex and show that the dynamical critical exponent, as defined in renormalization group theory, can be estimated in an empirical biological setting. We find that a task-relevant region of the cortex is associated with higher dynamical critical exponents in task vs. spontaneous states and vice versa for a task-irrelevant region.</p>

<p>Working memory is closely involved in various cognitive activities, but its neural mechanism is still under exploration. The mainstream view has long been that persistent activity is the neural basis of working memory, but recent experiments have observed that activity-silent memory can also be correctly recalled. The underlying mechanism of activity-silent memory is considered to be an alternative scheme that rejects the theory of persistent activity. We propose a working memory model based on spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). Different from models based on spike-rate coding, our model adopts temporal patterns of action potentials to represent information, so it can flexibly encode new memory representation. The model can work in both persistent and silent states, i.e., it is compatible with both of these seemingly conflicting neural mechanisms. We conducted a simulation experiment, and the results are similar to the real experimental results, which suggests that our model is plausible in biology.</p>

<p>According to mechanistic theories of working memory (WM), information is retained as stimulus-dependent persistent spiking activity of cortical neural networks. Yet, how this activity is related to changes in the oscillatory profile observed during WM tasks remains a largely open issue. We explore joint effects of input gamma-band oscillations and noise on the dynamics of several firing rate models of WM. The considered models have a metastable active regime, i.e., they demonstrate long-lasting transient post-stimulus firing rate elevation. We start from a single excitatory-inhibitory circuit and demonstrate that either gamma-band or noise input could stabilize the active regime, thus supporting WM retention. We then consider a system of two circuits with excitatory intercoupling. We find that fast coupling allows for better stabilization by common noise compared to independent noise and stronger amplification of this effect by in-phase gamma inputs compared to anti-phase inputs. Finally, we consider a multi-circuit system comprised of two clusters, each containing a group of circuits receiving a common noise input and a group of circuits receiving independent noise. Each cluster is associated with its own local gamma generator, so all its circuits receive gamma-band input in the same phase. We find that gamma-band input differentially stabilizes the activity of the “common-noise” groups compared to the “independent-noise” groups. If the inter-cluster connections are fast, this effect is more pronounced when the gamma-band input is delivered to the clusters in the same phase rather than in the anti-phase. Assuming that the common noise comes from a large-scale distributed WM representation, our results demonstrate that local gamma oscillations can stabilize the activity of the corresponding parts of this representation, with stronger effect for fast long-range connections and synchronized gamma oscillations.</p>

<p>Computational models of neural circuits with varying levels of biophysical detail have been generated in pursuit of an underlying mechanism explaining the ubiquitous hippocampal theta rhythm. However, within the theta rhythm are at least two types with distinct frequencies associated with different behavioral states, an aspect that must be considered in pursuit of these mechanistic explanations. Here, using our previously developed excitatory-inhibitory network models that generate theta rhythms, we investigate the robustness of theta generation to intrinsic neuronal variability by building a database of heterogeneous excitatory cells and implementing them in our microcircuit model. We specifically investigate the impact of three key “building block” features of the excitatory cell model that underlie our model design: these cells' rheobase, their capacity for post-inhibitory rebound, and their spike-frequency adaptation. We show that theta rhythms at various frequencies can arise dependent upon the combination of these building block features, and we find that the speed of these oscillations are dependent upon the excitatory cells' response to inhibitory drive, as encapsulated by their phase response curves. Taken together, these findings support a hypothesis for theta frequency control that includes two aspects: (i) an internal mechanism that stems from the building block features of excitatory cell dynamics; (ii) an external mechanism that we describe as “inhibition-based tuning” of excitatory cell firing. We propose that these mechanisms control theta rhythm frequencies and underlie their robustness.</p>

<p>Since the discovery of the C9orf72 repeat expansion mutation as causative for chromosome 9-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in 2011, a multitude of cellular pathways have been implicated. However, evidence has also been accumulating for a key mechanism of cellular compartmentalization—phase separation. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is fundamental for the formation of membraneless organelles including stress granules, the nucleolus, Cajal bodies, nuclear speckles and the central channel of the nuclear pore. Evidence has now accumulated showing that the formation and function of these membraneless organelles is impaired by both the toxic arginine rich dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs), translated from the C9orf72 repeat RNA transcript, and the repeat RNA itself. Both the arginine rich DPRs and repeat RNA themselves undergo phase separation and disrupt the physiological phase separation of proteins involved in the formation of these liquid-like organelles. Hence abnormal phase separation may explain a number of pathological cellular phenomena associated with C9orf72-ALS/FTD. In this review article, we will discuss the principles of phase separation, phase separation of the DPRs and repeat RNA themselves and how they perturb LLPS associated with membraneless organelles and the functional consequences of this. We will then discuss how phase separation may impact the major pathological feature of C9orf72-ALS/FTD, TDP-43 proteinopathy, and how LLPS may be targeted therapeutically in disease.</p>

<p>Stroke is the leading cause of disability and mortality in the world, but the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke (IS) is not completely clear and treatments are limited. Mounting evidence indicate that neovascularization is a critical defensive reaction to hypoxia that modulates the process of long-term neurologic recovery after IS. Angiogenesis is a complex process in which the original endothelial cells in blood vessels are differentiated, proliferated, migrated, and finally remolded into new blood vessels. Many immune cells and cytokines, as well as growth factors, are directly or indirectly involved in the regulation of angiogenesis. Inflammatory cells can affect endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and activation by secreting a variety of cytokines via various inflammation-relative signaling pathways and thus participate in the process of angiogenesis. However, the mechanism of inflammation-mediated angiogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Hence, this review aimed to discuss the mechanism of inflammation-mediated angiogenesis in IS and to provide new ideas for clinical treatment of IS.</p>

<p>Accumulating evidences supported that knock-down of DHCR24 is linked to the pathological risk factors of AD, suggesting a potential role of DHCR24 in AD pathogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism link between DHCR24 and tauopathy remains unknown. Here, in order to elucidate the relationship between DHCR24 and tauopathy, we will focus on the effect of DHCR24 on the tau hyperphosphorylation at some toxic sites. In present study, we found that DHCR24 knock-down significantly lead to the hyperphosphorylation of tau sites at Thr181, Ser199, Thr231, Ser262, Ser396. Moreover, DHCR24 knock-down also increase the accumulation of p62 protein, simultaneously decreased the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I and the number of autophagosome compared to the control groups, suggesting the inhibition of autophagy activity. In contrast, DHCR24 knock-in obviously abolished the effect of DHCR24 knock-down on tau hyperphosphrylation and autophagy. In addition, to elucidate the association between DHCR24 and tauopathy, we further showed that the level of plasma membrane cholesterol, lipid raft-anchored protein caveolin-1, and concomitantly total I class PI3-K (p110α), phospho-Akt (Thr308 and Ser473) were significantly decreased, resulting in the disruption of lipid raft/caveola and inhibition of PI3-K/Akt signaling in silencing DHCR24 SH-SY5Y cells compared to control groups. At the same time, DHCR24 knock-down simultaneously decreased the level of phosphorylated GSK3β at Ser9 (inactive form) and increased the level of phosphorylated mTOR at Ser2448 (active form), leading to overactivation of GSK3β and mTOR signaling. On the contrary, DHCR24 knock-in largely increased the level of membrane cholesterol and caveolin-1, suggesting the enhancement of lipid raft/caveola. And synchronously DHCR24 knock-in also abolished the effect of DHCR24 knock-down on the inhibition of PI3-K/Akt signaling as well as the overactivation of GSK3β and mTOR signaling. Collectively, our data strongly supported DHCR24 knock-down lead to tau hyperphosphorylation and the inhibition of autophagy by a lipid raft-dependent PI3-K/Akt-mediated GSK3β and mTOR signaling. Taking together, our results firstly demonstrated that the decrease of plasma membrane cholesterol mediated by DHCR24 deficiency might contribute to the tauopathy in AD and other tauopathies.</p>

Brain mosaic mutations are a major cause of refractory focal epilepsies with cortical malformations such as focal cortical dysplasia, hemimegalencephaly, malformation of cortical development with oligodendroglial hyperplasia in epilepsy, and ganglioglioma. Here, we collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during epilepsy surgery to search for somatic variants in cell‐free DNA (cfDNA) using targeted droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. In 3 of 12 epileptic patients with known somatic mutations previously identified in brain tissue, we here provide evidence that brain mosaicism can be detected in the CSF‐derived cfDNA. These findings suggest future opportunities for detecting the mutant allele driving epilepsy in CSF. ANN NEUROL 2021

<p>by Eric A. Chadwick, Takaya Suzuki, Michael G. George, David A. Romero, Cristina Amon, Thomas K. Waddell, Golnaz Karoubi, Aimy Bazylak</p>

In this work, non-invasive high-spatial resolution three-dimensional (3D) X-ray micro-computed tomography (μCT) of healthy mouse lung vasculature is performed. Methodologies are presented for filtering, segmenting, and skeletonizing the collected 3D images. Novel methods for the removal of spurious branch artefacts from the skeletonized 3D image are introduced, and these novel methods involve a combination of distance transform gradients, diameter-length ratios, and the fast marching method (FMM). These new techniques of spurious branch removal result in the consistent removal of spurious branches without compromising the connectivity of the pulmonary circuit. Analysis of the filtered, skeletonized, and segmented 3D images is performed using a newly developed Vessel Network Extraction algorithm to fully characterize the morphology of the mouse pulmonary circuit. The removal of spurious branches from the skeletonized image results in an accurate representation of the pulmonary circuit with significantly less variability in vessel diameter and vessel length in each generation. The branching morphology of a full pulmonary circuit is characterized by the mean diameter per generation and number of vessels per generation. The methods presented in this paper lead to a significant improvement in the characterization of 3D vasculature imaging, allow for automatic separation of arteries and veins, and for the characterization of generations containing capillaries and intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses (IPAVA).<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/h1OQ5sc_iwg" width="1" />

<p>by Michelle Wille, Jemma L. Geoghegan, Edward C. Holmes</p>

Identifying the animal reservoirs from which zoonotic viruses will likely emerge is central to understanding the determinants of disease emergence. Accordingly, there has been an increase in studies attempting zoonotic “risk assessment.” Herein, we demonstrate that the virological data on which these analyses are conducted are incomplete, biased, and rapidly changing with ongoing virus discovery. Together, these shortcomings suggest that attempts to assess zoonotic risk using available virological data are likely to be inaccurate and largely only identify those host taxa that have been studied most extensively. We suggest that virus surveillance at the human–animal interface may be more productive.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0mmobxPO1rg" width="1" />

Objective
Investigate the gut microbiome in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) and how it relates to clinical disease.


Methods
We sequenced the microbiota from healthy controls, relapsing remitting MS (RRMS), and progressive MS patients and correlated the levels of bacteria with clinical features of disease, including EDSS, quality of life, and brain MRI lesions/atrophy. We colonized mice with MS‐derived Akkermansia and induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.


Results
Microbiota β‐diversity differed between MS patients vs. controls but did not differ between RRMS vs. progressive MS or differ based on disease modifying therapies. Disease status had the greatest effect on the microbiome β‐diversity, followed by BMI, race, and sex. In both progressive and RRMS, we found increased Clostridium bolteae, Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans and Akkermansia and decreased Blautia wexlerae, Dorea formicigenerans, and Erysipelotrichaceae CCM. Unique to progressive MS, we found elevated Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium g24 FCEY and decreased Blautia and Agathobaculum. Several Clostridium species were associated with higher EDSS and fatigue scores. Contrary to the view that elevated Akkermansia in MS has a detrimental role, we found that Akkermansia was linked to lower disability, suggesting a beneficial role. Consistent with this, we found that Akkermansia isolated from MS patients ameliorated EAE, which was linked to a reduction in RORγt+ and IL‐17 producing γδ T cells.


Interpretation
While some microbiota alterations are shared in relapsing and progressive MS, we identified unique bacteria associated with progressive MS and clinical measures of disease. Furthermore, elevated Akkermansia in MS may be a compensatory beneficial response in the MS microbiome.

Introduction<p>The present pilot study examined to what extent the COVID-19 lockdown affected the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in people with dementia and worsened their family caregivers’ distress. The associations between changes in the BPSD of relatives with dementia (RwD) and in their caregivers’ distress, and sense of social and emotional loneliness, and resilience were also investigated.</p>Materials and Methods<p>Thirty-five caregivers of RwD attending formal healthcare services before the COVID-19 lockdown volunteered for the study, and were interviewed by phone during the lockdown. Caregivers completed the NeuroPsychiatric Inventory (NPI) to assess their care recipients’ BPSD and their own distress, and two questionnaires assessing their social and emotional loneliness, and their resilience.</p>Results<p>No clear changes emerged in either the BPSD of the RwD or the caregivers’ distress during lockdown compared with before the pandemic. Caregivers reporting more frequent and severe BPSD in their RwD before the lockdown scored higher on emotional loneliness. Those reporting more frequent and severe BPSD under lockdown, especially men and those taking care of RwD with more advanced dementia, scored higher on both social and emotional loneliness. A significant negative correlation also emerged between caregivers’ resilience and changes in their level of distress due to the lockdown, with female caregivers reporting greater resilience.</p>Discussion<p>Our findings offer preliminary insight on the effects of loneliness and resilience, and on the influence of individual characteristics on the experience and consequences of informal caregiving for RwD in times of restrictions imposed by a pandemic.</p>

<p>The role of the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CNR2) is still poorly described in sensory epithelia. We found strong cnr2 expression in hair cells (HCs) of the inner ear and the lateral line (LL), a superficial sensory structure in fish. Next, we demonstrated that sensory synapses in HCs were severely perturbed in larvae lacking cnr2. Appearance and distribution of presynaptic ribbons and calcium channels (Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3) were profoundly altered in mutant animals. Clustering of membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) in post-synaptic densities (PSDs) was also heavily affected, suggesting a role for cnr2 for maintaining the sensory synapse. Furthermore, vesicular trafficking in HCs was strongly perturbed suggesting a retrograde action of the endocannabinoid system (ECs) via cnr2 that was modulating HC mechanotransduction. We found similar perturbations in retinal ribbon synapses. Finally, we showed that larval swimming behaviors after sound and light stimulations were significantly different in mutant animals. Thus, we propose that cnr2 is critical for the processing of sensory information in the developing larva.</p>

<p>Stem cell scientists have developed methods for the self-formation of artificial organs, often referred to as organoids. Organoids can be used as model systems for research in multiple biological disciplines. Yoshiki Sasai’s innovation for deriving mammalian retinal tissue from in vitro stem cells has had a large impact on the study of the biology of vision. New developments in retinal organoid technology provide avenues for in vitro models of human retinal diseases, studies of pathological mechanisms, and development of therapies for retinal degeneration, including electronic retinal implants and gene therapy. Moreover, these innovations have played key roles in establishing models for large-scale drug screening, studying the stages of retinal development, and providing a human model for personalized therapeutic approaches, like cell transplants to replace degenerated retinal cells. Here, we first discuss the importance of human retinal organoids to the biomedical sciences. Then, we review various functional features of retinal organoids that have been developed. Finally, we highlight the current limitations of retinal organoid technologies.</p>

<p>The adult mammalian brain contains distinct neurogenic niches harboring populations of neural stem cells (NSCs) with the capacity to sustain the generation of specific subtypes of neurons during the lifetime. However, their ability to produce new progeny declines with age. The microenvironment of these specialized niches provides multiple cellular and molecular signals that condition NSC behavior and potential. Among the different niche components, vasculature has gained increasing interest over the years due to its undeniable role in NSC regulation and its therapeutic potential for neurogenesis enhancement. NSCs are uniquely positioned to receive both locally secreted factors and adhesion-mediated signals derived from vascular elements. Furthermore, studies of parabiosis indicate that NSCs are also exposed to blood-borne factors, sensing and responding to the systemic circulation. Both structural and functional alterations occur in vasculature with age at the cellular level that can affect the proper extrinsic regulation of NSCs. Additionally, blood exchange experiments in heterochronic parabionts have revealed that age-associated changes in blood composition also contribute to adult neurogenesis impairment in the elderly. Although the mechanisms of vascular- or blood-derived signaling in aging are still not fully understood, a general feature of organismal aging is the accumulation of senescent cells, which act as sources of inflammatory and other detrimental signals that can negatively impact on neighboring cells. This review focuses on the interactions between vascular senescence, circulating pro-senescence factors and the decrease in NSC potential during aging. Understanding the mechanisms of NSC dynamics in the aging brain could lead to new therapeutic approaches, potentially include senolysis, to target age-dependent brain decline.</p>

Objective<p>To explore the association between lipoprotein-related phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) and the risk of Parkinson’s disease (PD).</p>Methods<p>A case-control study involving 58 hospitalized PD patients and 60 healthy controls was carried out. Serum Lp-PLA2 level was detected. According to the disease course and severity, PD patients were subdivided to analyze the clinical value of Lp-PLA2. Relationship between Lp-PLA2 and PD risk was analyzed by logistic regression. Diagnostic value of Lp-PLA2 in PD patients was investigated using receiver’s operator characteristic curves.</p>Results<p>Lp-PLA2 level was significantly higher in the PD patients compared with the controls, and was significantly and positively correlated with the Hoehn-Yahr (H&amp;Y) stage. The serum Lp-PLA2 level and H&amp;Y stage of PD patients with a longer disease course were significantly higher than those with a shorter disease course. PD patients with milder conditions had significantly lower serum Lp-PLA2 levels than patients with severe conditions. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated higher Lp-PLA2 level was an independent risk factor of PD patients. Moreover, the area under the curve for Lp-PLA2 was 0.703, which was between those of homocysteine and serum amylase A.</p>Conclusion<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that increased level of Lp-PLA2 is associated with the risk of PD. Lp-PLA2 may be used for early detection of PD, and provides an effective intervention target for clinical treatment of PD.</p>

<p>Voxel-wise group analysis is presented as a novel feature selection (FS) technique for a deep learning (DL) approach to brain imaging data classification. The method, based on a voxel-wise two-sample t-test and denoted as t-masking, is integrated into the learning procedure as a data-driven FS strategy. t-Masking has been introduced in a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the test bench of binary classification of very-mild Alzheimer’s disease vs. normal control, using a structural magnetic resonance imaging dataset of 180 subjects. To better characterize the t-masking impact on CNN classification performance, six different experimental configurations were designed. Moreover, the performances of the presented FS method were compared to those of similar machine learning (ML) models that relied on different FS approaches. Overall, our results show an enhancement of about 6% in performance when t-masking was applied. Moreover, the reported performance enhancement was higher with respect to similar FS-based ML models. In addition, evaluation of the impact of t-masking on various selection rates has been provided, serving as a useful characterization for future insights. The proposed approach is also highly generalizable to other DL architectures, neuroimaging modalities, and brain pathologies.</p>

<p>Adolescence has been linked to an enhanced tolerance of uncertainty and risky behavior and is possibly connected to an increased response toward rewards. However, previous research has produced inconsistent findings. To investigate whether these findings are due to different reward probabilities used in the experimental design, we extended a monetary incentive delay (MID) task by including three different reward probabilities. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, 25 healthy adolescents and 22 adults were studied during anticipation of rewards in the VS. Differently colored cue stimuli indicated either a monetary or verbal trial and symbolized different reward probabilities, to which the participants were blinded. Results demonstrated faster reaction times for lower reward probabilities (33%) in both age groups. Adolescents were slower through all conditions and had less activation on a neural level. Imaging results showed a three-way interaction between age group x condition x reward probability with differences in percent signal change between adolescents and adults for the high reward probabilities (66%, 88%) while adolescents demonstrated differences for the lowest (33%). Therefore, previous inconsistent findings could be due to different reward probabilities, which makes examining these crucial for a better understanding of adolescent and adult behavior.</p>

<p>Stroke continues to be a leading cause of disability. Basic neurorehabilitation research is necessary to inform the neuropathophysiology of impaired motor control, and to develop targeted interventions with potential to remediate disability post-stroke. Despite knowledge gained from basic research studies, the effectiveness of research-based interventions for reducing motor impairment has been no greater than standard of practice interventions. In this perspective, we offer suggestions for overcoming translational barriers integral to experimental design, to augment traditional protocols, and re-route the rehabilitation trajectory toward recovery and away from compensation. First, we suggest that researchers consider modifying task practice schedules to focus on key aspects of movement quality, while minimizing the appearance of compensatory behaviors. Second, we suggest that researchers supplement primary outcome measures with secondary measures that capture emerging maladaptive compensations at other segments or joints. Third, we offer suggestions about how to maximize participant engagement, self-direction, and motivation, by embedding the task into a meaningful context, a strategy more likely to enable goal-action coupling, associated with improved neuro-motor control and learning. Finally, we remind the reader that motor impairment post-stroke is a multidimensional problem that involves central and peripheral sensorimotor systems, likely influenced by chronicity of stroke. Thus, stroke chronicity should be given special consideration for both participant recruitment and subsequent data analyses. We hope that future research endeavors will consider these suggestions in the design of the next generation of intervention studies in neurorehabilitation, to improve translation of research advances to improved participation and quality of life for stroke survivors.</p>

<p>Brain structural covariance network (SCN) can delineate the brain synchronized alterations in a long-range time period. It has been used in the research of cognition or neuropsychiatric disorders. Recently, causal analysis of structural covariance network (CaSCN), winner-take-all and cortex–subcortex covariance network (WTA-CSSCN), and modulation analysis of structural covariance network (MOD-SCN) have expended the technology breadth of SCN. However, the lack of user-friendly software limited the further application of SCN for the research. In this work, we developed the graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit of brain structural covariance connectivity based on MATLAB platform. The software contained the analysis of SCN, CaSCN, MOD-SCN, and WTA-CSSCN. Also, the group comparison and result-showing modules were included in the software. Furthermore, a simple showing of demo dataset was presented in the work. We hope that the toolkit could help the researchers, especially clinical researchers, to do the brain covariance connectivity analysis in further work more easily.</p>

<p>In the nervous system synaptic input arrives chiefly on dendrites and their type and distribution have been assumed pivotal in signal integration. We have developed an immunohistochemistry (IH)-correlated electron microscopy (EM) method – the “mirror” technique – by which synaptic input to entire dendrites of neurochemically identified interneurons (INs) can be mapped due preserving high-fidelity tissue ultrastructure. Hence, this approach allows quantitative assessment of morphometric parameters of synaptic inputs along the whole length of dendrites originating from the parent soma. The method exploits the fact that adjoining sections have truncated or cut cell bodies which appear on the common surfaces in a mirror fashion. In one of the sections the histochemical marker of the GABAergic subtype, calbindin was revealed in cell bodies whereas in the other section the remaining part of the very same cell bodies were subjected to serial section EM to trace and reconstruct the synaptology of entire dendrites. Here, we provide exemplary data on the synaptic coverage of two dendrites belonging to the same calbindin-D<sub>28</sub><sub>K</sub> immunopositive IN and determine the spatial distribution of asymmetric and symmetric synapses, surface area and volume of the presynaptic boutons, morphometric parameters of synaptic vesicles, and area extent of the active zones.</p>

<p>Background: Family caregivers of patients with dementia are at high risk of stress and burden, and quarantine due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have increased the risk of psychological disturbances in this population. The current study was carried out during the national lockdown declared in March 2020 by the Italian government as a containment measure of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic and is the first nationwide survey on the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the mental health of dementia informal caregivers.</p><p>Methods: Eighty-seven dementia centers evenly distributed on the Italian territory enrolled 4,710 caregiver–patient pairs. Caregivers underwent a telephone interview assessing classical symptoms of caregiver stress and concern for the consequences of COVID-19 infection on patient’s health. We calculated prevalence of symptoms and regressed them on various potential stress risk factors: caregivers’ sociodemographic characteristics and lifestyle, patients’ clinical features, and lockdown-related elements, like discontinuity in medical care.</p><p>Results: Approximately 90% of caregivers reported at least one symptom of stress, and nearly 30% reported four or more symptoms. The most prevalent symptoms were concern for consequences of COVID-19 on patient’s health (75%) and anxiety (46%). The main risk factors for stress were identified as a conflicting relationship with the patient and discontinuity in assistance, but caregiver’s female sex, younger age, lower education, and cohabitation with the patient also had an impact. Availability of help from institutions or private individuals showed a protective effect against sense of abandonment but a detrimental effect on concern about the risk for the patient to contract COVID-19. The only protective factor was mild dementia severity, which was associated with a lower risk of feeling isolated and abandoned; type of dementia, on the other hand, did not affect stress risk.</p><p>Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the large prevalence of stress in family caregivers of patients with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic and have identified both caregivers and situations at a higher risk of stress, which should be taken into account in the planning of interventions in support of quarantined families and patients.</p>

<p>It is difficult to differentiate between Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy parkinsonian subtype (MSA-P) because of the overlap of their signs and symptoms. Enormous efforts have been made to develop positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to differentiate these diseases. This study aimed to investigate the co-registration analysis of <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodopa and <sup>18</sup>F-flurodeoxyglucose PET images to visualize the difference between Parkinson's disease and MSA-P. We enrolled 29 Parkinson's disease patients, 28 MSA-P patients, and 10 healthy controls, who underwent both <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodopa and <sup>18</sup>F-flurodeoxyglucose PET scans. Patients with Parkinson's disease and MSA-P exhibited reduced bilateral striatal <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodopa uptake (p &lt; 0.05, vs. healthy controls). Both regional specific uptake ratio analysis and statistical parametric mapping analysis of <sup>18</sup>F-flurodeoxyglucose PET revealed hypometabolism in the bilateral putamen of MSA-P patients and hypermetabolism in the bilateral putamen of Parkinson's disease patients. There was a significant positive correlation between <sup>18</sup>F-flurodeoxyglucose uptake and <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodopa uptake in the contralateral posterior putamen of MSA-P patients (rs = 0.558, p = 0.002). Both <sup>18</sup>F-flurodeoxyglucose and <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodopa PET images showed that the striatum was rabbit-shaped in the healthy control group segmentation analysis. A defective rabbit-shaped striatum was observed in the <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodopa PET image of patients with Parkinson's disease and MSA-P. In the segmentation analysis of <sup>18</sup>F-flurodeoxyglucose PET image, an intact rabbit-shaped striatum was observed in Parkinson's disease patients, whereas a defective rabbit-shaped striatum was observed in MSA-P patients. These findings suggest that there were significant differences in the co-registration analysis of <sup>18</sup>F-flurodeoxyglucose and <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodopa PET images, which could be used in the individual analysis to differentiate Parkinson's disease from MSA-P.</p>

Background<p>The risk of recurrent stroke following a minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) is high, when inflammation might play an important role. We aimed to evaluate the value of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in predicting composite cardiovascular events in patients with minor stroke and TIA.</p>Methods<p>Consecutive patients with acute minor stroke or TIA admitted within 24 h of symptoms onset during a 5-year period in a prospective stroke registry were analyzed. We calculated the NLR dividing absolute neutrophil count by absolute lymphocyte count tested within 24 h of admission. NLR ≥4th quartile was defined as high NLR. A composite outcome was defined as stroke, acute coronary syndrome or vascular death within 1 year. We investigated associations between NLR and the composite outcome in univariate and multivariate analyses, among all patients and in those aged over 60 years (i.e., older patients).</p>Results<p>Overall, 841 patients (median age 68 years; 60.4% males) were recruited. No significant independent association was found between NLR and the composite outcome in multivariate analysis in the overall cohort. Among the 612 older patients (median age 73 years; 59.2% males), the median NLR was 2.76 (interquartile range 1.96−4.00) and 148 (24.2%) patients had high NLR. The composite outcome occurred in 77 (12.6%) older patients, who were more likely to have a high NLR (39.0% versus 22.1%; p = 0.001) than those without a composite outcome. In multivariate logistic regression, high NLR (adjusted odds ratio 2.00; 95% confidence interval 1.07−3.75; p = 0.031) was independently associated with the composite outcome in older patients.</p>Conclusion<p>In older (aged ≥60 years) patients with acute minor stroke or TIA, a higher NLR, a marker of systemic inflammation that can be easily obtained in routine blood tests, is an independent predictor of subsequent cardiovascular events.</p>

Objective<p>This study screened potential fluid biomarkers and developed a prediction model based on the easily obtained information at initial inspection to identify ataxia patients more likely to have multiple system atrophy-cerebellar type (MSA-C).</p>Methods<p>We established a retrospective cohort with 125 ataxia patients from southwest China between April 2018 and June 2020. Demographic and laboratory variables obtained at the time of hospital admission were screened using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and logistic regression to construct a diagnosis score. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and decision curve analyses were performed to assess the accuracy and net benefit of the model. Also, independent validation using 25 additional ataxia patients was carried out to verify the model efficiency. Then the model was translated into a visual and operable web application using the R studio and Shiny package.</p>Results<p>From 47 indicators, five variables were selected and integrated into the prediction model, including the age of onset (AO), direct bilirubin (DBIL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), eGFR, and synuclein-alpha. The prediction model exhibited an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.929 for the training cohort and an AUC of 0.917 for the testing cohort. The decision curve analysis (DCA) plot displayed a good net benefit for this model, and external validation confirmed its reliability. The model also was translated into a web application that is freely available to the public.</p>Conclusion<p>The prediction model that was developed based on laboratory and demographic variables obtained from ataxia patients at admission to the hospital might help improve the ability to differentiate MSA-C from spinocerebellar ataxia clinically.</p>

<p>by Yao Jiang, Hui-Fang Liu, Rong Liu</p>

The binding affinities of protein-nucleic acid interactions could be altered due to missense mutations occurring in DNA- or RNA-binding proteins, therefore resulting in various diseases. Unfortunately, a systematic comparison and prediction of the effects of mutations on protein-DNA and protein-RNA interactions (these two mutation classes are termed MPDs and MPRs, respectively) is still lacking. Here, we demonstrated that these two classes of mutations could generate similar or different tendencies for binding free energy changes in terms of the properties of mutated residues. We then developed regression algorithms separately for MPDs and MPRs by introducing novel geometric partition-based energy features and interface-based structural features. Through feature selection and ensemble learning, similar computational frameworks that integrated energy- and nonenergy-based models were established to estimate the binding affinity changes resulting from MPDs and MPRs, but the selected features for the final models were different and therefore reflected the specificity of these two mutation classes. Furthermore, the proposed methodology was extended to the identification of mutations that significantly decreased the binding affinities. Extensive validations indicated that our algorithm generally performed better than the state-of-the-art methods on both the regression and classification tasks.

<p>by James H. Joly, Brandon T. L. Chew, Nicholas A. Graham</p>

The metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells creates metabolic vulnerabilities that can be therapeutically targeted. However, our understanding of metabolic dependencies and the pathway crosstalk that creates these vulnerabilities in cancer cells remains incomplete. Here, by integrating gene expression data with genetic loss-of-function and pharmacological screening data from hundreds of cancer cell lines, we identified metabolic vulnerabilities at the level of pathways rather than individual genes. This approach revealed that metabolic pathway dependencies are highly context-specific such that cancer cells are vulnerable to inhibition of one metabolic pathway only when activity of another metabolic pathway is altered. Notably, we also found that the no single metabolic pathway was universally essential, suggesting that cancer cells are not invariably dependent on any metabolic pathway. In addition, we confirmed that cell culture medium is a major confounding factor for the analysis of metabolic pathway vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, we found robust associations between metabolic pathway activity and sensitivity to clinically approved drugs that were independent of cell culture medium. Lastly, we used parallel integration of pharmacological and genetic dependency data to confidently identify metabolic pathway vulnerabilities. Taken together, this study serves as a comprehensive characterization of the landscape of metabolic pathway vulnerabilities in cancer cell lines.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QSI4-3h-Ths" width="1" />

<p>by Rohan N. Shah, Alexander J. Ruthenburg</p>

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has transformed molecular biology and contributed to many seminal insights into genomic regulation and function. Apart from whole-genome sequencing, an NGS workflow involves alignment of the sequencing reads to the genome of study, after which the resulting alignments can be used for downstream analyses. However, alignment is complicated by the repetitive sequences; many reads align to more than one genomic locus, with 15–30% of the genome not being uniquely mappable by short-read NGS. This problem is typically addressed by discarding reads that do not uniquely map to the genome, but this practice can lead to systematic distortion of the data. Previous studies that developed methods for handling ambiguously mapped reads were often of limited applicability or were computationally intensive, hindering their broader usage. In this work, we present SmartMap: an algorithm that augments industry-standard aligners to enable usage of ambiguously mapped reads by assigning weights to each alignment with Bayesian analysis of the read distribution and alignment quality. SmartMap is computationally efficient, utilizing far fewer weighting iterations than previously thought necessary to process alignments and, as such, analyzing more than a billion alignments of NGS reads in approximately one hour on a desktop PC. By applying SmartMap to peak-type NGS data, including MNase-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq in three organisms, we can increase read depth by up to 53% and increase the mapped proportion of the genome by up to 18% compared to analyses utilizing only uniquely mapped reads. We further show that SmartMap enables the analysis of more than 140,000 repetitive elements that could not be analyzed by traditional ChIP-seq workflows, and we utilize this method to gain insight into the epigenetic regulation of different classes of repetitive elements. These data emphasize both the dangers of discarding ambiguously mapped reads and their power for driving biological discovery.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lxHOpbOVKoI" width="1" />

Mass Based Imaging (MBI) technologies such as Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) and Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) allow for the simultaneous measurement of the expression levels of 40 or more proteins in biological tissue, providing insight into cellular phenotypes and organization <i>in situ</i>. Imaging artifacts, resulting from the sample, assay or instrumentation complicate downstream analyses and require correction by domain experts. Here, we present MBI Analysis User Interface (MAUI), a series of graphical user interfaces that facilitate this data pre-processing, including the removal of channel crosstalk, noise and antibody aggregates. Our software streamlines these steps and accelerates processing by enabling real-time and interactive parameter tuning across multiple images.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OJnoGHD_DtQ" width="1" />

<p>by Benjamin Deneu, Maximilien Servajean, Pierre Bonnet, Christophe Botella, François Munoz, Alexis Joly</p>

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are statistical models suited for learning complex visual patterns. In the context of Species Distribution Models (SDM) and in line with predictions of landscape ecology and island biogeography, CNN could grasp how local landscape structure affects prediction of species occurrence in SDMs. The prediction can thus reflect the signatures of entangled ecological processes. Although previous machine-learning based SDMs can learn complex influences of environmental predictors, they cannot acknowledge the influence of environmental structure in local landscapes (hence denoted “punctual models”). In this study, we applied CNNs to a large dataset of plant occurrences in France (GBIF), on a large taxonomical scale, to predict ranked relative probability of species (by joint learning) to any geographical position. We examined the way local environmental landscapes improve prediction by performing alternative CNN models deprived of information on landscape heterogeneity and structure (“ablation experiments”). We found that the landscape structure around location crucially contributed to improve predictive performance of CNN-SDMs. CNN models can classify the predicted distributions of many species, as other joint modelling approaches, but they further prove efficient in identifying the influence of local environmental landscapes. CNN can then represent signatures of spatially structured environmental drivers. The prediction gain is noticeable for rare species, which open promising perspectives for biodiversity monitoring and conservation strategies. Therefore, the approach is of both theoretical and practical interest. We discuss the way to test hypotheses on the patterns learnt by CNN, which should be essential for further interpretation of the ecological processes at play.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/q7xKUcr8Ifw" width="1" />

<p>by Tsuyoshi Ikegami, Gowrishankar Ganesh, Tricia L. Gibo, Toshinori Yoshioka, Rieko Osu, Mitsuo Kawato</p>

Humans have the amazing ability to learn the dynamics of the body and environment to develop motor skills. Traditional motor studies using arm reaching paradigms have viewed this ability as the process of ‘internal model adaptation’. However, the behaviors have not been fully explored in the case when reaches fail to attain the intended target. Here we examined human reaching under two force fields types; one that induces failures (i.e., target errors), and the other that does not. Our results show the presence of a distinct failure-driven adaptation process that enables quick task success after failures, and before completion of internal model adaptation, but that can result in persistent changes to the undisturbed trajectory. These behaviors can be explained by considering a hierarchical interaction between internal model adaptation and the failure-driven adaptation of reach direction. Our findings suggest that movement failure is negotiated using hierarchical motor adaptations by humans.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/y64_0QXQutQ" width="1" />

<p>by David P. Shorten, Richard E. Spinney, Joseph T. Lizier</p>

Transfer entropy (TE) is a widely used measure of directed information flows in a number of domains including neuroscience. Many real-world time series for which we are interested in information flows come in the form of (near) instantaneous events occurring over time. Examples include the spiking of biological neurons, trades on stock markets and posts to social media, amongst myriad other systems involving events in continuous time throughout the natural and social sciences. However, there exist severe limitations to the current approach to TE estimation on such event-based data via discretising the time series into time bins: it is not consistent, has high bias, converges slowly and cannot simultaneously capture relationships that occur with very fine time precision as well as those that occur over long time intervals. Building on recent work which derived a theoretical framework for TE in continuous time, we present an estimation framework for TE on event-based data and develop a <i>k</i>-nearest-neighbours estimator within this framework. This estimator is provably consistent, has favourable bias properties and converges orders of magnitude more quickly than the current state-of-the-art in discrete-time estimation on synthetic examples. We demonstrate failures of the traditionally-used source-time-shift method for null surrogate generation. In order to overcome these failures, we develop a local permutation scheme for generating surrogate time series conforming to the appropriate null hypothesis in order to test for the statistical significance of the TE and, as such, test for the conditional independence between the history of one point process and the updates of another. Our approach is shown to be capable of correctly rejecting or accepting the null hypothesis of conditional independence even in the presence of strong pairwise time-directed correlations. This capacity to accurately test for conditional independence is further demonstrated on models of a spiking neural circuit inspired by the pyloric circuit of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion, succeeding where previous related estimators have failed.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/it9Dz-VffxU" width="1" />

Most vertebrate RNA viruses show pervasive suppression of CpG and UpA dinucleotides, closely resembling the dinucleotide composition of host cell transcriptomes. In contrast, CpG suppression is absent in both invertebrate mRNA and RNA viruses that exclusively infect arthropods. Arthropod-borne (arbo) viruses are transmitted between vertebrate hosts by invertebrate vectors and thus encounter potentially conflicting evolutionary pressures in the different cytoplasmic environments. Using a newly developed Zika virus (ZIKV) model, we have investigated how demands for CpG suppression in vertebrate cells can be reconciled with potentially quite different compositional requirements in invertebrates and how this affects ZIKV replication and transmission. Mutant viruses with synonymously elevated CpG or UpA dinucleotide frequencies showed attenuated replication in vertebrate cell lines, which was rescued by knockout of the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP). Conversely, in mosquito cells, ZIKV mutants with elevated CpG dinucleotide frequencies showed substantially enhanced replication compared to wild type. Host-driven effects on virus replication attenuation and enhancement were even more apparent in mouse and mosquito models. Infections with CpG- or UpA-high ZIKV mutants in mice did not cause typical ZIKV-induced tissue damage and completely protected mice during subsequent challenge with wild-type virus, which demonstrates their potential as live-attenuated vaccines. In contrast, the CpG-high mutants displayed enhanced replication in <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquitoes and a larger proportion of mosquitoes carried infectious virus in their saliva. These findings show that mosquito cells are also capable of discriminating RNA based on dinucleotide composition. However, the evolutionary pressure on the CpG dinucleotides of viral genomes in arthropod vectors directly opposes the pressure present in vertebrate host cells, which provides evidence that an adaptive compromise is required for arbovirus transmission. This suggests that the genome composition of arbo flaviviruses is crucial to maintain the balance between high-level replication in the vertebrate host and persistent replication in the mosquito vector.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/acvgEhXaVv8" width="1" />

Persisters represent a small subpopulation of non- or slow-growing bacterial cells that are tolerant to killing by antibiotics. Despite their prominent role in the recalcitrance of chronic infections to antibiotic therapy, the mechanism of their formation has remained elusive. We show that sorted cells of <i>Escherichia coli</i> with low levels of energy-generating enzymes are better able to survive antibiotic killing. Using microfluidics time-lapse microscopy and a fluorescent reporter for in vivo ATP measurements, we find that a subpopulation of cells with a low level of ATP survives killing by ampicillin. We propose that these low ATP cells are formed stochastically as a result of fluctuations in the abundance of energy-generating components. These findings point to a general “low energy” mechanism of persister formation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/wLiBOMyGtAE" width="1" />

<p>by Abigail Leavitt LaBella, Dana A. Opulente, Jacob L. Steenwyk, Chris Todd Hittinger, Antonis Rokas</p>

Reverse ecology is the inference of ecological information from patterns of genomic variation. One rich, heretofore underutilized, source of ecologically relevant genomic information is codon optimality or adaptation. Bias toward codons that match the tRNA pool is robustly associated with high gene expression in diverse organisms, suggesting that codon optimization could be used in a reverse ecology framework to identify highly expressed, ecologically relevant genes. To test this hypothesis, we examined the relationship between optimal codon usage in the classic galactose metabolism (<i>GAL</i>) pathway and known ecological niches for 329 species of budding yeasts, a diverse subphylum of fungi. We find that optimal codon usage in the <i>GAL</i> pathway is positively correlated with quantitative growth on galactose, suggesting that <i>GAL</i> codon optimization reflects increased capacity to grow on galactose. Optimal codon usage in the <i>GAL</i> pathway is also positively correlated with human-associated ecological niches in yeasts of the CUG-Ser1 clade and with dairy-associated ecological niches in the family Saccharomycetaceae. For example, optimal codon usage of <i>GAL</i> genes is greater than 85% of all genes in the genome of the major human pathogen <i>Candida albicans</i> (CUG-Ser1 clade) and greater than 75% of genes in the genome of the dairy yeast <i>Kluyveromyces lactis</i> (family Saccharomycetaceae). We further find a correlation between optimization in the <i>GAL</i>actose pathway genes and several genes associated with nutrient sensing and metabolism. This work suggests that codon optimization harbors information about the metabolic ecology of microbial eukaryotes. This information may be particularly useful for studying fungal dark matter—species that have yet to be cultured in the lab or have only been identified by genomic material.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/yGiZ_5eCky0" width="1" />

Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are biased and difficult to reproduce due to methodological flaws and poor reporting. There is increasing attention for responsible research practices and implementation of reporting guidelines, but whether these efforts have improved the methodological quality of RCTs (e.g., lower risk of bias) is unknown. We, therefore, mapped risk-of-bias trends over time in RCT publications in relation to journal and author characteristics. Meta-information of 176,620 RCTs published between 1966 and 2018 was extracted. The risk-of-bias probability (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of patients/personnel, and blinding of outcome assessment) was assessed using a risk-of-bias machine learning tool. This tool was simultaneously validated using 63,327 human risk-of-bias assessments obtained from 17,394 RCTs evaluated in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR). Moreover, RCT registration and CONSORT Statement reporting were assessed using automated searches. Publication characteristics included the number of authors, journal impact factor (JIF), and medical discipline. The annual number of published RCTs substantially increased over 4 decades, accompanied by increases in authors (5.2 to 7.8) and institutions (2.9 to 4.8). The risk of bias remained present in most RCTs but decreased over time for allocation concealment (63% to 51%), random sequence generation (57% to 36%), and blinding of outcome assessment (58% to 52%). Trial registration (37% to 47%) and the use of the CONSORT Statement (1% to 20%) also rapidly increased. In journals with a higher impact factor (&gt;10), the risk of bias was consistently lower with higher levels of RCT registration and the use of the CONSORT Statement. Automated risk-of-bias predictions had accuracies above 70% for allocation concealment (70.7%), random sequence generation (72.1%), and blinding of patients/personnel (79.8%), but not for blinding of outcome assessment (62.7%). In conclusion, the likelihood of bias in RCTs has generally decreased over the last decades. This optimistic trend may be driven by increased knowledge augmented by mandatory trial registration and more stringent reporting guidelines and journal requirements. Nevertheless, relatively high probabilities of bias remain, particularly in journals with lower impact factors. This emphasizes that further improvement of RCT registration, conduct, and reporting is still urgently needed.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/KTBxyMjg_Vs" width="1" />
