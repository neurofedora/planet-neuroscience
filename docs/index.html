                arXiv:2504.10875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music is a universal feature of human culture, linked to embodied cognitive functions that drive learning, action, and the emergence of creativity and individuality. Evidence highlights the critical role of statistical learning an implicit cognitive process of the brain in musical creativity and individuality. Despite its significance, the precise neural and computational mechanisms underpinning these dynamic and embodied cognitive processes re-main poorly understood. This paper discusses how individuality and creativity emerge within the framework of the brain's statistical learning, drawing on a series of neural and computational studies. This work offers perspectives on the mechanisms driving the heterogeneous nature of statistical learning abilities and embodied mechanisms and provides a framework to explain the paradoxical phenomenon where individuals with specific cognitive traits that limit certain perceptual abilities excel in creative domains.

                arXiv:2504.10973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early dementia diagnosis requires biomarkers sensitive to both structural and functional brain changes. While structural neuroimaging biomarkers have progressed significantly, objective functional biomarkers of early cognitive decline remain a critical unmet need. Current cognitive assessments often rely on behavioral responses, making them susceptible to factors like effort, practice effects, and educational background, thereby hindering early and accurate detection. This work introduces a novel approach, leveraging a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) to infer cognitive impairment levels directly from electroencephalography (EEG) data. Critically, this method employs a passive fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS) paradigm, eliminating the need for explicit behavioral responses or task comprehension from the participant. This passive approach provides an objective measure of working memory function, independent of confounding factors inherent in active cognitive tasks, and offers a promising new avenue for early and unbiased detection of cognitive decline.

                arXiv:2406.10184v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evidence indicates that intracranial EEG connectivity, as estimated from daily resting state recordings from epileptic patients, may be capable of identifying preictal states. In this study, we employed hyperbolic embedding of brain networks to capture non-trivial patterns that discriminate between connectivity networks from days with (preictal) and without (interictal) seizure. A statistical model was constructed by combining hyperbolic geometry and machine learning tools, which allowed for the estimation of the probability of an upcoming seizure. The results demonstrated that representing brain networks in a hyperbolic space enabled an accurate discrimination (85%) between interictal (no-seizure) and preictal (seizure within the next 24 hours) states. The proposed method also demonstrated excellent prediction performances, with an overall accuracy of 87% and an F1-score of 89% (mean Brier score and Brier skill score of 0.12 and 0.37, respectively). In conclusion, our findings indicate that representations of brain connectivity in a latent geometry space can reveal a daily and reliable signature of the upcoming seizure(s), thus providing a promising biomarker for seizure forecasting.

                arXiv:2504.11280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven genetic programming (GP) has proven highly effective in solving combinatorial optimization problems under dynamic and uncertain environments. A central challenge lies in fast fitness evaluations on large training datasets, especially for complex real-world problems involving time-consuming simulations. Surrogate models, like phenotypic characterization (PC)-based K-nearest neighbors (KNN), have been applied to reduce computational cost. However, the PC-based similarity measure is confined to behavioral characteristics, overlooking genotypic differences, which can limit surrogate quality and impair performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes a pheno-geno unified surrogate GP algorithm, PGU-SGP, integrating phenotypic and genotypic characterization (GC) to enhance surrogate sample selection and fitness prediction. A novel unified similarity metric combining PC and GC distances is proposed, along with an effective and efficient GC representation. Experimental results of a real-life vehicle scheduling problem demonstrate that PGU-SGP reduces training time by approximately 76% while achieving comparable performance to traditional GP. With the same training time, PGU-SGP significantly outperforms traditional GP and the state-of-the-art algorithm on most datasets. Additionally, PGU-SGP shows faster convergence and improved surrogate quality by maintaining accurate fitness rankings and appropriate selection pressure, further validating its effectiveness.

                arXiv:2504.10648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few activities are as crucial in urban environments as waste management. Mismanagement of waste can cause significant economic, social, and environmental damage. However, waste management is often a complex system to manage and therefore where computational decision-support tools can play a pivotal role in assisting managers to make faster and better decisions. In this sense, this article proposes, on the one hand, a unified optimization model to address two common waste management system optimization problem: the determination of the capacity of waste bins in the collection network and the design and scheduling of collection routes. The integration of these two problems is not usual in the literature since each of them separately is already a major computational challenge. On the other hand, two improved exact formulations based on mathematical programming and a genetic algorithm (GA) are provided to solve this proposed unified optimization model. It should be noted that the GA considers a mixed chromosome representation of the solutions combining binary and integer alleles, in order to solve realistic instances of this complex problem. Also, different genetic operators have been tested to study which combination of them obtained better results in execution times on the order of that of the exact solvers. The obtained results show that the proposed GA is able to match the results of exact solvers on small instances and, in addition, can obtain feasible solutions on large instances, where exact formulations are not applicable, in reasonable computation times.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11419">Embodied World Models Emerge from Navigational Task in Open-Ended Environments</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.11419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how artificial systems can develop spatial awareness and reasoning has long been a challenge in AI research. Traditional models often rely on passive observation, but embodied cognition theory suggests that deeper understanding emerges from active interaction with the environment. This study investigates whether neural networks can autonomously internalize spatial concepts through interaction, focusing on planar navigation tasks. Using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) combined with Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL), we show that agents can learn to encode spatial properties like direction, distance, and obstacle avoidance. We introduce Hybrid Dynamical Systems (HDS) to model the agent-environment interaction as a closed dynamical system, revealing stable limit cycles that correspond to optimal navigation strategies. Ridge Representation allows us to map navigation paths into a fixed-dimensional behavioral space, enabling comparison with neural states. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) confirms strong alignment between these representations, suggesting that the agent's neural states actively encode spatial knowledge. Intervention experiments further show that specific neural dimensions are causally linked to navigation performance. This work provides an approach to bridging the gap between action and perception in AI, offering new insights into building adaptive, interpretable models that can generalize across complex environments. The causal validation of neural representations also opens new avenues for understanding and controlling the internal mechanisms of AI systems, pushing the boundaries of how machines learn and reason in dynamic, real-world scenarios.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07014">An Attempt to Devise a Pairwise Ising-Type Maximum Entropy Model Integrated Cost Function for Optimizing SNN Deployment</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2407.07014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) emulate the spiking behavior of biological neurons and are typically deployed on distributed-memory neuromorphic hardware. The deployment of a SNN usually requires partitioning the network and mapping these partitions onto the hardware's processing units.
  However, finding optimal deployment configurations is an NP-hard problem, often addressed through optimization algorithms. While some objectives (e.g., memory utilization and chip count) are static, others (e.g., communication latency and energy efficiency) depend on the network's dynamic behavior, necessitating dynamic-aware optimization.
  To address this, we model SNN dynamics using an Ising-type pairwise interaction framework, bridging microscopic neuron interactions with macroscopic network behavior. We optimize deployment by exploring the parameter and configuration spaces of the Ising model.
  We evaluate our approach on two SNNs deployed on the sPyNNaker neuromorphic platform. Initial results suggest that the method underperforms, potentially due to the Ising model's equilibrium assumptions and the architectural complexity of real-world neuromorphic hardware, highlighting limitations in its current formulation.
  Update: The method proposed is with a equilibrium-dynamics SNN assumption, and the original paper does not mention this. The paper needs to be revisited and reuploaded after further experiments.

Abstract: Genetic programming is an optimization algorithm inspired by evolution which automatically evolves the structure of interpretable computer programs. The fitness evaluation in genetic programming suffers from high computational requirements, limiting the performance on difficult problems. Consequently, there is no efficient genetic programming framework that is usable for a wide range of tasks. To this end, we developed Kozax, a genetic programming framework that evolves symbolic expressions for arbitrary problems. We implemented Kozax using JAX, a framework for high-performance and scalable machine learning, which allows the fitness evaluation to scale efficiently to large populations or datasets on GPU. Furthermore, Kozax offers constant optimization, custom operator definition and simultaneous evolution of multiple trees. We demonstrate successful applications of Kozax to discover equations of natural laws, recover equations of hidden dynamic variables, evolve a control policy and optimize an objective function. Overall, Kozax provides a general, fast, and scalable library to optimize white-box solutions in the realm of scientific computing.

Abstract: Evolutionary model merging enables the creation of high-performing multi-task models but remains computationally prohibitive for consumer hardware. We introduce MERGE$^3$, an efficient framework that makes evolutionary merging feasible on a single GPU by reducing fitness computation costs 50$\times$ while preserving performance. MERGE$^3$ achieves this by Extracting a reduced dataset for evaluation, Estimating model abilities using Item Response Theory (IRT), and Evolving optimal merges via IRT-based performance estimators. Our method enables state-of-the-art multilingual and cross-lingual merging, transferring knowledge across languages with significantly lower computational overhead. We provide theoretical guarantees and an open-source library, democratizing high-quality model merging.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, with their performance heavily dependent on the quality of input prompts. While prompt engineering has proven effective, it typically relies on manual adjustments, making it time-consuming and potentially suboptimal.

Unlike traditional genetic approaches that rely solely on mutation and crossover operations, GAAPO integrates multiple specialized prompt generation strategies within its evolutionary framework. Through extensive experimentation on diverse datasets including ETHOS, MMLU-Pro, and GPQA, our analysis reveals several important point for the future development of automatic prompt optimization methods: importance of the tradeoff between the population size and the number of generations, effect of selection methods on stability results, capacity of different LLMs and especially reasoning models to be able to automatically generate prompts from similar queries... Furthermore, we provide insights into the relative effectiveness of different prompt generation strategies and their evolution across optimization phases. These findings contribute to both the theoretical understanding of prompt optimization and practical applications in improving LLM performance.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03843">Using Cooperative Co-evolutionary Search to Generate Metamorphic Test Cases for Autonomous Driving Systems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.03843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) rely on Deep Neural Networks, allowing vehicles to navigate complex, open environments. However, the unpredictability of these scenarios highlights the need for rigorous system-level testing to ensure safety, a task usually performed with a simulator in the loop. Though one important goal of such testing is to detect safety violations, there are many undesirable system behaviors, that may not immediately lead to violations, that testing should also be focusing on, thus detecting more subtle problems and enabling a finer-grained analysis. This paper introduces Cooperative Co-evolutionary MEtamorphic test Generator for Autonomous systems (CoCoMEGA), a novel automated testing framework aimed at advancing system-level safety assessments of ADSs. CoCoMEGA combines Metamorphic Testing (MT) with a search-based approach utilizing Cooperative Co-Evolutionary Algorithms (CCEA) to efficiently generate a diverse set of test cases. CoCoMEGA emphasizes the identification of test scenarios that present undesirable system behavior, that may eventually lead to safety violations, captured by Metamorphic Relations (MRs). When evaluated within the CARLA simulation environment on the Interfuser ADS, CoCoMEGA consistently outperforms baseline methods, demonstrating enhanced effectiveness and efficiency in generating severe, diverse MR violations and achieving broader exploration of the test space. These results underscore CoCoMEGA as a promising, more scalable solution to the inherent challenges in ADS testing with a simulator in the loop. Future research directions may include extending the approach to additional simulation platforms, applying it to other complex systems, and exploring methods for further improving testing efficiency such as surrogate modeling.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12012">Evolving Hard Maximum Cut Instances for Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.12012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms, such as the Recursive Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (RQAOA), have become increasingly popular, offering promising avenues for employing Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices to address challenging combinatorial optimization tasks like the maximum cut problem. In this study, we utilize an evolutionary algorithm equipped with a unique fitness function. This approach targets hard maximum cut instances within the latent space of a Graph Autoencoder, identifying those that pose significant challenges or are particularly tractable for RQAOA, in contrast to the classic Goemans and Williamson algorithm. Our findings not only delineate the distinct capabilities and limitations of each algorithm but also expand our understanding of RQAOA's operational limits. Furthermore, the diverse set of graphs we have generated serves as a crucial benchmarking asset, emphasizing the need for more advanced algorithms to tackle combinatorial optimization challenges. Additionally, our results pave the way for new avenues in graph generation research, offering exciting opportunities for future explorations.

                Izumi Shinya (1930-2022) participated in all the international expos held in Japan from the 1970 Osaka Expo to the 2005 Aichi Expo in important positions, and in particular oversaw the entire project as general producer for the 1990 Osaka International Garden and Greenery Exposition and the Aichi Expo. It is not easy to evaluate how producers conceived and realised a mega-event such as an international exposition. In this short report, I have taken a look at the concept of the San'in Yumeminato Expo held in Sakaiminato City in 1997, summarising its formulation process and uniqueness. In terms of the number of visitors, it was a regional exposition with around one-tenth the size of the Aichi Expo, but it clearly represents the methods used by Izumi and his team in order to realise expositions. This exposition can be seen as a step in the development of Izumi's exposition production, which followed the 1996 Tokyo World City Exposition (cancelled), through the 2001 Kitakyushu Expo (Kita Kyushu Hakuran Sai), and on to the Aichi Expo.

                Objectives Degenerative lumbar spine disease, a leading cause of chronic pain and disability in older adults, results from the progressive degeneration of intervertebral discs. This systematic review evaluates the role of mean kurtosis (MK) as a diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) parameter in the early diagnosis of degenerative spine disease and its potential to enhance patient outcomes. Methods A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, with a comprehensive search yielding 7,290 articles. After screening, three studies met the inclusion criteria. Quality assessment was performed using the QUADAS tool, considering studies with a score of ≥10 as high-quality. Data extraction focused on DKI parameters, particularly MK, in assessing early disc degeneration. The study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024554902) on June 5, 2024. Results Findings indicate that MK plays a crucial role in detecting microstructural changes in the intervertebral disc space of the lumbar spine. These changes closely correlate with clinical symptoms and the extent of degeneration observed on conventional MRI. DKI-derived MK appears to offer greater sensitivity in identifying early-stage microstructural degeneration compared to traditional imaging methods Conclusions MR DKI demonstrates significant potential for detecting subtle, early changes in lumbar spine degeneration. Integrating DKI into clinical practice could enhance diagnostic accuracy, enable earlier interventions, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-439/v1?src=rss">Contrafactual analysis: Comparing voucher systems with taxes, subsidies, and public spending to reduce income inequality [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study examines how voucher systems compare to traditional redistributive policies—such as progressive taxation, subsidies, and public spending—in reducing income inequality. Methods We apply a counterfactual analysis approach, using panel data from twelve countries over 22 years. By employing econometric modelling, we simulate a series of “what-if” scenarios to assess the impact of each policy on the Gini coefficient, a key measure of income inequality. Results The results suggest that voucher systems can be particularly effective at targeting essential services, like education and healthcare, improving access for lower-income groups, and helping to reduce inequality. Public spending on education and healthcare proves to be incredibly potent in narrowing income disparities. These sectors are vital for addressing systemic inequalities, improving overall access and providing long-term benefits to disadvantaged groups. In contrast, progressive taxation and subsidies show mixed effectiveness. While higher tax revenues often correlate with reduced inequality, their impacts vary across countries and contexts. The effectiveness of progressive taxation depends on factors such as the efficiency of tax systems and the political environment, which can influence how well these policies work. Similarly, subsidies generally produce only modest or inconsistent reductions in income gaps, suggesting that while they provide temporary relief, they do not always address the root causes of inequality. Conclusions These findings suggest that well-designed voucher programs, when combined with progressive taxation and strategic public spending, can play a key role in enhancing redistribution efforts. By improving access to essential services and targeting lower-income groups, vouchers have the potential to reduce income inequality. However, achieving equitable economic outcomes requires careful policy design and attention to the broader economic context.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1369/v2?src=rss">Financial inclusion and stability in Ethiopia using bank-level data: A two-step system GMM estimation [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background This paper examines the impact of FI on bank stability within Ethiopian context, using panel data from 17 commercial banks over the period 2015-2023. Given the scarcity of research focused on the relationship between FI and bank stability in Ethiopia, this paper seeks to address a crucial gap by analyzing both conventional and digital aspects of FI in relation with bank stability. Methods A two-stage principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to construct a composite FI index, integrating 10 conventional and 5 digital indicators. The study applied a two-step robust system generalized method of moments (GMM) to analyze the effects of FI on bank stability, tests nonlinearities using Lind and Mehlum’s (2010) U-test, and examines causality through Dumitrescu-Hurlin (2012) and Juodis et al. (2021) causality tests. Results The result reveals an inverted U-shaped relationship between FI and bank stability. FI enhances stability up to a 30.3% threshold, beyond which increased transaction costs, information asymmetries, and adverse selection risks weaken stability. Capital adequacy moderates this effect, raising the threshold to 35.1%, but its stabilizing role diminishes at higher levels. Granger causality tests confirm a bidirectional relationship. Additionally, bank efficiency and GDP growth enhance stability, while real interest rates, total assets, and income diversification exert destabilizing effects. Conclusions This study makes three key contributions. First, it provides the first empirical analysis of the FI-stability nexus in Ethiopia. Second: (i), it develops a multidimensional FI index; (ii), explores both linear and nonlinear relationships, and (iii) examines macroprudential regulation as a moderating factor. Third, it tests causality, offering policy insights. To enhance stability while mitigating risks, policymakers must balance FI expansion, enforce regulatory frameworks, and implement targeted capital requirements. Regulators should strengthen consumer protection and financial literacy, while banks must optimize outreach, manage credit risk, and ensure prudent asset allocation and liquidity management to sustain financial stability.

                <p>by Sarit F.A. Szpiro, Charlie S. Burlingham, Eero P. Simoncelli, Marisa Carrasco</p>

Human perceptual sensitivity often improves with training, a phenomenon known as “perceptual learning.” Another important perceptual dimension is appearance, the subjective sense of stimulus magnitude. Are training-induced improvements in sensitivity accompanied by more accurate appearance? Here, we examined this question by measuring both discrimination (sensitivity) and estimation (appearance) responses to near-horizontal motion directions, which are known to be repulsed away from horizontal. Participants performed discrimination and estimation tasks before and after training in either the discrimination or the estimation task or none (control group). Human observers who trained in either discrimination or estimation exhibited improvements in discrimination accuracy, but estimation repulsion did not decrease; instead, it either persisted or increased. Hence, distortions in perception can be exacerbated after perceptual learning. We developed a computational observer model in which perceptual learning arises from increases in the precision of underlying neural representations, which explains this counterintuitive finding. For each observer, the fitted model accounted for discrimination performance, the distribution of estimates, and their changes with training. Our empirical findings and modeling suggest that learning enhances distinctions between categories, a potentially important aspect of real-world perception and perceptual learning.

                <p>by Yee Chuen Teoh, Mohammed Sakib Noor, Sina Aghakhani, Jack Girton, Guiping Hu, Ratul Chowdhury</p>

A generalizable computational platform, CTRL-V (Computational TRacking of Likely Variants), is introduced to design selective binding (dual bait) biosensor proteins. The iteratively evolving receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been construed as a model dual bait biosensor which has iteratively evolved to distinguish and selectively bind to human entry receptors and avoid binding neutralizing antibodies. Spike RBD prioritizes mutations that reduce antibody binding while enhancing/ retaining binding with the ACE2 receptor. CTRL-V’s through iterative design cycles was shown to pinpoint 20% (of the 39) reported SARS-CoV-2 point mutations across 30 circulating, infective strains as responsible for immune escape from commercial antibody LY-CoV1404. CTRL-V successfully identifies ~70% (five out of seven) single point mutations (371F, 373P, 440K, 445H, 456L) in the latest circulating KP.2 variant and offers detailed structural insights to the escape mechanism. While other data-driven viral escape variant predictor tools have shown promise in predicting potential future viral variants, they require massive amounts of data to bypass the need for physics of explicit biochemical interactions. Consequently, they cannot be generalized for other protein design applications. The publicly availably viral escape data was leveraged as <i>in vivo</i> anchors to streamline a computational workflow that can be generalized for dual bait biosensor design tasks as exemplified by identifying key mutational loci in Raf kinase that enables it to selectively bind Ras and Rap1a GTP. We demonstrate three versions of CTRL-V which use a combination of integer optimization, stochastic sampling by PyRosetta, and deep learning-based ProteinMPNN for structure-guided biosensor design.

                <p>by Emma B Hodcroft, Martin S Wohlfender, Richard A Neher, Julien Riou, Christian L Althaus</p>

The wealth of genomic data that was generated during the COVID-19 pandemic provides an exceptional opportunity to obtain information on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, there is great interest to better understand how the effective reproduction number Re and the overdispersion of secondary cases, which can be quantified by the negative binomial dispersion parameter <i>k</i>, changed over time and across regions and viral variants. The aim of our study was to develop a Bayesian framework to infer Re and <i>k</i> from viral sequence data. First, we developed a mathematical model for the distribution of the size of identical sequence clusters, in which we integrated viral transmission, the mutation rate of the virus, and incomplete case-detection. Second, we implemented this model within a Bayesian inference framework, allowing the estimation of Re and <i>k</i> from genomic data only. We validated this model in a simulation study. Third, we identified clusters of identical sequences in all SARS-CoV-2 sequences in 2021 from Switzerland, Denmark, and Germany that were available on GISAID. We obtained monthly estimates of the posterior distribution of Re and <i>k</i>, with the resulting Re estimates slightly lower than resulting obtained by other methods, and <i>k</i> comparable with previous results. We found comparatively higher estimates of <i>k</i> in Denmark which suggests less opportunities for superspreading and more controlled transmission compared to the other countries in 2021. Our model included an estimation of the case detection and sampling probability, but the estimates obtained had large uncertainty, reflecting the difficulty of estimating these parameters simultaneously. Our study presents a novel method to infer information on the transmission of infectious diseases and its heterogeneity using genomic data. With increasing availability of sequences of pathogens in the future, we expect that our method has the potential to provide new insights into the transmission and the overdispersion in secondary cases of other pathogens.

                <p>by David N. White, Johannes Burge</p>

Stimulus variability—a form of nuisance variability—is a primary source of perceptual uncertainty in everyday natural tasks. How do different properties of natural images and scenes contribute to this uncertainty? Using binocular disparity as a model system, we report a systematic investigation of how various forms of natural stimulus variability impact performance in a stereo-depth discrimination task. With stimuli sampled from a stereo-image database of real-world scenes having pixel-by-pixel ground-truth distance data, three human observers completed two closely related double-pass psychophysical experiments. In the two experiments, each human observer responded twice to ten thousand unique trials, in which twenty thousand unique stimuli were presented. New analytical methods reveal, from this data, the specific and nearly dissociable effects of two distinct sources of natural stimulus variability—variation in luminance-contrast patterns and variation in local-depth structure—on discrimination performance, as well as the relative importance of stimulus-driven-variability and internal-noise in determining performance limits. Between-observer analyses show that both stimulus-driven sources of uncertainty are responsible for a large proportion of total variance, have strikingly similar effects on different people, and—surprisingly—make stimulus-by-stimulus responses more predictable (not less). The consistency across observers raises the intriguing prospect that image-computable models can make reasonably accurate performance predictions in natural viewing. Overall, the findings provide a rich picture of stimulus factors that contribute to human perceptual performance in natural scenes. The approach should have broad application to other animal models and other sensory-perceptual tasks with natural or naturalistic stimuli.

Information theory has deeply influenced the conceptualization of brain information processing and is a mainstream framework for analyzing how neural networks in the brain process information to generate behavior. Information theory tools have been initially conceived and used to study how information about sensory variables is encoded by the activity of small neural populations. However, recent multivariate information theoretic advances have enabled addressing how information is exchanged across areas and used to inform behavior. Moreover, its integration with dimensionality-reduction techniques has enabled addressing information encoding and communication by the activity of large neural populations or many brain areas, as recorded by multichannel activity measurements in functional imaging and electrophysiology. Here, we provide a Multivariate Information in Neuroscience Toolbox (MINT) that combines these new methods with statistical tools for robust estimation from limited-size empirical datasets. We demonstrate the capabilities of MINT by applying it to both simulated and real neural data recorded with electrophysiology or calcium imaging, but all MINT functions are equally applicable to other brain-activity measurement modalities. We highlight the synergistic opportunities that combining its methods afford for reverse engineering of specific information processing and flow between neural populations or areas, and for discovering how information processing functions emerge from interactions between neurons or areas. MINT works on Linux, Windows and macOS operating systems, is written in MATLAB (requires MATLAB version 2018b or newer) and depends on 4 native MATLAB toolboxes. The calculation of one possible way to compute information redundancy requires the installation and compilation of C files (made available by us also as pre-compiled files). MINT is freely available at https://github.com/panzerilab/MINT with DOI doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13998526 and operates under a GNU GPLv3 license.

A shallow neural network was used to embed lipid structures in a 2- or 3-dimensional space with the goal that structurally similar species have similar vectors. Tests on complete lipid databanks show that the method automatically produces distributions which follow conventional lipid classifications. The embedding is accompanied by the web-based software, Lipidome Projector. This displays user lipidomes as 2D or 3D scatterplots for quick exploratory analysis, quantitative comparison and interpretation at a structural level. Examples of published data sets were used for a qualitative comparison with literature interpretation.

                <p>by Lukáš Lochman, Ellen Tanaka Kahiya, Bechara Saade, Tomáš Smutný, Jurjen Duintjer Tebbens, Petr Pávek, Veronika Bernhauerová</p>

Xenoreceptors of the nuclear receptor superfamily, such as pregnane X receptor (PXR), are liver-enriched ligand-activated transcription factors regarded as crucial sensors in xenobiotic exposure and detoxification. PXR controls transcription of many drug-handling genes and influx/eﬄux transporters, thus playing a crucial role in drug metabolism and excretion. Liver functions have been studied using primary human hepatocytes (PHHs), which, when conventionally cultured, undergo rapid de-differentiation, leaving them unsuitable for long-term studies. Recently, 3D PHHs called spheroids have emerged as an <i>in vitro</i> model that is similar to <i>in vivo</i> hepatocytes regarding phenotype and function and represents the first <i>in vitro</i> model to study the long-term regulation of drug-handling genes by PXR. In this study, we used mathematical modelling to analyze the long-term activation of PXR in 3D PHHs through expression kinetics of three key PXR-regulated drug-metabolizing enzymes, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2B6 and the P-glycoprotein eﬄux transporter encoding gene, MDR1. PXR action in 3D PHHs was induced by the antibiotic rifampicin at two clinically relevant concentrations. The results confirmed that high rifampicin concentrations activated PXR nearly to its full capacity. The analysis indicated the highest PXR-induced transcription rate constant for CYP2B6. The rate constant dictating mRNA degradation associated with activated PXR was highest for CYP3A4. Moreover, we measured the metabolic activity of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2B6 and quantified their metabolic rate constants. Metabolic activity rate constant of CYP3A4 was found to be the highest whereas that of CYP2B6 was found to be the lowest among the studied enzymes. Our results provide important insight into the regulation of PXR-target genes in 3D PHHs and show that mRNA expression and metabolic activity data can be combined with quantitative analysis to reveal the long-term action of PXR and its effects on drug-handling genes.

                <p>by Gabriele Pozzati, Samuel Coulbourn Flores</p>

Introductory bioinformatics courses can be challenging to teach. Students with a biological background may have never encountered computer science, and computer science students are likely to have minimal knowledge of biology. To improve learning, we implemented a flipped spaced-repetition course. We repeated the topics through various activities across different days while applying an unusually high number of examinations. The examinations were synergistic with the flipped classroom, encouraging reading and watching recorded lectures before in-person discussions. Additionally, they helped us structure and assess laboratory practicals. We analyzed grades, pass rates, student satisfaction, and student comments qualitatively and quantitatively over 7 years of the course, documenting progress as well as the effect of disruptions such as COVID-19 and changes in teaching staff. We share our results and insights into the opportunities and challenges of this pedagogical approach. An open online version of this course is freely provided for students and teachers.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012298">Modelling the spatiotemporal dynamics of senescent cells in wound healing, chronic wounds, and fibrosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sharmilla Chandrasegaran, James P. Sluka, Daryl Shanley</p>

Cellular senescence is known to drive age-related pathology through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). However, it also plays important physiological roles such as cancer suppression, embryogenesis and wound healing. Wound healing is a tightly regulated process which when disrupted results in conditions such as fibrosis and chronic wounds. Senescent cells appear during the proliferation phase of the healing process where the SASP is involved in maintaining tissue homeostasis after damage. Interestingly, SASP composition and functionality was recently found to be temporally regulated, with distinct SASP profiles involved: a fibrogenic, followed by a fibrolytic SASP, which could have important implications for the role of senescent cells in wound healing. Given the number of factors at play a full understanding requires addressing the multiple levels of complexity, pertaining to the various cell behaviours, individually followed by investigating the interactions and influence each of these elements have on each other and the system as a whole. Here, a systems biology approach was adopted whereby a multi-scale model of wound healing that includes the dynamics of senescent cell behaviour and corresponding SASP composition within the wound microenvironment was developed. The model was built using the software CompuCell3D, which is based on a Cellular Potts modelling framework. We used an existing body of data on healthy wound healing to calibrate the model and validation was done on known disease conditions. The model clearly shows how differences in the spatiotemporal dynamics of different senescent cell phenotypes lead to several distinct repair outcomes. These differences in senescent cell dynamics can be attributed to variable SASP composition, duration of senescence and temporal induction of senescence relative to the healing stage. The range of outcomes demonstrated strongly highlight the dynamic and heterogenous role of senescent cells in wound healing, fibrosis and chronic wounds, and their fine-tuned control. Further specific data to increase model confidence could be used to explore senolytic treatments in wound disorders.

                <p>by Fillipe Georgiou, Camille Buhl, J. E. F. Green, Bishnu Lamichhane, Ngamta Thamwattana</p>

Collective behaviour occurs at all levels of the natural world, from cells aggregating to form tissues, to locusts interacting to form large and destructive plagues. These complex behaviours arise from relatively simple interactions amongst individuals and between individuals and their environment. For simplicity, mathematical models of these phenomena often assume that the population is homogeneous. However, population heterogeneity arising due to the internal state of individuals can affect these interactions and thus plays a role in the dynamics of group formation. In this paper, we present a partial differential equation model that accounts for this heterogeneity by introducing a state space that models an individual’s internal state (<i>e.g.</i> age, level of hunger) which affects its movement characteristics. We then apply the model to a concrete example of locust foraging to investigate the dynamic interplay of food availability, hunger, and degree of gregarisation (level of sociability) on locust group formation and structure. We find that including hunger lowers group density and raises the percentage of the population that needs to be gregarious for group formation. Within the group structure itself we find that the most gregarious and satiated locusts tend to be located towards the centre with hunger driving locusts towards the edges of the group. These two effects may combine to give a simple mechanism for locust group dispersal, in that hunger lowers the group density, which in turn lowers the gregarisation, further lowering density and creating a feedback loop. We also note that a previously found optimal food patch size for group formation may be driven by hunger. In addition to our locust results, we provide more general results and methods in the attached appendices.

                <p>by Alexis Hervais-Adelman, Simon W. Townsend</p>

Whether human language evolved via a gestural or a vocal route remains an unresolved and contentious issue. Given the existence of two preconditions—a “language faculty” and the capacity for imitative learning both vocally and manually—there is no compelling evidence for gesture being inherently inferior to vocalization as a mode of linguistic expression; indeed, signed languages are capable of the same expressive range as spoken ones. Here, we revisit this conundrum, championing recent methodological advances in human neuroimaging (specifically, in utero functional magnetic resonance imaging) as a window into the role of the prenatal gestational period in language evolution, a critical, yet currently underexplored environment in which fetuses are exposed to, and become attuned to, spoken language. In this Unsolved Mystery, we outline how, compared to visual sensitivity, the ontogenically earlier development of auditory sensitivity, beginning in utero and persisting for several months <i>post-partum,</i> alongside the relative permeability of the uterine environment to sound, but not light, may constitute a small but significant contribution to the current dominance of spoken language.

                <p>by Buse Isbilir, Anna Yeates, Vikram Alva, Tanmay A. M. Bharat</p>

<i>Corynebacterium glutamicum</i> is a diderm bacterium extensively used in the industrial-scale production of amino acids. Corynebacteria belong to the bacterial family <i>Mycobacteriaceae</i>, which is characterized by a highly unusual cell envelope with an outer membrane consisting of mycolic acids, called mycomembrane. The mycomembrane is further coated by a surface (S-)layer array in <i>C. glutamicum</i>, making this cell envelope highly distinctive. Despite the biotechnological significance of <i>C. glutamicum</i> and biomedical significance of mycomembrane-containing pathogens, ultrastructural and molecular details of its distinctive cell envelope remain poorly characterized. To address this, we investigated the cell envelope of <i>C. glutamicum</i> using electron cryotomography and cryomicroscopy of focused ion beam-milled single and dividing cells. Our cellular imaging allowed us to map the different components of the cell envelope onto the tomographic density. Our data reveal that <i>C. glutamicum</i> has a variable cell envelope, with the S-layer decorating the mycomembrane in a patchy manner. We further isolated and resolved the structure of the S-layer at 3.1 Å-resolution using single particle electron cryomicroscopy. Our structure shows that the S-layer of <i>C. glutamicum</i> is composed of a hexagonal array of the PS2 protein, which interacts directly with the mycomembrane via an anchoring segment containing a coiled-coil motif. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that the PS2 S-layer is sparsely yet exclusively present within the <i>Corynebacterium</i> genus and absent in other genera of the <i>Mycobacteriaceae</i> family, suggesting distinct evolutionary pathways in the development of their cell envelopes. Our structural and cellular data collectively provide a topography of the unusual <i>C. glutamicum</i> cell surface, features of which are shared by many pathogenic and microbiome-associated bacteria, as well as by several industrially significant bacterial species.

Hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCAR1), also known as lactate receptor or GPR81, is a class A G-protein-coupled receptor with key roles in regulating lipid metabolism, neuroprotection, angiogenesis, cardiovascular function, and inflammatory response in humans. HCAR1 is highly expressed in numerous types of cancer cells, where it participates in controlling cancer cell metabolism and defense mechanisms, rendering it an appealing target for cancer therapy. However, the molecular basis of HCAR1-mediated signaling remains poorly understood. Here, we report four cryo-EM structures of human HCAR1 and HCAR2 in complex with the Gi1 protein, in which HCAR1 binds to the subtype-specific agonist CHBA (3.16 Å) and apo form (3.36 Å), and HCAR2 binds to the subtype-specific agonists MK-1903 (2.68 Å) and SCH900271 (3.06 Å). Combined with mutagenesis and cellular functional assays, we elucidate the mechanisms underlying ligand recognition, receptor activation, and G protein coupling of HCAR1. More importantly, the key residues that determine ligand selectivity between HCAR1 and HCAR2 are clarified. On this basis, we further summarize the structural features of agonists that match the orthosteric pockets of HCAR1 and HCAR2. These structural insights are anticipated to greatly accelerate the development of novel HCAR1-targeted drugs, offering a promising avenue for the treatment of various diseases.

                <p>by Douglas C. Sloan, Yini Liao, Forest Ray, Brian S. Muntean</p>

G proteins (Gα and Gβγ subtypes) drive adenylyl cyclase type 5 (AC5) synthesis of cAMP in striatal neurons, which is essential for motor coordination. KCTD5 directly interacts with Gβγ to delimit signaling events, yet downstream impact of KCTD5 in striatal circuits is not known. Here, generation of a conditional <i>Kctd5</i> knockout mouse identified that loss of striatal KCTD5 leads to a dystonic phenotype, coordination deficits, and skewed transitions between behavioral syllables. 2-photon imaging of a cAMP biosensor revealed electrically evoked dopaminergic responses were significantly augmented in the absence of KCTD5 in striatal circuits. cAMP sensitization was rescued in situ by expression of Gβγ-scavenging nanobody and motor deficits were partially rescued in vivo by pharmacological antagonism of the indirect striatal cAMP pathway. Therefore, KCTD5 acts as a brake on cAMP signaling in striatal neurons important for tuning dopaminergic signaling and motor coordination.

Multiple viruses that are highly pathogenic in humans are known to have evolved in bats. How bats tolerate infection with these viruses, however, is poorly understood. As viruses engage in a wide range of interactions with their hosts, it is essential to study bat viruses in a system that resembles their natural environment like bat-derived in vitro cellular models. However, stable and accessible bat cell lines are not widely available for the broader scientific community. Here, we generated in vitro reagents for the Seba’s short-tailed bat (<i>Carollia perspicillata</i>), tested multiple methods of immortalization, and characterized their susceptibility to virus infection and response to immune stimulation. Using pseudotyped virus library and authentic virus infections, we show that these <i>C. perspicillata</i> cell lines derived from a diverse array of tissues are susceptible to viruses bearing the glycoprotein of numerous orthohantaviruses, including Andes and Hantaan virus and are also susceptible to live hantavirus infection. Furthermore, stimulation with synthetic double-stranded RNA prior to infection with vesicular stomatitis virus and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus induced a protective antiviral response, demonstrating the suitability of our cell lines to study the bat antiviral immune response. Taken together, the approaches outlined here will inform future efforts to develop in vitro tools for virology from non-model organisms and these <i>C. perspicillata</i> cell lines will enable studies on virus–host interactions in these bats.

Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) is a pore-forming toxin secreted by <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> strains that cause severe infections. Bicomponent PVL kills phagocytes depending on cell surface receptors, such as complement 5a receptor 1 (C5aR1). How the PVL-receptor interaction enables assembly of the leukocidin complex, targeting of membranes, and insertion of a pore channel remains incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that PVL binds the anionic phospholipids, phosphatidic acid, and cardiolipin, under acidic conditions and targets lipid bilayers that mimic lysosomal and mitochondrial membranes, but not the plasma membrane. The PVL–lipid interaction was sufficient to enable leukocidin complex formation as determined by neutron reflectometry and the rupture of model membranes, independent of protein receptors. In phagocytes, PVL and its C5aR1 receptor were internalized depending on sphingomyelin and cholesterol, which were dispensable for the interaction of the toxin with the plasma membrane. Internalized PVL compromised the integrity of lysosomes and mitochondria before plasma membrane rupture. Preventing the acidification of organelles or the genetic loss of PVL impaired the escape of intracellular <i>S. aureus</i> from macrophages. Together, the findings advance our understanding of how an <i>S. aureus</i> toxin kills host cells and provide key insights into how leukocidins target membranes.

The regeneration of myelin in the central nervous system (CNS) reinstates nerve health and function, yet its decreased efficiency with aging and progression of neurodegenerative disease contributes to axonal loss and/or degeneration. Although CNS myeloid cells have been implicated in regulating the efficiency of remyelination, the distinct contribution of blood monocytes versus that of resident microglia is unclear. Here, we reveal that monocytes have non-redundant functions compared to microglia in regulating remyelination. Using a transgenic mouse in which classical monocytes have reduced egress from bone marrow (<i>Ccr2</i><sup>−/−</sup>), we demonstrate that monocytes drive the timely onset of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin protein expression, yet impede myelin production. Ribonucleic acid sequencing revealed a Wnt signature in wild-type mouse lesion monocytes, which was confirmed in monocytes from multiple sclerosis white matter lesions and blood. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Wnt release by monocytes increased remyelination. Our findings reveal monocytes to be critical regulators of remyelination and identify monocytic Wnt signaling as a promising therapeutic target to inhibit for increased efficiency of CNS regeneration.

                <p>by Christina M. Homer, Mark Voorhies, Keith Walcott, Elena Ochoa, Anita Sil</p>

<i>Coccidioides spp</i>. are highly understudied but significant dimorphic fungal pathogens that can infect both immunocompetent and immunocompromised people. In the environment, they grow as multicellular filaments (hyphae) that produce vegetative spores called arthroconidia. Upon inhalation by mammals, arthroconidia undergo a process called spherulation. They enlarge and undergo numerous nuclear divisions to form a spherical structure, and then internally segment until the spherule is filled with multiple cells called endospores. Mature spherules rupture and release endospores, each of which can form another spherule, in a process thought to facilitate dissemination. Spherulation is unique to <i>Coccidioides</i>, and its molecular determinants remain largely unknown. Here, we report the first high-density transcriptomic analyses of <i>Coccidioides</i> development, defining morphology-dependent transcripts and those whose expression is regulated by <i>RYP1</i>, a major regulator required for spherulation and virulence. Of approximately 9,000 predicted transcripts, we discovered 273 transcripts with consistent spherule-associated expression, 82 of which are <i>RYP1</i>-dependent, a set likely to be critical for <i>Coccidioides</i> virulence. ChIP-Seq revealed two distinct regulons of <i>RYP1</i>: one shared between hyphae and spherules and the other unique to spherules. Spherulation regulation was elaborate, with the majority of 227 predicted transcription factors in <i>Coccidioides</i> displaying spherule-enriched expression. We identified provocative targets, including 20 transcripts whose expression is endospore-enriched and 14 putative secreted effectors whose expression is spherule-enriched, of which six are secreted proteases. To highlight the utility of these data, we selected a cluster of <i>RYP1</i>-dependent, arthroconidia-associated transcripts and found that they play a role in arthroconidia cell wall biology, demonstrating the power of this resource in illuminating <i>Coccidioides</i> biology and virulence.

                Background The Indonesian National Data for 2023 shows that the proportion of older adults has reached 11.75%. The Indonesian retirement age is the lowest in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries: 56 or 58. To extend the retirement age, attention must be paid to the elderly population so that they remain healthy and productive. Therefore, this study aims to examine the health conditions of pre-retirement Indonesian workers and compare them to those of workers in urban and rural areas. Methods It used the Indonesian Health Survey 2023 (Survei Kesehatan Indonesia 2023), which comprised 103,730 respondents aged 50–58. A t-test analysis was used to determine the difference between any two categories of data, and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for more than two categories. Results The analysis found that male workers in urban areas were 1.087 times more than male workers in rural areas (95% CI: 1.061–1.114). Moreover, the chronic diseases identified are different, namely cancer and diabetes mellitus (DM), which are more common in urban areas, with 1,954 and 1,719 more cases than in urban areas (95% CI: 1.5–2.53 and 1.617–1.827, respectively). Meanwhile, mental disorders in urban workers were significantly higher than in rural areas (95% CI: 1.09–2.46). Conclusion This study indicates that conditions such as cancer, diabetes and mental disorders are found among pre-retirement workers more frequently in urban areas than in rural areas.

                Background Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected tropical disease endemic to Latin America, has emerged as a global health concern due to the migration of infected individuals. With its epidemiological complexity, by difficulty to obtain appropriate diagnoses and poor treatment, the search for novel therapeutic options remains. Methods In this context, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of preclinical studies employing animal models to verify the progress in CD treatment. We searched the PubMed database for CD treatment studies published between 1990 and 2023, adhering to the PRISMA guidelines. Results Twelve papers met the inclusion criteria. The findings indicate that the fifteen treatment alternatives examined, mainly between 2010 and 2014, demonstrated efficacy in experimental CD models, evidenced by significant parasitemia reduction. Bis-triazole DO870 and VNI were effective in the acute and chronic phases, respectively. However, of these emerging therapies, only posaconazole and fexinidazole have progressed to clinical trials, yielding unsatisfactory outcomes as CD monotherapies Conclusions This meta-analysis highlights the existence of promising new drug candidates for CD treatment, but most remain in the preclinical stages. Those that reached clinical trials did not demonstrate optimal results, underscoring the ongoing challenges in CD therapy. Collaborative efforts among the academic community, pharmaceutical industries, funding agencies, and government agencies are urgently needed to accelerate the development of more effective medications against CD.

                Background People with dementia have a yearly risk of falling of 60 to 80 percent. Therefore, a walker is often recommended. However, the use of a walker in people with dementia is associated with a threefold increased odds of falls compared to their healthy peers who walk with a walker. Better advice and training could reduce fall risk. Therefore, a tool to assess functional walking skills with a walker is needed. The SUMAC was developed to fill this gap. So far, there is no Dutch instrument available that can assess functional walking skills with a walker in people with dementia. Methods Reliability was evaluated by scoring videos of people with dementia (n = 9) using a walker performing the SUMAC-NL. ICC was used to assess inter-rater and test-retest reliability. An expert panel (n = 8) evaluated the content validity using the content validity index (CVI) and the content validity ratio (CVR). Results Inter-rater reliability of the SUMAC-NL was statistically significant for the physical function (PF) domain (ICC = 0.94, 95%CI (0.84, 0.98, p < 0.001) and for the interaction with equipment (EQ) domain (ICC = 0.79, 95%CI (0.49 – 0.95), p < 0.001). Test-retest reliability was statistically significant for both the PF domain (ICC = 0.95, 95%CI (0.89, 0.99), p < 0.001) and EQ domain (ICC = 0.92, 95%CI (0.82, 0.98), p < 0.001). The SUMAC-NL shows content validity with a CVI >0.79 for both domains and a CVR of 0.53 on the PF domain and 0.78 on the EQ domain. Conclusions The SUMAC-NL shows good to excellent reliability and content validity for both the PF and the EQ domain. The SUMAC-NL seems to be a promising tool to assess walking with a walker in people with dementia in the Netherlands.

                Background At the 2020 UN General Assembly, China pledged to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. However, the traditional social development model has led to increasing carbon emissions annually, highlighting the need to resolve the contradiction between development and carbon reduction. This study examines the relationship between carbon emissions, economy, population, and energy consumption in a specific region to support carbon peak and neutrality goals. Methods A comprehensive indicator system was established, encompassing economic, population, energy consumption, and carbon emissions indicators. The study analyzed these factors during the 12th and 13th Five Year Plans, comparing total carbon emissions in 2010 and across the plans, and assessing trends. It also comprehensively analyzed the relationships and mutual influences among these factors. The study identified the main challenges in achieving carbon peak and neutrality. Using the Kaya model and various factor models, it calculated carbon peak times for three scenarios: baseline (2022), natural (2036), and ambitious (2021). These findings provide a basis for dual carbon path planning. Result The research results indicate that carbon emissions are closely related to the economy, population, and energy consumption. The prediction shows that the future trend of carbon emissions is controllable. Suggestions for dual carbon path planning are proposed to provide empirical basis for policy formulation. Under the baseline scenario, the peak carbon emissions are expected to occur around 2022; Under natural circumstances, the peak carbon emissions will be postponed to 2036; In the ambitious scenario, the carbon peak time can be advanced to 2021. Conclusion The research results are crucial for achieving carbon reduction targets and sustainable development and can be used to formulate targeted policies to promote regional development and support China's carbon neutrality commitments.

                Background With the rapid advancement of information and communication technologies (ICT), our society has entered the era of widespread internet and mobile communications, promoting the emergence of precision push services on mobile phones. Objective The purpose of this study is to investigate users' perception of mobile phone precision push services, and to evaluate their effectiveness and overall impact. Methods This study initially clarifies the working principle of precision push services, focusing on user information modeling and mathematical prediction methods to achieve personalized information delivery. Using a questionnaire survey targeting college students, this paper analyzes five factors hypothesized to influence user perceptions: the effectiveness of pushed information, interference with user experience, operability, user autonomy, and transparency of information. A total of 64 valid questionnaires were collected for statistical analysis, including demographic characteristics, reliability and validity tests, and difference and correlation analyses. Results The results indicate that users rated "user autonomy" highest, reflecting their strong preference for receiving tailored content such as industry news, trends, and event notifications. Significant gender differences were observed in terms of operability, while geographic location had minimal impact on user perceptions. Additionally, the effectiveness of precision push services showed a negative correlation with their perceived overall impact. Conclusion Consequently, this study recommends enhancing precision push services by prioritizing personalized user needs, particularly by delivering industry-specific information and timely event reminders to improve user engagement and satisfaction.

                Background There have been some discrepancies between Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) and Total Fertility Rate (TFR) in Ghana over the years which we examined in this study. Methods We adopted a repeated cross-sectional study design to examine the relationship between Ghana’s CPR and TFR using data from 1988 to 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys (GDHS). Results Our findings show that TFR declined from 6.4 to 4.2 births per woman between 1988 and 2014. Bivariate models fitted revealed that between 1988 and 2014, women using contraceptives had higher prospects of bearing more children than women not using contraceptives. This manifested in 1988 (IRR=1.16, 95% CI=1.11, 1.22) and 2014 (IRR=1.20, 95% CI=1.12, 1.29). The multivariable Poisson regression models also showed the same patterns in all the surveys including the 1988 GDHS (IRR=1.12, 95% CI=1.09,1.19) and 2014 (1RR=1.13,95% CI=1.09,1.17). Contrary to earlier studies reports, and common perceptions held by stakeholders in family planning that there is an inverse relationship between CPR and TFR in Ghana, we did not find any such inverse relationship between CPR and TFR in Ghana during the period under review. Conclusions Based on our findings we believe, contraception alone does not guarantee low fertility in Ghana, hence we recommend a qualitative study to further investigate the plausible factors behind our results/observations from this current study to inform policy and program decisions.

                This case report presents a complex case of a 65-year-old female with a history of hypertension and a family history of polycystic kidney disease and Fabry disease presented with acute pancreatitis and subsequent renal insufficiency. Despite initial corticosteroid therapy for immuno-allergic nephropathy, the patient’s condition deteriorated with the development of a skin rash, uremic syndrome, and neurological symptoms. A renal biopsy revealed cellular crescents and cytoplasmic vacuolization in podocytes and tubular cells. Genetic testing confirmed a GLA gene mutation, consistent with Fabry disease. While undergoing treatment with cyclophosphamide, the patient experienced severe allergic reactions, ultimately leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and fatal outcome. Despite the Fabry disease variant being primarily associated with cardiac involvement, renal involvement was evident. This case highlights the rarity of this co-occurrence, the diagnostic challenges, the importance of genetic factors in autoimmune kidney diseases, and the impact of drug allergies on patient management.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-435/v1?src=rss">Mobile health interventions for substance use reduction: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Substance use disorders often emerge during adolescence or early adulthood, posing significant physical and mental health risks. Young adults, however, frequently face barriers to treatment, such as stigma, high costs, and a lack of services tailored to their needs. mHealth interventions, leveraging widely accessible digital platforms, offer an innovative, evidence-based approach to addressing substance use in this vulnerable demographic. This review evaluates the effectiveness of mHealth interventions in reducing substance use among young adult students in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). A comprehensive search of PubMed, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, Google, and Google Scholar identified relevant studies from 1991 onward, focusing on students aged 16–25. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane EPOC and JBI checklists, with independent screening and data extraction by two reviewers. Of 153 records screened, five studies met inclusion criteria, exploring mHealth tools such as instant messaging apps, mobile applications, Telegram, and SMS. These interventions demonstrated feasibility, high engagement, and effectiveness in reducing alcohol and smoking behaviors. This review examines behavioral change techniques, psychometric properties, and intervention strategies, alongside factors influencing effectiveness, intervention characteristics, and methodological and contextual challenges. Behavioral models such as the Health Belief Model and Social Cognitive Theory supported the delivery of personalized, interactive content. Overall, mHealth interventions show promise in reducing substance use among young adults in LMICs, though further large-scale, rigorous trials are necessary to validate these findings and assess their scalability.

                Maintaining short-term planning aligned with the ultimate long-term plan is challenging. This requires many details to be modelled on a daily or weekly basis to reach this target. Short-term planning is more challenging than medium- and long-term planning because it deals with daily challenges with block model changes, mining cut polygons variation, which increases the gap between medium- and long-term plans for each material to be mined. Short-term mine planning teams are expected to identify and manage potential risks to mitigate them, and eventually achieve the long-term objective of maximizing the Net Present Value (NPV). Very few studies have identified the problems that exist in short-term mine planning and provided technical solutions to overcome them for open-pit mines. One of the complexities associated with short-term planning is the creation of polygons or mining cuts by clustering before optimizing and scheduling the plan to reduce the computational expense of mine planning models. The primary objective of this study is to review the latest papers describing short-term mine planning challenges and technical solutions proposed to optimize mine planning for open-pit mines.

                Background Cervical cancer poses a significant public health challenge, particularly in low and middle-income countries. Despite advancements in treatment, the disease remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women globally. Chemoradiation utilizing cisplatin has been the cornerstone therapy for locally advanced cervical cancer. Prognostic biomarkers, including hematological parameters, have emerged as valuable tools in guiding treatment decisions and predicting outcomes. Methodology Data from patients treated between January 2021 and June 2022 were analyzed. Demographic information, histopathology, pre-treatment blood parameters, treatment details, and response assessments were collected. The parameters assessed included hemoglobin levels, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and eosinophil albumin ratio (EAR). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to determine optimal cut-off values for these biomarkers. Results Of the 140 patients included, the majority had squamous cell carcinoma (92%) and were at stage II or III. Complete response to treatment was observed in 86.4% of patients. Non-responders demonstrated significantly higher levels of hemoglobin, NLR, and EAR, along with lower PNI levels compared to responders. ROC analysis revealed cut-off values for hemoglobin (< 9.5), NLR (< 2.98), PLR (> 289.26), PNI (< 37.67), and EAR (< 49.63) associated with treatment response. Conclusion The study highlights the potential utility of pre-treatment blood parameters as predictive markers for treatment response in locally advanced cervical cancer. Lower hemoglobin, higher NLR, and EAR, along with reduced PNI, were associated with poorer treatment outcomes. Integration of these biomarkers into clinical practice could aid in treatment planning and improve patient outcomes. Further validation and prospective studies are warranted to establish the role of these biomarkers in guiding personalized treatment strategies for cervical cancer patients.

                Gallbladder tuberculosis (GTB) is extremely rare, accounting for less than 1% of all TB cases. We present a 62-year-old woman in whom the diagnosis of GTB was made pre-operatively by percutaneous biopsy. The patient was put on antitubercular treatment for six months. The control CT scan showed an almost disappearance of the gallbladder mass leaving a discreet wall thickening. Because of the presence of stones in the gallbladder the patient was operated she had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Primary tuberculosis of the gallbladder is a rare and elusive condition that can be easily misdiagnosed due to its nonspecific clinical presentation. Early diagnosis and appropriate anti-tubercular therapy are crucial for successful management and prevention of further complications.

                <p>Scientific Data, Published online: 15 April 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04820-4">doi:10.1038/s41597-025-04820-4</a></p>Research software has become indispensable in contemporary research and is now viewed as essential infrastructure in many scholarly fields. Encompassing source code, algorithms, scripts, computational workflows, and executables generated during or specifically for research, it plays a critical role in advancing scholarly knowledge. The research software field includes considerable open-source use and links to the broader open science movement. In this context, it has been argued that the well-established FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles for research data should be adapted for research software under the label FAIR4RS. However, the level of uptake of FAIR4RS principles is unclear. To gauge FAIR4RS’s status, international research funders involved in supporting research software (n = 36) were surveyed about their awareness of the concept. The survey reveals much greater familiarity with the more established FAIR principles for data (73% ‘extremely familiar’) than FAIR4RS (33% ‘extremely familiar’). Nevertheless, there is still considerable recognition of the relatively new FAIR4RS concept, a significant achievement for efforts to extend open science policies and practices to encompass research software.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105393">Coevolutionary interplay: Helminths-trained immunity and its impact on the rise of inflammatory diseases</a></h4>

              
                The gut biome, a complex ecosystem of micro- and macro-organisms, plays a crucial role in human health. A disruption in this evolutive balance, particularly during early life, can lead to immune dysregulation and inflammatory disorders. ‘Biome repletion’ has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach, introducing live microbes or helminth-derived products to restore immune balance. While helminth therapy has shown some promise, significant challenges remain in optimizing clinical trials. Factors such as patient genetics, disease status, helminth species, and the optimal timing and dosage of their products or metabolites must be carefully considered to train the immune system effectively. We aim to discuss how helminths and their products induce trained immunity as prospective to treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The molecular repertoire of helminth excretory/secretory products (ESPs), which includes proteins, peptides, lipids, and RNA-carrying extracellular vesicles (EVs), underscores their potential to modulate innate immune cells and hematopoietic stem cell precursors. Mimicking natural delivery mechanisms like synthetic exosomes could revolutionize EV-based therapies and optimizing production and delivery of ESP will be crucial for their translation into clinical applications. By deciphering and harnessing helminth-derived products’ diverse modes of action, we can unleash their full therapeutic potential and pave the way for innovative treatments.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101841">Neural mechanisms of credit assignment for delayed outcomes during contingent learning</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive behavior in complex environments critically relies on the ability to appropriately link specific choices or actions to their outcomes. However, the neural mechanisms that support the ability to credit only those past choices believed to have caused the observed outcomes remain unclear. Here, we leverage multivariate pattern analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and an adaptive learning task to shed light on the underlying neural mechanisms of such specific credit assignment. We find that the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) and hippocampus (HC) code for the causal choice identity when credit needs to be assigned for choices that are separated from outcomes by a long delay, even when this delayed transition is punctuated by interim decisions. Further, we show when interim decisions must be made, learning is additionally supported by lateral frontopolar cortex (lFPC). Our results indicate that lFPC holds previous causal choices in a ‘pending’ state until a relevant outcome is observed, and the fidelity of these representations predicts the fidelity of subsequent causal choice representations in lOFC and HC during credit assignment. Together, these results highlight the importance of the timely reinstatement of specific causes in lOFC and HC in learning choice-outcome relationships when delays and choices intervene, a critical component of real-world learning and decision making.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100098">Distinct activation mechanisms of CXCR4 and ACKR3 revealed by single-molecule analysis of their conformational landscapes</a></h4>

              
                The canonical chemokine receptor CXCR4 and atypical receptor ACKR3 both respond to CXCL12 but induce different effector responses to regulate cell migration. While CXCR4 couples to G proteins and directly promotes cell migration, ACKR3 is G-protein-independent and scavenges CXCL12 to regulate extracellular chemokine levels and maintain CXCR4 responsiveness, thereby indirectly influencing migration. The receptors also have distinct activation requirements. CXCR4 only responds to wild-type CXCL12 and is sensitive to mutation of the chemokine. By contrast, ACKR3 recruits GPCR kinases (GRKs) and β-arrestins and promiscuously responds to CXCL12, CXCL12 variants, other peptides and proteins, and is relatively insensitive to mutation. To investigate the role of conformational dynamics in the distinct pharmacological behaviors of CXCR4 and ACKR3, we employed single-molecule FRET to track discrete conformational states of the receptors in real-time. The data revealed that apo-CXCR4 preferentially populates a high-FRET inactive state, while apo-ACKR3 shows little conformational preference and high transition probabilities among multiple inactive, intermediate and active conformations, consistent with its propensity for activation. Multiple active-like ACKR3 conformations are populated in response to agonists, compared to the single CXCR4 active-state. This and the markedly different conformational landscapes of the receptors suggest that activation of ACKR3 may be achieved by a broader distribution of conformational states than CXCR4. Much of the conformational heterogeneity of ACKR3 is linked to a single residue that differs between ACKR3 and CXCR4. The dynamic properties of ACKR3 may underly its inability to form productive interactions with G proteins that would drive canonical GPCR signaling.

                Animals navigate the auditory world by recognizing complex sounds, from the rustle of a predator to the call of a potential mate. This ability depends in part on the octopus cells of the auditory brainstem, which respond to multiple frequencies that change over time, as occurs in natural stimuli. Unlike the average neuron, which integrates inputs over time on the order of tens of milliseconds, octopus cells must detect momentary coincidence of excitatory inputs from the cochlea during an ongoing sound on both the millisecond and submillisecond time scale. Here, we show that octopus cells receive inhibitory inputs on their dendrites that enhance opportunities for coincidence detection in the cell body, thereby allowing for responses both to rapid onsets at the beginning of a sound and to frequency modulations during the sound. This mechanism is crucial for the fundamental process of integrating the synchronized frequencies of natural auditory signals over time.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105013">Non-allometric expansion and enhanced compartmentalization of Purkinje cell dendrites in the human cerebellum</a></h4>

              
                Purkinje cell (PC) dendrites are optimized to integrate the vast cerebellar input array and drive the sole cortical output. PCs are classically seen as stereotypical computational units, yet mouse PCs are morphologically diverse and those with multi-branched structure can receive non-canonical climbing fiber (CF) multi-innervation that confers independent compartment-specific signaling. While otherwise uncharacterized, human PCs are universally multi-branched. Do they exceed allometry to achieve enhanced integrative capacities relative to mouse PCs? To answer this, we used several comparative histology techniques in adult human and mouse to analyze cellular morphology, parallel fiber (PF) and CF input arrangement, and regional PC demographics. Human PCs are substantially larger than previously described; they exceed allometric constraint by cortical thickness and are the largest neuron in the brain with 6–7 cm total dendritic length. Unlike mouse, human PC dendrites ramify horizontally to form a multi-compartment motif that we show can receive multiple CFs. Human spines are denser (6.9 vs 4.9 spines/μm), larger (~0.36 vs 0.29 μm), and include an unreported ‘spine cluster’ structure—features that may be congruent with enhanced PF association and amplification as human-specific adaptations. By extrapolation, human PCs may receive 500,000 to 1 million synaptic inputs compared with 30–40,000 in mouse. Collectively, human PC morphology and input arrangement is quantitatively and qualitatively distinct from rodent. Multi-branched PCs are more prevalent in posterior and lateral cerebellum, co-varying with functional boundaries, supporting the hypothesis that this morphological motif permits expanded input multiplexing and may subserve task-dependent needs for input association.

                In autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D), immune cells infiltrate and destroy the islets of Langerhans — islands of endocrine tissue dispersed throughout the pancreas. However, the contribution of cellular programs outside islets to insulitis is unclear. Here, using CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX) tissue imaging and cadaveric pancreas samples, we simultaneously examine islet and extra-islet inflammation in human T1D. We identify four sub-states of inflamed islets characterized by the activation profiles of CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells enriched in islets relative to the surrounding tissue. We further find that the extra-islet space of lobules with extensive islet-infiltration differs from the extra-islet space of less infiltrated areas within the same tissue section. Finally, we identify lymphoid structures away from islets enriched in CD45RA<sup>+</sup> T cells — a population also enriched in one of the inflamed islet sub-states. Together, these data help define the coordination between islets and the extra-islet pancreas in the pathogenesis of human T1D.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91528">Dynamics of transcriptional programs and chromatin accessibility in mouse spermatogonial cells from early postnatal to adult life</a></h4>

              
                In mammals, spermatogonial cells (SPGs) are undifferentiated male germ cells in testis that are quiescent until birth and then self-renew and differentiate to produce spermatogenic cells and functional sperm from early postnatal life throughout adulthood. The transcriptome of SPGs is highly dynamic and timely regulated during postnatal development. We examined if such dynamics involves changes in chromatin organization by profiling the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility of SPGs from early postnatal stages to adulthood in mice using deep RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and computational deconvolution analyses. By integrating transcriptomic and epigenomic features, we show that SPGs undergo massive chromatin remodeling during postnatal development that partially correlates with distinct gene expression profiles and transcription factors (TF) motif enrichment. We identify genomic regions with significantly different chromatin accessibility in adult SPGs that are marked by histone modifications associated with enhancers and promoters. Some of the regions with increased accessibility correspond to transposable element subtypes enriched in multiple TFs motifs and close to differentially expressed genes. Our results underscore the dynamics of chromatin organization in developing germ cells and complement existing datasets on SPGs by providing maps of the regulatory genome at high resolution from the same cell populations at early postnatal, late postnatal and adult stages collected from single individuals.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103888">Sex-specific attenuation of photoreceptor degeneration by reserpine in a rhodopsin P23H rat model of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa</a></h4>

              
                Inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) constitute a group of clinically and genetically diverse vision-impairing disorders. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), the most common form of IRD, is characterized by gradual dysfunction and degeneration of rod photoreceptors, followed by the loss of cone photoreceptors. Recently, we identified reserpine as a lead molecule for maintaining rod survival in mouse and human retinal organoids as well as in the <i>rd16</i> mouse, which phenocopy Leber congenital amaurosis caused by mutations in the cilia-centrosomal gene <i>CEP290</i> (Chen et al., 2023). Here, we show the therapeutic potential of reserpine in a rhodopsin P23H rat model of autosomal dominant RP. At postnatal day (P) 68, when males and females are analyzed together, the reserpine-treated rats exhibit higher rod-derived scotopic b-wave amplitudes compared to the controls with little or no change in scotopic a-wave or cone-derived photopic b-wave. Interestingly, the reserpine-treated female rats display enhanced scotopic a- and b-waves and photopic b-wave responses at P68, along with a better contrast threshold and increased outer nuclear layer thickness. The female rats demonstrate better preservation of both rod and cone photoreceptors following reserpine treatment. Retinal transcriptome analysis reveals sex-specific responses to reserpine, with significant upregulation of phototransduction genes and proteostasis-related pathways, and notably, genes associated with stress response. This study builds upon our previously reported results reaffirming the potential of reserpine for gene-agnostic treatment of IRDs and emphasizes the importance of biological sex in retinal disease research and therapy development.

                The endothelial blood-brain barrier (BBB) strictly controls immune cell trafficking into the central nervous system (CNS). In neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis, this tight control is, however, disturbed, leading to immune cell infiltration into the CNS. The development of in vitro models of the BBB combined with microfluidic devices has advanced our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating the multistep T-cell extravasation across the BBB. A major bottleneck of these in vitro studies is the absence of a robust and automated pipeline suitable for analyzing and quantifying the sequential interaction steps of different immune cell subsets with the BBB under physiological flow in vitro. Here, we present the under-flow migration tracker (<sup>UFM</sup>Track) framework for studying immune cell interactions with endothelial monolayers under physiological flow. We then showcase a pipeline built based on it to study the entire multistep extravasation cascade of immune cells across brain microvascular endothelial cells under physiological flow in vitro. <sup>UFM</sup>Track achieves 90% track reconstruction efficiency and allows for scaling due to the reduction of the analysis cost and by eliminating experimenter bias. This allowed for an in-depth analysis of all behavioral regimes involved in the multistep immune cell extravasation cascade. The study summarizes how <sup>UFM</sup>Track can be employed to delineate the interactions of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with the BBB under physiological flow. We also demonstrate its applicability to the other BBB models, showcasing broader applicability of the developed framework to a range of immune cell-endothelial monolayer interaction studies. The <sup>UFM</sup>Track framework along with the generated datasets is publicly available in the corresponding repositories.

                Infection with the protozoan parasite <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> is generally well-controlled by host immune responses, but appears to be rarely eliminated. The resulting persistent, low-level infection results in cumulative tissue damage with the greatest impact generally in the heart in the form of chagasic cardiomyopathy. The relative success in immune control of <i>T. cruzi</i> infection usually averts acute phase death but has the negative consequence that the low-level presence of <i>T. cruzi</i> in hosts is challenging to detect unequivocally. Thus, it is difficult to identify those who are actively infected and, as well, problematic to gauge the impact of treatment, particularly in the evaluation of the relative efficacy of new drugs. In this study, we employ DNA fragmentation and high numbers of replicate PCR reaction (‘deep-sampling’) and to extend the quantitative range of detecting <i>T. cruzi</i> in blood by at least three orders of magnitude relative to current protocols. When combined with sampling blood at multiple time points, deep sampling of fragmented DNA allowed for detection of <i>T. cruzi</i> in all infected hosts in multiple host species, including humans, macaques, and dogs. In addition, we provide evidence for a number of characteristics not previously rigorously quantified in the population of hosts with naturally acquired <i>T. cruzi</i> infection, including, a &gt;6 log variation between chronically infected individuals in the stable parasite levels, a continuing decline in parasite load during the second and third years of infection in some hosts, and the potential for parasite load to change dramatically when health conditions change. Although requiring strict adherence to contamination–prevention protocols and significant resources, deep-sampling PCR provides an important new tool for assessing therapies and for addressing long-standing questions in <i>T. cruzi</i> infection and Chagas disease.

">Cell type-specific associations with Alzheimer's Disease conserved across racial and ethnic groups</a></h4>

              
                Genomic studies at single-cell resolution have implicated multiple cell types associated with clinical and pathological traits in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), but have not examined common features across broad, multi-ethnic populations, and across multiple regions. To bridge this gap, we performed single-nucleus RNA-seq and ATAC-seq profiling of cortical and subcortical brain regions from post-mortem samples across Non-Latin White, African American, and Latin donors (the latter of any race). Using discrete and continuous dissection of molecular programs, we elucidate cell-type-specific glial and neuronal signatures associated with AD across multiple population groups. Notably, we found that multiple microglial (GPNMB+, CD74+, and CR1+ subgroups) and astrocyte (SERPINH1+ and WIF1+ subgroups) signatures are associated with worse clinical and pathological phenotypes across all three population groups. We also report continuous gene expression factors in oligodendrocytes that are not captured by discrete clusters, yet still show strong associations with disease phenotypes. Finally, we observe these discrete cellular identities and continuous gene programs separate cognitively impaired donors into 6 molecularly distinct subgroups that span racial and ethnic population groups. Overall, our study identifies key cell types and gene programs implicated in AD that are shared across population groups, and provides an initial data set that underscores how representative sampling can capture conserved signatures as well as disease heterogeneity, leading to better prioritization of key cell types for further investigation.

">Integration of Nanomaterials and DBS to Improve Basal Ganglia Oscillations Using Delayed Van der Pol Model</a></h4>

              
                Basal ganglia play a crucial role in motor control and the challenges posed by pathological oscillations, especially in Parkinson's disease. Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) is effective in attenuating pathological frequencies, it often leads to side effects. This study presents a comprehensive framework for understanding and improving neural oscillation dynamics by integrating nanomaterials with DBS. Nanomaterials with their controllable frequencies through length, width, and structure could stabilize oscillations and maintain normal neural frequencies. This study introduces three mathematical models: the DBS model, the nanomaterials model, and a combined model of both, which use the Van der Pol delay model to demonstrate how the periodic force and nanomaterials collaborate to stabilize brain activity. Numerical simulations indicate that DBS by itself lowers harmful frequencies but might make the motor cortex unstable because it increases the strength of signals. In contrast, the nanomaterial models reduce the amplitude and activate the motor cortex. The combination of DBS and nanomaterials significantly improves stability, reduces pathological oscillations, and decreases hyperactivity. The use of nanomaterials must be carefully monitored to ensure that they do not suppress normal neural activity, highlighting the need for experimental validation. This study provides a promising direction for the development of personalized therapeutic technologies that balance the suppression of pathological activity with the preservation of normal neural function.

">It matters who you are: Biography modulates the neural dynamics of facial identity representation</a></h4>

              
                Recognizing the face of a person is an essential capacity to our social life. However, to interact properly with others we also need to know to which person a face belongs. Here we tested how person knowledge modulates face processing. Participants were familiarized with highly variable faces, associated with artificial biographies. Crucially, participants were allocated randomly into two groups, trained on the identical faces of the same persons, but with reversed person knowledge associated with the faces. Multivariate pattern analyses were used to examine the time course of identity representations in the EEG data. We estimated cross-participant, leave-one-participant-out pairwise identity classifications within the same face-person association groups and compared them to the those performed across association groups. We observed that face-person knowledge associations led to a robust familiarity signal from 300 ms and to a rapidly emerging identity representation, starting from 80 ms. Importantly, the shared associations within participant groups led to a longer-lasting and stronger face identity representation over the right posterior electrode cluster when compared to cross-group comparisons with reversed associations. The direct comparison of within and cross-group classifications showed that an early stage of identity representation, between 250 and 370 ms, is significantly modulated by face-biography associations. Our findings suggest that top-down, person recognition memory related information modulates visual face identity representation already at an early processing stage. Our study provides new insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of how person-related conceptual, biographical knowledge modulates familiar identity representation.

">Alzheimer Disease: The proposed role of tanycytes in the formation of tau tangles and amyloid beta plaques in human brain</a></h4>

              
                Currently, the causes for Alzheimer Disease (AD) are thought to lie in the formation of abnormal protein deposits including tau tangles and Amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) plaques in the human cortex. These proteins are believed to accumulate in the brain due to impaired waste removal resulting in neurodegeneration. In an alternative hypothesis we have recently proposed the existence of an aquaporin-4 aqua channel (AQP4)-expressing tanycyte-derived canal network that likely internalizes waste for removal from the brain. We propose that both A{beta} and tau protein may play important structural roles in this canal system. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate the formation of waste-internalizing receptacles by AQP4-expressing myelinated tanycytes. Using RNA-scope in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, ultrastructural, and histological approaches, we demonstrate receptacle differentiation in tanycyte-derived 'swell-bodies.' We show that these receptacles are AQP4- and A{beta}-immunoreactive and that related gene expression is observed in 'swell-bodies' where receptacle differentiation is observed. Through correlative light- and electron-microscopy in human and mouse brain, we demonstrate that both A{beta} and tau protein are associated with these waste-internalizing structures and likely play important roles in the waste internalization process. Based on our findings, we postulate that the functional significance of A{beta} may be structural stabilization of waste-internalizing structures and canals to prevent their collapse during the uptake process. We propose that tau protein may govern the quantitatively appropriate release of waste-internalizing structures. We postulate that AD-related A{beta}-plaques and tau tangles likely show hypertrophic pathologies of this glial-canal-system and associated waste-internalizing receptacles.

">Unpacking similarity effects in visual memory search: categorical, semantic, and visual contributions</a></h4>

              
                Visual memory search involves comparing a probe item against multiple memorized items. Previous work has shown that distractor probes from a different object category than the objects in the memory set are rejected more quickly than distractor probes from the same category. Because objects belonging to the same category usually share both visual and semantic features compared with objects of different categories, it is unclear whether the category effects reported in previous studies reflected category-level selection, visual similarity, and/or semantic target-distractor similarity. Here, we employed old/new recognition tasks to examine the role of categorical, semantic, and visual similarity in short- and long-term memory search. Participants (N=64) performed visual long-term memory (LTM) or short-term memory (STM) search tasks involving animate and inanimate objects. Trial-wise RT variability to distractor probes in LTM and STM search was modelled using regression analyses that included predictors capturing categorical target-distractor similarity (same or different category), semantic target-distractor similarity (from a distributional semantic model), and visual target-distractor similarity (from a deep neural network). We found that for both memory tasks, categorical, semantic, and visual similarity all explained unique variance in trial-wise memory search performance. However, their respective contributions varied with memory set size and task, with STM performance being relatively more strongly influenced by visual and categorical similarity and LTM performance being relatively more strongly influenced by semantic similarity. These results clarify the nature of the representations used in memory search and reveal both similarities and differences between search in STM and LTM.

">Brain Signal Variability During Rest as a Neural Mechanism Underlying Cognitive Reserve</a></h4>

              
                Background: Resting-state brain signal variability has been found to vary with age and cognitive function. Neural flexibility has been suggested as a neural mechanism underlying cognitive reserve (CR), a construct that describes better than expected cognition given brain status. Thus, we examined the associations between age, resting-state brain signal variability, cognition, and CR. Method: Analysis was based on resting-state functional neuroimaging data from 470 participants (aged 20-80 years) from the Reference Ability Neural Networks and the CR studies. Brain signal variability was quantified for each brain region as the log-transformed standard deviation of the time-varying blood-oxygen-dependent (BOLD) signal. We then derived variability patterns related to age, perceptual speed, fluid reasoning, episodic memory, and vocabulary using Scaled Subprofile Modelling principal component analysis. To perform the formal test whether these patterns fulfill the requirements for CR, we examined whether they explained additional variance in cognition beyond brain status, age, sex, and education, or moderated the brain status-cognition relationship. We additionally stratified all regression models by age (cutoff: 60 years) and sex. Results: BOLD signal variability showed an age-related increase in subcortical/medial brain regions, and an age-related decrease in cortical regions. It also met the CR test for speed (standardized regression coefficient ({beta})=0.251, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.118-0.384, pFDR<0.001), episodic memory ({beta}=0.344, CI: 0.200-0.489, pFDR<0.001), reasoning ({beta}=0.316, CI: 0.197-0.436, pFDR<0.001), and vocabulary ({beta}=0.270, CI: 0.167-0.373, pFDR<0.001). Associations were stronger in women for vocabulary and in young individuals for reasoning. Conclusions: BOLD signal variability plays a role in aging and cognition and underlies CR.

">The Maternal Effect of SKN-1B and DAF-7 on Intergenerational Pathogen Avoidance Learning in C. elegans.</a></h4>

              
                Parental health strongly influences the development of embryos, and can ultimately influence behavior post-birth. When exposed to pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14), C. elegans produces a robust immune response, as well as a learned behavior to avoid PA14 in the future. This learned avoidance of PA14 can be inherited by the F1 generation. An important trigger of the worm immune response to infection is the Nrf2 homologue, SKN-1. We find that the SKN-1B isoform strongly influences the intergenerational inheritance of PA14 avoidance in F1 animals via DAF-7 (TGF-beta) signaling from ASI. Functional SKN-1B is required in both the P0 and F1 generations to facilitate F1 avoidance of PA14 due to parental exposure. While inherited avoidance of PA14 was not observed in F2+ generations, the single generation learning investigated here may provide a parallel pathway to improve the fitness of F1 animals in a dynamic environment.

">Lost in a Large EEG Multiverse? Comparing Sampling Approaches for Representative Pipeline Selection</a></h4>

              
                The multiplicity of defensible strategies for processing and analysing data has been implicated as a core contributor to the replicability crisis, creating uncertainty about the robustness of a result to variations in data processing choices. This issue is exacerbated where a large number of data processing pipelines are defensible, and where there is great heterogeneity in the pipelines applied in the literature, such as in processing and analysing electroencephalography (EEG) signals. In a multiverse analysis, equally defensible pipelines are computed and the robustness of the result to these variations is reported. However, a large number of defensible pipelines is sometimes infeasible to compute exhaustively, and researchers rely on sampling approaches. In these cases, pipelines are sampled from the full multiverse and the robustness is reported across these samples, assuming that they are representative for the entire multiverse. However, different sampling methods may yield different robustness results, introducing what we term multiverse sampling uncertainty. To illustrate, we computed a 528-pipeline multiverse analysis on EEG-recordings during an emotion classification task aiming to predict extraversion scores from the Late Positive Potential. We applied three sampling methods (random, stratified, and active learning) to sample 26 pipelines (5%), and evaluated the results in terms of the representativeness of the distribution of model fits to that of the full multiverse. Our results highlight variability in the representativeness of the distribution of model fits between samples. The active learning sample most closely represented the median model fit of the full multiverse. The need for representative pipeline sampling to mitigate bias in large multiverse analyses is discussed.

">CLOOSE: An open-source platform for optical closed-loop experiments</a></h4>

              
                Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) have catalyzed advancements in both clinical applications and basic neuroscience research. However, technical barriers such as steep learning curves and complex synchronization requirements often impede their widespread adoption. In response to the increasing demand for optical BCI experiments and to the technical challenges associated with their implementation, we introduce CLOOSE (Closed loop Optical Open-Source Experiments), a versatile platform designed to standardize, simplify, and accelerate closed-loop experiments with functional imaging data. CLOOSE interfaces easily with any frame-based imaging system via TCP/IP, allowing for real-time data streaming and distributed computation. Benchmark tests validate CLOOSE real-time accuracy in image registration, signal processing, and analysis at 1 kHz imaging frequencies, making it the first optical BCI compatible with voltage indicators. Throughout the paper we showcase CLOOSE versatility in supporting several neurofeedback paradigms: from single neuron to population dynamics, multiplane imaging, and online (and offline) z-tracking. CLOOSE functionality is easily accessible to users with minimal coding experience through an intuitive graphical interface for experiment setup and real-time performance monitoring. By significantly lowering the barrier to performing technically demanding closed-loop experiments, CLOOSE advances the streamlining, standardization, and democratization of online image analysis and eurofeedback BCI paradigms, opening new avenues for precise manipulation and real-time readout of neuronal activity in health and disease.

">Superior colliculus coordinates whole-brain dynamics for sudden unconscious visual insight</a></h4>

              
                Recognition of Mooney images, highly degraded black-and-white stimuli, provides a classic paradigm for studying unconscious, sudden generative insight often accompanied by a "Eureka!" experience. This spontaneous recognition is believed to rely on top-down modulation by widespread cortical networks, a conclusion primarily drawn from contrasts between recognition and non-recognition. However, how the brain transitions from non-recognition to recognition remains unclear, particularly regarding the role of non-cortical regions such as the midbrain superior colliculus. Here we show that this transition can be captured by three data-driven large-scale functional clusters, reflecting stimulus-driven activation, suppression, and recognition-associated dynamics. Within these whole-brain dynamics, the superior colliculus displayed a distinct activation peak just before the behavioral response indicating recognition, and was the only region exhibiting mutual positive interactions with all three clusters. Although the superior colliculus has been recognized as a key node in binary perceptual decision-making in non-human primates, its contribution to human insight has remained largely unexplored. Our findings suggest that the superior colliculus coordinates large-scale neural activity for unconscious generative insight, revealing that evolutionarily conserved non-cortical structures may contribute directly to higher-level cognitive processes.

">Suzetrigine (VX-548) exhibits activity-dependent effects on human dorsal root ganglion neurons</a></h4>

              
                Non-selective antagonists of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) provide effective local analgesia, but systemic administration is fraught with unwanted cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity. The development of antagonists targeting VGSCs preferentially expressed in peripheral neurons, such as NaV1.7, 1.8, and 1.9, could mitigate these risks. One such new small molecule that selectively inhibits NaV1.8, is orally bioavailable, and has recent FDA approval for the treatment of acute pain is suzetrigine (VX-548). Here we tested the effects of this agent on human dorsal root ganglion (hDRG) neurons obtained from either patients undergoing surgical thoracic vertebrectomy or from organ donors in parallel electrophysiology studies across 2 laboratories. Bath application of 10 nM suzetrigine abolished spontaneous discharges previously shown to be associated with on-going neuropathic pain within minutes. In contrast, suppression of discharges evoked by intracellular current injection required more prolonged application times. These results suggest that suzetrigine will likely show efficacy versus spontaneous pain but may have less robust effects on evoked or breakthrough pain.

">Amyloid fibrils in Alzheimer's disease differently modulate sleep and cortical oscillations in mice depending on the type of amyloid</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by aggregation and deposition of the amyloid-beta (A{beta}) protein in patient brains, with aging playing a crucial role through oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Sleep disturbances are common in patients with AD, and contribute to their cognitive impairment. However, the association between the aggregation of specific A{beta} species in particular brain regions and its effect on sleep impairment remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of A{beta}1-40 (A{beta}40) and A{beta}1-42 (A{beta}42) amyloid fibrils on sleep/wakefulness and cortical oscillations in 3-month old wild-type mice. A{beta}42 aggregated faster and demonstrated distinct structural properties compared with A{beta}40. Bilateral injections into the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus showed that A{beta}42 amyloid fibrils significantly disrupted sleep and cortical activity as well as caused neuronal death, whereas A{beta}40 amyloid fibrils mainly affected cortical oscillations and caused minimal neuronal death. These findings shed light on AD-associated sleep disorders, which are differentially affected by the distinct properties of A{beta}40 and A{beta}42 aggregates.

">Multi-Metric Quantitative MRI Identifies Spatially Distinct Age-Related Brain Differences in Female Bonnet Macaques</a></h4>

              
                This study employs a data-driven, voxelwise analysis of high-resolution ex vivo quantitative MRI (qMRI) to examine age-related differences in brain morphometry and microstructure in female bonnet macaques. A binary classifier differentiated mid- and late-age groups, achieving the highest accuracy when integrating all MRI metrics rather than using diffusion or relaxometry alone. Diffusion-only and relaxometry-only classifiers revealed distinct, minimally overlapping spatial patterns, while the multi-metric approach captured a broader range of age-related differences. Tensor-based morphometry (TBM) differences were most pronounced in the neocortex, whereas the thalamus showed the highest classification accuracy despite minimal morphometric differences, suggesting unique tissue composition alterations. These findings highlight the complementary nature of diffusion, relaxometry, and morphometry qMRI metrics in aging research. Our results support the use of multi-parametric qMRI to identify age-vulnerable brain regions and highlight its potential for improving qMRI biomarkers in larger, longitudinal aging studies.

">The deubiquitinase OTULIN regulates tau expression and RNA metabolism in neurons</a></h4>

              
                The degradation of aggregation-prone tau is regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy, which are impaired in Alzheimers disease (AD) and related tauopathies causing tau aggregation. Protein ubiquitination with linkage specificity determines the fate of proteins that can be either degradative or stabilization signals. While the linear M1-linked ubiquitination on protein aggregates is a signaling hub that recruits various ubiquitin-binding proteins for coordinated actions of protein aggregates turnover and inflammatory NF-kB activation, the deubiquitinase OTULIN counteracts with the M1-linked ubiquitin signaling. However, the exact role of OTULIN on tau aggregate clearance in AD is unknown. Based on our bulk RNA sequence analysis, human inducible pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons (iPSNs) from an individual with late-onset sporadic AD (sAD2.1) show downregulation of ubiquitin ligase activating factors (MAGEA2B and MAGEA) and OTULIN long non-coding RNA (lncRNA-OTULIN) compared to healthy control WTC11 iPSNs. In sAD2.1 iPSNs, downregulated lncRNA-OTULIN is inversely correlated with increased levels of OTULIN protein and phosphorylated tau at p-S202/p-T205 (AT8), p-T231 (AT180), and p-S396/p-S404 (PHF-1). Loss of OTULIN deubiquitinase function using pharmacological inhibitor UC495 or CRISPR-Cas9-mediated OTULIN gene knockout causes a significant reduction of total tau and phosphorylated tau at AT8 epitope in sAD2.1 iPSNs. Whereas in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, either treating with the UC495 compound or knocking out of the OTULIN gene causes a significant reduction of total tau at both mRNA and protein levels and consequently decreases phosphorylated tau at AT8, AT180, and PHF-1 epitopes. An additional bulk RNA sequence analysis of OUTLIN knockout SH-SY5Y shows a 14-fold down-regulation of tau mRNA levels and differential expression of many other genes associated with autophagy, UPS, NF-kB pathway, and RNA metabolism. Together, our results suggest for the first time a non-canonical function for OTULIN in regulating gene expression and RNA metabolism, which may have a significant pathogenic role in AD and related tauopathies.

">Zebrafish optic nerve injury results in systemic retinal ganglion cell dedifferentiation</a></h4>

              
                Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the sole projection neurons connecting the retina to the brain and therefore play a critical role in vision. Death of RGCs during glaucoma, optic neuropathies and after ocular trauma results in irreversible loss of vision as RGCs do not regenerate in the human eye. Moreover, there are no FDA approved therapies that prevent RGC death and/or promote RGC survival in the diseased or injured eye. There is a critical need to better understand the molecular underpinnings of neuroprotection to develop effective therapeutic approaches to preserve damaged RGCs. Unlike in mammals, RGCs in zebrafish are resilient to optic nerve injury, even after complete transection of the optic nerve. Here, we leveraged this unique model and utilized single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize RGC responses to injury and identify putative neuroprotective and regenerative pathways. RGCs are heterogeneous and studies in mice have shown that there is differential resiliency across RGC subtypes. Our results demonstrated that all RGC subtypes are resilient to injury in zebrafish. Quantifying changes in gene expression revealed the upregulation of progenitor and regenerative markers in all RGC subtypes after injury as well as distinct early and late phases to the injury response. This shift in gene expression causes injury-responsive RGCs to resemble RGC subtype 3, a low frequency population of endogenous immature RGCs that are normally maintained in the wild-type, uninjured adult retina. A similar but restricted transcriptomic injury response in RGCs of the uninjured contralateral eye was also detected, highlighting a systemic RGC response to unilateral optic nerve injury. Taken together, these results demonstrate that zebrafish RGCs dedifferentiate in response to injury, and this may be a novel mechanism mediating their unique cell survival and regenerative capabilities.

">FL/FLT3 signaling enhances mechanical pain hypersensitivity through Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) in male mice</a></h4>

              
                Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) plays a critical role in chronic pain through its ligand FL, a cytokine that triggers mechanical pain hypersensitivity. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigate the potential interplay between FL and IL-1beta; a key cytokine in DRG neurons sensitization and mechanical hyperalgesia through both in vitro and in vivo approaches. ELISA assays reveal that intrathecal FL administration significantly increases IL-1beta; protein levels in both the DRG and dorsal spinal cord of mice, beginning four hours post-injection. Using video microscopy and [Ca2+]i; fluorescence imaging in primary DRG neuron cultures, we demonstrate that FL potentiation of TRPV1 receptor responses to capsaicin is partially mediated by IL-1beta; signalling, as evidenced by a significant reduction in this potentiation in the presence of the IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-1Ra. Furthermore, FLT3-driven acute mechanical pain hypersensitivity in vivo is reduced both by prior administration of IL-1Ra and in IL-1 receptor knockout mice. Importantly, IL-1beta-induced mechanical pain hypersensitivity remains independent of FLT3 signalling as shown in Flt3 knockout mice. Collectively our findings expand the understanding of neuro-immune interactions by demonstrating a potential functional link between FL/FLT3 and IL-1beta;/IL-1R signalling in nociceptive processing.

">Nucleus raphe magnus serotonin neurons bidirectionally control spinal mechanical pain transmission</a></h4>

              
                The perception of pain as an alarm signal is primarily processed by nociceptive transmission from the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (DHSC) to the brain. Descending pathways from the brainstem dynamically modulate this process, either facilitating or inhibiting nociceptive information based on physiological, emotional, genetic and environmental factors. Among these pathways, serotonergic neurons of the nucleus raphe magnus (NRM) play a critical role in nociceptive modulation, though their precise mechanisms of action remain elusive. Here we aimed to resolve this longstanding question. We investigated NRM serotonergic modulation of pain using imaging, behavioral, pharmacological, electrophysiological, chemogenetic and optogenetic approaches. We discovered that NRM serotonin neurons mediate bidirectional effects on nociception depending on the pattern of activation. Brief optogenetic stimulation induced analgesia, whereas prolonged stimulation paradoxically led to hyperalgesia. Mechanistically, we identified spinal inhibitory interneurons as the principal targets of NRM serotonergic inputs, with three distinct receptor subtypes underpinning bidirectional modulation. Furthermore, our model explains heightened pain perception via pathological NRM serotonin neuron hyperexcitability acting at 5-HT3 receptors. Targeting the activity of serotonin neurons within physiological ranges represents a promising therapeutic strategy for managing pain and preventing its chronic exacerbation; a finding of significance considering the opioid-based treatment crisis.

">Advection versus diffusion in brain ventricular transport</a></h4>

              
                Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is integral to brain function. CSF provides mechanical support for the brain and helps distribute nutrients, neurotransmitters and metabolites throughout the central nervous system. CSF flow is driven by several processes, including the beating of motile cilia located on the walls of the brain ventricles. Despite the physiological importance of CSF, the underlying mechanisms of CSF flow and solute transport in the brain ventricles remain to be comprehensively resolved. This study analyzes and evaluates specifically the role of motile cilia in CSF flow and transport. We developed finite element methods for modeling flow and transport using the geometry of the zebrafish larval brain ventricles, for which we have detailed knowledge of cilia properties and CSF motion. The computational model is validated by in vivo experiments that monitor transport of a photoconvertible protein secreted in the brain ventricles. Our results show that while cilia contribute to advection of large particles, diffusion plays a significant role in the transport of small solutes. We also demonstrate how cilia location and the geometry of the ventricular system impact solute distribution. Altogether, this work presents a computational framework that can be applied to other ventricular systems, together with new concepts of how molecules are transported within the brain and its ventricles.

">Depth-resolved fiber photometry of amyloid plaque signals in freely behaving Alzheimer's disease mice</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease pathology typically manifests itself across multiple brain regions yet assessment at this scale in mouse models remains a challenge. This hinders the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Here we introduce a novel fiber photometry approach to monitor amyloid pathology in freely behaving mice. We first demonstrated that flat fiber-based photometry can detect amyloid signals across multiple brain regions under anesthesia after injecting a blood-brain barrier permeable tracer, Methoxy-X04. The depth profile of in vivo fluorescent signals was correlated with postmortem histological plaque signals. After confirming its feasibility ex vivo, we chronically implanted a tapered fiber for depth-resolved fiber photometry in freely behaving mice. After injecting Methoxy-X04, fluorescent signals increased in a depth-specific manner in Alzheimer's mice, but not in wild-type littermates. While fiber photometry has been widely adopted to monitor neuronal and non-neuronal activity, our approach expands the capabilities to monitor molecular pathologies such as amyloid plaques, even in a freely behaving condition.

                Background Emergency landing procedures during landing gear malfunction necessitate quick thinking and precise execution to ensure the safety of passengers and crew. A common strategy involves executing a "wheels-up" landing. This paper examines a unique emergency landing scenario where an aircraft lands on a mobile platform moving along the runway. This method requires coordination and control between the aircraft and the platform to match their velocities during the landing process. Methods A Boeing 747 was performed as a 3-D point mass simulation in MATLAB. The mobile platform was modeled as a first-order system having throttle as an input and the mobile platform velocity as an output. The methods Proportional integral derivative controller (PID) and sliding mode control (SMC) were utilized to achieve the velocity synchronization amid the aircraft and the platform. For examining the stability of the mobile platform model, Lyapunov’s Theorem for stability was employed. and sliding mode control (SMC) were utilized to achieve the velocity synchronization amid the aircraft and the platform. For examining the stability of the mobile platform model, Lyapunov’s Theorem for stability was employed. Results Simulation results show that both PID and SMC controllers successfully controlled the platform velocity to match the aircraft velocity during the emergency landing. However, the SMC controller demonstrated superior performance with faster convergence to the desired velocity reference compared to the PID controller. Conclusions The analysis demonstrated that the most suitable control strategy for the mobile platform velocity in relation to aircraft velocity is SMC during emergency landings. The inherent robustness of SMC to disturbances and uncertainties, coupled with its rapid convergence capabilities, makes it well-suited for this application.

                Background Digital payment systems are pivotal in the digital economy, relying on the interplay between internet technology and e-vendors. While the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) have been extensively used to explain technology adoption, the role of trust in financial technology adoption remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by developing an extended Trust-TAM-TPB model, providing a comprehensive framework to analyze digital payment adoption in emerging markets. Methods A quantitative approach was adopted, analyzing survey data from 509 respondents using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The extended model examines both technological factors (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use) and trust-related factors (trust’s influence on behavioral intention via subjective norms, attitude, and perceived behavioral control). Results Findings confirm that trust is a significant determinant of digital payment adoption, influencing both perceived usefulness and subjective norms. However, a negative relationship was found between perceived usefulness (PU) and attitude (ATT), suggesting that while users recognize the benefits of digital payments, their attitudes may still be shaped by traditional cash-based habits and security concerns. These insights challenge traditional TAM assumptions and emphasize the importance of trust in driving adoption. Conclusions This study contributes to technology acceptance literature by integrating trust into the TAM-TPB framework and highlighting its dual role in shaping both perceived usefulness and behavioral intention. Practically, the findings suggest that policymakers and financial institutions should prioritize trust-building strategies, including fraud prevention measures, financial literacy programs, and transparent transaction policies, to accelerate digital payment adoption in developing economies. These insights are particularly relevant for Vietnam’s Northern mountainous regions, where digital payment penetration remains low.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-432/v1?src=rss">Assessment of hematology, coagulation, and clinical chemistry parameters in COVID-19 patients: Impact on disease progression and ICU admission in Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The surge of COVID-19 cases in Indonesia has markedly heightened the hospital demand for ICU care. Patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 exhibit discernible changes in laboratory results throughout their infection. This study aimed to assess the progression of COVID-19 infection, ICU admission rate, and patient outcomes by analyzing the profile of laboratory parameters in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods This retrospective cohort involved six hospitals in Jakarta. The inclusion criteria consisted of PCR-confirmed hospitalized COVID-19 patients who underwent laboratory examinations for hematology, hemostasis, clinical chemistry, and infection markers during the pandemic from 2020 to 2021. Results Total of 1865 COVID-19 patients participated in this study, with the majority of 54.16% male patients. Of these patients, 24.23% required ICU care, and 46.23% were aged >60 years old. The mortality rate among COVID-19 patients was 21.87%, with 58.68% of male patients, and 54.9% aged >60 years. Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, lung diseases, and liver diseases, which aggravate the severity of COVID-19 infection and increase the mortality rate, were observed (p<0.05). The median values of leukocytes, neutrophils, Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), prolonged prothrombin time (PT), D-dimer, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), urea, creatinine, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) increased significantly. Conversely, median glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and lymphocyte values declined with the progression of COVID-19 infection, ICU admission, and non-survival patient outcomes (p< 0.001). Conclusions Patients aged >60 years, with length of stay exceeding 8 days, low Hemoglobin levels, high NLR, low platelet levels, prolonged PT, high D-dimer, high CRP, and elevated IL-6 were correlated with severe COVID-19 infection, ICU admission, and unfavorable patient outcomes. The values of leukocyte count, neutrophil%, NLR, PT, D-dimer, AST, LDH, urea, creatinine, CRP, PCT, and IL-6 increased, while eGFR and lymphocytes decreased in severe COVID-19 infection, ICU admission, and non-survival patient outcome evaluations.

                <p>by Davide Chicco, Vasco Coelho</p>

As the availability of big biomedical data advances, there is a growing need of university students trained professionally on analyzing these data and correctly interpreting their results. We propose here a study plan for a master’s degree course on biomedical data science, by describing our experience during the last academic year. In our university course, we explained how to find an open biomedical dataset, how to correctly clean it and how to prepare it for a computational statistics or machine learning phase. By doing so, we introduce common health data science terms and explained how to avoid common mistakes in the process. Moreover, we clarified how to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and how to reasonably interpret its results. We also described how to properly execute a supervised or unsupervised machine learning analysis, and now to understand and interpret its outcomes. Eventually, we explained how to validate the findings obtained. We illustrated all these steps in the context of open science principles, by suggesting to the students to use only open source programming languages (R or Python in particular), open biomedical data (if available), and open access scientific articles (if possible). We believe our teaching proposal can be useful and of interest for anyone wanting to start to prepare a course on biomedical data science.

                <p>by Nava Leibovich, Sidhartha Goyal</p>

Tracking cellular lineages using genetic barcodes provides insights across biology and has become an important tool. However, barcoding strategies remain ad hoc. We show that elevating barcode insertion probability and thus increasing the average number of barcodes within the cells, adds to the number of traceable lineages but may decrease the accuracy of lineages inference due to reading errors. We establish the trade-off between accuracy in tracing lineages and the total number of traceable lineages, and find optimal experimental parameters under limited resources concerning the populations size of tracked cells and barcode pool complexity.

                <p>by Caesar Tawfeeq, Jiyao Wang, Umesh Khaniya, Thomas Madej, James Song, Ravinder Abrol, Philippe Youkharibache</p>

The Immunoglobulin fold (Ig-fold) is found in proteins from all domains of life and represents the most populous fold in the human genome, with current estimates ranging from 2 to 3% of protein coding regions. That proportion is much higher in the surfaceome where Ig and Ig-like domains orchestrate cell-cell recognition, adhesion and signaling. The ability of Ig-domains to reliably fold and self-assemble through highly specific interfaces represents a remarkable property of these domains, making them key elements of molecular interaction systems: the immune system, the nervous system, the vascular system and the muscular system. We define a universal residue numbering scheme, common to all domains sharing the Ig-fold in order to study the wide spectrum of Ig-domain variants constituting the Ig-proteome and Ig-Ig interactomes at the heart of these <i>systems</i>. The “IgStrand numbering scheme” enables the identification of Ig structural proteomes and interactomes in and between any species, and comparative structural, functional, and evolutionary analyses. We review how Ig-domains are classified today as topological and structural variants and highlight the <i>“Ig-fold irreducible structural signature”</i> shared by all of them. The IgStrand numbering scheme lays the foundation for the systematic annotation of structural proteomes by detecting and accurately labeling Ig-, Ig-like and Ig-extended domains in proteins, which are poorly annotated in current databases and opens the door to accurate machine learning. Importantly, it sheds light on the robust <i>Ig protein folding algorithm</i> used by nature to form beta sandwich supersecondary structures. The numbering scheme powers an algorithm implemented in the interactive structural analysis software iCn3D to systematically recognize Ig-domains, annotate them and perform detailed analyses comparing any domain sharing the Ig-fold in sequence, topology and structure, regardless of their diverse topologies or origin. The scheme provides a robust fold detection and labeling mechanism that reveals unsuspected structural homologies among protein structures beyond currently identified Ig- and Ig-like domain variants. Indeed, multiple folds classified independently contain a common structural signature, in particular jelly-rolls. Examples of folds that harbor an “Ig-extended” architecture are given. Applications in protein engineering around the Ig-architecture are straightforward based on the universal numbering.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012303">On the validity of electric brain signal predictions based on population firing rates</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Torbjørn V. Ness, Tom Tetzlaff, Gaute T. Einevoll, David Dahmen</p>

Neural activity at the population level is commonly studied experimentally through measurements of electric brain signals like local field potentials (LFPs), or electroencephalography (EEG) signals. To allow for comparison between observed and simulated neural activity it is therefore important that simulations of neural activity can accurately predict these brain signals. Simulations of neural activity at the population level often rely on point-neuron network models or firing-rate models. While these simplified representations of neural activity are computationally efficient, they lack the explicit spatial information needed for calculating LFP/EEG signals. Different heuristic approaches have been suggested for overcoming this limitation, but the accuracy of these approaches has not fully been assessed. One such heuristic approach, the so-called kernel method, has previously been applied with promising results and has the additional advantage of being well-grounded in the biophysics underlying electric brain signal generation. It is based on calculating rate-to-LFP/EEG kernels for each synaptic pathway in a network model, after which LFP/EEG signals can be obtained directly from population firing rates. This amounts to a massive reduction in the computational effort of calculating brain signals because the brain signals are calculated for each population instead of for each neuron. Here, we investigate how and when the kernel method can be expected to work, and present a theoretical framework for predicting its accuracy. We show that the relative error of the brain signal predictions is a function of the single-cell kernel heterogeneity and the spike-train correlations. Finally, we demonstrate that the kernel method is most accurate for contributions which are also dominating the brain signals: spatially clustered and correlated synaptic input to large populations of pyramidal cells. We thereby further establish the kernel method as a promising approach for calculating electric brain signals from large-scale neural simulations.

A central challenge in the progression of a variety of open questions in biology, such as morphogenesis, wound healing, and development, is learning from empirical data how information is integrated to support tissue-level function and behavior. Information-theoretic approaches provide a quantitative framework for extracting patterns from data, but so far have been predominantly applied to neuronal systems at the tissue-level. Here, we demonstrate how time series of Ca2<sup>+</sup> dynamics can be used to identify the structure and information dynamics of other biological tissues. To this end, we expressed the calcium reporter GCaMP6s in an organoid system of explanted amphibian epidermis derived from the African clawed frog <i>Xenopus laevis</i>, and imaged calcium activity pre- and post- a puncture injury, for six replicate organoids. We constructed functional connectivity networks by computing mutual information between cells from time series derived using medical imaging techniques to track intracellular Ca2<sup>+</sup>. We analyzed network properties including degree distribution, spatial embedding, and modular structure. We find organoid networks exhibit potential evidence for more connectivity than null models, with our models displaying high degree hubs and mesoscale community structure with spatial clustering. Utilizing functional connectivity networks, our model suggests the tissue retains non-random features after injury, displays long range correlations and structure, and non-trivial clustering that is not necessarily spatially dependent. In the context of this reconstruction method our results suggest increased integration after injury, possible cellular coordination in response to injury, and some type of generative structure of the anatomy. While we study Ca2<sup>+</sup> in <i>Xenopus</i> epidermal cells, our computational approach and analyses highlight how methods developed to analyze functional connectivity in neuronal tissues can be generalized to any tissue and fluorescent signal type. We discuss expanded methods of analyses to improve models of non-neuronal information processing highlighting the potential of our framework to provide a bridge between neuroscience and more basal modes of information processing.

Multiple -omics (genomics, proteomics, etc.) profiles are commonly generated to gain insight into a disease or physiological system. Constructing multi-omics networks with respect to the trait(s) of interest provides an opportunity to understand relationships between molecular features but integration is challenging due to multiple data sets with high dimensionality. One approach is to use canonical correlation to integrate one or two omics types and a single trait of interest. However, these types of methods may be limited due to (1) not accounting for higher-order correlations existing among features, (2) computational inefficiency when extending to more than two omics data when using a penalty term-based sparsity method, and (3) lack of flexibility for focusing on specific correlations (e.g., omics-to-phenotype correlation versus omics-to-omics correlations). In this work, we have developed a novel multi-omics network analysis pipeline called Sparse Generalized Tensor Canonical Correlation Analysis Network Inference (SGTCCA-Net) that can effectively overcome these limitations. We also introduce an implementation to improve the summarization of networks for downstream analyses. Simulation and real-data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel method for inferring omics networks and features of interest.

Insulin and other growth factors are key regulators of liver gene expression, including in metabolic diseases. Most of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity induced by insulin is considered to be dependent on PI3Kα. We used mice lacking p110α, the catalytic subunit of PI3Kα, to investigate its role in the regulation of liver gene expression in health and in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). The absence of hepatocyte PI3Kα reduced maximal insulin-induced PI3K activity and signaling, promoted glucose intolerance in lean mice and significantly regulated liver gene expression, including insulin-sensitive genes, in <i>ad libitum</i> feeding. Some of the defective regulation of gene expression in response to hepatocyte-restricted insulin receptor deletion was related to PI3Kα signaling. In addition, though PI3Kα deletion in hepatocytes promoted insulin resistance, it was protective against steatotic liver disease in diet-induced obesity. In the absence of hepatocyte PI3Kα, the effect of diet-induced obesity on liver gene expression was significantly altered, with changes in rhythmic gene expression in liver. Altogether, this study highlights the specific role of p110α in the control of liver gene expression in physiology and in the metabolic rewiring that occurs during MASLD.

                Background Background Case reports are one of the important forms of documentation and publication of clinical physiotherapy presenting the first line of evidence in scientific literature. In order to provide a systematic and precise structure for reporting and presenting cases, the CAse REport (CARE) guidelines were established in 2013. However, these guidelines present limitations as reporting requires items of specific specialties following the checklist. Authors from different specialities have developed CARE extensions specifying the characteristic features of corresponding fields, however, an extension dealing with physiotherapy assessment and line of management in the CARE guidelines is proposed as Physiotherapy CAse REport (PhyCARE). Method A survey will be conducted using standard e-Delphi methodology using Google forms®. 1 , 3 , 5 The e-Delphi questionnaire shall comprise responses on the relevance of each item of the CARE 2013 guideline with respect to physiotherapy. This shall be followed by suggestions from e-Delphi members regarding the incorporation of new items or adaptations of the existing items in the CARE 2013 statement using controlled feedback. Accordingly, based on the responses and suggestions from the e-Delphi experts, the core committee will draft the initial version of the PhyCARE checklist, which will be included in the second round of the e-Delphi process. Administration of the questionnaire as well as the sequential rounds shall continue unless a comprehensive set of findings with concurred definitions are obtained. Due to the fact that there is no requirement set for the number of e-Delphi rounds, the entire procedure will be carried out online. Subsequently, followed by pilot testing, submission of the CARE extension for physiotherapy (PhyCARE) will be conducted for publication and dissemination. The 2010 “Guidance for Developers of Health Research Reporting” and instructions from the Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research (EQUATOR) Network will be followed in the preparation of PhyCARE guidelines. The guidelines will be propagated on different platforms and journals will be requested to adopt the guidelines. Registration The reporting guideline under development is prospectively registered on the EQUATOR Network website on PhyCaRe – Reporting guideline for physiotherapy case reports.

                Background Haematological disorders characterized by hypocellular marrow like aplastic anaemia (AA) and hypocellular myelodysplastic neoplasm (MDS-h) are diagnostic challenges as the clinical and morphological features overlap, while the treatment and prognosis differ. Bone marrow mast cell quantification is proposed as a supplementary diagnostic and prognostic tool to differentiate AA from MDS-h. We aim to study the distribution of mast cells in hypoplastic marrow and determine its role in differential diagnosis of AA and MDS-h. Methods We analysed bone marrow biopsies of 65 cases of hypoplastic/aplastic marrow received during the year 2015-2021 for the distribution of mast cells using Toluidine Blue special staining. Hematopoietic stem cells were assessed with the help of CD34 immunohistochemistry. Results Increased mast cells were noted in 55.4% of all the cases, of which 48% were cases of AA and 21% were cases of MDS-h (P: 0.04). Overall, 76% of AA and 33% of MDS-h cases showed increased numbers of mast cells. Reduced hematopoietic stem cells were noted in 69.4% of the cases with elevated mast cells (P: 0.1). Conclusions Mast cell quantification in trephine biopsy of AA and MDS-h can act as a supplementary diagnostic tool and guide the management of the respective entities.

                Purpose The objective of this research was to assess the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in online students. Materials and methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed by searching the PubMed, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, CINAHL plus with full text, and Wiley InterScience databases. A total of 3,749 studies were identified between January 2020 and December 2023. The Joanna Briggs Tool for studies reporting prevalence was used to assess the quality of studies. Jamovi 2.4 was used in the meta-analysis. Results Sixteen studies were included and used for the meta-analysis. The average age of participants was 22 years, with an age range of 17–45 years. There were 6 studies of high quality, 9 studies of medium quality and 1 study of low quality. The areas with the highest prevalence of musculoskeletal pain were the neck (51%, 95% CI = 36–66%), lower back (51%, 95% CI = 42–59%) and shoulder (36%, 95% CI = 26–47%). Conclusions The shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a potential factor influencing musculoskeletal pain in students. Educational institutions should study the duration of online learning that begins to impact student injury outcomes.

                Phillips et al. demonstrate how neural representations of abstract rules governing behavior emerge. The thalamus identifies the relevant rule from converging, weak cortical inputs of different task variables, and then it amplifies and sustains the rule representation in prefrontal cortex. The thalamus and prefrontal cortex together monitor the outcome of rule-guided behavior.

                Arce et al. show that KRIT1 heterozygous mutations drive cavernoma-like structures in vascularized organoids and alter endothelial cell-cell junctions. KRIT1-deficient vascular cells reshaped brain vasculature through extracellular matrix organization, proliferation, and mesenchymal transition. The endothelial progenitor marker PEG3 was highly expressed in CCM patient-derived endothelial cells and patient cavernoma biopsies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102434">Oncogenic and teratogenic effects of Trp53Y217C, an inflammation-prone mouse model of the human hotspot mutant TP53Y220C</a></h4>

              
                Missense ‘hotspot’ mutations localized in six p53 codons account for 20% of <i>TP53</i> mutations in human cancers. Hotspot p53 mutants have lost the tumor suppressive functions of the wildtype protein, but whether and how they may gain additional functions promoting tumorigenesis remain controversial. Here, we generated <i>Trp53</i><sup>Y217C</sup>, a mouse model of the human hotspot mutant <i>TP53</i><sup>Y220C</sup>. DNA damage responses were lost in <i>Trp53</i><sup>Y217C/Y217C</sup> (<i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup>) cells, and <i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup> fibroblasts exhibited increased chromosome instability compared to <i>Trp53</i><sup>-/-</sup> cells. Furthermore, <i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup> male mice died earlier than <i>Trp53</i><sup>-/-</sup> males, with more aggressive thymic lymphomas. This correlated with an increased expression of inflammation-related genes in <i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup> thymic cells compared to <i>Trp53</i><sup>-/-</sup> cells. Surprisingly, we recovered only one <i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup> female for 22 <i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup> males at weaning, a skewed distribution explained by a high frequency of <i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup> female embryos with exencephaly and the death of most <i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup> female neonates. Strikingly, however, when we treated pregnant females with the anti-inflammatory drug supformin (LCC-12), we observed a fivefold increase in the proportion of viable <i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup> weaned females in their progeny. Together, these data suggest that the p53<sup>Y217C</sup> mutation not only abrogates wildtype p53 functions but also promotes inflammation, with oncogenic effects in males and teratogenic effects in females.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97403">Cell cycle and age-related modulations of mouse chromosome stiffness</a></h4>

              
                Chromosome structure is complex, and many aspects of chromosome organization are still not understood. Measuring the stiffness of chromosomes offers valuable insight into their structural properties. In this study, we analyzed the stiffness of chromosomes from metaphase I (MI) and metaphase II (MII) oocytes. Our results revealed a tenfold increase in stiffness (Young’s modulus) of MI chromosomes compared to somatic chromosomes. Furthermore, the stiffness of MII chromosomes was found to be lower than that of MI chromosomes. We examined the role of meiosis-specific cohesin complexes in regulating chromosome stiffness. Surprisingly, the stiffness of chromosomes from three meiosis-specific cohesin mutants did not significantly differ from that of wild-type chromosomes, indicating that these cohesins may not be primary determinants of chromosome stiffness. Additionally, our findings revealed an age-related increase of chromosome stiffness for MI oocytes. Since aging is associated with elevated levels of DNA damage, we investigated the impact of etoposide-induced DNA damage on chromosome stiffness and found that it led to a reduction in stiffness in MI oocytes. Overall, our study underscores the dynamic and cyclical nature of chromosome stiffness, modulated by both the cell cycle and age-related factors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97144">Enteric glia regulate Paneth cell secretion and intestinal microbial ecology</a></h4>

              
                Glial cells of the enteric nervous system (ENS) interact closely with the intestinal epithelium and secrete signals that influence epithelial cell proliferation and barrier formation in vitro. Whether these interactions are important in vivo, however, is unclear because previous studies reached conflicting conclusions (Prochera and Rao, 2023). To better define the roles of enteric glia in steady state regulation of the intestinal epithelium, we characterized the glia in closest proximity to epithelial cells and found that the majority express the gene Proteolipid protein 1 (<i>PLP1</i>) in both mice and humans. To test their functions using an unbiased approach, we genetically depleted PLP1<sup>+</sup> cells in mice and transcriptionally profiled the small and large intestines. Surprisingly, glial loss had minimal effects on transcriptional programs and the few identified changes varied along the gastrointestinal tract. In the ileum, where enteric glia had been considered most essential for epithelial integrity, glial depletion did not drastically alter epithelial gene expression but caused a modest enrichment in signatures of Paneth cells, a secretory cell type important for innate immunity. In the absence of PLP1<sup>+</sup> glia, Paneth cell number was intact, but a subset appeared abnormal with irregular and heterogenous cytoplasmic granules, suggesting a secretory deficit. Consistent with this possibility, ileal explants from glial-depleted mice secreted less functional lysozyme than controls with corresponding effects on fecal microbial composition. Collectively, these data suggest that enteric glia do not exert broad effects on the intestinal epithelium but have an essential role in regulating Paneth cell function and gut microbial ecology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102321">Pleiotropy increases parallel selection signatures during adaptation from standing genetic variation</a></h4>

              
                The phenomenon of parallel evolution, whereby similar genomic and phenotypic changes occur across replicated pairs of populations or species, is widely studied. Nevertheless, the determining factors of parallel evolution remain poorly understood. Theoretical studies have proposed that pleiotropy, the influence of a single gene on multiple traits, is an important factor. In order to gain a deeper insight into the role of pleiotropy for parallel evolution from standing genetic variation, we characterized the interplay between parallelism, polymorphism, and pleiotropy. The present study examined the parallel gene expression evolution in 10 replicated populations of <i>Drosophila simulans</i>, which were adapted from standing variation to the same new temperature regime. The data demonstrate that the parallel evolution of gene expression from standing genetic variation is positively correlated with the strength of pleiotropic effects. The ancestral variation in gene expression is, however, negatively correlated with parallelism. Given that pleiotropy is also negatively correlated with gene expression variation, we conducted a causal analysis to distinguish cause and correlation and evaluate the role of pleiotropy. The causal analysis indicated that both direct (causative) and indirect (correlational) effects of pleiotropy contribute to parallel evolution. The indirect effect is mediated by historic selective constraint in response to pleiotropy. This results in parallel selection responses due to the reduced standing variation of pleiotropic genes. The direct effect of pleiotropy is likely to reflect a genetic correlation among adaptive traits, which in turn gives rise to synergistic effects and higher parallelism.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100941">Somatodendritic orientation determines tDCS-induced neuromodulation of Purkinje cell activity in awake mice</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) of the cerebellum is a promising non-invasive neuromodulatory technique being proposed for the treatment of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. However, there is a lack of knowledge about how externally applied currents affect neuronal spiking activity in cerebellar circuits in vivo. We investigated how Cb-tDCS affects the firing rate of Purkinje cells (PC) and non-PC in the mouse cerebellar cortex to understand the underlying mechanisms behind the polarity-dependent modulation of neuronal activity induced by tDCS. Mice (n=9) were prepared for the chronic recording of local field potentials (LFPs) to assess the actual electric field gradient imposed by Cb-tDCS in our experimental design. Single-neuron extracellular recording of PCs in awake (n=24) and anesthetized (n=27) mice was combined with juxtacellular recordings and subsequent staining of PC with neurobiotin under anesthesia (n=8) to correlate their neuronal orientation with their response to Cb-tDCS. Finally, a high-density Neuropixels recording system was used to demonstrate the relevance of neuronal orientation during the application of Cb-tDCS in awake mice (n=6). In this study, we observe that Cb-tDCS induces a heterogeneous polarity-dependent modulation of the firing rate of PCs and non-PC in the mouse cerebellar cortex. We demonstrate that the apparently heterogeneous effects of tDCS on PC activity can be explained by taking into account the somatodendritic orientation relative to the electric field. Our findings highlight the need to consider neuronal orientation and morphology to improve tDCS computational models, enhance stimulation protocol reliability, and optimize effects in both basic and clinical applications.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105059">Food intake enhances hippocampal sharp wave-ripples</a></h4>

              
                Effective regulation of energy metabolism is critical for survival. Metabolic control involves various nuclei within the hypothalamus, which receive information about the body’s energy state and coordinate appropriate responses to maintain homeostasis, such as thermogenesis, pancreatic insulin secretion, and food-seeking behaviors. It has recently been found that the hippocampus, a brain region traditionally associated with memory and spatial navigation, is also involved in metabolic regulation. Specifically, hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs), which are high-frequency neural oscillations supporting memory consolidation and foraging decisions, have been shown to reduce peripheral glucose levels. However, whether SWRs are enhanced by recent feeding—when the need for glucose metabolism increases, and if so, whether feeding-dependent modulation of SWRs is communicated to other brain regions involved in metabolic regulation—remains unknown. To address these gaps, we recorded SWRs from the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus of mice during sleep sessions before and after consumption of meals of varying caloric values. We found that SWRs occurring during sleep are significantly enhanced following food intake, with the magnitude of enhancement being dependent on the caloric content of the meal. This pattern occurred under both food-deprived and ad libitum feeding conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate that GABAergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, which are known to regulate food intake, exhibit a robust SWR-triggered increase in activity. These findings identify the satiety state as a factor modulating SWRs and suggest that hippocampal-lateral hypothalamic communication is a potential mechanism by which SWRs could modulate peripheral metabolism and food intake.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101101">Prophage-encoded Hm-oscar gene recapitulates Wolbachia-induced male-killing in the tea tortrix moth Homona magnanima</a></h4>

              
                <i>Wolbachia</i> are maternally transmitted bacterial symbionts that are ubiquitous among arthropods. They can hijack host reproduction in various ways, including male-killing (MK), where the sons of infected mothers are killed during development. The recent discovery of MK-associated <i>Wolbachia</i> genes, i.e., <i>oscar</i> in <i>Ostrinia</i> moths and <i>wmk</i> in <i>Drosophila</i> flies, stimulates our interest in the diversity and commonality of MK mechanisms, which remain largely unclear. We recently discovered that a <i>Wolbachia</i> symbiont of the moth <i>Homona magnanima</i> carries an MK-associated prophage region encoding homologs of <i>oscar</i> (<i>Hm-oscar</i>) and <i>wmk</i> (<i>wmk-</i>1–4). Here, we investigated the effects of these genes in the native host. Upon transient overexpression, <i>Hm-oscar</i>, but not <i>wmk</i>, induced male lethality in <i>H. magnanima</i>, in contrast to our observations in <i>Drosophila</i>, where the <i>wmk</i> homologs, but not <i>Hm-oscar</i>, killed the males. <i>Hm-oscar</i> disrupted sex determination in male embryos by inducing a female-type <i>doublesex</i> splicing and impaired dosage compensation, recapitulating the <i>Wolbachia</i> phenotype. Cell-based transfection assays confirmed that <i>Hm-oscar</i> suppressed the function of <i>masculinizer</i>, the primary male sex determinant involved in lepidopteran dosage compensation. Our study highlights the conserved roles of <i>oscar</i> homologs in <i>Wolbachia</i>-induced lepidopteran MK and argues that <i>Wolbachia</i> have evolved multiple MK mechanisms in insects.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96722">Treacle’s ability to form liquid-like phase condensates is essential for nucleolar fibrillar center assembly, efficient rRNA transcription and processing, and rRNA gene repair</a></h4>

              
                We investigated the role of the nucleolar protein Treacle in organizing and regulating the nucleolus in human cells. Our results support Treacle’s ability to form liquid-like phase condensates through electrostatic interactions among molecules. The formation of these biomolecular condensates is crucial for segregating nucleolar fibrillar centers from the dense fibrillar component and ensuring high levels of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene transcription and accurate rRNA processing. Both the central and C-terminal domains of Treacle are required to form liquid-like condensates. The initiation of phase separation is attributed to the C-terminal domain. The central domain is characterized by repeated stretches of alternatively charged amino acid residues and is vital for condensate stability. Overexpression of mutant forms of Treacle that cannot form liquid-like phase condensates compromises the assembly of fibrillar centers, suppressing rRNA gene transcription and disrupting rRNA processing. These mutant forms also fail to recruit DNA topoisomerase II binding protein 1 (TOPBP1), suppressing the DNA damage response in the nucleolus.

                Task-fMRI analyses typically focus on localized activation contrasts between stimuli, neglecting the dynamic hierarchy of the brain. We introduce Brain Diffusion Transformer (Brain-DiT), a deep generative model capturing recurrent processing underlying individualized neurocognitive state transitions via functional networks. Without prior assumptions, Brain-DiT identifies canonical cognitive regions in the brain and reveals replicable subgroups with distinct neural circuits in large cohorts, offering critical clinical insights overlooked by traditional methods: individuals exhibiting negative emotion bias, linked to language-related regions, had a 12-fold higher likelihood of major depression, and those with maladaptive inhibition strategies, associated with overactive medial frontal regions, showed a 9-fold increased risk of alcohol abuse. By bridging cognitive theory and psychiatric applications, Brain-DiT provides a unified analytical paradigm, paving the way for operational personalized medicine in psychiatry.

">Experience reorganizes content-specific memory traces in macaques</a></h4>

              
                Memory formation requires neural activity reorganization during experience that persists in sleep. How these processes promote learning while preserving established memories remains unclear. We recorded neural ensemble activity from hippocampal and associated regions in freely moving macaques as they recalled item sequences presented that day ("new"), one day prior ("recent"), or over two weeks prior ("old"). Cell assemblies biased for old sequences showed less drift, greater network connectivity, and stronger sleep reactivation than new-biased assemblies. Pairs of old and recent assemblies formed persistent task-to-sleep coupling ("metassemblies"), unlike new assembly pairs. In the hippocampus, the propensity for superficial and deep CA1 pyramidal cells to form integrated assemblies increased with memory age. These findings reveal rapid organization and stabilization of neural activity in the primate brain, suggesting potential mechanisms for balancing learning with memory linking and durability.

">CO2 sensitive connexin channel synapses in the VTA release 5HT to regulate dopaminergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                It is now well established that the major mid-brain dopaminergic centre, the ventral tegmental area (VTA), plays an important role in the control of sleep-wake state transitions, producing arousal from sleep states upon activation. We recently showed that the VTA may also be involved in producing arousal in response to hypercapnia, a key survival response. We found that connexin 26 (Cx26) CO2-sensitive hemichannels are expressed by VTA GABAergic neurons and modulate their excitability. Here we have extended our investigation of VTA chemosensing and have discovered additional novel mechanisms of CO2 neural signalling: connexin co-synapses. CO2-sensitive hemichannels are expressed on the cell bodies and the terminals of dorsal raphe (DR) serotonergic neurons that cluster around VTA TH+ dopaminergic neurons colocalizing both with the 5HT transporter SERT and with VGLUT3. Using pharmacological dissection and GRAB5-HT sensors, we showed that 5HT can permeate through open Cx26 hemichannels to modulate the excitability of VTA dopamine neurons. Brief elevations of pCO2 regulate dopaminergic neuron excitability via 5HT3 and 5HT2A/C receptors activation. Longer applications of raised pCO2 modulates HCN channel opening in response to hyperpolarizing current steps, an effect blocked by 5HT2 receptor antagonists. These effects of pCO2 can be blocked with the connexin inhibitor lanthanum. In vivo, CO2 challenge (hypercapnia) activates VTA neurons (including dopaminergic neurons), with the activation greatly reduced by the conditional knockdown of Cx26 expression in the VTA. We therefore propose that the VTA could play an important role in hypercapnic arousal with at least two distinct mechanisms of CO2 signalling: modulation of GABAergic neuron excitability via soma Cx26 hemichannels and channel-mediated release of 5HT via CO2 sensitive Cx26 co-synapses on DR nerve terminals that regulate the excitability of dopaminergic neurons.

">Modeling AP2M1 Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Genetic defects in AP2M1, which encodes the -subunit of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), cause a rare form of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). In this study, we modeled AP2M1-DEE in Drosophila melanogaster to gain deeper insights into the underlying disease mechanisms. Pan-neuronal knock-down of the Drosophila AP2M1 ortholog, AP-2, resulted in a consistent heat-sensitive paralysis phenotype and altered morphology in class IV dendritic arborization (c4da) neurons. Unexpectedly, affected flies were resistant to antiseizure medications and exhibited increased resistance to electrically induced seizures. A CRISPR-engineered fly line carrying the recurrent human disease variant p.Arg170Trp displayed a milder seizure resistance phenotype. While these findings contrast with the human phenotype, they align with previous studies on other CME-related genes in Drosophila. Our results suggest that hyperexcitability and seizures in AP2M1-DEE may stem from broader defects in neuronal development rather than direct synaptic dysfunction.

">Glia phagocytose neuronal sphingolipids to infiltrate developing synapses</a></h4>

              
                The complex morphologies of mature neurons and glia emerge through profound rearrangements of cell membranes during development. Despite being integral components of these membranes, it is unclear whether lipids might actively sculpt these morphogenic processes. By analyzing lipid levels in the developing fruit fly brain, we discover dramatic increases in specific sphingolipids coinciding with neural circuit establishment. Disrupting this sphingolipid bolus via genetic perturbations of sphingolipid biosynthesis and catabolism leads to impaired glial autophagy. Remarkably, glia can obtain sphingolipid precursors needed for autophagy by phagocytosing neurons. These precursors are then converted into specific long-chain ceramide phosphoethanolamines (CPEs), invertebrate analogs of sphingomyelin. These lipids are essential for glia to arborize and infiltrate the brain, a critical step in circuit maturation that when disrupted leads to reduced synapse numbers. Taken together, our results demonstrate how spatiotemporal tuning of sphingolipid metabolism during development plays an instructive role in programming brain architecture.

">PsiConnect: A Multimodal Neuroimaging Study of Psilocybin-Induced Changes in Brain and Behaviour</a></h4>

              
                PsiConnect is a large-scale neuroimaging study designed to investigate the neural and subjective effects of psilocybin using multimodal neuroimaging. It combines functional, structural, and diffusion-weighted MRI with EEG to examine brain activity in 62 participants before and after a 19 mg dose of psilocybin. The design includes resting-state scans and three naturalistic conditions: guided meditation, music listening, and movie watching. Half of the cohort underwent an 8-week meditation training program, enabling the exploration of interactions among meditation, psilocybin, and brain function. The fMRI data was obtained through multi-echo fMRI, which enhances the signal-to-noise ratio and reduces susceptibility artifacts, thereby improving the reliability of the analyses. A comprehensive battery of behavioural and self-report measures captured both acute and longitudinal cognitive and subjective effects, with follow-ups extending to one year post-administration. The large sample size, multimodal neuroimaging, diversity of contexts, and longitudinal behavioural follow-ups enable the study of psilocybin-induced changes in brain and behaviour with an unprecedented level of detail and reliability. Furthermore, the data is curated according to open science principles to ensure accessibility and interoperability with established neuroimaging processing pipelines. These factors make PsiConnect a valuable and highly reusable resource for researchers in cognitive and computational neuroscience.

">Dopaminergic drugs modulate fear extinction related processes in humans, but effects are mild</a></h4>

              
                The ability to extinguish learned fear responses is crucial for adaptive behavior. The mesolimbic dopaminergic system originating in the ventral tegmental area has been proposed to contribute to fear extinction learning because of its critical role in reward learning. The unexpected omission of aversive unconditioned stimuli (US) is considered as rewarding (outcome better than expected) and to drive extinction learning. We tested the hypothesis that extinction learning is facilitated by dopaminergic drugs and impeded by anti-dopaminergic drugs. The effects of dopamine agonists [levodopa (100 mg) and bromocriptine (1.25 mg)] and antagonists [tiapride (100 mg) and haloperidol (3 mg)] on fear extinction learning were compared to placebo in 146 young and healthy human participants. A three-day differential fear conditioning paradigm was performed with pupil size and skin conductance responses (SCRs) being recorded. Fear acquisition training was performed on day 1, extinction training on day 2, and recall was tested on day 3. The conditioned stimuli (CS+, CS-) consisted of two geometric figures. A short electrical stimulation was used as the aversive US. One of the four drugs or placebo was administered prior to the extinction phase on day 2. Overall, effects were small and seen only in the bromocriptine group. In line with our hypothesis, we measured reduced pupil dilation during late recall in the bromocriptine group compared to the placebo group, indicating faster re-extinction of spontaneously recovered fear reactions on the third day. Effects of levodopa and haloperidol were unspecific and related to generally increased SCR levels in the levodopa group (already prior to drug intake), and miotic side-effects of haloperidol. Findings provide additional support that the dopaminergic system contributes to extinction learning in humans, possibly by improving consolidation of fear extinction memory.

">Fronto-parietal effective connectivity during working memory in Neurofibromatosis Type 1 adolescents and neurotypical controls</a></h4>

              
                Background Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a rare, a single-gene neurodevelopmental disorder. Atypical brain activation patterns have been linked to working memory difficulties in NF1 patients. The present work investigated if greater inhibitory activity underlies in interactions between neuronal populations in NF1 patients, as estimated with effective connectivity during working memory ask. Methods Forty-three adolescent patients with NF1 and twenty-six age-matched neurotypical controls completed functional magnetic resonance imaging scans during a verbal working memory task. Dynamic causal models were estimated for bilateral fronto-parietal network (dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices (dlPFC and vlPFC), superior and inferior parietal gyri (SPG and IPG)). Parametric empirical Bayes approach with Bayesian model reduction was used to test the hypothesis that NF1 diagnosis would be characterised by greater inhibitory self-connections (intrinsic connectivity). Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) was performed to test the generalisability of group differences. Results NF1 participants have greater average connectivity of left dlPFC, IPG, SPG and bilateral vlPFC. The winning model of Bayesian model reduction investigating effects of working memory showed that NF1 patients have stronger intrinsic connectivity of left vlPFC, but weaker connectivity of right vlPFC and left dlPFC. The parameters of these connections were weakly predictive of NF1 diagnosis; correlation coefficient between true and predicted scores was 0.19 (p = 0.055) Conclusions Increased average connectivity of left dlPFC, IPG, SPG and bilateral vlPFC in NF1, suggests greater overall sensitivity of these regions to inputs. Working memory evoked different patterns of input processing in NF1, that cannot be characterised by increased inhibition alone. Instead, modulatory connectivity related to working memory showed more inhibitory self-connectivity of left dlPFC and left vlPFC, and less inhibitory intrinsic connectivity of right vlPFC in NF1. Importantly, this discrepancy between average and modulatory connectivity suggests that overall NF1 participants are responsive to cognitive task-related inputs but may show atypical adaptation to the task demands of working memory.

">Functional connectivity reveals increased network segregation and sensorimotor processing during working memory in adolescents with Neurofibromatosis Type 1</a></h4>

              
                Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a rare genetic condition characterised by skin pigmentations, bone deformities, and tumours. Its cognitive phenotype shares similarities with autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, including impairments in executive function and working memory processing. In this work, we conducted functional connectivity and graph theory analysis of fMRI data from a sample of neurotypical adolescents (N = 26) and a sample of adolescent NF1 - participants (N = 43). Whole brain comparisons demonstrated that during working memory conditions NF1 participants have greater connectivity in left posterior parietal regions, particularly converging at the postcentral gyrus. Comparison of communication between functional networks demonstrated that NF1 participants have increased connectivity between visual, sensorimotor, dorsal attention and limbic networks. Individual connections were weaker in NF1 participants across the brain, and we found reduced connectivity between control, dorsal attention and default networks in NF1. Furthermore, connectivity strength in these networks was predictive of accuracy and response time in NF1 participants during the task performance. Finally, graph theory analysis showed that working memory demands evoked reorganisation towards greater assortativity in NF1 participants, which was predictive of poorer accuracy and accuracy-speed trade-off. These findings highlight that NF1 participants' working memory deficits emerge from reduced engagement of executive processes, and NF1 participants demonstrate coping mechanisms such as enhanced sensorimotor processing and network reorganisation towards greater segregation, that is however detrimental to cognitive performance.

">Neuronal networks in the dorsal hippocampus causally regulate rescue behavior in mice</a></h4>

              
                Prosocial behaviors, such as rescuing individuals in need, are crucial for social cohesion across species. While key brain regions involved in rescue behavior have been identified, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. The hippocampus (HPC), known for its role in memory and spatial navigation, also contributes to emotional and social processing. However, its specific involvement in prosocial behavior is not well understood. Here, we investigate the causal role of the HPC in learning and executing rescue behavior in mice. Using chemogenetics, we show that the dorsal HPC (dHPC), but not the ventral HPC (vHPC), is essential for acquiring rescue behavior. Calcium imaging of the dHPC reveals network consolidation during successful rescues, with distinct synchronized ensembles and activity patterns linked to liberations of an individual in need. These findings establish a novel role for the dHPC in prosocial behavior, providing insights into the neural mechanisms underlying empathy-driven actions.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The primary motor cortex (M1) is increasingly being recognized for its vital role in proprioceptive somatosensation. However, our current understanding of proprioceptive processing at the laminar scale is limited. Empirical findings in primates and rodents suggest a pronounced role of superficial cortical layers, but the involvement of deep layers has yet to be examined in humans. Submillimeter resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged in recent years, paving the way for studying layer-dependent activity in humans (laminar fMRI). In the present study, laminar fMRI was employed to investigate the influence of proprioceptive somatosensation on M1 deep layer activation using passive finger movements. Significant M1 deep layer activation was observed in response to proprioceptive stimulation across 10 healthy subjects using a vascular space occupancy (VASO)-sequence at 7 T. For further validation, two additional datasets were included which were obtained using a balanced steady-state free precession sequence with ultrahigh (0.3 mm) in-plane resolution, yielding converging results. These results were interpreted in the light of previous laminar fMRI studies and the active inference account of motor control. We propose that a considerable proportion of M1 deep layer activation is due to proprioceptive influence and that deep layers of M1 constitute a key component in proprioceptive circuits.</span>

<p>p75NTR expression in the brain of the basal vertebrate <i>Scyliorhinus canicula</i> revealed its conservation across species. Functional conservation among vertebrates was demonstrated (i) by performing the canonical PC-12 differentiation assay with the <i>S. canicula</i> NGF and (ii) by complementing the p75NTR absence in a PC-12 p75NTR<sup>−</sup>/<sup>−</sup> knock-out clone with the <i>S. canicula</i> p75NTR.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The p75NTR receptor, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, can participate in signaling pathways either by forming heteromeric complexes with other receptors, such as the Trk family (tropomyosin receptor kinases), or by functioning independently. p75NTR was investigated prevalently in the brain and retina of mammals, whereas almost nothing is known about its conservation among species. Here, we reconstructed the phylogenetic arb of p75NTR and described for the first time the p75NTR expression in the brain of the basal vertebrate Chondrichthyan <i>Scyliorhinus canicula</i> (<i>S. canicula</i>), uncovering the existing parallelism between ancient vertebrates and mammals. p75NTR functional conservation among vertebrates was further investigated by cloning the <i>S. canicula</i> nerve growth factor (NGF) and performing the canonical posterior commissure (PC)-12 differentiation assay, which results in standard neurite-like production. We then investigated the <i>S. canicula</i> p75NTR, which proves to be capable of complementing a specific clone of PC-12 lacking p75NTR (PC-12 p75NTR<sup>−</sup>/<sup>−</sup>). All together, our results highlighted the expression and functional conservation of p75NTR among vertebrates during the evolution.</p>

                <p>A decline in cognitive abilities is associated with the aging process, affecting nearly 33% of US adults over the age of 70, and is a risk factor for the development of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Several studies have reported age-related alterations in the transcriptome in the hippocampus, a major site of memory storage that is among the first regions impacted with age, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. However, much remains unknown about why these transcriptional changes exist in the aged hippocampus and how this impacts memory late in life. Here, we show that monoubiquitination of histone H2B (H2Bubi), an epigenetic mechanism recently reported to be major regulator of the epigenome and transcriptome during memory formation in the young adult brain, decreases with age in the hippocampus of male rats. In vivo CRISPR-dCas9&ndash;mediated upregulation of <I>Rnf20</I>, the only ubiquitin E3 ligase for H2B, in the hippocampus significantly improved memory retention in aged rats. Remarkably, RNA-seq analysis revealed that in addition to the 18 genes typically upregulated in the aged rat hippocampus following contextual fear conditioning, <I>Rnf20</I> upregulation caused learning-related increases and decreases in 40 and 11 unique genes, respectively, suggesting that these 51 genes may be among those most critical for improving memory in advanced age. Together, these data suggest that H2B monoubiquitination is a significant regulator of age-related dysregulation of the transcriptome and impairments in memory.</p>

                <p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and nonmotor symptoms. Its pathological hallmarks include the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein (&alpha;-Syn) in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. Phosphorylation of &alpha;-Syn is a prominent feature of these inclusions, but its role in disease pathogenesis remains unclear. To identify the role of &alpha;-Syn phosphorylation in synucleinopathy, we generated two <I>Snca</I> knock-in (KI) mouse models carrying phosphomimetic mutations at SncaY39 or SncaS129 (<I>Snca<sup>Y39E</sup></I> or <I>Snca<sup>S129D</sup></I>) which manipulated epitopes phosphorylated in the PD brain. Both <I>Snca<sup>Y39E</sup></I> and <I>Snca<sup>S129D</sup></I> KI mice displayed increased &alpha;-Syn phosphorylation, enhanced oligomer formation, and a shift of &alpha;-Syn localization from membrane-bound to cytoplasm. However, neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra was not observed up to 24&nbsp;months of age. These findings demonstrate that mimicking the phosphorylation of Y39 or S129 can induce endogenous &alpha;-Syn phosphorylation. Still, a single phosphomimetic mutation alone is insufficient to induce PD-like behavior and pathology in the mouse's lifespan. Overall, our study provides a mouse model for investigating the role of phosphorylation at Y39 and S129 &alpha;-Syn epitopes in vivo.</p>

Human affective experience varies along the dimensions of valence (positivity or negativity) and arousal (high or low activation). It remains unclear how these dimensions are represented in the brain and whether the representations are shared across different individuals and diverse situational contexts. In this study, we first utilized two publicly available functional MRI datasets of participants watching movies to build predictive models of moment-to-moment emotional arousal and valence from dynamic functional brain connectivity. We tested the models by predicting emotional arousal and valence both within and across datasets. Our results revealed a generalizable arousal representation characterized by the interactions between multiple large-scale functional networks. The arousal representation generalized to two additional movie-watching datasets with different participants viewing different movies. In contrast, we did not find evidence of a generalizable valence representation. Taken together, our findings reveal a generalizable representation of emotional arousal embedded in patterns of dynamic functional connectivity, suggesting a common underlying neural signature of emotional arousal across individuals and situational contexts. We have made our model and analysis scripts publicly available to facilitate its use by other researchers in decoding moment-to-moment emotional arousal in novel datasets, providing a new tool to probe affective experience using fMRI.
