                Background This study delves into the intricate interplay among paradoxical leadership (PL), employees’ proactive work behaviour (EPWB), and perceived psychological contract fulfilment (PPCF). PL, characterized by its simultaneous emphasis on apparently contradictory behaviours, has garnered attention due to its potential to foster innovation, adaptability, and creativity. The study’s main objective is to thoroughly explore the complexities of PL, its influence on EPWB, and whether the PPCF serves as a mediator. Methods A survey was distributed to 338 hotel and travel agency employees to gather data. The data was analysed using structural equation modelling through a SmartPLS program. Results The results reveal a positive correlation between PL and EPWB. Additionally, PPCF partially mediates this relationship, indicating its vital role in exploring the positive impact of PL on boosting proactive behaviours. Conclusions This research brings forth meaningful contributions to both theoretical and practical dimensions. Theoretically, it enhances our comprehension of how PL manifests in the distinctive landscape of the hospitality and tourism domain, substantiating its potential to drive proactive behaviours among employees. The mediation of PPCF enriches our grasp of the underlying mechanisms, accentuating the significance of maintaining harmonized and consistent leadership practices. From a practical vantage point, these findings offer valuable insights for hospitality and tourism establishments aspiring to optimize their leadership strategies for cultivating proactive work behaviour among their workforces.

                Background The pedicle screw rod system is believed to correction of 3-dimensional deformity and maintain the results of the correction, so the better sagittal balance correction can be expected. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 43 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients who performed correction, stabilization and posterior fusion to determine the effect of spinal and spinopelvic components on sagittal balance correction. X-ray data were measured for thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis as the spinal components and pelvic incidence (PI), pelvic tilt (PT), and sacral slope (SS) as the spinopelvic components. Further evaluations include sagittal spinal balance (C7PL), global sagittal balance, and sacrofemoral distance pre- and post-surgery. Statistical evaluation is performed to determine the correlation between the spinal and the spinopelvic components and the achievement of sagittal balance correction. Results TK/Sagittal Modifier obtained a significant correction with an average is 18.69° (±9.57), while LL (lumbar lordosis) has 44.58 ° (±11.94). Average of C7PL correction is 0.68 cm (±3.13), Global Sagittal Balance is -2.04 cm (±3.24), and SCFD is 2.69 cm (±2.48). The TK/LL degree doesn’t significantly influence on Global Sagittal Balance and C7PL. The TK degree significantly affects SCFD, whereas LL doesn’t significantly affect SCFD. Changes in each spinopelvic component are not significant in affecting Global Sagittal Balance. Conclusions Correction and stabilization of AIS’s patients using the pedicle screw rod system resulted in significant Spinal Component TK/Sagittal Modifier and LL correction. Meanwhile, Spinopelvic Components didn’t achieve significant correction. Mean correction of C7PL is -2.66 (±4.4) and Global Sagittal is -3.11 cm (±4.94), SCFD only managed to correct 37.3%. Global Sagittal Balance is not significantly affected by all components of Spinopelvic components, while the C7PL is only affected by PT. Only PT and SS that significantly affected SCFD.

                <p>Tic disorders (TD) are characterized by the presence of motor and/or vocal tics. Common neurophysiological frameworks suggest dysregulations of the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) brain circuit that controls movement execution. Besides common tics, there are other "non-tic" symptoms that are primarily related to sensory perception, sensorimotor integration, attention, and social cognition. The existence of these symptoms, the sensory tic triggers, and the modifying effect of attention and cognitive control mechanisms on tics may indicate the salience network's (SN) involvement in the neurophysiology of TD. Resting-state functional MRI measurements were performed in 26 participants with TD and 25 healthy controls (HC). The group differences in resting-state functional connectivity patterns were measured based on seed-to-voxel connectivity analyses. Compared to HC, patients with TD exhibited altered connectivity between the core regions of the SN (insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and temporoparietal junction) and sensory, associative, and motor-related cortices. Furthermore, connectivity changes were observed in relation to the severity of tics in the TD group. The SN, particularly the insula, is likely to be an important site of dysregulation in TD. Our results provide evidence for large-scale neural deviations in TD beyond the CSTC pathologies. These findings may be relevant for developing treatment targets.</p>

                Background Previous Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) of obesity susceptibility genes in different populations have confirmed the association of some variants with obesity, body mass index (BMI), and some related metabolic traits. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to investigate the genetic basis of obesity in the Jordanian population. The aim of our study is to investigate the occurrence and frequency of obesity-related genes in Jordanian individuals and any possible relationship between SNP genetic markers and phenotypic characteristics of studied individuals. Methods A total of 150 Jordanian unrelated adults, including 83 obese, 26 overweight, and 41 normal-weight subjects, were genotyped using the high resolution melt analysis (HRMA) and tested for the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs2167270 in LEP gene and rs1137100 in LEPR gene, with obesity risk, obesity/overweight risk, BMI, weight, height, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood level glucose. Results A significant association between obesity risk and the rs2167270 mutation in LEP gene was observed under a dominant model (odds ratio (OR) = 2.5147, 95% CI =1.0629 to 5.9494, p = 0.0358). A marginal (not significant) association between BMI and the rs2167270 mutation in LEP gene (p = 0.075), was also detected. Moreover, an association between rs2167270 mutation in LEP gene and glucose blood level was observed (p = 0.038). Total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol also presented a weak association with the rs1137100 mutation in LEPR gene, with p = 0.071 and p = 0.078, respectively. Additionally, no significant association between LDL-cholesterol and the rs2167270 mutation in LEP gene was observed (p = 0.091). By contrast, there was no association between weight or height and the SNPs mutation evaluated in this study (p > 0.05). Conclusions These results suggest that some SNPs in some obesity-related genes may contribute to obesity risk and its related anthropometric and metabolic traits in Jordanian population. To confirm these results, further studies on a larger Jordanian cohort should be carried out.

                Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, especially those on hemodialysis, are at increased risk of developing hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Guidelines suggest that all patients with CKD should be vaccinated against HBV, but these guidelines are usually not followed. We conducted this study to know the status of vaccination against HBV in CKD patients on regular hemodialysis. Methods This observational descriptive study was conducted at the Department of Medicine, Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Teaching Hospital, Poonch Medical College Rawalakot , and POF Teaching Hospital, Wah Medical College Wah Cantt, from March to July 2019. Patients reporting to the dialysis center of both hospitals on regular dialysis were included in the study. Patient information (HBV vaccination status, age, gender, education, socioeconomic status, duration of CKD and duration of dialysis) were collected on a specially designed questionnaire. The statistical analysis of data was done in SPSS for Windows, version 20. Results A total 149 patients were included in the study, 63.1% were male and 36.9% were female. Out of these 24.2% were uneducated, 33.6% had 1–10 years school education, 38.2% had 10–14 years education, and 4% had more than 14 years education. About 35% patients were from low socioeconomic class, 54% from middle and 11% from higher class. Only 45.6% (n=68) of patients were vaccinated and 54.4% (n=81) were not vaccinated against HBV. Vaccination status was significantly associated with education (p=0.004) and socioeconomic status (p=0.008). Conclusion The HBV status of patients on regular hemodialysis is not satisfactory at the two centers observed. It is associated with education and socioeconomic status of the patient.

                Background Gender equity in academia is a significant challenge. To investigate career advancement perspectives of mid-career female physician-scientists, identify their needs and barriers, and develop a mentor-sponsorship strategy to improve their representation in higher academic ranks. Methods In this qualitative study, conducted at a Western European academic medical center, we interviewed 19 mid-career female physician-scientists across all specialties, including radiology. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results Four themes were identified: 1. Horizontal and vertical ambitions, (i.e., knowledge expansion and hierarchical advancement) 2. Evaluation of talent, 3. Career path needs, and 4. Receiving support. These themes revealed barriers to women's advancement, including limited talent recognition, inadequate leadership support, self-limiting beliefs, structural issues, and lack of networking opportunities. To address these challenges, a mentor-sponsorship program should prioritize sponsor training, start immediately at the beginning of the mid-career phase (attainment of assistant professorship), emphasize horizontal and vertical development, take work-life balance into account, establish mentor networks, and allow individuals to choose mentors and sponsors based on their needs and aspirations. Conclusions This study has identified key needs and barriers that impede the advancement of female physician-scientists in academia. To address these challenges, a tailored mentor-sponsorship program is recommended. Key program elements include training leadership to recognize talent and offer proactive support, starting at the onset of the mid-career phase, emphasizing horizontal and vertical development, and establishing a strong mentor-sponsor network with thoughtful matching. These actions can help to overcome obstacles and facilitate the progress of women in academia.

                This study aimed to validate the Worker Well-Being Questionnaire, originally developed by the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, in the Malay language. The translation process involved an initial independent translation by a professional translator, followed by a comparison of translations to synthesize a unified version, which was subsequently back-translated. The back-translations were then reviewed by an expert committee to create a finalized questionnaire version. The results of this validation study indicate a high level of satisfaction, demonstrating an excellent fit with confirmatory factor analysis (CFI and TLI values ranging from 0.96 to 0.99) and a low root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA values ranging from 0.03 to 0.07). Moreover, the questionnaire exhibits sound internal consistency, with Cronbach’s alpha values exceeding 0.7, and the factor structures align with theoretical expectations. In conclusion, the Malay version of the questionnaire faithfully reproduces the original instrument, enabling a robust and efficient assessment of workers’ well.

                Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created the need to evaluate drugs such as favipiravir (FPV), an antiviral inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), and Maraviroc (MVC), an antiretroviral that antagonizes the chemokine receptor CCR5, which could affect the modulation of inflammation and viral replication in the treatment of COVID-19. We sought to evaluate the effect of MVC and/or FPV plus systemic steroid (SS) vs. SS alone on the viral load and progression to critical disease. Methods Sixteen patients with severe COVID-19 were evaluated in three treatment arms: 1) SS only (n=6), 2) SS plus one test drug MVC or FPV (n=5), and 3) SS plus both test drugs (MVC and FPV, n=5). The viral load was determined for N, E, and RdRp viral genes. Results A significant decrease in viral load was observed in the three treatment groups, with a larger effect size in the group that combined SS with both test drugs. The E, N, and RdRp genes with Cohen’s d were 120%, 123%, and 50%, respectively. Conclusions The largest effect on viral load reduction, as measured by effect size, was observed in the combination treatment group; however, no statistical significance was found, and it did not prevent progression to critical illness.

                Background There is an essential need for cardiomyocyte regeneration among patients with heart failure. Transplantation of dedifferentiated fat (DFAT) cells may lead to an improvement of cardiomyocyte regeneration among heart failure patients. We believe that DFAT cells are promising candidate cell sources for cardiac regeneration. However, the pathway underlying how DFAT cells of the adipose lineage differentiate into mature cardiomyocytes isn’t fully understood. Methods We conducted an experimental laboratory study on isolated DFAT cells from adipose tissue of healthy adults. Then, we treated cells with different concentrations of reversine (10, 20 and 40 nM), and performed RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. Next, we used a ceiling culture method based on the buoyancy properties of mature lipid-filled adipocytes. Stemness expression (Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 [Oct4], brachyury, Fetal liver kinase 1 [Flk-1]) was quantified by reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q)PCR, while cardiomyocyte expression (Transcription factor GATA-4 [GATA4] and cardiac troponin T [cTnT]) was quantified by immunocytochemistry. Results ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc found that 10 nM reversine increased greater Flk-1 expression compared to the control group (MD: 5.037 + 0.998; p < 0.001), but there were no significant changes among Oct4 (MD: 0.013 + 1.244; p = 0.99) and brachyury expression (MD: 0.157 + 0.084; p = 0.252). Kruskal-Wallis revealed that the expression of GATA4 (1.65 [0.41-1.98] to 0.015 [0.007-0.034]; p =0.017) reduced significantly from day 7 until day 21 and cTnT (5.07 [6.62-8.91] to 8.22 [6.81-9.40]; p= 0.001) increased significantly from day 7 until day 21. Conclusions Reversine could increase the expression of Flk-1, but it was unable to stimulate the expression of Oct4 and brachyury related to cell stemness. An optimal concentration of 10 nM reversine may have the greatest effect on enhancing the differentiation of DFAT cells into mature cardiomyocytes, as indicated by higher cTnT expression between cells.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-617/v1?src=rss">Zoom fatigue related to online learning among medical students in Thailand:  Prevalence, predictors, and association with depression [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the learning pattern of medical students shifted from onsite to online. This transition may contribute to what has been called “Zoom fatigue.” This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of Zoom fatigue related to online learning, identify associated factors of Zoom fatigue, and explore its correlation with depression among medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among 1st to 6th-year Thai medical students. The online survey was administered using a demographic and health behavior questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Thai version of the Zoom Exhaustion & Fatigue Scale (ZEF-T). Results Among the 386 participating students, 221 (57%) were female, with a mean age of 20.6 years. The prevalence of high Zoom fatigue was 9.6%. In the multivariable regression analysis, a lower academic year and a higher number of online learning sessions were significant predictors of Zoom fatigue (p < 0.001), while regular exercise emerged as a protective factor (p = 0.009). The prevalence of depressive disorder was 61.9%, and a significant correlation was found between having a depressive disorder and experiencing Zoom fatigue (p = 0.004). Conclusion Zoom fatigue among medical students was correlated with depression. Consequently, medical students experiencing Zoom fatigue should undergo further assessment for depression. It is crucial to closely monitor medical students in lower academic years with a high number of online sessions for signs of Zoom fatigue. Additionally, implementing strategies, such as reducing the frequency of online sessions and promoting regular exercise, may help alleviate the symptoms.

                Background Two-wheeled vehicles are the major mode of transportation in India. Such vehicles are exposed to excessive vibration on the road when compared to four-wheeled vehicles. However, the research on the reduction of whole body vibration in the case of two-wheelers is not explored in detail. The present study predicts rider comfort in the case of an electric two-wheeler as per ISO 2631-1, by obtaining the finding the weighted acceleration at the strategic locations of vibration at the test rig. Methods An electric two-wheeler test rig is used in the study. The values of acceleration from the test rig in running conditions are obtained by using NI LabVIEW 2019. The drive cycle of the electric vehicle (EV) test rig is controlled by Sync sols’ EV lab software. Obtaining the weighted root mean square (RMS) acceleration from running the test setup, it is compared with the ISO 2631-1 standard to obtain the rider comfort. Results Loading area, traction motor, base mount, and suspension were found to be the strategic points of vibration. Frequency weighted RMS acceleration of 0.3 to 0.4 m/s2 obtained at these points are prone to cause discomfort for the rider. Vehicle speed, road profile, and duration of exposure were found to be important parameters affecting the rider’s comfort. A maximum of 4.6 m/s2 amplitude was observed. The loading area, which corresponds to a rider’s seat in actual vehicle, is important and reduction of these vibrations make the ride comfortable for the rider. Suspension and base mount of the test rig are found to be uncomfortable observing the weighted RMS acceleration. Conclusions A suitable damping technique design is very much essential in reducing these vibrations and improve the rider comfort, as many more non-deterministic vibrations are prone to cause dis-comfort in case of actual on road riding conditions.

                Abstract* Background Telemedicine has improved adherence to heart failure (HF) treatment, however it has not yet been tailored specifically to address HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Our objective is to undertake a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of existing research studies that focus on telemedicine in HFrEF. Methods We conducted an extensive literature review encompassing trials which included outpatients with HFrEF who underwent telemedicine compared with usual care. We exclude any studies without ejection fraction data. Three bibliographic databases from PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library were utilized in our search from January 1999 to May 2023. The endpoints of interest included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular-related mortality, all-cause hospitalization, and HF-related hospitalization. The Cochrane risk-of-bias (RoB) and the risk of bias in non-randomized studies – of interventions (ROBINS-I) were used for non-randomized or observational studies. To quantitatively analyze the collective findings, a pooled odds ratio (OR) was computed for each outcome. Results Out of the initial pool of 4,947 articles, we narrowed down our analysis to 27 studies, Results showed that telemedicine significantly reduced all-cause mortality (OR: 0.65; 95% CI 0.54 – 0.78; p<0.00001), cardiovascular-related mortality (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58 – 0.80, p < 0.00001), and HF-related hospitalization based on number of events (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64 – 0.94, p = 0.009) as well as number of patients (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 – 0.87, p < 0.0001). Conclusion Telemedicine was shown significantly beneficial in decreasing mortality and hospitalization in HFrEF patients. Future research should focus on standardizing effective telemedicine practices due to the existing variability in methods and clinical situation of the patients.

                Introduction Hemiplegia is the common term used to describe a multitude of clinical problems associated with a stroke. Hemiplegic stroke accounts for 70-85% of all first strokes. Trunk stability is impaired due to hypertonia and weakness in hemiplegia. Impaired trunk control leads to gait and postural abnormalities which if left untreated causes permanent disability in hemiplegics. Objective To investigate the scope of research on the benefits of explicit training using Neurodevelopmental Therapy (NDT) for enhancing tone and postural control in subjects with hemiplegic stroke. Methods In order to adhere to established protocols of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, the systematic review will be carried out to find pertinent studies published up to the search date, and a thorough search strategy will be applied across popular electronic databases including PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane Library. This systematic review methodology has been registered in PROSPERO for rigorous and transparent dissemination of study search, synthesis, and analysis. Discussion As the motor impairments due to abnormal tone and postural impairment in hemiplegic stroke substantially impact a stroke survivor’s quality of life, this study will provide a thorough and methodical approach to synthesize and report the merits and demerits on the effectiveness of NDT in enhancing tone and postural control, considering the potential variability in interventions and outcomes, and the methodological rigor of particular studies. The review also intends to provide significant insights for clinicians, researchers, and policymakers by critically analysing and summarizing the present state of research in this domain. This will facilitate evidence-based decision-making in rehabilitation techniques for patients with hemiplegic stroke. Systematic Review Registration number CRD42023476137

                <p>by Nikolaos M. Dimitriou, Salvador Flores-Torres, Maria Kyriakidou, Joseph Matthew Kinsella, Georgios D. Mitsis</p>

Cell sedimentation in 3D hydrogel cultures refers to the vertical migration of cells towards the bottom of the space. Understanding this poorly examined phenomenon may allow us to design better protocols to prevent it, as well as provide insights into the mechanobiology of cancer development. We conducted a multiscale experimental and mathematical examination of 3D cancer growth in triple negative breast cancer cells. Migration was examined in the presence and absence of Paclitaxel, in high and low adhesion environments and in the presence of fibroblasts. The observed behaviour was modeled by hypothesizing active migration due to self-generated chemotactic gradients. Our results confirmed this hypothesis, whereby migration was likely to be regulated by the MAPK and TGF-βpathways. The mathematical model enabled us to describe the experimental data in absence (normalized error<40%) and presence of Paclitaxel (normalized error<10%), suggesting inhibition of random motion and advection in the latter case. Inhibition of sedimentation in low adhesion and co-culture experiments further supported the conclusion that cells actively migrated downwards due to the presence of signals produced by cells already attached to the adhesive glass surface.

                Tyrosine-protein kinase SYK, encoded by the SYK gene, is a non-receptor type protein kinase which mediates immune signal transduction through immunoreceptors. Tyrosine-protein kinase SYK expression has been associated with the development of various inflammatory diseases, cancer and neurodegenerative conditions. The reproducibility of tyrosine-protein kinase SYK research would help elucidate the mechanism in which it causes neuroinflammation as well as its potential as a novel target to treat Alzheimer’s disease. This would be facilitated with the availability of high-quality tyrosine-protein kinase SYK. In this study, we characterized thirteen tyrosine-protein kinase SYK commercial antibodies for Western Blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. We identified many high-performing antibodies and encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibody for their specific needs.

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We showed that grafts migrate to the whole brain and form functional synaptic connections in amyloid precursor protein gene/ presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) chimeric mice. Following transplantation of hiMGEs, behavioral deficits and AD-related pathology were alleviated and defective neurons were repaired. Notably, exosomes secreted from hiMGEs, which are rich in anti-inflammatory miRNA, inhibited astrocyte activation <i>in</i>
<i>vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, and the mechanism was related to regulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells mediated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathway.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that hiMGEs transplantation is an alternative treatment for neuronal loss in AD and demonstrate that exosomes with anti-inflammatory activity derived from hiMGEs are important factors for graft survival. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Cerebral vasculitis is a rare but severe complication of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), presenting significant challenges in management due to its potential for devastating neurological consequences and poor prognosis. We present a case of an 18-year-old female with known SLE who presented with seizures, declining cognitive function, and unresponsiveness. Neurological examination, laboratory investigations, and radiological imaging supported the diagnosis of cerebral vasculitis secondary to SLE. Despite aggressive immunosuppressive therapy, the patient’s neurological status continued to deteriorate, leading to respiratory failure and multiorgan dysfunction. Ultimately, the patient succumbed to multiorgan failure attributed to severe CNS vasculitis and its complications. This case underscores the importance of early recognition and aggressive management of cerebral vasculitis in SLE while highlighting the need for further research into more effective therapeutic strategies to improve patient outcomes.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore the clinical progression of the brain-/body-first categories within Lewy body disease (LBD): Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and PD dementia.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used of the Rochester Epidemiology Project to establish a population-based cohort of clinically diagnosed LBD. We used two definitions for differentiating between brain- and body-first LBD: a previously hypothesized body-first presentation in patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior onset before motor symptoms onset; and an expanded definition of body-first LBD when a patient had at least 2 premotor symptoms between constipation, erectile dysfunction, rapid eye movement sleep behavior, anosmia, or neurogenic bladder.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Brain-first patients were more likely to be diagnosed with PD (RR = 1.43, <i>p</i> = 0.003), whereas body-first patients were more likely to be diagnosed with DLB (RR = 3.15, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Under the expanded definition, there was no difference in LBD diagnosis between brain-first and body-first patients (PD: RR = 1.03, <i>p</i> = 0.10; DLB: RR = 0.88, <i>p</i> = 0.58) There were no patterns between brain- or body-first presentation, PD dementia under either definition (original: <i>p</i> = 0.09, expanded: <i>p</i> = 0.97), and no significant difference in motor symptoms between brain-first and body-first.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings do not support the dichotomous classification of body-first and brain-first LBD with the currently proposed definition. Biological exposures resulting in PD and DLB are unlikely to converge on a binary classification of top-down or bottom-up synuclein pathology. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background Motor learning is central to human existence, such as learning to speak or walk, sports moves, or rehabilitation after injury. Evidence suggests that all forms of motor learning share an evolutionarily conserved molecular plasticity pathway. Here, we present novel insights into the neural processes underlying operant self-learning, a form of motor learning in the fruit fly Drosophila. Methods We operantly trained wild type and transgenic Drosophila fruit flies, tethered at the torque meter, in a motor learning task that required them to initiate and maintain turning maneuvers around their vertical body axis (yaw torque). We combined this behavioral experiment with transgenic peptide expression, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated, spatio-temporally controlled gene knock-out and confocal microscopy. Results We find that expression of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) in direct wing steering motoneurons co-expressing the transcription factor FoxP is necessary for this type of motor learning and that aPKC likely acts via non-canonical pathways. We also found that it takes more than a week for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of FoxP in adult animals to impair motor learning, suggesting that adult FoxP expression is required for operant self-learning. Conclusions Our experiments suggest that, for operant self-learning, a type of motor learning in Drosophila, co-expression of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and the transcription factor FoxP is necessary in direct wing steering motoneurons. Some of these neurons control the wing beat amplitude when generating optomotor responses, and we have discovered modulation of optomotor behavior after operant self-learning. We also discovered that aPKC likely acts via non-canonical pathways and that FoxP expression is also required in adult flies.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a barrier between the circulatory system and the central nervous system (CNS), contributing to CNS protection and maintaining the brain homeostasis. Establishment of in vitro BBB models that are closer to the microenvironment of the human brain is helpful for evaluating the potential and efficiency of a drug penetrating BBB and thus the clinical application value of the drug. The in vitro BBB models not only provide great convenience for screening new drugs that can access to CNS but also help people to have a deeper study on the mechanism of substances entering and leaving the brain, which makes people have greater opportunities in the treatment of CNS diseases. Up to now, although much effort has been paid to the researches on the in vitro BBB models and many progresses have been achieved, no unified method has been described for establishing a BBB model and there is much work to do and many challenges to be faced with in the future. This review summarizes the research progresses in the establishment, evaluation, and application of in vitro BBB models.</p>

<p>The new rTMS therapeutic module (iTBS) can alter microglial polarization and improve motor dysfunction and neuroinflammation with ischemic stroke in mice.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuroinflammation caused by excessive microglial activation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive neuromodulatory technique that has recently been reported to regulate microglial functions and exert anti-inflammatory effects. The intermittent burst stimulation (iTBS) regimen in rTMS improves neuronal excitability. However, whether iTBS exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by stimulating neurons and thereby modulating microglial polarization remains unclear. Motor function was assessed after 1 week of rTMS (iTBS regimen) treatment in adult male mice with occlusion/reperfusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO/r) injury. We also investigated the molecular biological alterations associated with microglial polarization using a cell proliferation assay, multiplex cytokine bioassays, and immunofluorescence staining. iTBS regimen can improve balance and motor coordination function, increase spontaneous movement, and improve walking function in mice with early cerebral ischemia injury. Expression levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-10 increased significantly in mice with MCAO injury. Especially, rTMS significantly increased the number of proliferating cells in the infarcted cortex. The fluorescence intensity of MAP2 in the peri-infarct area of MCAO injured mice was low, but the signal was broader. Compared with MCAO group, the fluorescence intensity of MAP2 in rTMS group was significantly increased. rTMS inhibited pro-inflammatory M1 activation (Iba1<sup>+</sup>/CD86<sup>+</sup>) and improved anti-inflammatory M2 activation (Iba1<sup>+</sup>/CD206<sup>+</sup>) in the peri-infarct zone, thus significantly changing the phenotypic ratio M1/M2. rTMS improves motor dysfunction and neuroinflammation after cerebral I/R injury in mice by regulating microglial polarization.</p>

                Neurons have high energy demands. In a recent study, Looser et al. identified oligodendrocyte Kir4.1 as the activity-dependent driver of oligodendrocyte glycolysis that ensures that lactate is supplied to active neurons. Given that oligodendrocyte Kir4.1 also influenced axonal glucose consumption and uptake, oligodendrocytes may play a broader role in neuronal metabolic regulation.

                In the nervous system, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) control neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and, ultimately, behavior through spatiotemporally precise initiation of a variety of signaling pathways. However, despite their critical importance, there is incomplete understanding of how these receptors are regulated to tune their signaling to specific neurophysiological contexts. A deeper mechanistic picture of neuromodulatory GPCR function is needed to fully decipher their biological roles and effectively harness them for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. In this review, we highlight recent progress in identifying novel modes of regulation of neuromodulatory GPCRs, including G protein- and receptor-targeting mechanisms, receptor–receptor crosstalk, and unique features that emerge in the context of chemical synapses. These emerging principles of neuromodulatory GPCR tuning raise critical questions to be tackled at the molecular, cellular, synaptic, and neural circuit levels in the future.

                Xu and Wang developed a reporter to visualize unfolded protein accumulation in the ER lumen in living cells. Upon unfolded protein binding, this reporter forms fluorescence puncta fast and reversibly, enabling live imaging of ER stress and better understanding of how it correlates with the unfolded protein response.

                Creamer et al. show that a protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic isoform is sequestered into aggregates to regulate PKA kinase activity in response to heat stress. Reversible sequestration requires the Hsp42 chaperone, providing a mechanism to control a key cellular signaling pathway in a catalytic-isoform-specific manner.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62999">A unique multi-synaptic mechanism involving acetylcholine and GABA regulates dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens through early adolescence in male rats</a></h4>

              
                Adolescence is characterized by changes in reward-related behaviors, social behaviors, and decision making. These behavioral changes are necessary for the transition into adulthood, but they also increase vulnerability to the development of a range of psychiatric disorders. Major reorganization of the dopamine system during adolescence is thought to underlie, in part, the associated behavioral changes and increased vulnerability. Here, we utilized fast scan cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis to examine differences in dopamine release as well as mechanisms that underlie differential dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core of adolescent (P28-35) and adult (P70-90) male rats. We show baseline differences between adult and adolescent stimulated dopamine release in male rats, as well as opposite effects of the a6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) on modulating dopamine release. The a6-selective blocker, a-conotoxin, increased dopamine release in early adolescent rats, but decreased dopamine release in rats beginning in middle adolescence and extending through adulthood. Strikingly, blockade of GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B </sub>receptors revealed that this a6-mediated increase in adolescent dopamine release requires NAc GABA signaling to occur. We confirm the role of a6 nAChR and GABA in mediating this effect <i>in vivo</i> using microdialysis. Results herein suggest a multisynaptic mechanism potentially unique to the period of development that includes early adolescence, involving acetylcholine acting at a6-containing nAChRs to drive inhibitory GABA tone on dopamine release.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85914">The interferon-rich skin environment regulates Langerhans cell ADAM17 to promote photosensitivity in lupus</a></h4>

              
                The autoimmune disease lupus erythematosus (lupus) is characterized by photosensitivity, where even ambient ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure can lead to development of inflammatory skin lesions. We have previously shown that Langerhans cells (LCs) limit keratinocyte apoptosis and photosensitivity via a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17)-mediated release of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands and that LC ADAM17 sheddase activity is reduced in lupus. Here, we sought to understand how the lupus skin environment contributes to LC ADAM17 dysfunction and, in the process, differentiate between effects on LC ADAM17 sheddase function, LC ADAM17 expression, and LC numbers. We show through transcriptomic analysis a shared IFN-rich environment in non-lesional skin across human lupus and three murine models: MRL/lpr, B6.Sle1yaa, and imiquimod (IMQ) mice. IFN-I inhibits LC ADAM17 sheddase activity in murine and human LCs, and IFNAR blockade in lupus model mice restores LC ADAM17 sheddase activity, all without consistent effects on LC ADAM17 protein expression or LC numbers. Anti-IFNAR-mediated LC ADAM17 sheddase function restoration is associated with reduced photosensitive responses that are dependent on EGFR signaling and LC ADAM17. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a known mediator of ADAM17 activity; we show that UVR-induced LC ROS production is reduced in lupus model mice, restored by anti-IFNAR, and is cytoplasmic in origin. Our findings suggest that IFN-I promotes photosensitivity at least in part by inhibiting UVR-induced LC ADAM17 sheddase function and raise the possibility that anifrolumab ameliorates lupus skin disease in part by restoring this function. This work provides insight into IFN-I-mediated disease mechanisms, LC regulation, and a potential mechanism of action for anifrolumab in lupus.

">Modulation of beta oscillatory dynamics in motor and frontal areas during physical fatigue</a></h4>

              
                Beta-band oscillations have been suggested to promote the maintenance of the current motor (or cognitive) set, thus signaling the status quo of the system. While this hypothesis has been reliably demonstrated in many studies, it fails to explain changes in beta-band activity due to the accumulation of physical fatigue. In the current study, we aimed to reconcile the functional role of beta oscillations during physical fatigue within the status quo theory. Using an innovative EEG design, we identified two distinct beta-band power dynamics in the motor areas as fatigue rises: (i) an enhancement at rest, supposedly promoting the resting state, and (ii) a decrease during contraction, thought to reflect the increase in motor cortex activation necessary to cope with the muscular fatigue. We then conducted effective connectivity analyses, which revealed that the modulations during contractions were driven by frontal areas. Finally, we implement a biologically plausible model to replicate and characterize our results mechanistically. Together, our findings anchor the physical fatigue paradigm within the status quo theory, thus shedding light on the functional role of beta oscillations in physical fatigue. We further discuss a unified interpretation that might explain the conflicting evidence previously encountered in the physical fatigue literature.

">Impact of cardiometabolic factors and blood beta-amyloid on the volume of white matter hyperintensities in dementia-free subjects with cognitive complaints</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) in Alzheimer disease (AD) have traditionally been associated with cerebrovascular diseases. Amyloid beta deposition reportedly contributes to WMHs, however, this relationship remains unclear in dementia free subjects with cognitive complaints (CC). Here, we explored the relationship between WMHs and cardiometabolic and amyloid beta blood biomarkers in a community based cohort of Latin American CC participants. Methods: We recruited 112 individuals with CC (69 92 YO, 90 females) with available plasma amyloid beta biomarkers and cardiometabolic markers (systolic diastolic blood pressure and glycaemia). WMHs were quantified using a lesion segmentation tool based on SPM12 and segmented using the John Hopkins University (JHU) Atlas and ALVIN segmentation for periventricular and subcortical white matter. Linear multiple regression models were fitted to assess total WMH lesions and the segmented tract, using demographics, cardiometabolic, and amyloid beta blood biomarker measures as independent variables. Results: After multiple comparison corrections, diastolic blood pressure was associated with WMHs, specifically in the right anterior thalamic radiation, left cingulum, minor forceps, and subcortical ALVIN segmentation. Glycaemia was associated with WMH volume in forceps major, forceps minor, and right fronto occipital fasciculi. Conversely, amyloid beta blood biomarkers and systolic blood pressure showed no association with WMH overall or in specific tracts. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that, in dementia free CC individuals, WMH volume was more related to cardiometabolic factors, whereas amyloid beta blood biomarkers might be of less relevance. Dementia prevention strategies in individuals might be a useful focus for managing high peripheral vessel resistance and endothelial damage due to hypertension and hyperglycaemia.

">Echo-locate: Cerebellar activity predicts vocalization in fruit bats</a></h4>

              
                Echolocating bats exhibit remarkable auditory behaviors, enabled by adaptations within and outside their auditory system. Yet, research in echolocating bats has focused mostly on brain areas that belong to the classic ascending auditory pathway. This study provides direct evidence linking the cerebellum, an evolutionarily ancient and non-classic auditory structure, to vocalization and hearing. We report that in the fruit-eating bat Carollia perspicillata, external sounds can evoke cerebellar responses with latencies below 20 ms. Such fast responses are indicative of early inputs to the bat cerebellum. In vocalizing bats, distinct spike train patterns allow the prediction with over 85% accuracy of the sound they are about to produce, or have just produced, i.e., communication calls or echolocation pulses. Taken together, our findings provide evidence of specializations for vocalization and hearing in the cerebellum of an auditory specialist.

">The spatial organization of ascending auditory pathway microstructural maturation from infancy through adolescence using a novel fiber tracking approach</a></h4>

              
                Auditory perception is established through experience-dependent stimuli exposure during sensitive developmental periods; however, little is known regarding the structural development of the central auditory pathway in humans. The present study characterized the regional developmental trajectories of the ascending auditory pathway from the brainstem to the auditory cortex from infancy through adolescence using a novel diffusion MRI-based tractography approach and along-tract analyses. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) to quantify the magnitude and timing of auditory pathway microstructural maturation. We found spatially varying patterns of white matter maturation along the length of the tract, with inferior brainstem regions developing earlier than thalamocortical projections and left hemisphere tracts developing earlier than the right. These results help to characterize the processes that give rise to functional auditory processing and may provide a baseline for detecting abnormal development.

">Microglia replacement effectively attenuates the disease progress of ALSP in the mouse model and human patient</a></h4>

              
                Microglia play critical roles in the brain physiology and pathology. CSF1R is primarily expressed in microglia. The mono-allelic CSF1R mutation causes adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP), a lethal neurological disease and no rational cure in clinical trials. There are no animal models mimicking human ALSP. In this study, we first developed mouse models based on human ALSP hotspot mutations. We then utilized microglia replacement by bone marrow transplantation (Mr BMT) to replace the Csf1r-deficient microglia in ALSP mice by Csf1r-normal donor cells. With pathogenic gene correction, Mr BMT efficiently attenuated the pathologies. Previously, an ALSP patient received traditional bone marrow transplantation (tBMT) due to a misdiagnosis of metachromatic leukodystrophy. The disease progress was halted for 15 years with unknown reasons. We demonstrated that tBMT in ALSP is equivalent to or close to Mr BMT, achieving efficient microglia replacement and therefore attenuating the ALSP progress in the mouse model. Next, we applied tBMT to replace CSF1R-deficient microglia in human patients. Our clinical results show that after microglia replacement, the ALSP course is effectively halted. Together, microglia replacement corrects the pathogenic gene and thus halts the disease progress in the mouse model and human patients. This study strongly demonstrates clinical potentials of microglia replacement in neurological disease treatments.

                Vagal sensory neurons convey sensations from internal organs along the vagus nerve to the brainstem. Pruriceptors are a subtype of neurons that transmit itch and induce pruritus. Despite extensive research on the molecular mechanisms of itch, studies focusing on pruriceptors in the vagal ganglia still need to be explored. In this study, we characterized vagal pruriceptor neurons by their responsiveness to pruritogens such as lysophosphatidic acid, {beta}-alanine, chloroquine, and the cytokine oncostatin M. We discovered that lung-resident basophils produce oncostatin M and that its release can be induced by engagement of Fc{varepsilon}RI. Oncostatin M then sensitizes multiple populations of vagal sensory neurons, including Tac1+ and MrgprA3+ neurons in the jugular ganglia. Finally, we observed an increase in oncostatin M release in mice sensitized to the house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus or to the fungal allergen Alternaria alternate, highlighting a novel mechanism through which basophils and vagal sensory neurons may communicate during type I hypersensitivity diseases such as allergic asthma.

">C-LTMRs mediate wet dog shakes via the spinoparabrachial pathway</a></h4>

              
                Mammals perform rapid oscillations of their body- "wet dog shakes" -to remove water and irritants from their back hairy skin. The somatosensory mechanisms underlying this stereotypical behavior are unknown. We report that Piezo2-dependent mechanosensation mediates wet dog shakes evoked by water or oil droplets applied to hairy skin of mice. Unmyelinated low-threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs) were strongly activated by oil droplets and their optogenetic activation elicited wet dog shakes. Ablation of C-LTMRs attenuated this behavior. Moreover, C-LTMRs synaptically couple to spinoparabrachial (SPB) neurons, and optogenetically inhibiting SPB neuron synapses and excitatory neurons in the parabrachial nucleus impaired both oil droplet- and C-LTMR-evoked wet dog shakes. Thus, a C-LTMR-spinoparabrachial pathway mediates wet dog shakes for rapid and effective removal of foreign particles from back hairy skin.

                Progress in histological methods and in microscope technology has enabled dense staining and imaging of axons over large brain volumes, but tracing axons over such volumes requires new computational tools for 3D reconstruction of data acquired from serial sections. We have developed a computational pipeline for automated tracing and volume assembly of densely stained axons imaged over serial sections, which leverages machine learning-based segmentation to enable stitching and alignment with the axon traces themselves. We validated this segmentation-driven approach to volume assembly and alignment of individual axons over centimeter-scale serial sections and show the application of the output traces for analysis of local orientation and for proofreading over aligned volumes. The pipeline is scalable, and combined with recent advances in experimental approaches, should enable new studies of mesoscale connectivity and function over the whole human brain.

                Our understanding of how visual cortex neural processes mature during infancy and toddlerhood is limited. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), the present study investigated the development of visual evoked responses (VERs) in both cross-sectional and longitudinal samples of infants and toddlers 2 months to 3 years. Brain space analyses focused on N1m and P1m latency, as well as the N1m-to-P1m amplitude. Associations between VER measures and developmental quotient (DQ) scores in the cognitive/visual and fine motor domains were also examined. Results showed a nonlinear decrease in N1m and P1m latency as a function of age, characterized by rapid changes followed by slower progression, with the N1m latency plateauing at 6-7 months and the P1m latency plateauing at 8-9 months. The N1m-to-P1m amplitude also exhibited a non-linear decrease, with strong responses observed in younger infants (~2-3 months) and then a gradual decline. Associations between N1m and P1m latency and fine motor DQ scores were observed, suggesting that infants with faster visual processing may be better equipped to perform fine motor tasks. The present findings advance our understanding of the maturation of the infant visual system and highlight the relationship between the maturation of visual system and fine motor skills.

">Modeling differences in neurodevelopmental maturity of the reading network using support vector regression on functional connectivity data</a></h4>

              
                The construction of brain growth charts trained to predict age based on morphometric and/or functional properties of the brain ("brain-age prediction") has the potential to inform neuroscientists and clinicians alike about children's neurodevelopmental trajectories. When applied to both typically and atypically-developing populations - such as those with specific learning disorders - results may be informative as to whether a particular condition is associated with atypical maturation of specific brain networks. Here, we focus on the relationship between reading disorder (RD) and maturation of functional connectivity (FC) patterns in the prototypical reading/language network across development using a cross-sectional sample of N = 742 participants aged 6-21 years. A support vector regression model is trained to predict chronological age from FC data derived from (1) a whole-brain model, as well as (2) multiple "reduced" models, which are trained on FC data generated from a successively smaller number of regions in the brain's reading network. We hypothesized that the trained models would show systematic underestimation of brain network maturity (i.e., lower FC-based age predictions) for poor readers, particularly for the models trained with reading/language regions. Exploratory results demonstrated that the most important whole-brain ROIs and connections are derived from the dorsal attention and somatosensory motor networks. Comparisons of the different models' predictions reveal that while the whole-brain model outperforms the others in terms of overall prediction accuracy, all models are effective at predicting brain maturity, including the one trained with the smallest amount of FC data. In addition, all models demonstrate some degree of moderation in the reliability of their age predictions as a function of reading ability, with predictions for both poor and exceptional readers being more accurate relative to those for typical readers.

">Enhancing Retromer Complex Stability Ameliorates Synaptic Dysfunction in a Mouse Model ofAlzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic dysfunction is an early hallmark of Alzheimers disease, characterized by the disruption of synaptic transmission and plasticity. Central to these processes is endosomal trafficking, mediated by the retromer complex, which orchestrates the movement of vesicle contents for recycling to the plasma membrane, return to the Golgi, or degradation. Variants of VPS35, the cargo recognition component of the retromer complex, have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinsons disease (PARK17, D620N mutation) and Alzheimers disease (L625P mutation). While substantial research has focused on Parkinsons, the role of VPS35 in Alzheimers has been less explored. This study investigates the acute neuroprotective effects of retromer-stabilizing compounds in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimers. Our results reveal that stabilization of the retromer complex not only mitigates pathogenic production mechanisms but also compensates for early synaptic dysfunction and microglial activation. Specifically, we observed significant modulation of genes involved in long-term potentiation and a reduction in abnormal retromer-associated cargos. These findings highlight the potential of retromer stabilisation as atherapeutic strategy to address fundamental pathological pathological processes in Alzheimers disease

">Longitudinal sex-at-birth and age analyses of cortical structure in the ABCD Study</a></h4>

              
                While the brain continues to develop during adolescence, such development may depend on sex-at-birth. However, the elucidation of such differences may be hindered by analytical decisions (e.g., covariate selection to address body/brain-size differences) and the typical reporting of cross-sectional data. To further evaluate adolescent cortical development, we analyzed data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development StudySM, whose cohort of 11,000+ youth participants with biannual neuroimaging data collection can facilitate understanding neuroanatomical change during a critical developmental window. Doubly considering individual differences in the context of group-level effects, we analyzed regional changes in cortical thickness, sulcal depth, surface area, and volume between two timepoints (~2 years apart) in 9- to 12-year-olds assigned male or female sex-at-birth. First, we conducted linear mixed-effects models to gauge how controlling for intracranial volume, whole-brain volume (WBV), or a summary metric (e.g., mean cortical thickness) influenced interpretations of age-dependent cortical change. Next, we evaluated the relative changes in thickness and surface area as a function of sex-at-birth and age. Here, we showed that WBV (thickness, sulcal depth, volume) and total cortical surface area were more optimal covariates; controlling for different covariates would have substantially altered our interpretations of overall and sex-at-birth-specific neuroanatomical development. Further, we provided evidence to suggest that aggregate change in how cortical thickness is changing relative to surface area is generally comparable across those assigned male or female sex-at-birth, with corresponding change happening at slightly older ages in those assigned male sex-at-birth. Overall, these results help elucidate neuroanatomical developmental trajectories in early adolescence.

">Palytoxin Evokes Reversible Spreading Depolarization in the Locust CNS</a></h4>

              
                Spreading depolarization (SD) describes the near-complete depolarization of CNS neural cells as a consequence of chemical, electrical, and metabolic perturbations. It is well-established as the central mechanism underlying insect coma and various mammalian neurological dysfunctions. Despite significant progress in our understanding, the question remains: which cation channel, if any, generates SD in the CNS? Previously, we speculated that the sodium-potassium ATPase (NKA) might function as a large-conductance ion channel to initiate SD in insects, potentially mediated by a palytoxin (PLTX)-like endogenous activator. In the current study, we evaluate the effectiveness and properties of PLTX as an SD initiator in L. migratoria. Whereas bath-applied PLTX failed to ignite SD, direct injection into the neuropil triggered SD in 57% of the preparations. Notably, PLTX-induced SD onset was significantly more rapid compared to ouabain injection and azide controls, though their electrophysiological features remained similar. Furthermore, PLTX-induced SD was recoverable and resulted in a greater frequency of repetitive SD events compared to ouabain. Surprisingly, prior PLTX treatment disrupted the onset and recovery of subsequent SD evoked by other means. PLTX injection could attenuate the amplitude and hasten the onset time of azide-induced SD. Such an effect is associated with a complete inhibition at higher doses of subsequent anoxic SD induced through azide treatment or submersion. These results show that PLTX can trigger repetitive and reversible SD-like events in locusts and simultaneously interfere with anoxic SD occurrence. We suggest that the well-documented NKA pump conversion into an open non-selective cationic channel is a plausible mechanism of SD activation in the locust CNS, warranting additional investigations.

">Endogenous opioids facilitate stress-induced binge eating via an insular cortex-claustrum pathway</a></h4>

              
                Stress has been shown to promote the development and persistence of binge eating behaviors. However, the neural circuit mechanisms for stress-induced binge-eating behaviors are largely unreported. The endogenous dynorphin (dyn)/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) opioid neuropeptide system has been well-established to be a crucial mediator of the anhedonic component of stress. Here, we aimed to dissect the basis of dynorphinergic control of stress-induced binge-like eating behavior. We first established a mouse behavioral model for stress-induced binge-like eating behaviors. We found that mice exposed to stress increased their food intake of familiar palatable food (high fat, high sugar, HPD) compared to non-stressed mice. Following a brain-wide analysis, we isolated robust cFos-positive cells in the Claustrum (CLA), a subcortical structure with highly abundant KOR expression, following stress-induced binge-eating behavior. We report that KOR signaling in CLA is necessary for this elevated stress-induced binge eating behavior using local pharmacology and local deletion of KOR. In vivo calcium recordings using fiber photometry revealed a disinhibition circuit structure in the CLA during the initiation of HPD feeding bouts. We further established the dynamics of endogenous dynorphinergic control of this behavior using a genetically encoded dynorphin biosensor, Klight. Combined with 1-photon single-cell calcium imaging, we report significant heterogeneity with the CLA population during stress-induced binge eating and such behavior attenuates local dynorphin tone. Furthermore, we isolate the anterior Insular cortex (aIC) as the potential source of endogenous dynorphin afferents in the CLA. By characterizing neural circuits and peptidergic mechanisms within the CLA, we uncover a pathway that implicates endogenous opioid regulation stress-induced binge eating.

">Universal statistics of hippocampal place fields across species and dimensionalities</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal place cells form a spatial map by selectively firing at specific locations in an animal's environment. Until recently the hippocampus appeared to implement a simple coding scheme for position, in which each neuron is assigned to a single region of space in which it is active. Recently, new experiments revealed that the tuning of hippocampal neurons to space is much less stereotyped than previously thought: in large environments, place cells are active in multiple locations and their fields vary in shape and size across locations, with distributions that differ substantially in different experiments. It is unknown whether these seemingly diverse observations can be explained in a unified manner, and whether the heterogeneous statistics can reveal the mechanisms that determine the tuning of neural activity to position. Here we show that a surprisingly simple mathematical model, in which firing fields are generated by thresholding a realization of a random Gaussian process, explains the statistical properties of neural activity in quantitative detail, in bats and rodents, and in one-, two-, and three-dimensional environments of varying sizes. The model captures the statistics of field arrangements, and further yields quantitative predictions on the statistics of field shapes and topologies, which we verify. Thus, the seemingly diverse statistics arise from mathematical principles that are common to different species and behavioral conditions. The underlying Gaussian statistics are compatible with a picture in which the synaptic connections between place cells and their inputs are random and highly unstructured.

">The Drosophila tyramine-beta-hydroxylase gene encodes multiple isoforms with different functions</a></h4>

              
                The Tyramine-beta-hydroxylase (Tbh) is required for octopamine synthesis. To better understand the function of Tbh in neurotransmitter synthesis, we analyzed the molecular genetic organization of the Drosophila melanogaster Tbh gene and found that the Tbh gene encodes multiple transcripts. The transcripts differ in their 5UTR, which results in proteins that differ in their size and putative phosphorylation sites, suggesting that the Tbh function is regulated at translational and posttranslational levels. We generated a new Tbh mutant - TbhDel3 - using FLP/FRT recombination mutagenesis to remove the translational start site still that is present in TbhnM18mutants. The TbhDel3 mutants share ethanol tolerance and larval locomotion defects with the TbhnM18 mutants. But, they differ in terms of their cellular stress response. To develop normal levels of ethanol tolerance, Tbh is required in a subset of Tbh expressing neurons in the adult brain, which was identified using a newly generated Tbh-Gal4 driver. Taking advantage of a newly generated Tbh antibody serum, we show that one Tbh isoform is expressed in a group of peptidergic Hugin-positive and noradrenergic neurons uncoupling Tbh function from octopamine synthesis. The existence of different functional Tbh isoforms impacts our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of neurotransmitter synthesis and the function of the octopaminergic neurotransmitter system in cellular processes and the regulation of behavior.

">Central Amygdala Astrocyte Plasticity Underlies GABAergic Dysregulation in Ethanol Dependence</a></h4>

              
                Dependence is a hallmark of alcohol use disorder characterized by excessive alcohol intake and withdrawal symptoms. The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is a key brain structure underlying the synaptic and behavioral consequences of ethanol dependence. While accumulating evidence suggests that astrocytes regulate synaptic transmission and behavior, there is a limited understanding of the role astrocytes play in ethanol dependence. The present study used a combination of viral labeling, super resolution confocal microscopy, 3D image analysis, and slice electrophysiology to determine the effects of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure on astrocyte plasticity in the CeA. During withdrawal from CIE exposure, we observed increased GABA transmission, an upregulation in astrocytic GAT3 levels, and an increased proximity of astrocyte processes near CeA synapses. Furthermore, GAT3 levels and synaptic proximity were positively associated with voluntary ethanol drinking in dependent rats. Slice electrophysiology confirmed that the upregulation in astrocytic GAT3 levels was functional, as CIE exposure unmasked a GAT3-sensitive tonic GABA current in the CeA. A causal role for astrocytic GAT3 in ethanol dependence was assessed using viral-mediated GAT3 overexpression and knockdown approaches. However, GAT3 knockdown or overexpression had no effect on somatic withdrawal symptoms, dependence-escalated ethanol intake, aversion-resistant drinking, or post-dependent ethanol drinking in male or female rats. Moreover, intra-CeA pharmacological inhibition of GAT3 also did not alter dependent ethanol drinking. Together, these findings indicate that ethanol dependence induces GABAergic dysregulation and astrocyte plasticity in the CeA. However, astrocytic GAT3 does not appear necessary for the drinking related phenotypes associated with dependence.

">TMEM106B C-terminal fragments aggregate and drive neurodegenerative proteinopathy.</a></h4>

              
                Genetic variation in the lysosomal and transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B) modifies risk for a diverse range of neurodegenerative disorders, especially frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with progranulin (PGRN) haplo-insufficiency, although the molecular mechanisms involved are not yet understood. Through advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), homotypic aggregates of the C-Terminal domain of TMEM106B (TMEM CT) were discovered as a previously unidentified cytosolic proteinopathy in the brains of FTLD, Alzheimers disease, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) patients. While it remains unknown what role TMEM CT aggregation plays in neuronal loss, its presence across a range of aging related dementia disorders indicates involvement in multi-proteinopathy driven neurodegeneration. To determine the TMEM CT aggregation propensity and neurodegenerative potential, we characterized a novel transgenic C. elegans model expressing the human TMEM CT fragment constituting the fibrillar core seen in FTLD cases. We found that pan-neuronal expression of human TMEM CT in C. elegans causes neuronal dysfunction as evidenced by behavioral analysis. Cytosolic aggregation of TMEM CT proteins accompanied the behavioral dysfunction driving neurodegeneration, as illustrated by loss of GABAergic neurons. To investigate the molecular mechanisms driving TMEM106B proteinopathy, we explored the impact of PGRN loss on the neurodegenerative effect of TMEM CT expression. To this end, we generated TMEM CT expressing C. elegans with loss of pgrn-1, the C. elegans ortholog of human PGRN. Neither full nor partial loss of pgrn-1 altered the motor phenotype of our TMEM CT model suggesting TMEM CT aggregation occurs downstream of PGRN loss of function. We also tested the ability of genetic suppressors of tauopathy to rescue TMEM CT pathology. We found that genetic knockout of spop-1, sut-2, and sut-6 resulted in weak to no rescue of proteinopathy phenotypes, indicating that the mechanistic drivers of TMEM106B proteinopathy may be distinct from tauopathy. Taken together, our data demonstrate that TMEM CT aggregation can kill neurons. Further, expression of TMEM CT in C. elegans neurons provides a useful model for the functional characterization of TMEM106B proteinopathy in neurodegenerative disease.

">High-affinity detection of endogenously biotinylated neuroligin-1 at excitatory and inhibitory synapses using a tagged knock-in mouse strain</a></h4>

              
                Neuroligins (NLGNs) are important cell adhesion molecules mediating trans-synaptic contacts between neurons. However, the high-yield biochemical isolation and visualization of endogenous NLGNs have been hampered by the lack of efficient antibodies to these proteins. Thus, to reveal their sub-cellular distribution, binding partners, and synaptic function, NLGNs have been extensively manipulated using knock-down, knock-out, or over-expression approaches, overall leading to controversial results. As an alternative to the manipulation of NLGN expression level, we describe here the generation of a new transgenic mouse strain in which native NLGN1 was N-terminally tagged with a small biotin acceptor peptide (bAP) that can be enzymatically biotinylated by the exogenous delivery of biotin ligase. After showing that knock-in mice exhibit normal behavior as well as similar synaptic number, ultrastructure, transmission properties, and protein expression levels when compared to wild type counterparts, we exploited the fact that biotinylated bAP-NLGN1 can be selectively isolated or visualized using high-affinity streptavidin conjugates. Using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence, we show that bAP-NLGN1 binds both PSD-95 and gephyrin and distributes equally well at excitatory and inhibitory synapses, challenging the historical view that NLGN1 is exclusively localized at excitatory synapses. Using super-resolution fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy, we further highlight that bAP-NLGN1 forms in the synaptic cleft a subset of nanodomains each containing a few NLGN1 dimers, while the number of nanodomains per synapse positively scales with the post-synapse size. Overall, our study not only provides a novel, extensively characterized transgenic mouse model which will be made available to the scientific community, but also an unprecedented view of the nanoscale organization of endogenous NLGN1.

">Mutant HTT protein decreases with CAG repeat expansion: implications for therapeutics and bioassays.</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion that encodes a polyglutamine tract in the HTT protein. The mutant CAG repeat is unstable and expands in specific brain cells and peripheral tissues throughout life. Genes involved in the DNA mismatch repair pathways, known to act on expansion, have been identified as genetics modifiers, therefore, it is the rate of somatic CAG repeat expansion that drives the age of onset and rate of disease progression. In the context of an expanded CAG repeat, the HTT pre-mRNA can be alternatively processed to generate the HTT1a transcript, that encodes the aggregation prone and highly pathogenic HTT1a protein. This may be a mechanism through which somatic CAG repeat expansion exerts its pathogenic effects, as the longer the CAG repeat, the more HTT1a and HTT1a is produced. The allelic series of knock-in mouse models: HdhQ20, HdhQ50, HdhQ80, HdhQ111, CAG140 and zQ175 with polyQ expansions of 20, 50, 80, 111 140 and ~190 can be used to model the molecular and cellular consequences of CAG repeat expansion within a single neuron. By western blot of cortical lysates, we found that mutant HTT levels decreased with increasing CAG repeat length; mutant HTT was only 23% and 10% of wild-type levels in CAG140 and zQ175 cortices, respectively. To identify the optimal bioassays for detecting the full-length HTT and HTT1a isoforms, we interrogated the pairwise combinations of seven well-characterized antibodies on both the HTRF and MSD platforms. In total we tested 32 HTRF and 32 MSD assays to detect full-length mutant HTT, HTT1a, total mutant HTT (full-length HTT and HTT1a) and total full-length HTT (mutant and wild type). None of these assays recapitulated the full-length mutant HTT levels as measured by western blot. We recommend using isoform- and species- specific assays that detect either full-length mutant HTT, HTT1a or wild-type HTT as opposed to those that detect more than one isoform simultaneously. Our finding that as the CAG repeat expands, full-length mutant HTT levels decrease, whilst HTT1a and HTT1a levels increase has implications for therapeutic strategies. If mutant HTT levels in cells containing (CAG)200 are only 10% of wild-type, HTT-lowering strategies targeting full-length HTT at sequences 3 prime to intron 1 HTT will predominantly lower wild-type HTT, as mutant HTT levels in these cells are already depleted. These data support a therapeutic strategy that lowers HTT1a and depletes levels of the HTT1a protein.

">A versatile correlative light and electron microscopy protocol for human brain and other biological models</a></h4>

              
                Correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) combines light microscopy (LM) for target identification using genetic labels, dyes, antibodies, and morphological features with electron microscopy (EM) for high-resolution subcellular structure analysis. We describe an optimized room-temperature CLEM protocol for ultrastructural investigation of post-mortem human brain tissues, which is adaptable to cell lines and animal tissues. This versatile 8-day protocol encompasses sample fixation for optimal ultrastructural preservation, immunofluorescence staining, imaging, and multi-modal image correlation, and is executable within standard EM laboratories. Serving as a critical tool for characterizing human tissue and disease models, room-temperature CLEM facilitates the identification and quantification of subcellular morphological features across brain regions and can act as a preliminary step to assess sample suitability for cryo-EM studies.

">Gangliosides in neural stem cell fate determination and nerve cell specification--preparation and administration</a></h4>

              
                Gangliosides are sialylated glycosphingolipids with essential but enigmatic functions in healthy and disease brains. GD3 is the predominant species in neural stem cells (NSCs) and GD3-synthase (sialyltransferase II; St8Sia1) knockout (GD3S-KO) revealed reduction of postnatal NSC pools with severe behavioral deficits including cognitive impairment, depression-like phenotypes, and olfactory dysfunction. Exogenous administration of GD3 significantly restored the NSC pools and enhanced the stemness of NSCs with multipotency and self-renewal, followed by restored neuronal functions. Our group discovered that GD3 is involved in the maintenance of NSC fate determination by interacting with epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs), by modulating expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p27 and p21, and by regulating mitochondrial dynamics via associating a mitochondrial fission protein, the dynamin-related protein-1 (Drp1). Furthermore, we discovered that nuclear GM1 promotes neuronal differentiation by an epigenetic regulatory mechanism. GM1 binds with acetylated histones on the promoter of N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GalNAcT; GM2 synthase (GM2S); B4galnt1) as well as on the NeuroD1 in differentiated neurons. In addition, epigenetic activation of the GM2S gene was detected as accompanied by an apparent induction of neuronal differentiation in NSCs responding to an exogenous supplement of GM1. Interestingly, GM1 induced epigenetic activation of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene, with recruitment of Nurr1 and PITX3, dopaminergic neuron-associated transcription factors, to the TH promoter region. In this way, GM1 epigenetically regulates dopaminergic neuron specific gene expression, and it would modify Parkinson's disease. Multifunctional gangliosides significantly modulate lipid microdomains to regulate functions of important molecules on multiple sites: the plasma membrane, mitochondrial membrane, and nuclear membrane. Versatile gangliosides regulate functional neurons as well as sustain NSC functions via modulating protein and gene activities on ganglioside microdomains. Maintaining proper ganglioside microdomains benefits healthy neuronal development and millions of senior citizens with neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we introduce how to isolate GD3 and GM1 and how to administer them into the mouse brain to investigate their functions on NSC fate determination and nerve cell specification.

	<p>Background: The study aimed to examine the bidirectional relationship between sarcopenia and depressive symptoms in a national, community-based cohort study, despite the unclear temporal sequence demonstrated previously. Methods: Data were derived from four waves (2011 baseline and 2013, 2015, and 2018 follow-ups) of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). A total of 17,708 participants aged 45 years or older who had baseline data on both sarcopenia status and depressive symptoms in 2011 were included in the study. For the two cohort analyses, a total of 8092 adults without depressive symptoms and 11,292 participants without sarcopenia in 2011 were included. Sarcopenia status was defined according to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 (AWGS 2019) criteria. Depressive symptoms were defined as a score of 20 or higher on the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depressive Scale (CES-D-10). Cox proportional hazard regression models were conducted to examine the risk of depressive symptoms and sarcopenia risk, while cross-lagged panel models were used to examine the temporal sequence between depressive symptoms and sarcopenia over time. Results: During a total of 48,305.1 person-years follow-up, 1262 cases of incident depressive symptoms were identified. Sarcopenia exhibited a dose&amp;amp;ndash;response relationship with a higher risk of depressive symptoms (HR = 1.7, 95%CI: 1.2&amp;amp;ndash;2.3 for sarcopenia, and HR = 1.5, 95%CI: 1.2&amp;amp;ndash;1.8 for possible sarcopenia, p trend &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). In the second cohort analysis, 240 incident sarcopenia cases were identified over 39,621.1 person-years. Depressive symptoms (HR = 1.5, 95%CI: 1.2&amp;amp;ndash;2.0) are significantly associated with a higher risk of developing sarcopenia after multivariable adjustment (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, Cross-lagged panel analyses demonstrated that depressive symptoms were associated with subsequent sarcopenia (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.003, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Simultaneously, baseline sarcopenia was also associated with subsequent depressive symptoms (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.428, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusion: This study identified a bidirectional relationship between depressive symptoms and sarcopenia. It seems more probable that baseline sarcopenia is associated with subsequent depressive symptoms in a stronger pattern than the reverse pathway. The interlinkage indicated that maintaining normal muscle mass and strength may serve as a crucial intervention strategy for alleviating mood disorders.</p>

                <p>Studies on genetic robustness recently revealed transcriptional adaptation (TA) as a mechanism by which an organism can compensate for genetic mutations through activation of homologous genes. Here, we discovered that genetic mutations, introducing a premature termination codon (PTC) in the amyloid precursor protein-b (<I>appb</I>) gene, activated TA of two other <I>app</I> family members, <I>appa</I> and amyloid precursor-like protein-2 (<I>aplp2</I>), in zebrafish. The observed transcriptional response of <I>appa</I> and <I>aplp2</I> required degradation of mutant mRNA and did not depend on Appb protein level. Furthermore, TA between amyloid precursor protein (APP) family members was observed in human neuronal progenitor cells; however, compensation was only present during early neuronal differentiation and could not be detected in a more differentiated neuronal stage or adult zebrafish brain. Using knockdown and chemical inhibition, we showed that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is involved in degradation of mutant mRNA and that Upf1 and Upf2, key proteins in the NMD pathway, regulate the endogenous transcript levels of <I>appa</I>, <I>appb</I>, <I>aplp1</I>, and <I>aplp2</I>. In conclusion, our results suggest that the expression level of App family members is regulated by the NMD pathway and that mutations destabilizing <I>app</I>/<I>APP</I> mRNA can induce genetic compensation by other family members through TA in both zebrafish and human neuronal progenitors.</p>

                <p>Amylin, a pancreatic hormone that is cosecreted with insulin, has been highlighted as a potential treatment target for obesity. Amylin receptors are distributed widely throughout the brain and are coexpressed on mesolimbic dopamine neurons. Activation of amylin receptors is known to reduce food intake, but the neurochemical mechanisms behind this remain to be elucidated. Amylin receptor activation in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key dopaminergic nucleus in the mesolimbic reward system, has a potent ability to suppress intake of palatable fat and sugar solutions. Although previous work has demonstrated that VTA amylin receptor activation can dampen mesolimbic dopamine signaling elicited by random delivery of sucrose, whether this is also the case for fat remains unknown. Herein we tested the hypothesis that amylin receptor activation in the VTA of male rats would attenuate dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens core in response to random intraoral delivery of either fat or sugar solutions. Results show that fat solution produces a greater potentiation of accumbens dopamine than an isocaloric sucrose solution. Moreover, activation of VTA amylin receptors elicits a more robust suppression of accumbens dopamine signaling in response to fat solution than to sucrose. Taken together these results shed new light on the amylin system as a therapeutic target for obesity and emphasize the reinforcing nature of high-fat/high-sugar diets.</p>

                Background In this paper we analyse the novel The End of Eddy by Édouard Louis. The motivation for this paper is Bourdeau’s (2020) observation that Louis’s book explores working class politics, sexuality, and masculinity. Methods We analysed the amendment through narrative content analysis, the application of which allows us to answer the following question: Édouard Louis’s novel The End of Eddy: A representation of hegemonic masculinity? Results We conclude that this narrative is built on contradictions that can be summarized as a conflict between a socio-cultural norm anchored in a French village and a person who does not fulfil this concept, who is outside of it. We believe that hegemonic masculinity, that is, one part of the cultural norm of a given village, causes Eddy’s inclination or consciousness of homonationalism. Thus, on the one hand, hegemonic masculinity is undoubtedly present in this novel; on the other hand, it forms a kind of background or socio-cultural environment which, although it defines itself against the given, unconsciously causes the “birth of the conscious homosexual”. Conclusions Thus, we dare to claim that the narrative under analysis is not only a representation of hegemonic masculinity, but also an accentuation of its external and internal influence on one’s own perception of (sexual) difference.

                Background Post-operative sore throat (POST) is one of the most common complaints post-endotracheal intubation and can be decreased through various interventions. This study aimed to determine the effect of fluticasone-impregnated versus saline throat packs on the occurrence and severity of POST and voice hoarseness. Methods This prospective, randomized, double-blinded trial was conducted on patients undergoing nasosinus surgeries at Kasturba Medical College and Hospital. Patients were randomized to groups based on a computer-generated table of random numbers post-intubation after placing a definite length of oropharyngeal packs into group F (fluticasone) who received four puffs of fluticasone furoate-soaked throat packs and group C (control) wherein normal saline-soaked throat packs were used. Determining the incidence of POST and voice hoarseness was the primary outcome; severity of POST and voice hoarseness, patient satisfaction scores at 24 hours post-surgery and adverse events were secondary outcomes. Results Overall, 86 patients were randomized and 43 patients were included in each group. Incidence of POST (%) and voice hoarseness (%) were 55.8, 55.6, 55.8, 53.4 and 30.2, 28, 28, 28 in group C. Incidence of POST (%) and voice hoarseness (%) were 37.2, 37.2, 37.2, 34.8 and 14, 14, 14,14 in group F at 1, 2, 6 and 24 hours, respectively, however, the p values were not found to be significant at any time interval. There was no significant difference in terms of severity of POST and voice hoarseness, patient satisfaction scores between the groups and there were no reported adverse events. Conclusions In patients undergoing nasosinus surgery under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation, fluticasone furoate-impregnated throat packs failed to show any significant reduction in the incidence and severity of POST as well as hoarseness of voice, and even though it was not statistically significant, the fluticasone impregnated group had higher patient satisfaction scores.

                Background Although numerous case-control studies have examined the role of nitric oxide, particularly the 894G>T polymorphism in the eNOS gene, in increasing the risk of stroke and cancer, there remains a need for a comprehensive meta-analysis to clarify these associations. This study aims to address this gap by thoroughly evaluating the relationship between the eNOS 894G>T polymorphism and the risks of cancer and stroke. Methods We conducted an exhaustive search across digital databases including Science Direct, PubMed, and Google Scholar for studies published between 2012-2023. A rigorous selection process was employed to include relevant studies, which were then analyzed using robust meta-analytical techniques to determine the association between the eNOS 894G>T polymorphism and the risks of cancer and stroke. Results In this meta-analysis, we combined data from 2,013 cases and 2,187 control subjects for cancer risk assessment and 1,006 cases with 1,146 control subjects for stroke risk evaluation. Our findings indicate that the eNOS 894G>T polymorphism is significantly associated with an increased risk of cancer when comparing GG vs. GT+TT genotypes. Additionally, there is a notable correlation between this polymorphism and stroke incidence under various genetic models (T vs. G, TT vs. GG + GT, GG + GT vs. TT). Conclusions The results of this meta-analysis suggest a significant association between the eNOS 894G>T polymorphism and increased risks of cancer and stroke. These findings underscore the importance of conducting future studies with larger sample sizes and more comprehensive analyses further to elucidate the role of nitric oxide in these diseases. This study addresses some concerns but further detailed and non-repetitive research is necessary for conclusive evidence.

                Background The increasing popularity of green cosmetic products among consumers who prioritize skin health, quality, and beauty has driven the production of these products. Growing awareness of harmful toxins in traditional cosmetics is leading consumers to prefer natural alternatives. This study aimed to identify the factors influencing Indian consumers' buying behaviour and purchase intentions toward green cosmetics, focusing on both male and female consumers. Methods To achieve this, a thorough evaluation of the literature from Scopus-indexed journals was conducted, employing the theory of planned behavior as the theoretical framework. The study used Smart PLS 3.0’s structural equation modeling to analyze data and performed a multi-group analysis to explore variations in purchasing intentions and actions between male and female consumers. Results The research indicated an increasing demand for green cosmetics among males in North India. Findings revealed that subjective norms significantly influenced both purchase behaviour and purchase intention. Additionally, perceived behavioural control and subjective norms positively impacted purchase intention, which in turn indirectly affected purchase behaviour. Interestingly, environmental concerns did not influence consumers' actual purchasing intentions or behaviour. The analysis also demonstrated no significant differences between male and female consumers regarding the impact of various factors on their purchase intentions and behaviours. Conclusion These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and marketing managers aiming to promote green cosmetic product purchase behaviour. Recognizing that subjective norms and perceived behavioural control are crucial drivers of purchase intention and behaviour can help in devising effective marketing strategies. Despite the absence of significant gender differences in the factors influencing purchase behaviour, the increasing interest in green cosmetics, especially among males, highlights a broader market potential for these products. This research underscores the importance of focusing on social and behavioural influences to encourage the adoption of green cosmetics

New sublineages of SARS-CoV-2 variants-of-concern (VOCs) continuously emerge with mutations in the spike glycoprotein. In most cases, the sublineage-defining mutations vary between the VOCs. It is unclear whether these differences reflect lineage-specific likelihoods for mutations at each spike position or the stochastic nature of their appearance. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 lineages have distinct evolutionary spaces (a probabilistic definition of the sequence states that can be occupied by expanding virus subpopulations). This space can be accurately inferred from the patterns of amino acid variability at the whole-protein level. Robust networks of co-variable sites identify the highest-likelihood mutations in new VOC sublineages and predict remarkably well the emergence of subvariants with resistance mutations to COVID-19 therapeutics. Our studies reveal the contribution of low frequency variant patterns at heterologous sites across the protein to accurate prediction of the changes at each position of interest.

                <p>by Diego Andrés Contreras, Giulia Cencetti, Alain Barrat</p>

Contagion processes, representing the spread of infectious diseases, information, or social behaviors, are often schematized as taking place on networks, which encode for instance the interactions between individuals. The impact of the network structure on spreading process has been widely investigated, but not the reverse question: do different processes unfolding on a given network lead to different infection patterns? How do the infection patterns depend on a model’s parameters or on the nature of the contagion processes? Here we address this issue by investigating the infection patterns for a variety of models. In simple contagion processes, where contagion events involve one connection at a time, we find that the infection patterns are extremely robust across models and parameters. In complex contagion models instead, in which multiple interactions are needed for a contagion event, non-trivial dependencies on models parameters emerge, as the infection pattern depends on the interplay between pairwise and group contagions. In models involving threshold mechanisms moreover, slight parameter changes can significantly impact the spreading paths. Our results show that it is possible to study crucial features of a spread from schematized models, and inform us on the variations between spreading patterns in processes of different nature.

                <p>by Florian Bolenz, Thorsten Pachur</p>

Younger and older adults often differ in their risky choices. Theoretical frameworks on human aging point to various cognitive and motivational factors that might underlie these differences. Using a novel computational model based on the framework of resource rationality, we find that the two age groups rely on different strategies. Importantly, older adults did not use simpler strategies than younger adults, they did not select among fewer strategies, they did not make more errors, and they did not put more weight on cognitive costs. Instead, older adults selected strategies that had different risk propensities than those selected by younger adults. Our modeling approach suggests that age differences in risky choice are not necessarily a consequence of cognitive decline; instead, they may reflect motivational differences between age groups.

Transcription factors (TFs) regulate the process of transcription through the modulation of different kinetic steps. Although models can often describe the observed transcriptional output of a measured gene, predicting a TFs role on a given promoter requires an understanding of how the TF alters each step of the transcription process. In this work, we use a simple model of transcription to assess the role of promoter identity, and the degree to which TFs alter binding of RNAP (stabilization) and initiation of transcription (acceleration) on three primary characteristics: the range of steady-state regulation, cell-to-cell variability in expression, and the dynamic response time of a regulated gene. We find that steady state regulation and the response time of a gene behave uniquely for TFs that regulate incoherently, i.e that speed up one step but slow the other. We also find that incoherent TFs have dynamic implications, with one type of incoherent mode configuring the promoter to respond more slowly at intermediate TF concentrations. We also demonstrate that the noise of gene expression for these TFs is sensitive to promoter strength, with a distinct non-monotonic profile that is apparent under stronger promoters. Taken together, our work uncovers the coupling between promoters and TF regulatory modes with implications for understanding natural promoters and engineering synthetic gene circuits with desired expression properties.

                <p>by Sebastian Salwig, Jakob Drefs, Jörg Lücke</p>

Conventional and electron microscopy visualize structures in the micrometer to nanometer range, and such visualizations contribute decisively to our understanding of biological processes. Due to different factors in recording processes, microscopy images are subject to noise. Especially at their respective resolution limits, a high degree of noise can negatively effect both image interpretation by experts and further automated processing. However, the deteriorating effects of strong noise can be alleviated to a large extend by image enhancement algorithms. Because of the inherent high noise, a requirement for such algorithms is their applicability directly to noisy images or, in the extreme case, to just a single noisy image without a priori noise level information (referred to as blind zero-shot setting). This work investigates blind zero-shot algorithms for microscopy image denoising. The strategies for denoising applied by the investigated approaches include: filtering methods, recent feed-forward neural networks which were amended to be trainable on noisy images, and recent probabilistic generative models. As datasets we consider transmission electron microscopy images including images of SARS-CoV-2 viruses and fluorescence microscopy images. A natural goal of denoising algorithms is to simultaneously reduce noise while preserving the original image features, e.g., the sharpness of structures. However, in practice, a tradeoff between both aspects often has to be found. Our performance evaluations, therefore, focus not only on noise removal but set noise removal in relation to a metric which is instructive about sharpness. For all considered approaches, we numerically investigate their performance, report their denoising/sharpness tradeoff on different images, and discuss future developments. We observe that, depending on the data, the different algorithms can provide significant advantages or disadvantages in terms of their noise removal vs. sharpness preservation capabilities, which may be very relevant for different virological applications, e.g., virological analysis or image segmentation.

                <p>by Xiangting Li, Tom Chou</p>

Cellular signaling, crucial for biological processes like immune response and homeostasis, relies on specificity and fidelity in signal transduction to accurately respond to stimuli amidst biological noise. Kinetic proofreading (KPR) is a key mechanism enhancing signaling specificity through time-delayed steps, although its effectiveness is debated due to intrinsic noise potentially reducing signal fidelity. In this study, we reformulate the theory of kinetic proofreading (KPR) by convolving multiple intermediate states into a single state and then define an overall “processing” time required to traverse these states. This simplification allows us to succinctly describe kinetic proofreading in terms of a single waiting time parameter, facilitating a more direct evaluation and comparison of KPR performance across different biological contexts such as DNA replication and T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. We find that loss of fidelity for longer proofreading steps relies on the specific strategy of information extraction and show that in the first-passage time (FPT) discrimination strategy, longer proofreading steps can exponentially improve the accuracy of KPR at the cost of speed. Thus, KPR can still be an effective discrimination mechanism in the high noise regime. However, in a product concentration-based discrimination strategy, longer proofreading steps do not necessarily lead to an increase in performance. However, by introducing activation thresholds on product concentrations, can we decompose the product-based strategy into a series of FPT-based strategies to better resolve the subtleties of KPR-mediated product discrimination. Our findings underscore the importance of understanding KPR in the context of how information is extracted and processed in the cell.

As <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> disseminates through its host, the parasite must sense and adapt to its environment and scavenge nutrients. Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) is one such environmental factor and cytoplasmic prolyl 4-hydroxylases (PHDs) are evolutionarily conserved O<sub>2</sub> cellular sensing proteins that regulate responses to changes in O<sub>2</sub> availability. <i>Toxoplasma</i> expresses 2 PHDs. One of them, TgPHYa hydroxylates SKP1, a subunit of the SCF-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. In vitro, TgPHYa is important for growth at low O<sub>2</sub> levels. However, studies have yet to examine the role that TgPHYa or any other pathogen-encoded PHD plays in virulence and disease. Using a type II ME49 <i>Toxoplasma</i> TgPHYa knockout, we report that TgPHYa is important for <i>Toxoplasma</i> virulence and brain cyst formation in mice. We further find that while TgPHYa mutant parasites can establish an infection in the gut, they are unable to efficiently disseminate to peripheral tissues because the mutant parasites are unable to survive within recruited immune cells. Since this phenotype was abrogated in IFNγ knockout mice, we studied how TgPHYa mediates survival in IFNγ-treated cells. We find that TgPHYa is not required for release of parasite-encoded effectors into host cells that neutralize anti-parasitic processes induced by IFNγ. In contrast, we find that TgPHYa is required for the parasite to scavenge tryptophan, which is an amino acid whose levels are decreased after IFNγ up-regulates the tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme, indoleamine dioxygenase (IDO). We further find, relative to wild-type mice, that IDO knockout mice display increased morbidity when infected with TgPHYa knockout parasites. Together, these data identify the first parasite mechanism for evading IFNγ-induced nutritional immunity and highlight a novel role that oxygen-sensing proteins play in pathogen growth and virulence.

                <p>by Vanessa M. Adams</p>

There has been an increasingly prevalent message that data regarding costs must be included in conservation planning activities to make cost-efficient decisions. Despite the growing acceptance that socioeconomic context is critical to conservation success, the approaches to embedded economic and financial considerations into planning have not significantly evolved. Inappropriate cost data is frequently included in decisions, with the potential of compromising biodiversity and social outcomes. For each conservation planning step, this essay details common mistakes made when considering costs, proposing solutions to enable conservation managers to know when and how to include costs. Appropriate use of high-quality cost data obtained at the right scale will improve decision-making and ultimately avoid costly mistakes.

Despite the diverse genetic origins of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), affected individuals share strikingly similar and correlated behavioural traits that include perceptual and sensory processing challenges. Notably, the severity of these sensory symptoms is often predictive of the expression of other autistic traits. However, the origin of these perceptual deficits remains largely elusive. Here, we show a recurrent impairment in visual threat perception that is similarly impaired in 3 independent mouse models of ASD with different molecular aetiologies. Interestingly, this deficit is associated with reduced avoidance of threatening environments—a nonperceptual trait. Focusing on a common cause of ASDs, the <i>Setd5</i> gene mutation, we define the molecular mechanism. We show that the perceptual impairment is caused by a potassium channel (Kv1)-mediated hypoexcitability in a subcortical node essential for the initiation of escape responses, the dorsal periaqueductal grey (dPAG). Targeted pharmacological Kv1 blockade rescued both perceptual and place avoidance deficits, causally linking seemingly unrelated trait deficits to the dPAG. Furthermore, we show that different molecular mechanisms converge on similar behavioural phenotypes by demonstrating that the autism models <i>Cul3</i> and <i>Ptchd1</i>, despite having similar behavioural phenotypes, differ in their functional and molecular alteration. Our findings reveal a link between rapid perception controlled by subcortical pathways and appropriate learned interactions with the environment and define a nondevelopmental source of such deficits in ASD.

                Background Nintedanib (NTB) is a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor, been investigated for many disease conditions like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), systemic sclerosis interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NTB is available as oral capsule formulation, but its ability to detect degradants formed through oxidative, photolytic and hydrolytic processes makes it difficult to quantify. In the current work, a novel reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method was developed and validated. Methods The developed method is simple, precise, reproducible, stable and accurate. The inherent stability of NTB was evaluated using the proposed analytical method approach and force degradation studies were carried out. NTB was separated chromatographically on the Shimadzu C18 column as stationary phase (250 ×4.6 mm, 5 µm) using an isocratic elution method with 0.1% v/v triethyl amine (TEA) in HPLC grade water and acetonitrile (ACN) in the ratio 35:65% v/v. The mobile phase was pumped at a constant flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, and the eluent was detected at 390 nm wavelength. Results NTB was eluted at 6.77±0.00 min of retention time (tR) with a correlation coefficient of 0.999, the developed method was linear in the concentration range of 0.5 µg/ml to 4.5 µg/ml. The recovery rate was found to be in the range of 99.391±0.468% for 1.5 µg/ml concentration. Six replicate standards were determined to have an % RSD of 0.04. Conclusion The formulation excipients didn’t interfere with the determination of NTB, demonstrating the specificity of the developed method. The proposed approach of the analytical method developed can be used to quantify the amount of NTB present in bulk drugs and pharmaceutical formulations.

                Background Various stemness markers (SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG) have been studied in odontogenic cysts and tumors. However, studies on SALL4 having similar properties of stemness has not been documented. Additionally, insight into fascin as a migratory molecule is less explored. In this study, the expression of SALL4 and fascin were evaluated in ameloblastoma, adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (AOT), odontogenic keratocyst (OKC), dentigerous cyst (DC), radicular cyst (RC), and calcifying odontogenic cyst (COC). Methods Semi-quantitative analysis of fascin and SALL4 immuno-positive cells was done in a total of 40 cases of ameloblastoma (11 plexiform, 12 follicular, 12 unicystic, and 5 desmoplastic) variants, 6 cases of AOT, 15 each of OKC, DC, RC and 5 of COC. Chi-square test was applied to evaluate the association between SALL4 and fascin expression in odontogenic cysts and tumors. Results Fascin immunopositivity was observed in peripheral ameloblast-like cells, and the expression was weak or absent in stellate reticulum-like cells. A moderate to weak immune-reactivity to SALL4 was observed in the cytoplasm of ameloblastoma, epithelial cells of dentigerous and radicular cysts, having a marked inflammatory infiltrate, which was an interesting observation. COC and AOT had negative to weak expressions. No recurrence has been reported. Conclusions Expression of fascin in ameloblastomas elucidate their role in motility and localized invasion. Its expression in less aggressive lesions like DC, COC, AOT will incite to explore the other functional properties of fascin. SALL4 expression in the cytoplasm of odontogenic cysts and tumors may represent inactive or mutant forms which requires further validation.

                Background: Worldwide, infertility affects about 15% of reproductive-age couples. In many cases, infertility can't be treated, however new treatment options with promising value have been involved in recent clinical trials. The aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate the impacts of adding coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) to letrozole on the results of spermiogram and sex hormone tests in men diagnosed with idiopathic oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (iOAT) syndrome, which is a type of male defective spermatogenesis of unknown etiology. Methods: This randomized, open-label, parallel two-arm interventional study included 67 adult male patients aged 18-60 years with a confirmed diagnosis of iOAT syndrome recruited from The High Institute for Infertility Diagnosis & Assisted Reproduction Technologies/Nahrain University. Patients were randomly separated into two groups, Group A included 29 patients treated with letrozole 2.5 mg tablet orally twice a week, Group B included 38 patients treated with a combination of letrozole 2.5 mg tablet orally twice a week plus CoQ10 400 mg per day. Both groups completed treatment for three months. Semen samples, serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), and testosterone (T) were analyzed at day one, and at the end of month one, two and three. Results: Both groups showed that sperm concentration, normal morphology, total sperm count and motility, serum testosterone and FSH levels, and T/E2 ratio were significantly increased, while estradiol levels significantly decreased after three months of treatment. Seminal fluid volume changed significantly in group A only. In comparing between the two groups, all measured parameters, apart from sperm motility and FSH level, demonstrated a significant difference after three months of treatment, while sperm volume reached significant value after only two months of therapy. Conclusions: CoQ10 as adjuvant treatment to letrozole effectively improved most of the tested sperm parameters in Iraqi men with iOAT. Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05847257, May 6, 2023).

                Background In recent times, the efforts to profile the language characteristics of bilinguals have been extended from mere documentation of proficiency in each language to the determination of language dominance that captures both proficiency and usage (i.e., frequency & contexts) of each language. In multilingual countries, individuals are immersed in various languages in different contexts. With the broader intention to improve the linguistic profiling of bilinguals in countries with similar characteristics, we aimed to adapt and validate the Self-report classification tool in Indian Kannada-English bilinguals. Methods A group of 88 adult Kannada-English bilingual participants self-rated their language proficiency. We measured their language dominance with the adapted tool. Finally, to objectively measure their language abilities, we used the short version of the Bilingual Aphasia Test. Results Discriminant analysis of the ratings showed that the self-report classification tool accurately classified our participants into three groups based on language dominance. Both the self-rating and the objective measure of language proficiency supported the (dominance) classifications by the adapted tool. Conclusion Findings show that the adapted self-report classification tool is valid for determining language dominance in Kannada-English bilinguals. Further, the current study shows that this tool is adaptable to novel bilingual language dyads.

                Background Tissue engineering research aims to address the global shortage of donated corneal tissue, yet challenges persist in clinical translation. This study assesses the pathway from basic research to clinical adoption in corneal tissue engineering. Methods Bibliometric and patent analyses were conducted using the Web of Science-Core Collection and Lens databases to identify top authors, countries, journals, publication trends, inventors, patent statuses, and affiliated companies. A quality-adjusted life year (QALY) analysis compared engineered corneal endothelium to full keratoplasty. A pilot study surveyed thirty ophthalmologist surgeons from eight Latin American countries. Results A strong upward publication trend (R2 = 0.89, p = 1.53x10^-9) in corneal endothelium engineering was observed over the past decade, led by the USA, China, and Japan. Among 614 research papers, 26 patents and 10 companies were identified. Engineered corneal endothelium showed a QALY gain of 0.74 versus 0.07 of corneal transplants. Most survey respondents (97%) expressed interest in adopting engineered corneal endothelium for transplantation if affordability, biocompatibility, and functionality were assured. Conclusions While tissue engineering offers promise in alleviating corneal scarcity, a significant gap remains between scientific advancements and clinical adoption, presenting “death valleys.” Addressing this requires more efficient navigation of the interplay between scientific progress, technology adoption, and clinical practice.

                α-Synuclein (αS) is an abundant presynaptic protein that regulates neurotransmission. It is also a key protein implicated in a broad class of neurodegenerative disorders termed synucleinopathies, including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD). Pathological αS deposits in these diseases, Lewy bodies (LBs)/neurites (LNs), contain about 90% of αS in its phospho-serine129 (pS129) form. Therefore, pS129 is widely used as a surrogate marker of pathology. However, recent findings demonstrate that pS129 is also physiologically triggered by neuronal activity to positively regulate synaptic transmission. In this opinion article, we contrast the literature on pathological and physiological pS129, with a special focus on the latter. We emphasize that pS129 is ambiguous and knowledge about the context is necessary to correctly interpret changes in pS129.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91532">Deciphering the genetic code of neuronal type connectivity through bilinear modeling</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how different neuronal types connect and communicate is critical to interpreting brain function and behavior. However, it has remained a formidable challenge to decipher the genetic underpinnings that dictate the specific connections formed between neuronal types. To address this, we propose a novel bilinear modeling approach that leverages the architecture similar to that of recommendation systems. Our model transforms the gene expressions of presynaptic and postsynaptic neuronal types, obtained from single-cell transcriptomics, into a covariance matrix. The objective is to construct this covariance matrix that closely mirrors a connectivity matrix, derived from connectomic data, reflecting the known anatomical connections between these neuronal types. When tested on a dataset of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, our model achieved a performance comparable to, if slightly better than, the previously proposed spatial connectome model (SCM) in reconstructing electrical synaptic connectivity based on gene expressions. Through a comparative analysis, our model not only captured all genetic interactions identified by the SCM but also inferred additional ones. Applied to a mouse retinal neuronal dataset, the bilinear model successfully recapitulated recognized connectivity motifs between bipolar cells and retinal ganglion cells, and provided interpretable insights into genetic interactions shaping the connectivity. Specifically, it identified unique genetic signatures associated with different connectivity motifs, including genes important to cell-cell adhesion and synapse formation, highlighting their role in orchestrating specific synaptic connections between these neurons. Our work establishes an innovative computational strategy for decoding the genetic programming of neuronal type connectivity. It not only sets a new benchmark for single-cell transcriptomic analysis of synaptic connections but also paves the way for mechanistic studies of neural circuit assembly and genetic manipulation of circuit wiring.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92673">Cell-autonomous role of leucine-rich repeat kinase in the protection of dopaminergic neuron survival</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, whether LRRK2 mutations cause PD and degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons via a toxic gain-of-function or a loss-of-function mechanism is unresolved and has pivotal implications for LRRK2-based PD therapies. In this study, we investigate whether <i>Lrrk2</i> and its functional homolog <i>Lrrk1</i> play a cell-intrinsic role in DA neuron survival through the development of DA neuron-specific <i>Lrrk</i> conditional double knockout (cDKO) mice. Unlike <i>Lrrk</i> germline DKO mice, DA neuron-restricted <i>Lrrk</i> cDKO mice exhibit normal mortality but develop age-dependent loss of DA neurons, as shown by the progressive reduction of DA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) at the ages of 20 and 24 months. Moreover, DA neurodegeneration is accompanied with increases in apoptosis and elevated microgliosis in the SNpc as well as decreases in DA terminals in the striatum, and is preceded by impaired motor coordination. Taken together, these findings provide the unequivocal evidence for the cell-intrinsic requirement of LRRK in DA neurons and raise the possibility that LRRK2 mutations may impair its protection of DA neurons, leading to DA neurodegeneration in PD.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95297">Secreted antigen A peptidoglycan hydrolase is essential for Enterococcus faecium cell separation and priming of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy</a></h4>

              
                <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> is a microbiota species in humans that can modulate host immunity (Griffin and Hang, 2022), but has also acquired antibiotic resistance and is a major cause of hospital-associated infections (Van Tyne and Gilmore, 2014). Notably, diverse strains of <i>E. faecium</i> produce SagA, a highly conserved peptidoglycan hydrolase that is sufficient to promote intestinal immunity (Rangan et al., 2016; Pedicord et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2019) and immune checkpoint inhibitor antitumor activity (Griffin et al., 2021). However, the functions of SagA in <i>E. faecium</i> were unknown. Here, we report that deletion of <i>sagA</i> impaired <i>E. faecium</i> growth and resulted in bulged and clustered enterococci due to defective peptidoglycan cleavage and cell separation. Moreover, Δ<i>sagA</i> showed increased antibiotic sensitivity, yielded lower levels of active muropeptides, displayed reduced activation of the peptidoglycan pattern-recognition receptor NOD2, and failed to promote cancer immunotherapy. Importantly, the plasmid-based expression of SagA, but not its catalytically inactive mutant, restored Δ<i>sagA</i> growth, production of active muropeptides, and NOD2 activation. SagA is, therefore, essential for <i>E. faecium</i> growth, stress resistance, and activation of host immunity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/86722">Rapid, DNA-induced interface swapping by DNA gyrase</a></h4>

              
                DNA gyrase, a ubiquitous bacterial enzyme, is a type IIA topoisomerase formed by heterotetramerisation of 2 GyrA subunits and 2 GyrB subunits, to form the active complex. DNA gyrase can loop DNA around the C-terminal domains (CTDs) of GyrA and pass one DNA duplex through a transient double-strand break (DSB) established in another duplex. This results in the conversion from a positive (+1) to a negative (–1) supercoil, thereby introducing negative supercoiling into the bacterial genome by steps of 2, an activity essential for DNA replication and transcription. The strong protein interface in the GyrA dimer must be broken to allow passage of the transported DNA segment and it is generally assumed that the interface is usually stable and only opens when DNA is transported, to prevent the introduction of deleterious DSBs in the genome. In this paper, we show that DNA gyrase can exchange its DNA-cleaving interfaces between two active heterotetramers. This so-called interface ‘swapping’ (IS) can occur within a few minutes in solution. We also show that bending of DNA by gyrase is essential for cleavage but not for DNA binding per se and favors IS. Interface swapping is also favored by DNA wrapping and an excess of GyrB. We suggest that proximity, promoted by GyrB oligomerization and binding and wrapping along a length of DNA, between two heterotetramers favors rapid interface swapping. This swapping does not require ATP, occurs in the presence of fluoroquinolones, and raises the possibility of non-homologous recombination solely through gyrase activity. The ability of gyrase to undergo interface swapping explains how gyrase heterodimers, containing a single active-site tyrosine, can carry out double-strand passage reactions and therefore suggests an alternative explanation to the recently proposed ‘swivelling’ mechanism for DNA gyrase (Gubaev et al., 2016).

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88942">Single-cell transcriptome analysis of cavernous tissues reveals the key roles of pericytes in diabetic erectile dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects a significant proportion of men aged 40–70 and is caused by cavernous tissue dysfunction. Presently, the most common treatment for ED is phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors; however, this is less effective in patients with severe vascular disease such as diabetic ED. Therefore, there is a need for development of new treatment, which requires a better understanding of the cavernous microenvironment and cell-cell communications under diabetic condition. Pericytes are vital in penile erection; however, their dysfunction due to diabetes remains unclear. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing to understand the cellular landscape of cavernous tissues and cell type-specific transcriptional changes in diabetic ED. We found a decreased expression of genes associated with collagen or extracellular matrix organization and angiogenesis in diabetic fibroblasts, chondrocytes, myofibroblasts, valve-related lymphatic endothelial cells, and pericytes. Moreover, the newly identified pericyte-specific marker, Limb Bud-Heart (Lbh)<i>,</i> in mouse and human cavernous tissues, clearly distinguishing pericytes from smooth muscle cells. Cell-cell interaction analysis revealed that pericytes are involved in angiogenesis, adhesion, and migration by communicating with other cell types in the corpus cavernosum; however, these interactions were highly reduced under diabetic conditions. Lbh expression is low in diabetic pericytes, and overexpression of LBH prevents erectile function by regulating neurovascular regeneration. Furthermore, the LBH-interacting proteins (Crystallin Alpha B and Vimentin) were identified in mouse cavernous pericytes through LC-MS/MS analysis, indicating that their interactions were critical for maintaining pericyte function. Thus, our study reveals novel targets and insights into the pathogenesis of ED in patients with diabetes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93094">7,8-Dihydroxyflavone is a direct inhibitor of human and murine pyridoxal phosphatase</a></h4>

              
                Vitamin B6 deficiency has been linked to cognitive impairment in human brain disorders for decades. Still, the molecular mechanisms linking vitamin B6 to these pathologies remain poorly understood, and whether vitamin B6 supplementation improves cognition is unclear as well. Pyridoxal 5’-phosphate phosphatase (PDXP), an enzyme that controls levels of pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP), the co-enzymatically active form of vitamin B6, may represent an alternative therapeutic entry point into vitamin B6-associated pathologies. However, pharmacological PDXP inhibitors to test this concept are lacking. We now identify a PDXP and age-dependent decline of PLP levels in the murine hippocampus that provides a rationale for the development of PDXP inhibitors. Using a combination of small-molecule screening, protein crystallography, and biolayer interferometry, we discover, visualize, and analyze 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) as a direct and potent PDXP inhibitor. 7,8-DHF binds and reversibly inhibits PDXP with low micromolar affinity and sub-micromolar potency. In mouse hippocampal neurons, 7,8-DHF increases PLP in a PDXP-dependent manner. These findings validate PDXP as a druggable target. Of note, 7,8-DHF is a well-studied molecule in brain disorder models, although its mechanism of action is actively debated. Our discovery of 7,8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor offers novel mechanistic insights into the controversy surrounding 7,8-DHF-mediated effects in the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91876">Defective mesenchymal Bmpr1a-mediated BMP signaling causes congenital pulmonary cysts</a></h4>

              
                Abnormal lung development can cause congenital pulmonary cysts, the mechanisms of which remain largely unknown. Although the cystic lesions are believed to result directly from disrupted airway epithelial cell growth, the extent to which developmental defects in lung mesenchymal cells contribute to abnormal airway epithelial cell growth and subsequent cystic lesions has not been thoroughly examined. In the present study using genetic mouse models, we dissected the roles of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor 1a (Bmpr1a)-mediated BMP signaling in lung mesenchyme during prenatal lung development and discovered that abrogation of mesenchymal <i>Bmpr1a</i> disrupted normal lung branching morphogenesis, leading to the formation of prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. Severe deficiency of airway smooth muscle cells and subepithelial elastin fibers were found in the cystic airways of the mesenchymal <i>Bmpr1a</i> knockout lungs. In addition, ectopic mesenchymal expression of BMP ligands and airway epithelial perturbation of the Sox2-Sox9 proximal-distal axis were detected in the mesenchymal <i>Bmpr1a</i> knockout lungs. However, deletion of Smad1/5, two major BMP signaling downstream effectors, from the lung mesenchyme did not phenocopy the cystic abnormalities observed in the mesenchymal <i>Bmpr1a</i> knockout lungs, suggesting that a Smad-independent mechanism contributes to prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. These findings reveal for the first time the role of mesenchymal BMP signaling in lung development and a potential pathogenic mechanism underlying congenital pulmonary cysts.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97489">Convergence of inputs from the basal ganglia with layer 5 of motor cortex and cerebellum in mouse motor thalamus</a></h4>

              
                A key to motor control is the motor thalamus, where several inputs converge. One excitatory input originates from layer 5 of primary motor cortex (M1<sub>L5</sub>), while another arises from the deep cerebellar nuclei (Cb). M1<sub>L5</sub> terminals distribute throughout the motor thalamus and overlap with GABAergic inputs from the basal ganglia output nuclei, the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). In contrast, it is thought that Cb and basal ganglia inputs are segregated. Therefore, we hypothesized that one potential function of the GABAergic inputs from basal ganglia is to selectively inhibit, or gate, excitatory signals from M1<sub>L5</sub> in the motor thalamus. Here, we tested this possibility and determined the circuit organization of mouse (both sexes) motor thalamus using an optogenetic strategy in acute slices. First, we demonstrated the presence of a feedforward transthalamic pathway from M1<sub>L5</sub> through motor thalamus. Importantly, we discovered that GABAergic inputs from the GPi and SNr converge onto single motor thalamic cells with excitatory synapses from M1<sub>L5</sub>. Separately, we also demonstrate that, perhaps unexpectedly, GABAergic GPi and SNr inputs converge with those from the Cb. We interpret these results to indicate that a role of the basal ganglia is to gate the thalamic transmission of M1<sub>L5</sub> and Cb information to cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95856">Obox4 promotes zygotic genome activation upon loss of Dux</a></h4>

              
                Once fertilized, mouse zygotes rapidly proceed to zygotic genome activation (ZGA), during which long terminal repeats (LTRs) of murine endogenous retroviruses with leucine tRNA primer (MERVL) are activated by a conserved homeodomain-containing transcription factor, DUX. However, <i>Dux</i>-knockout embryos produce fertile mice, suggesting that ZGA is redundantly driven by an unknown factor(s). Here we present multiple lines of evidence that the multicopy homeobox gene, <i>Obox4</i>, encodes a transcription factor that is highly expressed in mouse 2-cell embryos and redundantly drives ZGA. Genome-wide profiling revealed that OBOX4 specifically binds and activates MERVL LTRs as well as a subset of murine endogenous retroviruses with lysine tRNA primer (MERVK) LTRs. Depletion of<i> Obox4 </i>is tolerated by embryogenesis, whereas concomitant <i>Obox4</i>/<i>Dux</i> depletion markedly compromises embryonic development. Our study identified OBOX4 as a transcription factor that provides genetic redundancy to pre-implantation development.

">Interactive data exploration websites for large-scale electrophysiology</a></h4>

              
                Methodological advances in neuroscience have enabled the collection of massive datasets which demand innovative approaches for scientific communication. Existing platforms for data storage lack intuitive tools for data exploration, limiting our ability to interact effectively with these brain-wide datasets. We introduce two public websites: Data and Atlas developed for the International Brain Laboratory which provide access to millions of behavioral trials and hundreds of thousands of individual neurons. These interfaces allow users to discover both the raw and processed brain-wide data released by the IBL at the scale of the whole brain, individual sessions, trials, and neurons. By hosting these data interfaces as websites they are available cross-platform with no installation. By releasing each site's code as a modular open-source framework, other researchers can easily develop their own web interfaces and explore their own data. As neuroscience datasets continue to expand, customizable web interfaces offer a glimpse into a future of streamlined data exploration and act as blueprints for future tools.

">Olfactory facilitation of visual categorization in the 4-month-old brain depends on visual demand</a></h4>

              
                To navigate their environment, infants rely on intersensory facilitation when unisensory perceptual demand is high, a principle known as inverse effectiveness. Given that this principle was mainly documented in the context of audiovisual stimulations, here we aim to determine whether it applies to olfactory-to-visual facilitation. We build on previous evidence that the mother's body odor facilitates face categorization in the 4-month-old brain, and investigate whether this effect depends on visual demand. Scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded in 2 groups of 4-month-old infants while they watched 6-Hz streams of visual stimuli with faces displayed every 6th stimulus to tag a face-selective response at 1 Hz. We used variable natural stimuli in one group (Nat Group), while stimuli were simplified in the other group (Simp Group) to reduce perceptual categorization demand. During visual stimulation, infants were alternatively exposed to their mother's vs. a baseline odor. For both groups, we found an occipito-temporal face-selective response, but with a larger amplitude for the simplified stimuli, reflecting less demanding visual categorization. Importantly, the mother's body odor enhances the response to natural, but not to simplified, face stimuli, indicating that maternal odor improves face categorization when it is most demanding for the 4-month-old brain. Overall, this study demonstrates that the inverse effectiveness of intersensory facilitation applies to the sense of smell during early perceptual development.

">NMDA receptor antagonist memantine selectively affects recurrent processing during perceptual inference</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual inference requires the integration of visual features through recurrent processing, the dynamic exchange of information between higher and lower level cortical regions. While animal research has demonstrated a crucial role of NMDA receptors in recurrent processing, establishing a causal link between NMDA-mediated recurrent processing and human perception has remained challenging. Here, we report two pharmacological studies with randomized, double-blind, crossover designs in which we administered the NMDA antagonist memantine, while collecting human electroencephalography (EEG). We trained and tested EEG classifiers to reflect the processing of specific stimulus features with increasing levels of complexity, namely differences in stimulus contrast, collinearity between local line elements, and illusory surfaces of a Kanizsa triangle. In two experiments involving different participants and visual tasks, we found that memantine selectively affected decoding of the Kanizsa illusion, known to depend on recurrent processing, while leaving decoding of contrast and collinearity largely unaffected. Interestingly, the results from an attentional blink (experiment 1) and task-relevance manipulation (experiment 2) showed that memantine was only effective when the stimulus was attended and consciously accessed. These findings demonstrate that NMDA inhibition selectively affects recurrent processing, especially for attended objects, and thereby provide a crucial step toward bridging animal and human research, shedding light on the neural mechanisms underpinning perceptual inference and conscious perception.

">Lack of Oncomodulin Increases ATP-Dependent Calcium Signaling and Susceptibility to Noise in Adult Mice</a></h4>

              
                Tight regulation of Ca2+ is crucial for the function of cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs). Dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis in OHCs is associated with impaired hearing function and contributes to increased vulnerability to environmental insults, such as noise exposure. Ca2+ signaling in developing OHCs can be modulated by oncomodulin (OCM), an EF-hand calcium-binding protein. Here, we investigated whether the lack of OCM disrupts the control of intracellular Ca2+ in mature OHCs, and influences vulnerability to noise. Using young adult CBA/CaJ mice, we found that OHCs from Ocm-knockout (Ocm-/-) mice exhibited normal biophysical profiles and electromotile responses compared to littermate control OHCs. Moderate noise exposure (95 dB SPL, 2 hrs) caused temporary hearing threshold shifts in Ocm+/+ and Ocm-/- mice but the loss of hearing was permanent for Ocm-/- mice. However, while Ocm+/+ fully recovered their hearing 2 weeks after noise exposure, Ocm-/- mice showed permanent threshold shifts. Using a genetically encoded Ca2+ sensor (GCaMP6s) expressed in Ocm+/+ and Ocm-/- OHCs, we found that chronic noise exposure (95 dB SPL, 9 hrs) increased ATP-induced Ca2+ signaling in Ocm-/- OHCs compared to Ocm+/+ OHCs. Chronic noise exposures also caused higher hearing threshold shifts in Ocm-/- mice. Prior to noise exposure, P2X2 expression was already upregulated in Ocm-/- mice compared to Ocm+/+ mice. Following chronic noise, P2X2 receptors were upregulated in the Ocm+/+ cochlea but not in the Ocm-/- cochlea, which retains their pre-noise high expression level. We propose that the lack of OCM increases susceptibility to noise. Increased purinergic signaling and dysregulation of cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis could contribute to early onset hearing loss in the Ocm-/- mice.

">Hierarchical Bayesian inference to model continuous phenotypical progression in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Throughout an organism's lifespan, a multitude of biological systems transition through complex biophysical processes. These processes serve as indicators of the underlying biological states. Inferring these latent unobserved states is a key problem in modern biology and neuroscience. Unfortunately, in many experimental setups, we can at best obtain snapshots of the system at different times for different individuals, and one major challenge is the one of reconciling those measurements. This formalism is particularly relevant in the study of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) progression, in which we observe in brain donors the aggregation of pathological proteins but the underlying disease state is unknown. The progression of AD can be modeled by assigning a latent score - termed pseudotime - to each pathological state, creating a pseudotemporal ordering of donors based on their pathological burden. This paper proposes a hierarchical Bayesian framework to model AD progression using detailed quantification of multiple AD pathological proteins from the Seattle AD Brain Cell Atlas consortium (SEA-AD). Inspired by biophysical models, we model pathological burden as an exponential process. Theoretical properties of the model are studied, by using linearization to reveal convergence and identifiability properties. We provide Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation algorithms, and show the effectiveness of our approach with multiple simulation studies across data conditions. Applying the methodology to SEA-AD brain data, we infer pseudotime for each donor and order them by pathological burden. Finally, we analyze the information within each pathological feature and utilize it to refine the model by focusing on the most informative pathologies. This lays the groundwork for suggesting future experimental design approaches.

">Retinoid X Receptor as a Novel Drug Target to Treat Neurological Disorders Associated with α-Synucleinopathies.</a></h4>

              
                The pathology of Parkinson Disease (PD) is multifaceted, with chronic neuroinflammation associated with glial cell activation standing out as a hallmark of PD pathophysiology. While a few treatments exist to interfere with inflammation, a breakthrough therapy based on innovative molecular mechanisms and targets is still awaited. The nuclear retinoid X receptor (RXR) is of particular interest for therapeutic intervention due to its ability to bind and activate permissive partners, NURR1 and PPARs, which have been shown to be dysfunctional in PD brains. Therefore, the goal of this study was to validate RXR-based therapy to slow down PD pathogenesis. Adult C57BL6 male mice were used in the study. PD-like pathology was triggered by co-delivery of AAV expressing alpha-synuclein and PFF to the substantia nigra pars compacta. The therapeutic potential of RXR activation was evaluated using AAV-mediated gene transport. Unbiased stereology, immunohistochemical analysis, LC/MS, and western blotting were employed to assess the therapeutic effect. At 8 weeks post-injection, elevated GFAP and Iba1 levels, associated with accumulated LB-like aggregates, pronounced loss of TH neuronal cells, and diminished dopamine (DA) levels were observed in affected brains. Moreover, PPAR and NURR1 protein levels were also reduced in these brains. Conversely, RXR overexpression resulted in an increase in PPAR and NURR1 levels, a reduction in GFAP and Iba1 levels, and a decrease in the number and distribution of LB-like aggregates. These phenomena were also accompanied by the prevention of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)+ cell loss and the DA deficit in the treated brains. Therefore, our data provide direct evidence of the therapeutic potential of RXR-based therapy and highlight RXR as a novel drug target for PD.

">Human sensory-like neuron cultivation - an optimized protocol</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Reprogramming of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and their differentiation into specific cell types, such as induced sensory-like neurons (iSN), are critical for disease modeling and drug testing. However, the variability of cell populations challenges reliability and reproducibility. While various protocols for iSN differentiation exist, development of non-iSN cells in these cultures remains an issue. Therefore, standardization of protocols is essential. This study aimed to improve iSN culture conditions by reducing the number of non-iSN cells while preserving survival and quality of iSN. Methods: iSN were differentiated from a healthy control iPSC line using an established protocol. Interventions for protocol optimization included floxuridine (FdU) or 1-{beta}-D-arabinofuranosyl-cytosin-hydrochlorid (AraC) treatment, Magnetic-Activated Cell Sorting (MACS), early cell passaging, and replating. Cell viability and iSN-to-total-cell-count ratio were assessed using a luminescent assay and immunocytochemistry, respectively. Results: Passaging of cells during differentiation did not increase the iSN-to-total-cell-count ratio, and MACS of immature iSN led to neuronal blebbing and reduced the iSN-to-total-cell-count ratio. Treatment with high concentrations and prolonged incubation of FdU or AraC resulted in excessive cell death. However, treatment with 10 M FdU for 24 h post-differentiation showed the most selective targeting of non-iSN cells, leading to an increase in the iSN-to-total-cell count ratio without compromising the viability or functionality of the iSN population. Replating of iSN shortly after seeding also helped to reduce non-iSN cells. Conclusion: In direct comparison to other methods, treatment with 10 M FdU for 24 h after differentiation represents a promising approach to improve iSN culture purity, offering a potential benefit for downstream applications in disease modeling and drug discovery. However, further investigations involving multiple iPSC lines and optimization of protocol parameters are warranted to fully exploit the potential of this method and enhance its reproducibility and applicability. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into optimizing culture conditions for iSN differentiation and highlights the importance of standardized protocols in iPSC-based research.

">Amyloid beta oligomers dysregulate oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination via PKC in the zebrafish spinal cord</a></h4>

              
                Amyloid beta oligomers (Abetao) have been proposed as candidates to induce oligodendrocyte (OL) and myelin dysfunctions in early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Nevertheless, little is known about how Abetao affect OL differentiation and myelination in vivo, and the underlying molecular mechanisms. In this study, we explored the effects of a brain intraventricular injection of Abetao on OLs and myelin in the developing spinal cord of zebrafish larvae. Using quantitative fluorescent in situ RNA hybridization assays, we demonstrated that Abetao altered myrf and mbp mRNA levels and the regional distribution of mbp during larval development, suggesting an early differentiation of OLs. Through live imaging of Tg(myrf:mScarlet) and Tg(mbp:tagRFP) zebrafish lines, both crossed with Tg(olig2:EGFP), we found that Abetao increased the number of myrf+ and mbp+ OLs in the dorsal spinal cord at 72 hpf and 5 dpf, respectively, without affecting total cell numbers. Furthermore, Abetao also increased the number of myelin sheaths per OL and the number of myelinated axons in the dorsal spinal cord compared to vehicle-injected control animals. Interestingly, the treatment of Abetao-injected zebrafish with the pan-PKC inhibitor Go6983 restored the aforementioned alterations in OLs and myelin to control levels. Altogether, not only do we demonstrate that Abetao induce a precocious oligodendroglial differentiation leading to dysregulated myelination, but we also identified PKC as a key player in Abetao-induced pathology.

	<p>The endocannabinoid system has been linked to various physiological and pathological processes, because it plays a neuromodulator role in the central nervous system. In this sense, cannabinoids have been used off-label for neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHA), as well as in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), a more prevalent neurodegenerative disease. Thus, this study aims, through a comprehensive literature review, to arrive at a better understanding of the impact of cannabinoids in the therapeutic treatment of patients with ASD, ADHD, and Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD). Overall, cannabis products rich in CBD displayed a higher therapeutic potential for ASD children, while cannabis products rich in THC have been tested more for AD therapy. For ADHD, the clinical studies are incipient and inconclusive, but promising. In general, the main limitations of the clinical studies are the lack of standardization of the cannabis-based products consumed by the participants, a lack of scientific rigor, and the small number of participants.</p>

	<p>Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is increasingly recognized for its potential to modulate cerebral blood flow (CBF) and evoke cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), which are crucial in conditions like mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. This study explores the impact of tES on the neurovascular unit (NVU), employing a physiological modeling approach to simulate the vascular response to electric fields generated by tES. Utilizing the FitzHugh&amp;amp;ndash;Nagumo model for neuroelectrical activity, we demonstrate how tES can initiate vascular responses such as vasoconstriction followed by delayed vasodilation in cerebral arterioles, potentially modulated by a combination of local metabolic demands and autonomic regulation (pivotal locus coeruleus). Here, four distinct pathways within the NVU were modeled to reflect the complex interplay between synaptic activity, astrocytic influences, perivascular potassium dynamics, and smooth muscle cell responses. Modal analysis revealed characteristic dynamics of these pathways, suggesting that oscillatory tES may finely tune the vascular tone by modulating the stiffness and elasticity of blood vessel walls, possibly by also impacting endothelial glycocalyx function. The findings underscore the therapeutic potential vis-&amp;amp;agrave;-vis blood-brain barrier safety of tES in modulating neurovascular coupling and cognitive function needing the precise modulation of NVU dynamics. This technology review supports the human-in-the-loop integration of tES leveraging digital health technologies for the personalized management of cerebral blood flow, offering new avenues for treating vascular cognitive disorders. Future studies should aim to optimize tES parameters using computational modeling and validate these models in clinical settings, enhancing the understanding of tES in neurovascular health.</p>

<p>Graphical Abstract: We used single-cell transcriptomics to explore cell type and neuronal class diversity, and in situ hybridization chain reaction to view expression in the brain of the nudibranch mollusc, <i>Berghia stephanieae</i>. Gene markers for nudibranch neurons and glia were found. Transcription factors, neuropeptides, and unannotated genes subdivided neuronal classes.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Gastropod molluscs such as <i>Aplysia</i>, <i>Lymnaea</i>, and <i>Tritonia</i> have been important for determining fundamental rules of motor control, learning, and memory because of their large, individually identifiable neurons. Yet only a small number of gastropod neurons have known molecular markers, limiting the ability to establish brain-wide structure–function relations. Here we combine high-throughput, single-cell RNA sequencing with in situ hybridization chain reaction in the nudibranch <i>Berghia stephanieae</i> to identify and visualize the expression of markers for cell types. Broad neuronal classes were characterized by genes associated with neurotransmitters, like acetylcholine, glutamate, serotonin, and GABA, as well as neuropeptides. These classes were subdivided by other genes including transcriptional regulators and unannotated genes. Marker genes expressed by neurons and glia formed discrete, previously unrecognized regions within and between ganglia. This study provides the foundation for understanding the fundamental cellular organization of gastropod nervous systems.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mitochondria play critical roles in neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation and fate decisions. The subcellular localization of mitochondria in neural stem/progenitor cells during mitosis potentially influences the distribution of mitochondria to the daughter cells and thus their fates. Therefore, understanding the spatial dynamics of mitochondria provides important knowledge about brain development. In this study, we analyzed the subcellular localization of mitochondria in the fetal human neocortex with a particular focus on the basal radial glial cells (bRGCs), a neural stem/progenitor cell subtype attributed to the evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex. During interphase, bRGCs exhibit a polarized localization of mitochondria that is localized at the base of the process or the proximal part of the process. Thereafter, mitochondria in bRGCs at metaphase show unpolarized distribution in which the mitochondria are randomly localized in the cytoplasm. During anaphase and telophase, mitochondria are still localized evenly, but mainly in the periphery of the cytoplasm. Mitochondria start to accumulate at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. These results suggest that the mitochondrial localization in bRGCs is tightly regulated during the cell cycle, which may ensure the proper distribution of mitochondria to the daughter cells and, thus in turn, influence their fates.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>For postmetamorphic specimens of amphioxus (Cephalochordata), serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBSEM) is used to describe the long-ignored Rohde-like cells (RLCs) at the extreme posterior end of the dorsal nerve cord. These cells, numbering about three dozen in all, are divisible into a group with larger diameters running near the dorsal side of the cord and a more ventral group with smaller diameters closely associated with the central canal of the neurocoel. It is possible that the smaller ventral cells might be generated at the ependymal zone of the dorsal nerve cord and later migrate to a dorsal position, although a functional reason for this remains a mystery. All the RLCs have conspicuous regions of microvilli covering as much as 40% of their surface; limited data (by others) on the more anterior bona fide Rohde cells also indicate an extensive microvillar surface. Thus, both the RLCs and the better-known Rohde cells appear to be rhabdomeric photoreceptors, although a specific function for this feature is currently unknown. Even more perplexingly, although the Rohde cells are quintessential neurons extending giant processes, each RLC comprises a perikaryon that does not bear any neurites.</p>

	<p>As the population ages worldwide, Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), the most prevalent kind of neurodegenerative disorder among older people, has become a significant factor affecting quality of life, public health, and economies. However, the exact pathogenesis of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s remains elusive, and existing highly recognized pathogenesis includes the amyloid cascade hypothesis, Tau neurofibrillary tangles hypothesis, and neuroinflammation hypothesis. The major diagnoses of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease include neuroimaging positron emission computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid molecular diagnosis. The therapy of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease primarily relies on drugs, and the approved drugs on the market include acetylcholinesterase drugs, glutamate receptor antagonists, and amyloid-&amp;amp;beta; monoclonal antibodies. Still, the existing drugs can only alleviate the symptoms of the disease and cannot completely reverse it. This review aims to summarize existing research results on Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease pathogenesis, diagnosis, and drug therapy, with the objective of facilitating future research in this area.</p>

	<p>Neuropathic pain arises from injuries to the nervous system in diseases such as diabetes, infections, toxicity, and traumas. The underlying mechanism of neuropathic pain involves peripheral and central pathological modifications. Peripheral mechanisms entail nerve damage, leading to neuronal hypersensitivity and ectopic action potentials. Central sensitization involves a neuropathological process with increased responsiveness of the nociceptive neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) to their normal or subthreshold input due to persistent stimuli, leading to sustained electrical discharge, synaptic plasticity, and aberrant processing in the CNS. Current treatments, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, aim to alleviate symptoms but often face challenges due to the complexity of neuropathic pain. Neuromodulation is emerging as an important therapeutic approach for the treatment of neuropathic pain in patients unresponsive to common therapies, by promoting the normalization of neuronal and/or glial activity and by targeting cerebral cortical regions, spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, and nerve endings. Having a better understanding of the efficacy, adverse events and applicability of neuromodulation through pre-clinical studies is of great importance. Unveiling the mechanisms and characteristics of neuromodulation to manage neuropathic pain is essential to understand how to use it. In the present article, we review the current understanding supporting dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord neuromodulation as a therapeutic approach for neuropathic pain.</p>

	<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has brought attention to the long-term consequences of the virus, particularly the persistent symptoms that characterize long COVID. This syndrome, which can last for months after the initial infection, includes a range of neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations that have significant implications for brain health and dementia research. This review explores the current understanding of long COVID&amp;amp;rsquo;s cognitive, neurological, and psychiatric symptoms and their potential impact on brain stimulation and neuroimaging studies. It argues that researchers must adapt their study designs and screening processes to account for the confounding effects of long COVID and ensure the accuracy and reliability of their findings. To advance the understanding of this condition and its long-term effects on brain health, the review proposes a series of strategies, including the development of standardized screening tools, the investigation of underlying mechanisms, and the identification of risk factors and protective factors. It also emphasizes the importance of collaborative research efforts and international data sharing platforms in accelerating the pace of discovery and developing targeted interventions for individuals with long COVID. As the prevalence of this condition continues to grow, it is imperative that the neuroscience community comes together to address this challenge and support those affected by long COVID.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/6/ENEURO.0286-23.2024?rss=1">Large Individual Differences in Functional Connectivity in the Context of Major Depression and Antidepressant Pharmacotherapy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Clinical studies of major depression (MD) generally focus on group effects, yet interindividual differences in brain function are increasingly recognized as important and may even impact effect sizes related to group effects. Here, we examine the magnitude of individual differences in relation to group differences that are commonly investigated (e.g., related to MD diagnosis and treatment response). Functional MRI data from 107 participants (63 female, 44 male) were collected at baseline, 2, and 8&nbsp;weeks during which patients received pharmacotherapy (escitalopram, <I>N</I> = 68) and controls (<I>N</I>&nbsp;=&nbsp;39) received no intervention. The unique contributions of different sources of variation were examined by calculating how much variance in functional connectivity was shared across all participants and sessions, within/across groups (patients vs controls, responders vs nonresponders, female vs male participants), recording sessions, and individuals. Individual differences and common connectivity across groups, sessions, and participants contributed most to the explained variance (&gt;95% across analyses). Group differences related to MD diagnosis, treatment response, and biological sex made significant but small contributions (0.3&ndash;1.2%). High individual variation was present in cognitive control and attention areas, while low individual variation characterized primary sensorimotor regions. Group differences were much smaller than individual differences in the context of MD and its treatment. These results could be linked to the variable findings and difficulty translating research on MD to clinical practice. Future research should examine brain features with low and high individual variation in relation to psychiatric symptoms and treatment trajectories to explore the clinical relevance of the individual differences identified here.</p>

                <p>Homeostatic plasticity stabilizes firing rates of neurons, but the pressure to restore low activity rates can significantly alter synaptic and cellular properties. Most previous studies of homeostatic readjustment to complete activity silencing in rodent forebrain have examined changes after 2&nbsp;d of deprivation, but it is known that longer periods of deprivation can produce adverse effects. To better understand the mechanisms underlying these effects and to address how presynaptic as well as postsynaptic compartments change during homeostatic plasticity, we subjected mouse cortical slice cultures to a more severe 5&nbsp;d deprivation paradigm. We developed and validated a computational framework to measure the number and morphology of presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments from super-resolution light microscopy images of dense cortical tissue. Using these tools, combined with electrophysiological miniature excitatory postsynaptic current measurements, and synaptic imaging at the electron microscopy level, we assessed the functional and morphological results of prolonged deprivation. Excitatory synapses were strengthened both presynaptically and postsynaptically. Surprisingly, we also observed a decrement in the density of excitatory synapses, both as measured from colocalized staining of pre- and postsynaptic proteins in tissue and from the number of dendritic spines. Overall, our results suggest that cortical networks deprived of activity progressively move toward a smaller population of stronger synapses.</p>

                Background Non-union fractures can be prevented with bone grafts, such as hydroxyapatite made from green mussel shells. Green mussel shells contain a high percentage of HA, making them a promising alternative for bone healing. This research aims to reveal the effectiveness of green mussel shell HA as a bone substitute material and to provide knowledge for further research. Methods This research was conducted for four months using a true experimental research method with a post-test-only control group design. This study used 36 New Zealand rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) which were divided into 9 groups: positive control, negative control, and intervention at weeks 2, 4 and 6 after the intervention. All groups were subjected to three general procedures: pre-surgery, surgery, and post-surgery. This study utilized histological evaluation and biochemical assessment, specifically measuring serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, to investigate the effects of hydroxyapatite (HA) from green mussel shells on bone healing in rabbits. Results The findings demonstrated that green mussel shell HA hashad efficacy in accelerating bone healing, better than HA bovine HA i.e. green mussel shell hydroxyapatite showed superior efficacy compared to bovine hydroxyapatite in accelerating and maximizing fracture healing, as compared to the 6-week negative control group and demonstrated a significant difference (p < 0.05). Conclusions Green mussel hydroxyapatite is proven to be able to fasten and maximize the bone healing process as fast as bovine HA, and even has higher efficacy than bovine HA.

                Background Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as obesity, hypertension (HPT), and type II diabetes (T2D) are of increasing concern in South Africa (SA), with women being more at risk. Authors conducted a scoping review to identify and map the evidence available about the barriers of access to obesity, HPT, and T2D care among women in SA. Methods Arksey and O'Malley's framework for scoping review was used. The search of the literature was completed in the Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases between April and May 2022. Only studies conducted among women in SA were eligible for inclusion. Identified barriers were mapped onto Levesque’s framework of access to health care to determine which points along the chain of accessing NCD health care among women are mostly impacted. Results Seven articles were included in the review: qualitative (n=2), quantitative (n=2), mixed methods (n=2), and grey literature (n=1). The included studies reported barriers of access to HPT and T2D care only, and no study reported barriers to obesity care. Supply-side barriers included lack of knowledge about available services, physician heavy workloads, medicine stock-outs, limited availability of testing equipment, travelling long distances, long waiting times, and delayed referral. Demand-side barriers included women having low self-awareness of NCD status, concerns about confidentiality, perceived discrimination, and poverty. Conclusions The study highlighted barriers related to the availability and accessibility dimension of access to health care, indicating that care for HPT and T2D is often inaccessible, with women often unable to reach health facilities or service providers. There is a pressing need for further research on access to healthcare for obesity, T2D, and HPT for women in South Africa, particularly among women who bear a disproportionately high burden of these conditions.

                Background High work pressure and complex problems during the COVID-19 pandemic caused nursing staff, including first-line managers, experienced burnout. Objective This study aims to explore burnout experienced of first-line managers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This qualitative descriptive study used thematic analysis. Twelve first-line managers were selected using purposive sampling from two government hospitals, designated as COVID-19 referral centres in Jakarta and Depok, Indonesia. Data were collected through semi-structured online face-to-face interviews using ZOOM meeting video with a guideline interview. Results Exploration of first-line manager’s burnout revealed three themes: 1) unpreparedness, 2) impact on wellbeing, and 3) resilience. Conclusion The first-line managers experienced burnout during the pandemic due to obstacles in implementing management roles and functions accompanied. Their burnout was caused by the unpreparedness of both the hospital management and the community. Their burnout has an impact on their emotional and physical well-being. By this time, the first-line manager’s resilience was formed because they used adaptive coping mechanisms and had a good support system. The experience during COVID-19 should be a lesson learned to strengthen the healthcare system in the future. Risk management mitigation must be systematically and routinely performed.

                Abstract* Background Researchers are leading the development of AI designed to conduct interviews. These developments imply that AI's role is expanding from mere data analysis to becoming a tool for social researchers to interact with and comprehend their subjects. Yet, academic discussions have not addressed the potential impacts of AI on narrative interviews. In narrative interviews, the method of collecting data is a collaborative effort. The interviewer also contributes to exploring and shaping the interviewee's story. A compelling narrative interviewer has to display critical skills, such as maintaining a specific questioning order, showing empathy, and helping participants delve into and build their own stories. Methods This case study configured an OpenAI Assistant on WhatsApp to conduct narrative interviews with a human participant. The participant shared the same story in two distinct conversations: first, following a standard cycle and answering questions earnestly, and second, deliberately sidetracking the assistant from the main interview path as instructed by the researcher, to test how well the metrics could reflect the deliberate differences between different conversations. The AI's performance was evaluated through conversation analysis and specific narrative indicators, focusing on its adherence to the interview structure, empathy, narrative coherence, complexity, and support for human participant agency. The study sought to answer these questions: 1) How can the proposed metrics help us, as social researchers without a technical background, understand the quality of the AI-driven interviews in this study? 2) What do these findings contribute to our discussion on using AI in narrative interviews for social research? 3) What further research could these results inspire? Results The findings show to what extent the AI maintained structure and adaptability in conversations, illustrating its potential to support personalized, flexible narrative interviews based on specific needs. Conclusions These results suggest that social researchers without a technical background can use observation-based metrics to gauge how well an AI assistant conducts narrative interviews. They also prompt reflection on AI's role in narrative interviews and spark further research.

                Background Mental health and work are closely interlinked. Evidence suggests that food handlers suffer from poor mental health across the globe. A job in the food service sector is emotionally demanding as employees directly interact with customers who insist on impeccable services and real-time responses. The causes of mental health conditions among food handlers are multifactorial. Studies on the antecedents, outcomes, and intervening factors of foodservice employees’ mental health are fragmented and sparse. Objective We aimed to explore the existing literature describing the antecedents and outcomes of mental health disorders among food handlers. Moreover, we also aimed to explore various contextual factors that directly or indirectly influence the relationship between multiple antecedents and outcomes of food handlers’ mental health. Inclusion criteria Studies that focus on identifying the antecedents, outcomes, and contextual factors that influence the relationship between the antecedents and consequences of food handlers’ mental health will be included in the scoping review. Methods This scoping review will follow Arksey and O'Malley's (2005) framework: 1) identifying the research question; 2) identifying relevant studies; 3) study selection; 4) charting the data; and 5) collating, summarizing, and reporting results. Comprehensive searches will be conducted in databases such as PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL using relevant keywords. Studies meeting the inclusion criteria that focused on antecedents, outcomes, and contextual factors influencing the mental health of food handlers will be selected. Data will be extracted and charted in electronic form. The findings will be narratively summarized and thematically analyzed to answer the research questions.

                <p>by Shaked Bergman, Tamir Tuller</p>

CRISPR is a gene editing technology which enables precise in-vivo genome editing; but its potential is hampered by its relatively low specificity and sensitivity. Improving CRISPR’s on-target and off-target effects requires a better understanding of its mechanism and determinants. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, the chromosomal 3D spatial structure’s association with CRISPR’s cleavage efficiency, and its predictive capabilities. We used high-resolution Hi-C data to estimate the 3D distance between different regions in the human genome and utilized these spatial properties to generate 3D-based features, characterizing each region’s density. We evaluated these features based on empirical, in-vivo CRISPR efficiency data and compared them to 425 features used in state-of-the-art models. The 3D features ranked in the top 13% of the features, and significantly improved the predictive power of LASSO and xgboost models trained with these features. The features indicated that sites with lower spatial density demonstrated higher efficiency. Understanding how CRISPR is affected by the 3D DNA structure provides insight into CRISPR’s mechanism in general and improves our ability to correctly predict CRISPR’s cleavage as well as design sgRNAs for therapeutic and scientific use.

                <p>by Christina M. P. Ray, Huilin Yang, Jamie B. Spangler, Feilim Mac Gabhann</p>

The spread of cancer from organ to organ (metastasis) is responsible for the vast majority of cancer deaths; however, most current anti-cancer drugs are designed to arrest or reverse tumor growth without directly addressing disease spread. It was recently discovered that tumor cell-secreted interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) synergize to enhance cancer metastasis in a cell-density dependent manner, and blockade of the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors (IL-6R and IL-8R) with a novel bispecific antibody, BS1, significantly reduced metastatic burden in multiple preclinical mouse models of cancer. Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), which combine two different antigen-binding sites into one molecule, are a promising modality for drug development due to their enhanced avidity and dual targeting effects. However, while BsAbs have tremendous therapeutic potential, elucidating the mechanisms underlying their binding and inhibition will be critical for maximizing the efficacy of new BsAb treatments. Here, we describe a quantitative, computational model of the BS1 BsAb, exhibiting how modeling multivalent binding provides key insights into antibody affinity and avidity effects and can guide therapeutic design. We present detailed simulations of the monovalent and bivalent binding interactions between different antibody constructs and the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors to establish how antibody properties and system conditions impact the formation of binary (antibody-receptor) and ternary (receptor-antibody-receptor) complexes. Model results demonstrate how the balance of these complex types drives receptor inhibition, providing important and generalizable predictions for effective therapeutic design.

Immunization through repeated direct venous inoculation of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (Pf) sporozoites (PfSPZ) under chloroquine chemoprophylaxis, using the PfSPZ Chemoprophylaxis Vaccine (PfSPZ-CVac), induces high-level protection against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). Humoral and cellular immunity contribute to vaccine efficacy but only limited information about the implicated Pf-specific antigens is available. Here, we examined Pf-specific antibody profiles, measured by protein arrays representing the full Pf proteome, of 40 placebo- and PfSPZ-immunized malaria-naïve volunteers from an earlier published PfSPZ-CVac dose-escalation trial. For this purpose, we both utilized and adapted supervised machine learning methods to identify predictive antibody profiles at two different time points: after immunization and before CHMI. We developed an adapted multitask support vector machine (SVM) approach and compared it to standard methods, i.e. single-task SVM, regularized logistic regression and random forests. Our results show, that the multitask SVM approach improved the classification performance to discriminate the protection status based on the underlying antibody-profiles while combining time- and dose-dependent data in the prediction model. Additionally, we developed the new f<i>E</i>ature di<i>S</i>tance ex<i>P</i>lainabilit<i>Y</i> (ESPY) method to quantify the impact of single antigens on the non-linear multitask SVM model and make it more interpretable. In conclusion, our multitask SVM model outperforms the studied standard approaches in regard of classification performance. Moreover, with our new explanation method ESPY, we were able to interpret the impact of Pf-specific antigen antibody responses that predict sterile protective immunity against CHMI after immunization. The identified Pf-specific antigens may contribute to a better understanding of immunity against human malaria and may foster vaccine development.

                <p>by Ellie Mainou, Ruy M. Ribeiro, Jessica M. Conway</p>

Understanding the dynamics of acute HIV infection can offer valuable insights into the early stages of viral behavior, potentially helping uncover various aspects of HIV pathogenesis. The standard viral dynamics model explains HIV viral dynamics during acute infection reasonably well. However, the model makes simplifying assumptions, neglecting some aspects of HIV infection. For instance, in the standard model, target cells are infected by a single HIV virion. Yet, cellular multiplicity of infection (MOI) may have considerable effects in pathogenesis and viral evolution. Further, when using the standard model, we take constant infected cell death rates, simplifying the dynamic immune responses. Here, we use four models—1) the standard viral dynamics model, 2) an alternate model incorporating cellular MOI, 3) a model assuming density-dependent death rate of infected cells and 4) a model combining (2) and (3)—to investigate acute infection dynamics in 43 people living with HIV very early after HIV exposure. We find that all models qualitatively describe the data, but none of the tested models is by itself the best to capture different kinds of heterogeneity. Instead, different models describe differing features of the dynamics more accurately. For example, while the standard viral dynamics model may be the most parsimonious across study participants by the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc), we find that viral peaks are better explained by a model allowing for cellular MOI, using a linear regression analysis as analyzed by <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>. These results suggest that heterogeneity in within-host viral dynamics cannot be captured by a single model. Depending on the specific aspect of interest, a corresponding model should be employed.

                Introduction Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) have low survival rates in advanced stages. Anticancer drugs (ACDs) are usually recommended, but may be associated with important toxicity and lower quality of life (QoL). Best supportive care (BSC) could represent a valid alternative of treatment. We aim to synthesise evidence regarding the effects of ACDs versus BSC in patients with advanced BTCs. Methods We conducted a systematic review including randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any type of ACD versus BSC, placebo or no active treatment. We searched in five databases. Two reviewers performed selection, risk of bias and data extraction processes. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses and assessed certainty of evidence using GRADE. Results We included eight RCTs. Biological/targeted therapies may result in little to no difference in overall survival (OS) (Mean difference (MD): 1.66 months higher; 95%CI, -0.65 to 3.96; low certainty) and toxicity (Relative risk (RR): 1.38; 95%CI, 0.99 to 1.93; low certainty), with uncertain effects on QoL. Evidence is very uncertain about the effects of chemotherapy on OS (MD: 3.28 months higher; 95%CI, 0.16 to 6.39; very low certainty), and may increase toxicity (RR: 1.33; 95%CI, 1.03 to 1.72; low certainty). We identified insufficient evidence for other prespecified outcomes. Conclusions Compared to BSC, ACDs have poor OS benefit and higher toxicity. Due to overall very low certainty of evidence, the effects of ACDs on critical outcomes are still unclear. Our findings should be used to better inform decision-making processes and future research.

                Abstract* Background The high prevalence of infant stunting and maternal undernutrition in low- and middle-income countries poses a significant public health threat. The World Health Organization recommends balanced energy-protein (BEP) supplementation to pregnant women from populations with a high prevalence of underweight (prepregnancy BMI <18.5 kg/m2), leaving a notable gap in guidance for lactating women. Therefore, we established the Maternal BEP Studies Harmonization Initiative (BEP Initiative) to investigate the impact of BEP supplementation given to pregnant and/or lactating women on maternal and infant outcomes by synthesizing data from multiple clinical trials. This is a study protocol for our prospective individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis on BEP lactation trials. Methods Data from four randomized controlled trials that include mother-infant dyads in India (n=816), Pakistan (n=957), Burkina Faso (n=800), and Nepal (n=726) will be pooled and analysed. Women were randomized to BEP (one trial had a third arm with maternal BEP plus infants receiving azithromycin) or control groups at baseline (during the first week) and received the intervention through six months postpartum. A one-stage IPD meta-analysis will be done using mixed-effects linear and log-binomial regression models to account for between-trial heterogeneity. The primary outcome of infant length-for-age z scores (LAZ) and secondary outcomes of maternal and infant indicators of nutritional status, all at six months of age, will be examined. Also, we will assess baseline characteristics as covariates and effect modifiers for the BEP to outcome relationship. Discussion This prospective IPD meta-analysis uses a one-stage IPD meta-analysis, which allows for higher statistical power to examine outcomes, more flexibility in defining variables, and can examine effect modifiers, which could inform which individuals or populations may benefit more from BEP given during lactation.

                Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be the foremost mortality internationally. Cardiac rehabilitation has proven as an effective program in reducing CVD burden. Participation in cardiac rehabilitation programs is very low. Digital health intervention emerged as an alternative method to deliver Cardiac rehabilitation. This review aimed to investigate the impact of digital health intervention on the outcomes of interest Methods the following databases: PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and Cochrane Library have been searched to retrieve randomized controlled trials that examine the impact of digital health intervention on blood pressure, body mass index, lipid profile, blood glucose, Six-Minute Walk Test, and peak oxygen consumption. filters were set to include studies published in English between 2000-2023. Results Nineteen studies were included in this review. Six-Minute Walk Test (MD = 16.70; 95% CI: 6.00 to 27.39, p = 0.000) and maximal oxygen consumption (SMD = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.45, p = 0.004) significantly improved following digital health intervention, after employing the sensitivity analysis significant improvement was observed in systolic (MD = -2.54; 95% CI: -4.98 to -0.11, p = 0.04) and diastolic blood pressure (SMD = -2.0182; 95% CI: -3.9436 to -0.0928, p = 0.04) favoring experimental groups. Subgroup analysis revealed significant improvement in quality of life after three months of follow-up (SMD = 0.18; 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.31, p = 0.00), no significant differences have been observed in body mass index, lipid profile, and blood glucose. Conclusion The findings emphasize the significant impact of digital vs CBCR or usual care on physical capacity, blood pressure, and quality of life. Despite the non-statistically significant differences in body mass index and lipid profile, the comparable effect between the two methods suggests the superiority of digital over CBCR or usual care due to its convenient nature, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness.

                Background Colon cancer is the third most common cancer type worldwide. Novel alternative therapeutic anti-cancer drugs against colon cancer with less toxicity are to be explored . This study was aimed to explore the anti-proliferative and anti-migratory activity of various fractions of Annona reticulata ethanolic leaf extract on human colon cancer cell lines (HCT-116) and to explore the potential molecular targets from the most potent plant extract fraction. Methods After obtaining ethical clearance from the institutional ethics committee, the extract and fractions were prepared and a preliminary analysis of the phytochemical was done qualitatively. Total phenolic and flavonoids were determined. Ethanolic leaf extract and its fractions were subjected to cytotoxicity analysis using the sulforhodamine B assay and the most promising fraction which showed the highest viability was selected to study anti-migratory activity. The anti-migratory effect was studied using a scratch wound healing assay. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was done to identify the major phytocompounds present in the fraction. The major five phytocompounds identified from the GC-MS were subjected to bioinformatics analysis. Result Among the four fractions, the petroleum ether fraction exhibited the highest anti-proliferative activity. The migration of colon cancer cells was significantly inhibited by the extract and petroleum ether fraction. The major phytocompounds identified from GC-MS were phytol (13.03%), 2,6-bis (3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-3,7-dioxabicyclo (3.3.0) octane (11.95%), gamma.-sitosterol (10.45%), alpha.-tocopherol-beta.-D-mannoside (7.50%) and 3-amino-4-piperonyl-5-pyrazolone (5.84%). The bioinformatics analysis of these phytochemicals showed a high potential to affect the levels of key proteins driving colon cancer progression, inhibiting the enzymes and proteins overexpressed in cancer. Conclusion The outcome of this study endorses the potential of phytochemicals of the petroleum ether fraction of ethanolic leaf extract of Annona reticulata for the development of a new chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of colon cancer.

                Introduction Surgical removal of an impacted third molar is one of the most common oral surgical procedures performed in dental offices. The postoperative phase is often associated with severe inflammation. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are usually prescribed to manage postoperative discomfort. NSAIDs have been associated with gastrointestinal bleeding, renal function disturbances, and platelet count reductions. Thus, the present study demonstrates the utility of aescin in managing postoperative discomfort after the surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molars. This study aimed to correlate and compare the impact of aescin and diclofenac on salivary PGE2 levels and serum C-reactive protein levels after surgical extraction of the mandibular third molar. The study will also evaluate and compare the effectiveness of individual drug therapy in managing postoperative pain, swelling and mouth opening. Methods The planned study is a single-center, double-blind, randomized, parallel, prospective clinical trial. Each patient will be prescribed either diclofenac sodium 150 mg/day or aescin (escin) 120 mg/day to be taken orally in divided doses for five days after surgically removing the impacted mandibular third molar. Pain will be assessed using a visual analog scale. Facial swelling and mouth opening will be recorded using a metric scale with standardized reference points. ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) will be employed to measure salivary Prostaglandin E2 and serum C–reactive protein levels. All parameters will be recorded preoperatively (T0) on the second postoperative day (T1) and fifth postoperative day (T2). Conclusion The proposed study is expected to show a clinically acceptable response to the administration of aescin for the management of postoperative discomfort compared to diclofenac sodium after third molar surgery. The proposed study is expected to positively manipulate the levels of salivary Prostaglandin E2 and serum C–reactive protein, which are reliable inflammatory markers. The outcome of this study may provide an efficacious and safe alternative to conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for managing postoperative discomfort following third molar surgery.

                Background Excess nitrogen (N) loading to coastal ecosystems impairs estuarine water quality. Land management decisions made within estuarine watersheds have a direct impact on downstream N delivery. Natural features within watersheds can act as landscape sinks for N, such as wetlands, streams and ponds that transform dissolved N into gaseous N, effectively removing it from the aquatic system. Identifying and evaluating these landscape sinks and their spatial relationship to N sources can help managers understand the effects of alternative decisions on downstream resources. Methods The N-Sink approach uses widely available GIS data to identify landscape sinks within HUC-12 (or larger) catchments, estimate their N removal potential and map the effect of those sinks on N movement through the catchment. Static maps are produced to visualize N removal efficiency, transport and delivery, the latter in the form of an index. The R package nsink was developed to facilitate data acquisition, processing and visualization. Results The R package creates static maps for a specific HUC-12, or users can visit the University of Connecticut website to explore previously mapped areas. Users can also investigate specific flowpaths interactively by clicking on any location within the catchment. A flowpath is generated with a table describing N removal along each segment. We describe the motivation behind developing nsink, discuss implementation in R, and present two use case examples. nsink is available from https://github.com/USEPA/nsink. Conclusions N-Sink is a decision support tool created for local decision-makers to facilitate better understanding of the relationship between land use and downstream N delivery. Local decision-makers that have prioritized N mitigation in their long-term planning can use nsink to better understand the potential impact of proposed development projects and zoning variances. Similarly, land trusts and other NGOs interested in N mitigation can use nsink to identify high priority areas for acquisition or restoration.

<p>High-fat diets alter amygdala and hippocampus neurochemistry in juvenile male rats.

This highlights intricate connections between obesogenic diets, neurochemistry, and cognition, implying that metabolic dysfunctions can induce both detrimental and enhanced plasticity effects.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Childhood obesity increases the risk of health and cognitive disorders in adulthood. Consuming high-fat diets (HFD) during critical neurodevelopmental periods, like childhood, impairs cognition and memory in humans and animals, affecting the function and connectivity of brain structures related to emotional memory. However, the underlying mechanisms of such phenomena need to be better understood. This study aimed to investigate the neurochemical profile of the amygdala and hippocampus, brain structures involved in emotional memory, during the acquisition of conditioned odor aversion in male rats that consumed a HFD from weaning to adulthood. The rats gained weight, experienced metabolic changes, and reduced insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Rats showed enhanced odor aversion memory, contrary to the expected cognitive impairments. This memory enhancement was accompanied by increased noradrenergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in the amygdala and hippocampus. Importantly, this upregulation was specific to stimuli exposure, as basal neurotransmitter levels remained unaltered by the HFD. Our results suggest that HFD modifies cognitive function by altering neurochemical signaling, in this case, upregulating neurotransmitter levels rendering a stronger memory trace, demonstrating that metabolic dysfunctions do not only trigger exclusively detrimental plasticity processes but also render enhanced plastic effects depending on the type of information.</p>

                Background Research on Mpox is essential to protect public health, develop effective interventions, and enhance global preparedness for infectious disease outbreaks. Owing to the scarcity of any specific treatment for Mpox disease, public health guidelines are important for patient care and management. Therefore, this systematic review suggests a public health policy guidelines to control Mpox diseases, especially in densely populated countries. Methods In this systematic review study, the databases and search engines PubMed, Scopus, BanglaJol, WHO, and Google Scholar were searched, and related literature was retrieved for further investigation. Articles describing monkeypox epidemiology, clinical symptoms, and preventive strategies, and published in English language were the core inclusion criteria; articles published in other languages were excluded. All records in the literature were managed through Mendeley (version 1.19.4) reference manager and summarized for further investigation. Results Mpox severity is prevalent in America and Europe. Male (96.3%) and young adults aged 18-44 years (mean: 34 years) were the most vulnerable population due to the virus. Among the patients, rash and fever were the most frequent symptoms, with cough, vomiting, anogenital pain and/or bleeding, conjunctivitis, diarrhea, and genital edema being the least prevalent symptoms in less than 5% of the patients. As there is no specific treatment for the disease, infection control in densely populated countries require early detection, isolation of infected individuals, strict infection control measures, mass vaccination campaigns, education, public awareness campaigns, and continued investment in research. Conclusions This study underscores the urgent need for comprehensive infection control strategies, including early detection, strict isolation protocols, mass vaccination initiatives, and ongoing research investment given the absence of specific treatment options for the disease.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The long-term consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on brain structure remain uncertain. Given evidence that a single significant brain injury event increases the risk of dementia, brain-age estimation could provide a novel and efficient indexing of the long-term consequences of TBI. Brain-age procedures use predictive modeling to calculate brain-age scores for an individual using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Complicated mild, moderate, and severe TBI (cmsTBI) is associated with a higher predicted age difference (PAD), but the progression of PAD over time remains unclear. We sought to examine whether PAD increases as a function of time since injury (TSI) and if injury severity and sex interacted to influence this progression.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Through the ENIGMA Adult Moderate and Severe (AMS)-TBI working group, we examine the largest TBI sample to date (n = 343), along with controls, for a total sample size of n = 540, to replicate and extend prior findings in the study of TBI brain age. Cross-sectional T1w-MRI data were aggregated across 7 cohorts, and brain age was established using a similar brain age algorithm to prior work in TBI.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Findings show that PAD widens with longer TSI, and there was evidence for differences between sexes in PAD, with men showing more advanced brain age. We did not find strong evidence supporting a link between PAD and cognitive performance.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This work provides evidence that changes in brain structure after cmsTBI are dynamic, with an initial period of change, followed by relative stability in brain morphometry, eventually leading to further changes in the decades after a single cmsTBI. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Trained immunity initially describes the long-term functional reprogramming of innate immune cells. Here, Yang et al. reveal the mechanism of trained immunity in zebrafish hepatocytes. They uncover that β-glucan training induces DrDectin-1-gated H3K4me3 modification of mitophagy-related genes, inhibiting pyroptosis to protect the host from septic liver injury in vivo.

They show that this synergistic effect can salvage more escaped antibodies when certain prerequisites for the narrower antigen-binding site span, such as scDbs, and the correct antibody combinations are met.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93908">Targeted protein degradation systems to enhance Wnt signaling</a></h4>

              
                Molecules that facilitate targeted protein degradation (TPD) offer great promise as novel therapeutics. The human hepatic lectin asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGR) is selectively expressed on hepatocytes. We have previously engineered an anti-ASGR1 antibody-mutant RSPO2 (RSPO2RA) fusion protein (called SWEETS) to drive tissue-specific degradation of ZNRF3/RNF43 E3 ubiquitin ligases, which achieved hepatocyte-specific enhanced Wnt signaling, proliferation, and restored liver function in mouse models, and an antibody–RSPO2RA fusion molecule is currently in human clinical trials. In the current study, we identified two new ASGR1- and ASGR1/2-specific antibodies, 8M24 and 8G8. High-resolution crystal structures of ASGR1:8M24 and ASGR2:8G8 complexes revealed that these antibodies bind to distinct epitopes on opposing sides of ASGR, away from the substrate-binding site. Both antibodies enhanced Wnt activity when assembled as SWEETS molecules with RSPO2RA through specific effects sequestering E3 ligases. In addition, 8M24-RSPO2RA and 8G8-RSPO2RA efficiently downregulate ASGR1 through TPD mechanisms. These results demonstrate the possibility of combining different therapeutic effects and degradation mechanisms in a single molecule.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97035">Post-meiotic mechanism of facultative parthenogenesis in gonochoristic whiptail lizard species</a></h4>

              
                Facultative parthenogenesis (FP) has historically been regarded as rare in vertebrates, but in recent years incidences have been reported in a growing list of fish, reptile, and bird species. Despite the increasing interest in the phenomenon, the underlying mechanism and evolutionary implications have remained unclear. A common finding across many incidences of FP is either a high degree of homozygosity at microsatellite loci or low levels of heterozygosity detected in next-generation sequencing data. This has led to the proposal that second polar body fusion following the meiotic divisions restores diploidy and thereby mimics fertilization. Here, we show that FP occurring in the gonochoristic <i>Aspidoscelis</i> species <i>A. marmoratus</i> and <i>A. arizonae</i> results in genome-wide homozygosity, an observation inconsistent with polar body fusion as the underlying mechanism of restoration. Instead, a high-quality reference genome for <i>A. marmoratus</i> and analysis of whole-genome sequencing from multiple FP and control animals reveals that a post-meiotic mechanism gives rise to homozygous animals from haploid, unfertilized oocytes. Contrary to the widely held belief that females need to be isolated from males to undergo FP, females housed with conspecific and heterospecific males produced unfertilized eggs that underwent spontaneous development. In addition, offspring arising from both fertilized eggs and parthenogenetic development were observed to arise from a single clutch. Strikingly, our data support a mechanism for facultative parthenogenesis that removes all heterozygosity in a single generation. Complete homozygosity exposes the genetic load and explains the high rate of congenital malformations and embryonic mortality associated with FP in many species. Conversely, for animals that develop normally, FP could potentially exert strong purifying selection as all lethal recessive alleles are purged in a single generation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90948">Enhancing CRISPR prime editing by reducing misfolded pegRNA interactions</a></h4>

              
                CRISPR prime editing (<b>PE</b>) requires a Cas9 nickase-reverse transcriptase fusion protein (known as PE2) and a prime editing guide RNA (<b>pegRNA</b>), an extended version of a standard guide RNA (<b>gRNA</b>) that both specifies the intended target genomic sequence and encodes the desired genetic edit. Here, we show that sequence complementarity between the 5’ and the 3’ regions of a pegRNA can negatively impact its ability to complex with Cas9, thereby potentially reducing PE efficiency. We demonstrate this limitation can be overcome by a simple pegRNA refolding procedure, which improved ribonucleoprotein-mediated PE efficiencies in zebrafish embryos by up to nearly 25-fold. Further gains in PE efficiencies of as much as sixfold could also be achieved by introducing point mutations designed to disrupt internal interactions within the pegRNA. Our work defines simple strategies that can be implemented to improve the efficiency of PE.

	<p>Porcine Liver Decomposition Product (PLDP) was obtained by treating pig liver homogenate with protease and filling it into capsules. We have already confirmed from three clinical trials that PLDP enhances visual memory and delays memory recall, and we believe that its activity is due to various phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine (PC). In this study, we clinically evaluated PLDP for depressive symptoms caused by a decline in cognitive function. This clinical trial was conducted using the Revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS-R). The HDS-R (maximum score is 30 points) is a test similar to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), which is commonly used in Japan. Dementia is suspected if the score falls below 20 on the HDS-R. Additionally, in a previous clinical trial, there was no change in scores in the placebo group after three doses of the HDS-R. In order to clearly confirm the effectiveness of PLDP, this study was conducted under stricter conditions (HDS-R points of 15 to 23) than previous clinical trials (all participants had scores of 20 or higher). Therefore, from ethical considerations, a clinical trial was conducted using the scores before PLDP administration as a control. In this study, PLDP was administered orally at 4 capsules per day, and the HDS-R was confirmed 2 and 4 weeks after administration. A significant increase in HDS-R scores was observed at 2 and 4 weeks after PLDP administration. Additionally, regarding each item of the HDS-R, PLDP significantly increased 2 and 4 weeks after oral administration for the question items assessing delayed recall, and the question item assessing verbal fluency tasks was recognized. From the above results, we confirmed the reproducibility of the effect of PLDP in improving the delayed recall of verbal memories. Furthermore, increasing scores on verbal fluency tasks suggest that PLDP may enhance frontal lobe function and prevent or improve depressive symptoms. The effects observed in this study may differ from the mechanisms of action of existing antidepressants, and we believe that this may lead to the discovery of new antidepressants.</p>

                Background With rapid industrialization, urbanization, and population explosion in sub-Saharan Africa including Uganda, the population has experienced increased exposure to environmental lead subsequently causing elevated blood lead levels. Mean blood levels of 332µg/dL,120µg/dʟ, 25µg/dL,11µg/dL, and 10µg/dL in children under 18 years of age in Nigeria, DR Congo, South Africa, Sudan, and Uganda respectively. Susceptibility to lead toxicity correlates with one’s nutrition status, age, and genetics. This study expounded susceptibility to lead toxicity by relating blood lead levels, delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) enzyme activity, and genetic variations of proteins that code for ALAD in urban children of Uganda aged between 6 and 60 months. Methods A total of 198 blood samples were analyzed for blood lead levels (BLL), on an atomic absorption spectrophotometer whereas hemoglobin (Hb) levels, and ALAD enzyme activity, were analyzed on a spectrophotometer before DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction, and restriction fragment length digestion for ALAD polymorphism. Results Geometric means of BLL (10.55µg/dL, SD = 7.4), Hb (7.85g/dL, SD = 1.3) and ALAD enzyme activity (37.15 units/L BLL, S.D = 9.7), corresponded to samples that coded for ALAD1 allele (99.05%) compared to the 0.05% that coded for ALAD2 with BLL (14.5µg/ dL, SD = 4.7), Hb (6.1 g/ dL), ALAD enzyme activity (33.8 units/L, SD=1.45). There was a significant relationship with a negative linear correlation between BLL, Hb (status, and ALAD enzyme activity in the three isozymes (ALAD1-1, ALAD1-2, and ALAD2-2) in the strength of ALAD1-1 (r = 0.42, p-value = 0.02) ˂ ALAD1-2 (r = 0.62, effective size = 0.43, p-value = ˂ 0.001) ˂ ALAD2-2 (r = 0.67, effective size = 0.86, p-value = ˂ 0.001). Conclusions Most of the study participants coded for the ALAD1 allele hence hoarded blood lead, which could result in delayed exposure and adverse effects later in their lives.

                Objective To determine gender gaps in Emeritus researchers in Colombia. Methods Oaxaca-Blinder-Kitakagwa decomposition model, correcting the sample selection bias with the inclusion of Mills’ inverse ratio (Heckman’s Lambda) through an ordered probit model. Data: Information available in the ScienTI Platform – Colombia during the period 2015-2021. Results The results show that the gender gap between female and male researchers is 5.8%. To achieve Emeritus status, one must be over 65 years old, and the possibility of achieving Emeritus status is 5.1% higher for female researchers than for their male counterparts. These differences can be explained by the time constraints that female researchers face in being productive, as they spend more time than male researchers on caregiving responsibilities, either due to motherhood or the care of other dependent family members. Conclusions The results obtained allow us to affirm that there is a gender gap in scientific research in Colombia in the Emeritus research category in the calls for proposals for the period 2015-2021. Moreover, the existing gap cannot be explained by factors associated with attributes of education and academic productivity that are part of the regulatory requirements, insofar as not being explained by them, it evidences the existence of discrimination against women researchers to access the highest research category.

                Introduction Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung disease that affects premature infants and is characterized by disrupted alveolar and vascular development. Pulmonary complications significantly affect morbidity and mortality rates in neonates with BPD. Aim This systematic review aimed to outline a protocol for investigating the effects of pulmonary complications in neonates diagnosed with BPD. Methods A comprehensive search strategy will be implemented across electronic databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Eligible studies will include primary research articles reporting pulmonary complications, such as pulmonary hypertension, respiratory infections, ventilator-associated events, and airway abnormalities among neonates diagnosed with BPD. Two independent reviewers screened the titles, abstracts, and full text of the identified articles for eligibility. Data extraction will be conducted using a predefined form, including study characteristics, participant demographics, types of pulmonary complications, and relevant outcomes. The methodological quality of the included studies will be assessed using appropriate tools, such as the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for randomized controlled trials. Outcome measures The primary outcomes of interest will include the prevalence and incidence of pulmonary complications among neonates diagnosed with BPD. Secondary outcomes will encompass the impact of pulmonary complications on clinical outcomes, such as respiratory morbidity, mortality rates, length of hospital stay, and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Narrative synthesis will be employed to summarize the findings of the included studies, and where applicable, a meta-analysis will be conducted to quantify the effects of pulmonary complications on neonatal outcomes. Discussion This systematic review protocol outlines a rigorous methodology for investigating the effects of pulmonary complications in neonates with BPD. The findings of this review will provide valuable insights into the burden of pulmonary complications in this vulnerable population, and inform clinical practice and future research endeavors aimed at improving the care and management of neonates with BPD.

                <p>by Seolah Shin, Seok Joo Chae, Seunggyu Lee, Jae Kyoung Kim</p>

The Michaelis–Menten (MM) rate law has been a fundamental tool in describing enzyme-catalyzed reactions for over a century. When substrates and enzymes are homogeneously distributed, the validity of the MM rate law can be easily assessed based on relative concentrations: the substrate is in large excess over the enzyme-substrate complex. However, the applicability of this conventional criterion remains unclear when species exhibit spatial heterogeneity, a prevailing scenario in biological systems. Here, we explore the MM rate law’s applicability under spatial heterogeneity by using partial differential equations. In this study, molecules diffuse very slowly, allowing them to locally reach quasi-steady states at each time point. We find that the conventional criterion for the validity of the MM rate law cannot be readily extended to heterogeneous environments solely through spatial averages of molecular concentrations. That is, even when the conventional criterion for the spatial averages is satisfied, the MM rate law fails to capture the enzyme catalytic rate under spatial heterogeneity. In contrast, a slightly modified form of the MM rate law, based on the total quasi-steady state approximation (tQSSA), is accurate. Specifically, the tQSSA-based modified form, but not the original MM rate law, accurately predicts the drug clearance via cytochrome P450 enzymes and the ultrasensitive phosphorylation in heterogeneous environments. Our findings shed light on how to simplify spatiotemporal models for enzyme-catalyzed reactions in the right context, ensuring accurate conclusions and avoiding misinterpretations in <i>in silico</i> simulations.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012166">Ten recommendations for hosting a Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice (DEIJ) journal club</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Roberto Efraín Díaz, Stephanie A. Wankowicz</p>

Despite advances and social progress, the exclusion of diverse groups in academia, especially science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, across the US and Europe persists, resulting in the underrepresentation of diverse people in higher education. There is extensive literature about theory, observation, and evidence-based practices that can help create a more equitable, inclusive, and diverse learning environment. In this article, we propose the implementation of a Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice (DEIJ) journal club as a strategic initiative to foster education and promote action towards making academia a more equitable institution. By creating a space for people to engage with DEIJ theories* and strategize ways to improve their learning environment, we hope to normalize the practice and importance of analyzing academia through an equity lens. Guided by restorative justice principles, we offer 10 recommendations for fostering community cohesion through education and mutual understanding. This approach underscores the importance of appropriate action and self-education in the journey toward a more diverse, equitable, inclusive, and just academic environment.
*Authors’ note: We understand that “DEIJ” is a multidisciplinary organizational framework that relies on numerous fields of study, including history, sociology, philosophy, and more. We use this term to refer to these different fields of study for brevity purposes.
