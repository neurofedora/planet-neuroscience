	<p>(1) Background: Exercise exerts many neuroprotective effects in diabetes-induced brain disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on brain molecular changes and cognitive and anxiety-like behaviors in rats with type 2 diabetes. (2) Methods: Twenty-eight adult male rats were divided into four groups (n = 7): control (C), exercise + control (C+EX), diabetes (DM), and diabetes + exercise (DM+EX). Diabetes was induced using a two-month high-fat diet and a single dose of streptozotocin (35 mg/kg) in the DM and DM+EX groups. After, the C+EX and DM+EX groups performed HIIT for eight weeks (five sessions per week, running at 80&amp;amp;ndash;100% of VMax, 4&amp;amp;ndash;10 intervals) on a motorized treadmill. Then, the elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field test (OFT) were performed to evaluate anxiety-like behaviors. The Morris water maze (MWM) and shuttle box were used to assess cognitive function. The hippocampal levels of beta-amyloid and tau protein were also assessed using Western blot. (3) Results: The hippocampal levels of beta-amyloid and tau protein were increased in the DM group, but HIIT restored these changes. While diabetes led to a significant decrease in open arm time percentage (%OAT) and open arm enters percentage (%OAE) in the EPM, indicating anxiety-like behavior, HIIT restored them. In the OFT, grooming was decreased in diabetic rats, which was restored by HIIT. No significant difference between groups was seen in the latency time in the shuttle box or for learning and memory in the MWM. (4) Conclusions: HIIT-induced hippocampal molecular changes were associated with anxiety-like behavior improvement but not cognitive function in rats with type 2 diabetes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Intrasession and Intersession Reproducibility of Artificial Scotoma pRF Mapping Results at Ultra-High Fields</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) combined with population receptive field (pRF) mapping allows for associating positions on the visual cortex to areas on the visual field. Apart from applications in healthy subjects, this method can also be used to examine dysfunctions in patients suffering from partial visual field losses. While such objective measurement of visual deficits (scotoma) is of great importance for, e.g., longitudinal studies addressing treatment effects, it requires a thorough assessment of accuracy and reproducibility of the results obtained. In this study, we quantified the reproducibility of pRF mapping results within and across sessions in case of central visual field loss in a group of 15 human subjects. We simulated scotoma by masking a central area of 2&deg; radius from stimulation to establish ground-truth conditions. This study was performed on a 7T ultra-high field MRI scanner for increased sensitivity. We found excellent intrasession and intersession reproducibility for the pRF center position (Spearman correlation coefficients for <I>x</I>, <I>y</I>: &gt;0.95; eccentricity: &gt;0.87; polar angle: &gt;0.98), but only modest reproducibility for pRF size (Spearman correlation coefficients around 0.4). We further examined the scotoma detection performance using an automated method based on a reference dataset acquired with full-field stimulation. For the 2&deg; artificial scotoma, the group-averaged scotoma sizes were estimated at between 1.92&deg; and 2.19&deg; for different sessions. We conclude that pRF mapping of visual field losses yields robust, reproducible measures of retinal function and suggest the use of pRF mapping as an objective method for monitoring visual deficits during therapeutic interventions or disease progression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Sources of Variation in the Spectral Slope of the Sleep EEG</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The 1/<I>f</I> spectral slope of the electroencephalogram (EEG) estimated in the  frequency range has been proposed as an arousal marker that differentiates wake, nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Here, we sought to replicate and extend these findings in a large sample, providing a comprehensive characterization of how slope changes with age, sex, and its test-retest reliability as well as potential confounds that could affect the slope estimation. We used 10,255 whole-night polysomnograms (PSGs) from the National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR). All preprocessing steps were performed using an open-source Luna package and the spectral slope was estimated by fitting log-log linear regression models on the absolute power from 30 to 45 Hz separately for wake, NREM, and REM stages. We confirmed that the mean spectral slope grows steeper going from wake to NREM to REM sleep. We found that the choice of mastoid referencing scheme modulated the extent to which electromyogenic, or electrocardiographic artifacts were likely to bias 30- to 45-Hz slope estimates, as well as other sources of technical, device-specific bias. Nonetheless, within individuals, slope estimates were relatively stable over time. Both cross-sectionally and longitudinal, slopes tended to become shallower with increasing age, particularly for REM sleep; males tended to show flatter slopes than females across all states. Our findings support that spectral slope can be a valuable arousal marker for both clinical and research endeavors but also underscore the importance of considering interindividual variation and multiple methodological aspects related to its estimation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Enlarged Interior Built Environment Scale Modulates High-Frequency EEG Oscillations</a></h4>

              
                <p>There is currently no robust method to evaluate how built environment design affects our emotion. Understanding emotion is significant, as it influences cognitive processes, behavior, and wellbeing, and is linked to the functioning of physiological systems. As mental health problems are becoming more prevalent, and exposure to indoor environments is increasing, it is important we develop rigorous methods to understand whether design elements in our environment affect emotion. This study examines whether the scale of interior built environments modulate neural networks involved in emotion regulation. Using a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) and controlling for indoor environmental quality (IEQ), 66 adults (31 female, aged 18&ndash;55) were exposed to context-neutral enclosed indoor room scenes to understand whether built environment scale affected self-report, autonomic nervous system, and central nervous system correlates of emotion. Our results revealed enlarged scale increased electroencephalography (EEG) power in the &beta; bandwidth. Frontal midline low- and high- power were also found to increase with enlarged scale, but contrary to our hypothesis, scale did not modulate frontal midline power or lateralization in the  or &alpha; bandwidths. We did not detect an effect of scale on autonomic indicators or self-reported emotion. However, we did find increased range in skin conductance response (SCR) and heart rate variability (HRV) to the built environment conditions. This study provides a rigorous empirical framework for assessing the environmental impact of a design characteristic on human emotion and suggests that measures of high-frequency oscillations may provide a useful marker of the response to built environment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of intraoperative PEEP with recruitment maneuvers on the occurrence of postoperative pulmonary complications during general anesthesia––protocol for Bayesian analysis of three randomized clinical trials of intraoperative ventilation [version 1; pee</a></h4>

              
                Background: Using the frequentist approach, a recent meta–analysis of three randomized clinical trials in patients undergoing intraoperative ventilation during general anesthesia for major surgery failed to show the benefit of ventilation that uses high positive end–expiratory pressure with recruitment maneuvers when compared to ventilation that uses low positive end–expiratory pressure without recruitment maneuvers. Methods: We designed a protocol for a Bayesian analysis using the pooled dataset. The multilevel Bayesian logistic model will use the individual patient data. Prior distributions will be prespecified to represent a varying level of skepticism for the effect estimate. The primary endpoint will be a composite of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) within the first seven postoperative days, which reflects the primary endpoint of the original studies. We preset a range of practical equivalence to assess the futility of the intervention with an interval of odds ratio (OR) between 0.9 and 1.1 and assess how much of the 95% of highest density interval (HDI) falls between the region of practical equivalence. Ethics and dissemination: The used data derive from approved studies that were published in recent years. The findings of this current analysis will be reported in a new manuscript, drafted by the writing committee on behalf of the three research groups. All investigators listed in the original trials will serve as collaborative authors.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mental health problems of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients in hospitel in Thailand: A cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background There is evidence that patients with COVID-19 have a higher prevalence of mental health problems than the normal population. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of mental health problems and their associated factors in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in the hospitel in Thailand. Methods Mental health problems were evaluated using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale - 21 items, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The prevalence of mental health problems was presented by frequency and percentage. McNemar's test was used to compare the prevalence of mental health problems between day 1 and day 7. Binary logistic regression was used to identify potential predictors of mental health problems. Results A total of 186 participants (68.3% female; mean age = 37.21 years (SD 13.66) were recruited. The depression, anxiety, and stress rate on day 1 of admission was 26.9%, 32.3% and 25.8%, respectively. Having mild COVID-19 symptoms was a significantly associated factor with anxiety (OR=2.69, 95%CI: 1.05-6.89) and stress (OR=4.53, 95%CI: 1.32-15.55). Conclusions There was a high rate of mental health problems in COVID-19 patients. Detecting and managing mental health problems should be considered standard care for COVID-19 patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The new educational paradigm in the COVID-19 era: Can Blackboard replace physical teaching in EFL writing classrooms? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Many changes are evident in classrooms in the COVID-19 times, but the most drastic perhaps has been the scramble to find substitutes for physical classrooms, a truly solemn challenge for the foreign language learning paradigm. In the meantime, many customized learning apps came to the educationists’ rescue: Blackboard being one of them. This study endeavors to investigate the effectiveness of Blackboard as an alternative to face-to-face writing instruction during the COVID-19 crisis and in the following period of precautionary distancing and other norms. Methods: The study used the final grades of Saudi male and female EFL undergraduates across two terms and with the Blackboard and face-to-face approaches in three compulsory English writing courses, and statistical tests were conducted on them. Results: The findings showed that female students (M=83.24, Std= 10.627) significantly outperform the male students (M=73.62, Std=16.011) in the final writing test (P=. 000). Furthermore, in face-to-face teaching (M=84.34, Std=10.752) was more statistically effective than when using Blackboard (M=75.65, Std=14.545) with the Sig value scored (P=. 000). Findings also showed that third level scored higher than the second and the first in writing (83.83, 78.17, 77.89) respectively. All the differences were significant (P=. 000). Conclusion: The implications of the study have a major bearing on curriculum and pedagogy planning for the coming times which may see more comebacks of the COVID-19 variants and warrant innovative teaching-learning tools and methods.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Sudden death related to unrecognized cardiac hydatid cyst [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Echinococcosis, also known as hydatid disease, is a common parasitic human infestation found in sheep-breeding areas. It is caused by the larvae stage of Echinococcus granulosus, and cysts develop mostly in the lungs and the liver. Cardiac involvement is unusual and silent until acute complications or a fatal outcome occurs. Herein, we report an autopsy case of a young healthy adult who died suddenly. The autopsy revealed an external bulging on the right heart ventricle outlet with a fluid-filled cystic cavity discovered on sectioning. Dissection of other organs did not reveal other cyst locations. Histological examination ascertained the diagnosis of hydatid cyst, and death was attributed to cardiac arrhythmias. Pathologists should keep in mind that hydatid cysts can develop anywhere in the body. Solitary cardiac cyst is rare and can simulate a “silent bomb”. Unfortunately, sudden death remains the frequent manner of revelation of this disease in endemic areas.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Circadian signatures of anterior hypothalamus in time-restricted feeding [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Meal timing resets circadian clocks in peripheral tissues, such as the liver, in seven days without affecting the phase of the central clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Anterior hypothalamus plays an essential role in energy metabolism, circadian rhythm, and stress response. However, it remains to be elucidated whether and how anterior hypothalamus adapts its circadian rhythms to meal timing. Methods: Here, we applied transcriptomics to profile rhythmic transcripts in the anterior hypothalamus of nocturnal female mice subjected to day- (DRF) or night (NRF)-time restricted feeding for seven days. Results: This global profiling identified 128 and 3,518 rhythmic transcripts in DRF and NRF, respectively. NRF entrained diurnal rhythms among 990 biological processes, including ‘Electron transport chain’ and ‘Hippo signaling’ that reached peak time in the late sleep and late active phase, respectively. By contrast, DRF entrained only 20 rhythmic pathways, including ‘Cellular amino acid catabolic process’, all of which were restricted to the late active phase. The rhythmic transcripts found in both DRF and NRF tissues were largely resistant to phase entrainment by meal timing, which were matched to the action of the circadian clock. Remarkably, DRF for 36 days partially reversed the circadian clock compared to NRF. Conclusions: Collectively, our work generates a useful dataset to explore anterior hypothalamic circadian biology and sheds light on potential rhythmic processes influenced by meal timing in the brain (www.circametdb.org.cn).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Identification of key somatic oncogenic mutation based on a confounder-free causal inference model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yijun Liu, Ji Sun, Huiyan Sun, Yi Chang</p>

Abnormal cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are the essential events that induce cancer initiation and progression. A fundamental goal in cancer research is to develop an efficient method to detect mutational genes capable of driving cancer. Although several computational methods have been proposed to identify these key mutations, many of them focus on the association between genetic mutations and functional changes in relevant biological processes, but not their real causality. Causal effect inference provides a way to estimate the real induce effect of a certain mutation on vital biological processes of cancer initiation and progression, through addressing the confounder bias due to neutral mutations and unobserved latent variables. In this study, integrating genomic and transcriptomic data, we construct a novel causal inference model based on a deep variational autoencoder to identify key oncogenic somatic mutations. Applied to 10 cancer types, our method quantifies the causal effect of genetic mutations on cell proliferation and EMT by reducing both observed and unobserved confounding biases. The experimental results indicate that genes with higher mutation frequency do not necessarily mean they are more potent in inducing cancer and promoting cancer development. Moreover, our study fills a gap in the use of machine learning for causal inference to identify oncogenic mutations.

                <p>by Evgeny A. Podolskiy, Mads Peter Heide-Jørgensen</p>

Detecting structures within the continuous diving behavior of marine animals is challenging, and no universal framework is available. We captured such diverse structures using chaos theory. By applying time-delay embedding to exceptionally long dive records (83 d) from the narwhal, we reconstructed the state-space portrait. Using measures of chaos, we detected a diurnal pattern and its seasonal modulation, classified data, and found how sea-ice appearance shifts time budgets. There is more near-surface rest but deeper dives at solar noon, and more intense diving during twilight and at night but to shallower depths (likely following squid); sea-ice appearance reduces rest. The introduced geometrical approach is simple to implement and potentially helpful for mapping and labeling long-term behavioral data, identifying differences between individual animals and species, and detecting perturbations.

<i>Babesia</i> is a genus of apicomplexan parasites that infect red blood cells in vertebrate hosts. Pathology occurs during rapid replication cycles in the asexual blood stage of infection. Current knowledge of <i>Babesia</i> replication cycle progression and regulation is limited and relies mostly on comparative studies with related parasites. Due to limitations in synchronizing <i>Babesia</i> parasites, fine-scale time-course transcriptomic resources are not readily available. Single-cell transcriptomics provides a powerful unbiased alternative for profiling asynchronous cell populations. Here, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to 3 <i>Babesia</i> species (<i>B</i>. <i>divergens</i>, <i>B</i>. <i>bovis</i>, and <i>B</i>. <i>bigemina</i>). We used analytical approaches and algorithms to map the replication cycle and construct pseudo-synchronized time-course gene expression profiles. We identify clusters of co-expressed genes showing “just-in-time” expression profiles, with gradually cascading peaks throughout asexual development. Moreover, clustering analysis of reconstructed gene curves reveals coordinated timing of peak expression in epigenetic markers and transcription factors. Using a regularized Gaussian graphical model, we reconstructed co-expression networks and identified conserved and species-specific nodes. Motif analysis of a co-expression interactome of AP2 transcription factors identified specific motifs previously reported to play a role in DNA replication in <i>Plasmodium</i> species. Finally, we present an interactive web application to visualize and interactively explore the datasets.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Primary and metastatic tumors exhibit systems-level differences in dependence on mitochondrial respiratory function</a></h4>

The Warburg effect, aerobic glycolysis, is a hallmark feature of cancer cells grown in culture. However, the relative roles of glycolysis and respiratory metabolism in supporting in vivo tumor growth and processes such as tumor dissemination and metastatic growth remain poorly understood, particularly on a systems level. Using a CRISPRi mini-library enriched for mitochondrial ribosomal protein and respiratory chain genes in multiple human lung cancer cell lines, we analyzed in vivo metabolic requirements in xenograft tumors grown in distinct anatomic contexts. While knockdown of mitochondrial ribosomal protein and respiratory chain genes (mito-respiratory genes) has little impact on growth in vitro, tumor cells depend heavily on these genes when grown in vivo as either flank or primary orthotopic lung tumor xenografts. In contrast, respiratory function is comparatively dispensable for metastatic tumor growth. RNA-Seq and metabolomics analysis of tumor cells expressing individual sgRNAs against mito-respiratory genes indicate overexpression of glycolytic genes and increased sensitivity of glycolytic inhibition compared to control when grown in vitro, but when grown in vivo as primary tumors these cells down-regulate glycolytic mechanisms. These studies demonstrate that discrete perturbations of mitochondrial respiratory chain function impact in vivo tumor growth in a context-specific manner with differential impacts on primary and metastatic tumors.

                The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly changed how scientific conferences are organized, fostering virtual meetings. These online events have allowed students and researchers to overcome geographical, administrative and economic barriers to attend and organize high-quality international symposiums. Moreover, these virtual conferences have contributed to the creation of inclusive activities that strengthen scientific communities. Here, we summarize the main activities and learnings from the 1st Ecuadorian-Venezuelan Symposium of Young Bioinformatics Researchers (1SEVJIB), organized by the Ecuadorian and Venezuelan ISCB-SC Regional Student Groups (RSGs). This symposium aimed to provide an opportunity for undergraduate and postgraduate students from Ecuador, Venezuela, and other Latin American countries to share their Bioinformatics research. The 1SEVJIB was the first bi-national conference organized by two RSGs from Latin America (LatAm). This symposium was a two-day virtual meeting with five activities: 1) oral student presentations, 2) poster session, 3) keynote lectures, 4) workshop, and 5) round table. This conference promoted the scientific exchange and cooperation networks between young Bioinformatics researchers and students from Ecuador, Venezuela, and LatAm, giving them opportunities to boost their scientific careers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pharmacy practitioners’ practice, awareness and knowledge about herbal products and their potential interactions with cardiovascular drugs [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Herbal medicine use is widespread among patients, as community pharmacies may provide such products. Therefore, pharmacy practitioners should be aware of potential herbal products’ adverse effects and herb-drug interactions, particularly with medications for comorbid diseases, such as cardiovascular drugs, in which pharmacy practitioners need to have good knowledge to provide patients with relevant advice to get optimal and safe therapeutic outcomes. Accordingly, the study is designed to assess the knowledge and awareness of pharmacy practitioners regarding herbal product dispensing and cardiovascular drug interaction in Jordan and view their role in patients’ counselling to set up safe and effective drug use. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Jordan using an online formatted questionnaire distributed to pharmacy practitioners working in community pharmacies. Descriptive and analytical statistics were performed for the responses using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software, version 26. Results: Out of 508 participants, 41.7% had medium knowledge of herbal products pertaining mainly to university education (68.1%); 55.1% of participants dispensed herbal products without prescriptions for obesity and weight reduction (72.8%) and gastrointestinal problems (70.9%); this is because respondents agreed that herbal remedies are safe (28.5%) and effective (38.4%). Whilst the knowledge level of respondents about herbal medicine interaction with cardiovascular medication was medium, with a mean of 1.94, as this interaction may result in potentially serious consequences, 40.7% of respondents strongly agreed to gain more knowledge about the side effects of herbal products and medicine interactions through educational courses. Conclusions: The pharmacy practitioners had medium knowledge of herbal products; however, more attention should be paid to herb-drug interactions in the pharmacy educational curriculum. Additionally, pharmacy practitioners need to refresh their knowledge by attending periodic educational courses and by using reliable resources for information about herbal products in order to provide effective and competent pharmaceutical care.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">HR practices and turnover intention; the mediating role of organizational commitment in Tehran: a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Employees are increasingly being recognised as a valuable source of information, especially in knowledge-based businesses. Businesses, however, suffer financial and organisational memory losses related to re-hiring and training new staff, and lost productivity and intellectual property because of employee turnover. Hence, employee turnover should be considered an essential part of human resource management. Furthermore, employees’ trust in management and human resource (HR) practices substantially impact organisational commitment (OC). Thus, anticipating employee commitment and turnover intentions is crucial, as people are the sole source for knowledge-based firms to maintain their competitive advantage. In the context of selected Tehran Renewable Energy (RE) firms, this study investigated the mediating impact of OC on the relationship between HR practices (recruitment and selection; training and development opportunities; performance appraisal and evaluation; teamwork; compensation and pay; and job security) and employee turnover intention. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study in Tehran that involved 90 experts and knowledgeable employees from four of Tehran's top RE businesses. A questionnaire was distributed to collect data which was later analysed with correlation, regression and bootstrapping analyses. Results: All six dimensions of HR practices were discovered to have an indirect impact on turnover intention and a direct impact on OC. OC among employees has an indirect effect on turnover intention. It was also revealed that the training and development opportunity has the most considerable effect on OC and turnover intention. OC was not found as a mediator between HR practices and turnover intention. Conclusions: The outcomes of this study showed that both training and development opportunities; and pay and compensation structure were found to be two significant components of HR practices in the relationship with OC. RE managers should employ appropriate HR strategies, particularly in these two dimensions, to improve an individual's degree of OC and reduce turnover intention.

                Camel meat is an ethnic food consumed across the arid regions. For these medicinal and nutritional benefits, it can be a great option for sustainable meat worldwide supply. Consumers can be benefit from the subtle taste of camel meat, flavored with aromatic and medicinal herbs from the arid regions. Research on the camel meat from both an economic and technological aspects is quite recent, which explains the limited information available on this area. Nevertheless, developing new preservation techniques as well the development of various products from camel meat through optimum processing constitute an axis of fu-ture scientific research in order to valorize this product. The camel meat as an alternative source to red meats is also discussed as well as the challenges of its acceptance by consumers. In light of the enthusiasm for this meat, to which many beneficial health effects are attributed, it seemed interesting to conduct this review.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Self-medication for anxiety symptoms in the context of COVID-19, in users who go to a drugstore in Los Olivos, Lima in 2021 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Self-medication is a non-responsible act and leads to the inappropriate use of medications, causing low effectiveness and insecurity in treatments. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between self-medication and anxiety symptoms in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in users attending a pharmacy in Los Olivos, Lima in 2021. Methods: The research method was deductive, basic and with a quantitative approach; the design used was non-experimental, descriptive, correlational, cross-sectional, and prospective. Spearman's Rho analysis was performed to validate the hypothesis. Results: 384 users were evaluated, finding 93.5% aged 18-59 years, of whom 53.4% were female, 42.7% had completed high school, 57.8% were single and 51.6% presented physical symptoms, predominantly muscular tension accompanied by pain, 60.7% presented behavioral symptoms, highlighting unusual sadness in the face of COVID-19 and 70.1% presented cognitive symptoms with greater frequency of concern about contracting COVID-19. In addition, the greater the symptoms of anxiety, the higher the self-medication increased from 9.0% to 21.1%. A similar case was evidenced in self-medication on their own initiative where the increase was from 7.5% to 33.3%; likewise, self-medication without medical prescription increased from 15.8% to 47.7%, and the consumption of anxiolytics or antidepressants increased from 0.8% to 26.3% caused by the symptoms of anxiety. Conclusion: It was determined that there is a moderate relationship between self-medication and anxiety symptoms in the context of COVID-19, in users who go to a drugstore in Los Olivos, Lima in 2021.

                Behçet’s disease (BD) is rare in children. Herein, we report a case of 12-year-old male child with a history of left superficial femoral vein thrombosis and bilateral pulmonary embolism, admitted for multiple thrombosis located in the inferior vena cava, right atrium and ventricle associated with multiple pulmonary artery aneurisms and fissurations concomitant to oral aphthosis, which was suggestive of BD. Despite corticoids and immunosuppressive therapy, the child had a massive hemoptysis resulting in his death. The association between intracardiac thrombosis, pulmonary aneurism and venous thrombosis should raise suspicion of angio-Behçet, which could be lethal.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Besides the well-documented ophthalmic manifestations, thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) is believed to be related to emotional and psychological abnormalities. Given the previous neuroimaging evidence, we hypothesized that TAO patients would have altered neurovascular coupling associated with clinical-psychiatric disturbances. This study was to investigate neurovascular coupling changes in TAO by combining resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) techniques. Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) was calculated from rs-fMRI, and cerebral blood flow (CBF) was computed from ASL in 37 TAO patients and 21 healthy controls (HCs). Global neurovascular coupling was assessed by across-voxel CBF-ALFF correlation, and regional neurovascular coupling was evaluated by CBF/ALFF ratio. Auxiliary analyses were performed using fractional ALFF (fALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) as rs-fMRI measures. Compared with HCs, TAO patients showed significantly reduced global CBF-ALFF coupling. Moreover, TAO patients exhibited decreased CBF/ALFF ratio in the left lingual gyrus (LG)/fusiform gyrus (FFG), and increased CBF/ALFF ratio in the bilateral precuneus (PCu). In TAOs, CBF/ALFF ratio in the left LG/FFG was positively correlated with visual acuity, while CBF/ALFF ratio in the bilateral PCu was negatively correlated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment score. The auxiliary analyses showed trends of reduced global neurovascular coupling (i.e., CBF-fALFF correlation and CBF-ReHo correlation), as well as significant altered regional neurovascular coupling (i.e., CBF/fALFF ratio and CBF/ReHo ratio) in several brain regions. These findings indicated that TAO patients had altered neurovascular coupling in the visual and higher-order cognitive cortices. The neurovascular decoupling might be a possible neuropathological mechanism of TAO.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Regional precuneus cortical hyperexcitability in Alzheimer's disease patients</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>neuronal excitation/inhibition (E/I) imbalance is a potential cause of neuronal network malfunctioning in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), contributing to cognitive dysfunction. Here, we used a novel approach combining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) to probe cortical excitability in different brain areas known to be directly involved in AD pathology.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>we performed TMS-EEG recordings targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (l-DLPFC), the left posterior parietal cortex (l-PPC) and the precuneus (PC) in a large sample of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease patients (n=65) that were compared with a group of age-matched healthy controls (n=21).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>we found that AD patients are characterized by a regional cortical hyper-excitability in the PC and, to some extent, in the frontal lobe, as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked potentials. Notably, cortical excitability assessed over the l-PPC was comparable between the two groups. Furthermore, we found that the individual level of PC excitability was associated with the level of cognitive impairment, as measured with Mini-Mental State Examination, and with corticospinal fluid levels of Aβ<sub>42.</sub></p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>our data provide novel evidence that precuneus cortical hyper-excitability is a key feature of synaptic dysfunction in AD patients. The current results point to the combined approach of transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography as a novel promising technique to measure hyperexcitability in patients with AD. This index could represent a useful biomarker to stage disease severity and evaluate response to novel therapies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Outcomes in the year after first‐ever ischemic stroke in a bi‐ethnic population</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate stroke outcomes at three, six and 12 months post-stroke overall and by ethnicity in a population-based, longitudinal study.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>First-ever ischemic strokes (2014-2019, n=1,332) among Mexican American (MA) persons (n=807) and non-Hispanic white (NHW) persons (n=525) were identified from the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi Project. Data were collected from patient or proxy interviews (baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months post-stroke) and medical records, including functional (activities of daily living (ADL)/instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) score), neurologic (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)), cognitive (Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE)) and quality of life (QOL) outcomes (Stroke-specific QOL-12). Outcome trajectories were analyzed using multivariable adjusted linear models, with generalized estimating equations to account for within-subject correlations; interactions between ethnicity and time were included to investigate ethnic differences in trajectories.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Median age was 67 years (IQR: 58,78), 48.5% were women, and 60.6% were MA. For all outcomes, significant improvement was seen between three and six months (p&lt;0.05 for all), with stability between six and 12 months. MA persons had significantly worse outcomes compared with NHW persons at all time points (three, six, and 12 months) with the exception of NIHSS which did not differ by ethnicity at six and 12 months, and average change in outcomes did not vary significantly by ethnicity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Outcomes were at their worst at three months post-stroke, and ethnic disparities were already present suggesting the need for early assessment and strategies to improve outcomes and possibly reduce disparities.</p>

     alt="Molecular examination of the endogenous opioid system in rhesus macaque monkeys with self-injurious behavior"/>
<p>The expression of genes related to endogenous opioid signaling was examined in Rhesus macaque (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) monkeys that self-injure compared to control monkeys, in brain regions important for behavioral and emotional regulation including the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, caudate, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. Reduced mRNA levels for the mu opioid receptor were measured in the amygdala, while reduced mRNA levels of dynorphin mRNA were observed in the hypothalamus in monkeys that self-injure compared to controls. This study confirms and extends our knowledge of endogenous opioid signaling in self-injurious behaviors.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Self-injurious behavior (SIB) can lead to serious injury and occurs in approximately 1%–4% of the adult population, with higher incidences in adolescent and institutionalized populations, as well as in children with developmental disorders such as Autism. SIB also spontaneously occurs in a low percentage of captive monkeys. Rhesus macaque (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) monkeys are evolutionarily and physiologically similar to humans, share 93% genetic sequence similarity to humans, and have long been used as testing subjects for vaccine and clinical trials. Previous studies hypothesized that altered endogenous opioid expression occurs in the brains of individuals and animals that self-injure. We examined the regional mRNA expression of opioid signaling genes in sixteen rhesus macaques that exhibited SIB and eight sex- and age- matched controls. The brain regions examined are linked to reward reinforcement and stress adaptation including the hypothalamus, orbital frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, caudate, and the amygdala. We found decreased μ-opioid receptor (<i>OPRM1</i>) in the amygdala of monkeys with SIB, and reduced prodynorphin (<i>PDYN</i>) in the hypothalamus. Our data suggest dysfunction in the regulation of opioid peptide precursors and calls for further investigation of the endogenous opioid system in SIB.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">The brain-immune ecosystem: Implications for immunotherapy in defeating neurodegenerative diseases</a></h4>

              
                Recent functional and anatomical discoveries of brain-immune relationships have overturned previous beliefs regarding the brain’s immune privilege. Here, we propose that the brain and immune cells at its borders operate as an “ecosystem” to support the brain’s robustness and resilience. Modulation of this ecosystem can be harnessed in the clinic.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mountain gorillas maintain strong maternal affiliative biases despite high male reproductive skew and extensive exposure to paternal kin</a></h4>

              
                Evolutionary theories predict that sibling relationships will reflect a complex balance of cooperative and competitive dynamics. In most mammals, dispersal and death patterns mean that sibling relationships occur in a relatively narrow window during development, and/or only with same-sex individuals. Besides humans, one notable exception are mountain gorillas, in which non-sex biased dispersal, relatively stable group composition, and the long reproductive tenures of alpha males mean that animals routinely reside with both maternally and paternally related siblings, of the same and opposite sex, throughout their lives. Using nearly 40,000 hours of behavioral data collected over 14 years on 699 sibling and 1235 non-sibling pairs of wild mountain gorillas, we demonstrate that individuals have strong affiliative preferences for full and maternal siblings over paternal siblings or unrelated animals, consistent with an inability to discriminate paternal kin. Intriguingly, however, aggression data imply the opposite. Aggression rates were statistically indistinguishable among all types of dyads except one: in mixed-sex dyads, non-siblings engaged in substantially more aggression than siblings of any type. This pattern suggests mountain gorillas may be capable of distinguishing paternal kin, but nonetheless choose not to affiliate with them over non-kin. We observe a preference for maternal kin in a species with high reproductive skew (i.e., high relatedness certainty), even though low reproductive skew (i.e., low relatedness certainty) is believed to underlie such biases in other non-human primates. Our results call into question reasons for strong maternal kin biases when paternal kin are identifiable, familiar, and similarly likely to be long-term groupmates, and they may also suggest behavioral mismatches at play during a transitional period in mountain gorilla society.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Variable paralog expression underlies phenotype variation</a></h4>

              
                Human faces are variable; we look different from one another. Craniofacial disorders further increase facial variation. To understand craniofacial variation, and how it can be buffered, we analyzed the zebrafish <i>mef2ca</i> mutant. When this transcription factor encoding gene is mutated, zebrafish develop dramatically variable craniofacial phenotypes. Years of selective breeding for low and high penetrance of mutant phenotypes produced strains that are either resilient, or sensitive, to the <i>mef2ca</i> mutation. Here we compared gene expression between these strains, which revealed that selective breeding enriched for high and low <i>mef2ca</i> paralog expression in the low- and high-penetrance strains, respectively. We found that <i>mef2ca</i> paralog expression is variable in unselected wild-type zebrafish, motivating the hypothesis that heritable variation in paralog expression underlies mutant phenotype severity and variation. In support, mutagenizing the <i>mef2ca</i> paralogs, <i>mef2aa</i>, <i>mef2b</i>, <i>mef2cb</i>, and <i>mef2d</i>, demonstrated modular buffering by paralogs. Specifically, some paralogs buffer severity while others buffer variability. We present a novel, mechanistic model for phenotypic variation where variable, vestigial paralog expression buffers development. These studies are a major step forward in understanding the mechanisms of facial variation, including how some genetically resilient individuals can overcome a deleterious mutation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fitness effects of CRISPR endonucleases in Drosophila melanogaster populations</a></h4>

              
                CRISPR/Cas9 provides a highly efficient and flexible genome editing technology with numerous potential applications ranging from gene therapy to population control. Some proposed applications involve the integration of CRISPR/Cas9 endonucleases into an organism's genome, which raises questions about potentially harmful effects to the transgenic individuals. One example for which this is particularly relevant are CRISPR-based gene drives conceived for the genetic alteration of entire populations. The performance of such drives can strongly depend on fitness costs experienced by drive carriers, yet relatively little is known about the magnitude and causes of these costs. Here, we assess the fitness effects of genomic CRISPR/Cas9 expression in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> cage populations by tracking allele frequencies of four different transgenic constructs that allow us to disentangle 'direct' fitness costs due to the integration, expression, and target-site activity of Cas9, from fitness costs due to potential off-target cleavage. Using a maximum likelihood framework, we find that a model with no direct fitness costs but moderate costs due to off-target effects fits our cage data best. Consistent with this, we do not observe fitness costs for a construct with Cas9HF1, a high-fidelity version of Cas9. We further demonstrate that using Cas9HF1 instead of standard Cas9 in a homing drive achieves similar drive conversion efficiency. These results suggest that gene drives should be designed with high-fidelity endonucleases and may have implications for other applications that involve genomic integration of CRISPR endonucleases.

                Tracking visual objects while stabilizing the visual background is complicated by the different computational requirements for object tracking and motion vision. In fruit fly, directionally selective motion detectors T4 and T5 cells supply wide-field neurons of the lobula plate, which control smooth gaze stabilization behavior. Here, we hypothesized that an anatomically parallel pathway supplied by T3, which encodes small moving objects and innervates the lobula, drives body saccades toward objects. We combined physiological and behavioral experiments to show that T3 neurons respond omnidirectionally to contrast changes induced by the visual stimuli that elicit tracking saccades, and silencing T3 reduced the frequency of tracking saccades. By contrast, optogenetic manipulation of T3 increased the number of tracking saccades. Our results represent the first evidence that parallel motion detection and feature detection pathways coordinate smooth gaze stabilization and saccadic object tracking behavior during flight.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-modal brain magnetic resonance imaging database covering marmosets with a wide age range</a></h4>

              
                Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive neuroimaging method beneficial for the identification of normal developmental and aging processes and data sharing. Marmosets have a relatively shorter life expectancy (approximately 10 years) than other primates, including, humans because they grow and age faster. Hence, the common marmoset model is effective in aging research. The current study investigated the aging process of the marmoset brain and provided an open MRI database on marmosets with a wide age range. The Brain/MINDS Marmoset Brain MRI Dataset contains brain MRI information on 216 marmosets aged between 1 and 10 years. During its release date, it is the largest public dataset worldwide. Further, it comprises multi contrast MRI images. In addition, 91 of 216 animals have corresponding ex vivo high-resolution MRI datasets. Our MRI database, which is available at the Brain/MINDS Data portal might help understand the effects of different factors, such as age, sex, body size, and fixation, on the brain. Moreover, it can contribute to and accelerate brain science studies worldwide.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain mapping and spatial protein profiling reveal functional connectivity deficits and molecular changes following repetitive mild traumatic brain injury in wild-type mice.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) is a leading and severe threat to cognition that often goes undiagnosed. A major challenge in developing diagnostics and treatments for the consequences of rmTBI is the fundamental knowledge gaps that explain how TBI promotes brain dysfunction. It is both critical and urgent to understand the neuropathological and functional consequences of rmTBI to develop effective therapeutic strategies. In this study, we defined the extent of altered brain functional connectivity (FC) and expression of neuropathological markers after rmTBI. Methods: We performed two rmTBI (2x 0.6 J impacts 24 h apart) in male and female C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) (~2.5-3mo) mice using CHIMERA or sham procedures. At 5-6 days post-injury (dpi), we measured changes in brain volume and FC using T2-weighted images, resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) and graph theory analyses. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess microstructural changes in white matter tracts. In addition, at 7dpi, we measured changes in Iba1 and GFAP in specific brain regions to determine the extent of gliosis. The expression of disease-associated protein markers in grey and white matter (WM) regions were evaluated using the NanoString-GeoMx digital spatial protein profiling spatial profiling (DSP) platform. Results: The rsfMRI data revealed aberrant changes in connectivity such as node clustering coefficient, global and local efficiency, participation coefficient, eigenvector centrality, and betweenness centrality in thalamus and other key brain regions that process visual, auditory, and somatosensory information. Using DTI, we found that fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial diffusivity in the optic tract was significantly decreased. Also, mean, radial, and axial diffusivity (L1) were significantly increased in the hippocampus. DSP revealed that phospho-serine 199 tau (pS199) as well as glial markers such as GFAP, cathepsin-D, and Iba1 were significantly increased in the optic tract. In thalamic nuclei, the neuroinflammatory marker GPNMB was increased significantly, and the cell proliferation marker Ki-67 was significantly decreased in the rmTBI group. Our data suggest that rmTBI significantly alters brain functional connectivity and causes a profound inflammatory response in gray matter regions, beyond chronic white matter damage.

                Synaptic dysfunction is implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BP). We used quantitative mass-spectrometry to carry out deep and unbiased profiling of the proteome of synapses purified from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 35 cases of SCZ, 35 cases of BP, and 35 controls. Compared to controls, SCZ and BP synapses showed substantial and similar proteomic alterations. Network and gene set enrichment analyses revealed upregulation of proteins associated with autophagy and certain vesicle transport pathways, and downregulation of proteins related to synaptic, mitochondrial, and ribosomal function in the synapses of individuals with SCZ or BP. Some of the same pathways (e.g., upregulation of vesicle transport, downregulation of mitochondrial and ribosomal proteins) were similarly dysregulated in the synaptic proteome of mutant mice deficient in Akap11, a recently discovered shared risk gene for SCZ and BP. Our work provides novel biological insights into molecular dysfunction at the synapse in SCZ and BP and serves as a resource for understanding the pathophysiology of these debilitating neuropsychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">SRF transcriptionally regulates the oligodendrocyte cytoskeleton during CNS myelination</a></h4>

              
                Myelination of neuronal axons is essential for nervous system development. Myelination requires dramatic cytoskeletal dynamics in oligodendrocytes, but how actin is regulated during myelination is poorly understood. We recently identified serum response factor (SRF), a transcription factor known to regulate expression of actin and actin regulators in other cell types, as a critical driver of myelination in the aged brain. Yet, a major gap remains in understanding the fundamental role of SRF in oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Here we show that SRF is required cell autonomously in oligodendrocytes for myelination during development. Combining ChIP-seq with RNA-seq identifies SRF-target genes in OPCs and oligodendrocytes that include actin and other key cytoskeletal genes. Accordingly, SRF knockout oligodendrocytes exhibit dramatically reduced actin filament levels early in differentiation, consistent with its role in actin-dependent myelin sheath initiation. Together, our findings identify SRF as a transcriptional regulator that controls the expression of cytoskeletal genes required in oligodendrocytes for myelination. This study identifies a novel pathway regulating oligodendrocyte biology with high relevance to brain development, aging, and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Irregular optogenetic stimulation waveforms can induce naturalistic patterns of hippocampal spectral activity</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Brain stimulation is a fundamental and effective therapy for neurological diseases including Parkinsons disease, essential tremor, and epilepsy. One key challenge in delivering effective brain stimulation is identifying the stimulation parameters, such as the amplitude, frequency, contact configuration, and pulse width, that induce an optimal change in symptoms, behavior, or neural activity. Most clinical and translational studies use constant frequency pulses of stimulation, but stimulation with irregular pulse patterns or non-pulsatile waveforms might induce unique changes in neural activity that could enable better therapeutic responses. Here, we comprehensively evaluate several optogenetic stimulation waveforms, report their differing effects on hippocampal spectral activity, and compare these induced effects to activity recorded during natural behavior. Methods: Sprague Dawley rats were prepared for panneuronal excitatory optogenetic stimulation of the medial septum (hSyn ChR2) and 16-channel microelectrode recording in CA1 and CA3 layers of the hippocampus. We performed grid and random sampling of the parameters comprising several stimulation waveforms, including standard pulse, nested pulse, sinusoid, double sinusoid, and Poisson pulse waveforms. Results: We comprehensively report the effects of changing stimulation parameters in these parameter spaces on two key biomarkers of hippocampal function, theta and gamma power. Similarly, robust excitation of hippocampal gamma power was observed across all waveforms, whereas no set of stimulation parameters was sufficient to consistently increase power in the theta band beyond baseline levels of activity (despite the prominent role of the medial septum in pacing hippocampal theta oscillations). Using a manifold learning algorithm to compare high dimensional neural activity, we show that irregular stimulation patterns produce differing effects with respect to multi-band patterns of activity and can induce activity patterns that more closely resemble activity recorded during natural behavior than conventional parameters. Conclusion: Our counter intuitive findings, that stimulation of the medial septum ubiquitously does not increase hippocampal theta power, and that different waveforms have similar effects on single power bands, contradict recent trends in brain stimulation research, necessitating greater caution and fewer mechanistic assumptions as to how a given stimulation target or waveform will modulate a neurophysiological biomarker of disease. We also reveal that irregular stimulation patterns can have biomimetic utility, promoting their exploration in medical applications where inducing a particular activity pattern can have therapeutic benefit. Last, we demonstrate a scalable data driven analysis strategy that can make the discovery of such physiologically informed temporal stimulation patterns more empirically tractable in translational settings.

                During the visual critical period, sensory experience refines the structure and function of visual circuits. The basis of this plasticity was long thought to be limited to cortical circuits, yet recently described thalamic ocular dominance plasticity challenges this dogma and demonstrates greater complexity underlying visual plasticity. Yet how visual experience modulates responses of thalamic neurons or how the thalamus modulates CP timing is incompletely understood. Using a novel larval zebrafish, thalamus-centric ocular dominance model, we show functional changes in the thalamus and a role of inhibitory signaling to establish critical period timing using a combination of functional imaging, optogenetics, and pharmacology. Moreover, hemisphere-specific functional changes in genetically defined thalamic neurons correlate with changes in visuomotor behavior, establishing a role of thalamic plasticity in modulating motor performance. Together, our work demonstrates that visual plasticity is more broadly conserved and shows that visual experience leads to neuron-level functional changes in the thalamus that require inhibitory signaling to establish critical period timing.

                Spontaneous oscillatory neural activity can influence the processing of incoming sensory input and subsequent behavioural reactions. Spontaneous oscillatory activity mostly appears in stochastic bursts, but typical trial-averaged approaches fail to capture this. We aimed at relating oscillatory bursts in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) to behaviour directly, via an EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) that allowed for burst-triggered stimulus presentation in real-time in a visual detection task. According to alpha theories, we hypothesised that targets presented during alpha-bursts should lead to slower responses and higher miss rates, whereas targets presented in the absence of bursts should lead to faster responses and higher false alarm rates. Our findings support the role of bursts in alpha-oscillations in visual perception and exemplify how real-time BCI systems can be used as a test bench for brain-behavioural theories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic refinement of behavioral structure mediates dopamine-dependent credit assignment</a></h4>

              
                Animals exhibit a diverse behavioral repertoire when exploring new environments and can learn which actions or action sequences produce positive outcomes. Dopamine release upon encountering reward is critical for reinforcing reward-producing actions. However, it has been challenging to understand how credit is assigned to the exact action that produced dopamine release during continuous behavior. We investigated this problem with a novel self-stimulation paradigm in which specific spontaneous movements triggered optogenetic stimulation of dopaminergic neurons. We uncovered that dopamine self-stimulation rapidly and dynamically changes the structure of the entire behavioral repertoire. Initial stimulations reinforced not only the stimulation-producing target action, but also actions similar to the target and actions that occurred a few seconds before stimulation. Repeated pairings led to gradual refinement of the behavioral repertoire leading animals to home in on the target action. Reinforcement of action sequences revealed further temporal dependencies of behavioral refinement. Action pairs that tend to be spontaneously separated by long time intervals promoted a stepwise credit assignment, with early refinement of actions most proximal to stimulation and subsequent refinement of more distal actions. Thus, a retrospective reinforcement mechanism promotes gradual refinement of the entire behavioral repertoire to assign credit to specific actions and action sequences that lead to dopamine release.

                Motor (M1) and dorsal premotor (PMd) cortex are central to arm and hand control in primates. Motor outputs in both areas confer somatotopically organized arm and hand zones. Here, we investigate the spatial mapping between those motor zones and movement-related neural activity to gain insight about functional organization in M1/PMd. Two macaques reached and grasped while cortical activity was measured with intrinsic signal optical imaging. Activity maps were quantified in relation to microstimulation motor maps from the same hemispheres. Each activity map was comprised of many patches and overlapped surprisingly small portions of the motor map. Functional differences between the patches were inferred from their activity time courses and location within the motor map. We propose that M1/PMd contain subzones that are preferentially tuned for specific actions. Thus, the spatial dimension of neural activity in frontal motor areas is an important organizing principle of the neural code for movement control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The logic of recurrent circuits in the primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Recurrent cortical activity sculpts visual perception by refining, amplifying, or suppressing incoming visual signals. Despite the importance of recurrent circuits for cortical processing, the basic rules that govern how nearby cortical neurons influence each other remains enigmatic. We used two-photon holographic optogenetics to activate ensembles of neurons in Layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex (V1) in the absence of external stimuli to isolate the impact of local recurrence from external inputs. We find that the spatial arrangement and the stimulus feature preference of both the stimulated and the target ensemble jointly determine the net effect of recurrent activity, defining the cortical activity patterns that drive competition versus facilitation in L2/3 circuits. Computational modeling suggests that a combination of highly local recurrent excitatory connectivity and selective convergence onto inhibitory neurons give rise to these principles of recurrent activity. Our data and modeling reveal that recurrent activity can have varied impact, but a logic emerges through an understanding of the precise spatial distribution and feature preference of the multicellular pattern of activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Generalization of contextual fear is sex-specifically affected by high salt intake</a></h4>

              
                A hallmark symptom of many anxiety disorders, and multiple neuropsychiatric disorders more broadly, is generalization of fearful responses to non-fearful stimuli. Anxiety disorders are often comorbid with cardiovascular diseases. One established, and modifiable, risk factor for cardiovascular diseases is salt intake. Yet, investigations into how excess salt consumption affects anxiety-relevant behaviors remains little explored. Moreover, no studies have yet assessed how high salt intake influences generalization of fear. Here, we used adult C57BL/6J mice of both sexes to evaluate the influence of two or six weeks of high salt consumption (4.0% NaCl), compared to controls (0.4% NaCl), on contextual fear acquisition, expression, and generalization. Further, we measured osmotic and physiological stress by quantifying serum osmolality and corticosterone levels, respectively. Consuming excess salt did not influence contextual fear acquisition nor discrimination between the context used for training and a novel, neutral context when training occurred 48 prior to testing. However, when a four week delay between training and testing was employed to induce natural fear generalization processes, we found that high salt intake selectively increases contextual fear generalization in females, but the same diet reduces contextual fear generalization in males. These sex-specific effects were independent of any changes in serum osmolality nor corticosterone levels, suggesting the behavioral shifts are a consequence of more subtle, neurophysiologic changes. This is the first evidence of salt consumption influencing contextual fear generalization, and adds information about sex-specific effects of salt that are largely missing from current literature.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gradual relation between perceptual awareness, recognition and pupillary responses to social threat</a></h4>

              
                There is substantial evidence about affective stimulus processing outside awareness in healthy participants and brain-damaged patients. However, there are still methodological concerns mainly relating to the methods used to assess awareness. In two experiments, we investigated the processing of social threat in healthy participants by combining the continuous flash suppression paradigm and the perceptual awareness scale, a finer measure of perceptual awareness than dichotomous (seen/unseen) responses. Our behavioral results show a gradual relationship between emotional recognition and perceptual awareness. Recognition sensitivity was also higher for fearful than angry bodies for all visual awareness levels except for the perceptual unawareness condition where performance was at chance level. Interestingly, angry body expressions were suppressed for a shorter duration than neutral and fearful ones. Pupil dilation was a function of affective expression, the duration of suppression and the level of perceptual awareness. In conclusion, behavioral as well as pupillary responses showed a gradual relationship with perceptual awareness, and this relationship was influenced by the specific stimulus category.

                Oral contraceptive (OC) intake has been associated with alterations in functional brain architecture and socio-affective processes. However, most previous studies have been limited by cross-sectional designs and/or did not account for synthetic sex hormone concentrations. The aim of this longitudinal study was to determine the effects of starting vs discontinuing OCs on socio-affective functions such as mood and emotion cognition, and to identify their possible neuroendocrinological substrates. To this end, 88 young healthy women performed the behavioral and fMRI measures twice, three to eight months apart: 26 natural cycling women twice during menstruation, 26 OC users twice during OC intake, 25 OC discontinuers and 11 OC starters before and after discontinuation or start, respectively. In addition to mean-based analyses, we used intersubject representational similarity analyses to determine relationships between interindividual variability in within-subject changes of hormone profiles, including concentrations of endogenous and synthetic hormones, region-specific resting state functional connectivity (parcelwise RSFC) and socio-affective measures. Across the whole sample, interindividual patterns of changes in RSFC of fronto-parietal regions, parts of the left hippocampus and the right cerebellum reflected change patterns of progestogen levels. For the right superior orbitofrontal gyrus (OFG), a trinity of idiosyncratic patterns was found in changes of progestogens, RSFC and positive mood. Active OC intake was associated with higher self-reported depressive symptoms in OC discontinuers (and starters). Emotion recognition performance was not associated with changes in hormone profiles or RSFC. Overall, progestogens rather than estrogens appear to be associated with functional brain architecture of the frontal and subcortical/cerebellar regions and positive mood. The right superior OFG represents a possible neural substrate for progestogen-induced changes in positive mood. This study indicates the importance of a multidimensional, longitudinal approach when being interested in effects of hormonal contraception on women's brain and behavior.

                In everyday activities, humans use a finite number of postural hand configurations, but how do they flow into each other to create sophisticated manual behavior? We hypothesized that hand movement emerges through the temporal dynamics of a set of recurrent hand shapes characterized by specific transitions. Through a sensorized glove, we collected kinematics data from thirty-six participants preparing and having breakfast in naturalistic conditions. By means of a combined PCA/clustering-based approach, we identified a repertoire of hand states and their transitions over time. We found that manual behavior can be described in space through a complex organization of basic configurations. These, even in an unconstrained experiment, recurred across subjects. A specific temporal structure, highly consistent within the sample, seems to integrate such identified hand shapes to realize skilled movements. Our findings suggest that the simplification of the motor commands unravels in the temporal dimension more than in the spatial one.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Interaction of Context Constraints and Predictive Validity during Sentence Reading</a></h4>

              
                Words are not processed in isolation, instead they are commonly embedded in phrases and sentences. The sentential context influences the perception and processing of a word. However, how this is achieved by brain processes and whether predictive mechanisms underlie this process remains a debated topic. To this end we employed an experimental paradigm in which we orthogonalized sentence context constraints and predictive validity, which was defined as the ratio of congruent to incongruent sentence endings within the experiment. While recording electroencephalography, participants read sentences with three levels of sentential context constraints (high, medium and low). Participants were also separated into two groups, which differed in their ratio of valid congruent to incongruent target words that could be predicted from the sentential context. For both groups we investigated modulations of alpha power before, and N400 amplitude modulations after target word onset. The results reveal that the N400 amplitude gradually decreases with higher context constraints. Contrary, alpha power is non-monotonically influenced, displaying the strongest decrease for high context constraints over frontal electrode sites, while alpha power between medium and low context constraints does not differ. This indicates that both neural correlates are influenced by the degree of context constraint but are not affected by changes in predictive validity. The results therefore suggest that both N400 and alpha power are not unequivocally linked to the predictability of a target word based on larger contextual information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adolescent ethanol exposure promotes mechanical allodynia and alters dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens shell.</a></h4>

              
                Excessive alcohol consumption in adolescence can disrupt neural development and may augment pain perception. Recent studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell is involved in mediating pain sensitivity after peripheral inflammation in rodent models of chronic pain and alcohol use disorder (AUD). Interestingly, there have been very few studies examining the impact of chronic ethanol exposure during adolescence on pain sensitivity in adulthood. Therefore, in this project we investigated the impact of adolescent chronic intermittent ethanol (aCIE) exposure on mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Furthermore, given the involvement of the NAc shell in pain processing and chronic ethanol mediated changes, we measured changes in accumbal dopamine kinetics during protracted withdrawal. We found that both male and female aCIE rats show mechanical allodynia during withdrawal; however, only male rats exhibit thermal hyperalgesia during protracted withdrawal. Furthermore, male and female aCIE rats show greater evoked tonic dopamine release, maximal rate of dopamine reuptake, and dopamine affinity to the dopamine transporter in the NAc shell compared to controls. With phasic stimulation, aCIE rats also showed greater dopamine release compared to air exposed rats. These data suggest that aCIE exposure exacerbates pain sensitivity during withdrawal. Furthermore, based on prior literature, it is possible that the increased pain sensitivity may be driven, at least in part, by augmented dopamine kinetics in the NAc shell observed in the current study.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Choice seeking is motivated by the intrinsic need for personal control</a></h4>

              
                When deciding between options that do or do not lead to future choices, humans often choose to choose. We studied choice seeking by asking subjects to decide between a choice opportunity or performing a computer-selected action. Subjects preferred choice when these options were equally rewarded, even deterministically, and were willing to trade extrinsic rewards for the opportunity to choose. We explained individual variability in choice seeking using reinforcement learning models incorporating risk sensitivity and overvaluation of rewards obtained through choice. Degrading perceived controllability diminished choice preference, although willingness to repeat selection of choice opportunities remained unchanged. In choices following these repeats, subjects were sensitive to rewards following freely chosen actions, but ignored environmental information in a manner consistent with a desire to maintain personal control. Choice seeking appears to reflect the intrinsic need for personal control, which competes with extrinsic reward properties and external information to motivate behavior.

                Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are predominantly developmental in nature and largely genetically determined. There are some human data supporting the idea that fever can improve symptoms in some individuals but the human data for this are limited and there are almost no data to support this from animal models. In the current study, we used a whole body hyperthermia (WBH) protocol and systemic inflammation induced by bacterial endotoxin (LPS) to dissociate temperature and inflammatory elements of fever in order to examine the impact of these environmental stressors on behavioural signs in two animal models relevant to ASD: C58BL/6 and Shank3B- mice. While only LPS induced inflammatory signatures in the brain, WBH and LPS induced both overlapping and distinct neuronal cFos activation in several brain regions and modest effects on heat shock gene expression. In behavioural experiments LPS significantly suppressed most activities over 24-48 hours while WBH reduced repetitive behaviours and improved social interaction in C58BL/6 mice. In Shank3B- mice WBH significantly reduced compulsive grooming. The data are the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate that elevated body temperature, in the absence of underpinning inflammation, can improve some behavioural signs in two distinct animal models of ASD. Given the developmental and genetic nature of ASD, evidence that symptoms may be ameliorated by environmental perturbations indicates that there are possibilities for improving function in these individuals.

                Structural, functional, and molecular alterations in excitatory spine synapses are a common hallmark of many neurodevelopmental disorders including intellectual disability and autism. Here, we describe an optimized methodology, based on combined use of DiI and immunofluorescence, for rapid and sensitive characterization of the structure and composition of spine synapses in native brain tissue. We successfully demonstrate the applicability of this approach by examining the properties of hippocampal spine synapses in juvenile Fmr1 KO mice, a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome. We find that mutant mice display pervasive dysgenesis of spine synapses evidenced by an overabundance of both abnormally elongated thin spines and cup-shaped spines, in combination with reduced density of mushroom spines. We further find that mushroom spines expressing the actin-binding protein Synaptopodin - a marker for spine apparatus - are more prevalent in mutant mice. Previous work identified spines with Synaptopodin/spine apparatus as the locus of mGluR-LTD, which is abnormally elevated in Fmr1 KO mice. Altogether, our data suggest this enhancement may be linked to the preponderance of this subset of spines in the mutant. Overall, these findings demonstrate the sensitivity and versatility of the optimized methodology by uncovering a novel facet of spine dysgenesis in Fmr1 KO mice.

                Treatments accelerating axon regeneration in the nervous system are still unavailable in the clinic. However, in culture, parthenolide markedly promotes adult sensory neurons' axon growth by inhibiting microtubule detyrosination. Here, we show that overexpression of vasohibins increases microtubule detyrosination in growth cones and compromises growth in culture and in vivo. Moreover, overexpression of these proteins increases the required parthenolide concentrations to promote axon regeneration, while the knockdown of vasohibins or their enhancer SVBP abolishes parthenolide's effects, verifying them as pharmacological targets for promoting axon growth. In vivo, repeated intravenous application of parthenolide or its prodrug di-methyl-amino-parthenolide (DMAPT) markedly facilitates regeneration of sensory, motor, and sympathetic axons in injured murine and rat nerves and accelerates functional recovery. Moreover, orally applied DMAPT was similarly effective in promoting nerve regeneration. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of vasohibins facilitates axon regeneration in different species and nerves, making parthenolide and DMAPT promising drugs for curing nerve injury.

                Previously, we used the genetically encoded dopamine sensor dLight1 to show that mice modeling the neurodevelopmental disorder neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have enhanced dopaminergic responses to salient visual stimuli in the lateral nucleus accumbens/ventral striatum (LNAc), as well as more vigorous behavioral responses to visual threats (Robinson et al., 2019). Here, we sought to better understand the nature of this phenotype by testing the ability of striatal dopamine release to encode the properties of sensory stimuli, including threatening looming discs, in typically developing mice. In this Research Advance, we report that ventral striatum dopamine release encodes the rate and magnitude of environmental luminance changes rather than the perceived threat intensity of the stimulus. These visually-evoked dopamine responses are wavelength-dependent at low irradiances, independent of the circadian cycle, and relatively robust to previous exposure history. Thus, we have further elaborated the mesolimbic dopamine system's ability to encode visual information in mice, which may be altered in neurodevelopmental disease models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pre- and post-task resting-state differs in clinical populations</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state functional connectivity has generated great hopes as a potential brain biomarker for improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in psychiatry. This neuroimaging protocol can routinely be performed by patients and does not depend on the specificities of a task. Thus, it seems ideal for big data approaches that require aggregating data across multiple studies and sites. However, technical variability, diverging data analysis approaches, and differences in data acquisition protocols might introduce heterogeneity to the aggregated data. Besides these technical aspects, the psychological state of participants might also contribute to heterogeneity. In healthy participants, studies have shown that behavioral tasks can influence resting-state measures, but such effects have not yet been reported in clinical populations. Here, we fill this knowledge gap by comparing resting-state functional connectivity before and after clinically relevant tasks in two clinical conditions, namely substance use disorders and phobias. The tasks consisted of viewing craving-inducing and spider anxiety provoking pictures that are frequently used in cue-reactivity studies and exposure therapy. We found distinct pre- vs. post-task resting-state connectivity differences in each group, as well as decreased thalamo-cortical and increased intra-thalamic connectivity which might be associated with decreased vigilance in both groups. Notably, the pre- vs. post-task thalamus-amygdala connectivity change within a patient cohort seems more pronounced than the difference of that connection between the smoker vs. phobia clinical trait. Our results confirm that resting-state measures can be strongly influenced by changes in psychological states that need to be taken into account when pooling resting-state scans for clinical biomarker detection. This demands that resting-state datasets should include a complete description of the experimental design, especially when a task preceded data collection.

                Recognizing and monitoring students' attention during learning is crucial to successful knowledge acquisition since it influences cognitive function. As a result, gaining a precise picture of a learner's mental state may enable interactive learning systems to alter tutoring content, devise effective help tactics, and improve learning outcomes. In computer-based learning environments, keeping track of students' mental states is vital. Investigating the feasibility of utilizing active learning in enhancing student engagement index when exposed to various visual stimuli is the genesis of this work. The research includes collecting EEG data from 20 participants (ten males, ten females) while resting and being subjected to various virtual infotainment/educational content. The EEG data were collected using the Allengers Neuro PLOT, a 40-channel wet electrode system. The work includes raw and pre-processed EEG data under quiescent and audio-visual continuous cues. The recorded data is accommodated by a sophisticated EEG data pre-processing pipeline and will be available to the research community for usage.

                Natural odorant scenes are complex landscapes comprising mixtures of volatile compounds. It was previously proposed that the Antennal Lobe circuit recovers the odorant identity in a concentration-invariant manner via divisive normalization of Local Neurons. It remains unclear, however, how identities of odorant components in a mixture is represented or recovered in the fruit fly early olfactory pathway. In the current work, we take a different approach from the traditional steady-state analyses that classify odorant mixture encoding into configural vs. elemental schemes. Instead, we focus on the spatio-temporal responses of the early olfactory pathway at the levels of the Antennal Lobe and the Mushroom Body, and formulate the odorant demixing problem as a blind source separation problem - where the identities of each individual odorant component and their corresponding concentration waveforms are recovered from the spatio-temporal PSTH of Olfactory Sensory Neurons (OSNs), Projection Neurons (PNs), and Kenyon Cells (KCs) respectively. Building upon previous models of the Antenna and the Antennal Lobe, we advanced a feedback divisive normalization architecture of the Mushroom Body Calyx circuit comprised of PN, KC and the giant Anterior Paired Lateral (APL) neuron. We demonstrate that the PN KC-APL circuit produces a high dimensional representation of odorant mixture with robust sparsity, and results in greater odorant demixing performance than the PN responses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Kynurenine aminotransferase II inhibition promotes sleep and rescues impairments induced by neurodevelopmental insult</a></h4>

              
                Dysregulated sleep is commonly reported in individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BPD). Physiology and pathogenesis of these disorders points to aberrant metabolism, during neurodevelopment and adulthood, of tryptophan via the kynurenine pathway (KP). Kynurenic acid (KYNA), a neuroactive KP metabolite derived from its precursor kynurenine by kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II), is increased in the brains of individuals with SCZ and BPD. We hypothesize that elevated KYNA, an inhibitor of glutamatergic and cholinergic neurotransmission, contributes to sleep dysfunction. Employing the embryonic kynurenine (EKyn) paradigm to elevate KYNA in the fetal brain, we presently examined whether reducing KYNA in adulthood by pharmacologically inhibiting KAT II would improve sleep quality. Pregnant Wistar rats were fed either kynurenine (100 mg/day) (EKyn) or control wet mash (ECon) from embryonic day (ED) 15 to ED 22. In adulthood, male and female offspring were implanted with devices to record electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) telemetrically for continuous sleep-wake data acquisition. Each subject was treated with either vehicle or PF-04859989 (30 mg/kg, s.c.), an irreversible KAT II inhibitor, at zeitgeber time (ZT) 0 or ZT 12. KAT II inhibitor improved sleep architecture maintaining entrainment of the light-dark cycle; ZT 0 treatment with PF-04859989 induced transient improvements in rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) during the immediate light phase, while the impact of ZT 12 treatment was delayed until the subsequent light phase. PF-04859989 administration at ZT 0 enhanced NREM delta spectral power and reduced activity and body temperature. In conclusion, reducing de novo KYNA production alleviated sleep disturbances and increased sleep quality in EKyn, while also improving sleep outcomes in ECon offspring. Our findings place attention on KAT II inhibition as a novel mechanistic approach to treating disrupted sleep behavior with potential translational implications for patients with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activating words without language: Beta and theta oscillations reflect lexical access and control processes during verbal and non-verbal object recognition tasks</a></h4>

              
                The intention to name an object modulates neural responses during object recognition tasks. However, the nature of this modulation is still unclear. We established whether a core operation in language, i.e., lexical access, can be observed even when the task does not require language (size- judgment task), and whether response selection in verbal versus non-verbal semantic tasks relies on similar neuronal processes. We measured and compared neuronal oscillatory activities and behavioural responses to the same set of pictures of meaningful objects, while the type of task participants had to perform (picture-naming versus size-judgment) and the type of stimuli to measure lexical access (cognate versus non-cognate) were manipulated. Despite activation of words was facilitated when the task required explicit word-retrieval (picture-naming task), lexical access occurred even without the intention to name the object (non-verbal size-judgment task). Activation of words and response selection were accompanied by beta (25-35 Hz) desynchronisation and theta (3-7 Hz) synchronisation, respectively. These effects were observed in both picture-naming and size-judgment tasks, suggesting that words became activated via similar mechanisms, irrespective of whether the task involves language explicitly. This finding has important implications to understand the link between core linguistic operations and performance in verbal and non-verbal semantic tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">"Um... it's really difficult to... um.. speak fluently": Neural tracking of spontaneous speech</a></h4>

              
                Spontaneous real-life speech is imperfect in many ways. It contains disfluencies and ill-formed utterances that the brain needs to contend with in order to extract meaning out of speech. Here, we studied how the neural speech-tracking response is affected by three specific factors that are prevalent in spontaneous colloquial speech: (1) the presence of non-lexical fillers, (2) the need to detect syntactic boundaries in disfluent speech and (3) the effort involved in processing syntactically complex phrases. Neural activity (EEG) was recorded from individuals as they listened to an unscripted, spontaneous narrative, which was analyzed in a time-resolved fashion to identify fillers, detect syntactic boundaries and assess the syntactic complexity of different phrases. When considering these factors in the speech-tracking analysis, we found that it was affected by all of them. The most consistent effect, observed for all three factors, was modulation of a centro-frontal negative response that peaked around 350 ms, highly resembling the well-known N400 ERP response linked to various aspects of lexical access and semantic processing. This response was observed for lexical words but not for fillers, was larger for opening vs. closing words of a clause and was enhanced in response to high-complexity phrases. These findings broaden ongoing efforts to understand neural processing of speech under increasingly realistic conditions. They highlight the importance of considering the imperfect nature of real-life spoken language, linking past research on linguistically well-formed and meticulously controlled speech to the type of speech that the brain actually deals with on a daily basis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Corticothalamic Neurons in Motor Cortex Have a Permissive Role in Motor Execution</a></h4>

              
                The primary motor cortex (M1) is a central hub for motor learning and execution, as it receives input from and broadcasts to a multitude of other motor regions. It has become increasingly clear that M1 is heterogeneous in terms of cell types, many of which exhibit varying relationships to movement during learning and execution. Previous studies have mainly used a single candidate approach to identify cell types contributing to motor learning and execution. Here, we employed an unbiased screen to tag active neurons at different stages of performance of a motor task. We characterized the relative cell type composition among the active neurons at different stages of motor training and identified varying patterns across training. One cell type consistently showed enrichment as training and execution progressed: corticothalamic neurons (M1CT). Anatomical characterization of M1CT neurons revealed an extensive projection pattern to thalamic nuclei with marked topographical organization. Using two-photon calcium imaging, we found that M1CT neuron activity is largely suppressed during movement. M1CT neurons display a negative correlation with movement that scales with movement vigor and augments with training. Closed-loop optogenetic manipulation of M1CT activity revealed that their activity rapidly affects movement execution, even after movement is initiated. Taken together, these results identify and reveal a critical permissive role of corticothalamic neurons in movement execution.

	<p>Electroencephalography (EEG) records the electrical activity of the brain, which is an important tool for the automatic detection of epileptic seizures. It is certainly a very heavy burden to only recognize EEG epilepsy manually, so the method of computer-assisted treatment is of great importance. This paper presents a seizure detection algorithm based on variational modal decomposition (VMD) and a deep forest (DF) model. Variational modal decomposition is performed on EEG recordings, and the first three variational modal functions (VMFs) are selected to construct the time&amp;amp;ndash;frequency distribution of the EEG signals. Then, the log&amp;amp;minus;Euclidean covariance matrix (LECM) is computed to represent the EEG properties and form EEG features. The deep forest model is applied to complete the EEG signal classification, which is a non-neural network deep model with a cascade structure that performs feature learning through the forest. In addition, to improve the classification accuracy, postprocessing techniques are performed to generate the discriminant results by moving average filtering and adaptive collar expansion. The algorithm was evaluated on the Bonn EEG dataset and the Freiburg long&amp;amp;minus;term EEG dataset, and the former achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 99.32% and 99.31%, respectively. The mean sensitivity and specificity of this method for the 21 patients in the Freiburg dataset were 95.2% and 98.56%, respectively, with a false detection rate of 0.36/h. These results demonstrate the superior performance advantage of our algorithm and indicate its great research potential in epilepsy detection.</p>

	<p>Short-term auditory habituation is typically reflected by decreased but recoverable amplitudes of the N1 component of event-related potentials to repeated stimuli. It remains less well understood whether and how N1 habituation is modulated by the human cognition. The current study aims to further test for the potential modulatory roles of phonological information carried by spoken word-forms. Two phonological variables, namely lexicality (real versus pseudoword-form) and usage frequency (high versus low frequency), are considered and combined factorially, yielding four types of monosyllabic Mandarin spoken word-forms. Each type consists of 10 items (i.e., word-forms). The stimuli were passively presented to native Mandarin speakers in trains of five (S1&amp;amp;ndash;S5), while their EEG was recorded. The peak amplitudes of N1 to the same type of speech stimuli were calculated for each position by averaging the trains extracted from the EEG recording. Then, the N1 habituation was quantified for the two electrodes of interest (C3 and C4) in each repetitive presentation position (S2&amp;amp;ndash;S5). The results showed that the N1 habituation in low-frequency pseudo word-forms was consistently greater than in low-frequency real word-forms and high-frequency pseudo word-forms, respectively, at the fourth presentation (S4). The results suggest the first evidence that different types of phonological information (i.e., lexicality and usage frequency) modulate N1 habituation, interactively. Sensory filtering is proposed as a candidate mechanism for mediating between the processing of phonological information and the short-term habituation of auditory N1.</p>

	<p>Despite the widespread use of email, our knowledge regarding the consequences of email addiction is lacking. The purpose of this study was to develop an email addiction tendency scale to evaluate its correlation to behavior and brain structure. Following this, the validity and reliability of the developed scale was investigated. We used voxel-based morphometry, correlation, and univariate regression analysis to assess the relationships between email addiction tendency scores and regional gray and white matter volumes, depression, and nonverbal reasoning abilities in a large sample of healthy young adults (n = 1152; mean age, 20.69 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.84 years). The content validity ratio, content validity index, principal component analysis, and confirmatory factorial analysis all showed that the email addiction tendency scale (EATS) has high validity. Additionally, the Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s alpha internal consistency and split-half reliability coefficient showed that the EATS has high reliability. We found that email addiction tendency scores were significantly negatively correlated with nonverbal reasoning. We also observed that the email addiction tendency scores were significantly and positively correlated with depression symptom severity and gray matter volume of the left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPC) in subjects. These results indicate that email addiction tendency is associated with lower mental health outcomes and increased GMV in the left RLPC.</p>

	<p>Transcranial ultrasound holds much potential as a safe, non-invasive modality for navigated neuromodulation, with low-intensity focused ultrasound (FUS) and transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) representing the two main modalities. While neuroscientific and preclinical applications have received much interest, clinical applications are still relatively scarce. For safety considerations, the current literature is largely based on guidelines for ultrasound imaging that uses various physical parameters to describe the ultrasound pulse form and expected bioeffects. However, the safety situation for neuromodulation is inherently different. This article provides an overview of relevant ultrasound parameters with a focus on bioeffects relevant for safe clinical applications. Further, a retrospective analysis of safety data for clinical TPS applications in patients is presented.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Importance of Semantic Network Brain Regions in Integrating Prior Knowledge with an Ongoing Dialogue</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>To understand a dialogue, we need to know the topics that are being discussed. This enables us to integrate our knowledge of what was said previously to interpret the current dialogue. This study involved a large-scale behavioral experiment conducted online and a separate fMRI experiment, both testing human participants. In both, we selectively manipulated knowledge about the narrative content of dialogues presented in short videos. The clips were scenes from situation comedies that were split into two parts. The speech in the part 1 clips could either be presented normally or spectrally rotated to render it unintelligible. The part 2 clips that concluded the scenes were always presented normally. The behavioral experiment showed that knowledge of the preceding narrative boosted memory for the part 2 clips as well as increased the intersubject semantic similarity of recalled descriptions of the dialogues. The fMRI experiment replicated the finding that prior knowledge improved memory for the conclusions of the dialogues. Furthermore, prior knowledge strengthened temporal intersubject correlations in brain regions including the left angular gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus. Together, these findings show that (1) prior knowledge constrains the interpretation of a dialogue to be more similar across individuals; and (2), consistent with this, the activation of brain regions involved in semantic control processing is also more similar between individuals who share the same prior knowledge. Processing in these regions likely supports the activation and integration of prior knowledge, which helps people to better understand and remember dialogues as they unfold.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide (PACAP) System of the Central Amygdala Mediates the Detrimental Effects of Chronic Social Defeat Stress in Rats</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Many psychiatric diseases stem from an inability to cope with stressful events, as chronic stressors can precipitate or exacerbate psychopathologies. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying the response to chronic stress and the resulting anxiety states remain poorly understood. Stress neuropeptides in the extended amygdala circuitry mediate the behavioral response to stress, and hyperactivity of these systems has been hypothesized to be responsible for the emergence of persistent negative outcomes and for the pathogenesis of anxiety-related and trauma-related disorders. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and its receptor PAC1R are highly expressed within the central amygdala (CeA) and play a key role in stress regulation. Here, we used chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), a clinically relevant model of psychosocial stress that produces robust maladaptive behaviors in rodents. We found that 10 days of CSDS cause a significant increase in PACAP levels selectively in the CeA of rats, as well as an increase in PAC1R mRNA. Using a viral vector strategy, we found that PAC1R knock-down in the CeA attenuates the CSDS-induced body weight loss and prevents the CSDS-induced increase in anxiety-like behavior. Notably, CSDS animals display reduced basal corticosterone (CORT) levels and PAC1R knock-down in CeA further reduce them. Finally, the CeA PAC1R knock-down blocks the increase in corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) immunoreactivity induced by CSDS in CeA. Our findings support the notion that the persistent activation of the PACAP-PAC1R system in the CeA mediates the behavioral outcomes of chronic psychosocial stress independently of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, perhaps via the recruitment of the CRF system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Abstinence-Dependent Effects of Long-Access Cocaine Self-Administration on Nucleus Accumbens Astrocytes Are Observed in Male, But Not Female, Rats</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Accumulating evidence indicates significant consequences for astrocytes associated with drug abuse. For example, reductions in structural features and synaptic colocalization of male rat nucleus accumbens (NAc) astrocytes are observed following short-access (ShA; 2 h/d) self-administration and extinction from cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin. However, it is unknown whether these observations extend to other rodent models of drug abuse, how enduring these effects may be, and whether similar effects are observed in female rats. Here, we assess the effects of long-access (LgA; 6 h/d) cocaine self-administration and abstinence on NAc astrocytes separately in male and female rats, employing a commonly used behavioral approach to investigate the incubation of cocaine craving. NAc astrocytes from male rats exhibit extensive (~40%) reductions in surface area, volume, and postsynaptic colocalization 45 d but not 24 h after the last self-administration session. In contrast, no effect of self-administration and abstinence was observed in astrocytes from female rats. Moreover, no effect of LgA self-administration and abstinence was observed on NAc GLT-1 expression in female rats, an effect that has been well described in males. These results indicate striking and sexually dimorphic effects of abstinence subsequent to LgA self-administration on astrocytes. Taken together, these results indicate a pivotal role of prolonged abstinence in the effects of cocaine self-administration on NAc astrocytes, and extend a growing body of evidence regarding sex differences in the cellular consequences of drug self-administration in the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">p140Cap Regulates the Composition and Localization of the NMDAR Complex in Synaptic Lipid Rafts</a></h4>

              
                <p>The NMDARs are key players in both physiological and pathologic synaptic plasticity because of their involvement in many aspects of neuronal transmission as well as learning and memory. The contribution in these events of different types of GluN2A-interacting proteins is still unclear. The p140Cap scaffold protein acts as a hub for postsynaptic complexes relevant to psychiatric and neurologic disorders and regulates synaptic functions, such as the stabilization of mature dendritic spine, memory consolidation, LTP, and LTD. Here we demonstrate that p140Cap directly binds the GluN2A subunit of NMDAR and modulates GluN2A-associated molecular network. Indeed, in p140Cap KO male mice, GluN2A is less associated with PSD95 both in <I>ex vivo</I> synaptosomes and in cultured hippocampal neurons, and p140Cap expression in KO neurons can rescue GluN2A and PSD95 colocalization. p140Cap is crucial in the recruitment of GluN2A-containing NMDARs and, consequently, in regulating NMDARs' intrinsic properties. p140Cap is associated to synaptic lipid-raft (LR) and to soluble postsynaptic membranes, and GluN2A and PSD95 are less recruited into synaptic LR of p140Cap KO male mice. Gated-stimulated emission depletion microscopy on hippocampal neurons confirmed that p140Cap is required for embedding GluN2A clusters in LR in an activity-dependent fashion. In the synaptic compartment, p140Cap influences the association between GluN2A and PSD95 and modulates GluN2A enrichment into LR. Overall, such increase in these membrane domains rich in signaling molecules results in improved signal transduction efficiency.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Here we originally show that the adaptor protein p140Cap directly binds the GluN2A subunit of NMDAR and modulates the GluN2A-associated molecular network. Moreover, we show, for the first time, that p140Cap also associates to synaptic lipid rafts and controls the selective recruitment of GluN2A and PSD95 to this specific compartment. Finally, gated-stimulated emission depletion microscopy on hippocampal neurons confirmed that p140Cap is required for embedding GluN2A clusters in lipid rafts in an activity-dependent fashion. Overall, our findings provide the molecular and functional dissection of p140Cap as a new active member of a highly dynamic synaptic network involved in memory consolidation, LTP, and LTD, which are known to be altered in neurologic and psychiatric disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Afferent Loss, GABA, and Central Gain in Older Adults: Associations with Speech Recognition in Noise</a></h4>

              
                <p>Deficits in auditory nerve (AN) function for older adults reduce afferent input to the cortex. The extent to which the cortex in older adults adapts to this loss of afferent input and the mechanisms underlying this adaptation are not well understood. We took a neural systems approach measuring AN and cortical evoked responses within 50 older and 27 younger human adults (59 female) to estimate central gain or increased cortical activity despite reduced AN activity. Relative to younger adults, older adults' AN response amplitudes were smaller, but cortical responses were not. We used the relationship between AN and cortical response amplitudes in younger adults to predict cortical response amplitudes for older adults from their AN responses. Central gain in older adults was thus defined as the difference between their observed cortical responses and those predicted from the parameter estimates of younger adults. In older adults, decreased afferent input contributed to lower cortical GABA levels, greater central gain, and poorer speech recognition in noise (SIN). These effects on SIN occur in addition to, and independent from, effects attributed to elevated hearing thresholds. Our results are consistent with animal models of central gain and suggest that reduced AN afferent input in some older adults may result in changes in cortical encoding and inhibitory neurotransmission, which contribute to reduced SIN. An advancement in our understanding of the changes that occur throughout the auditory system in response to the gradual loss of input with increasing age may provide potential therapeutic targets for intervention.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Age-related hearing loss is one of the most common chronic conditions of aging, yet little is known about how the cortex adapts to this loss of sensory input. We measured AN and cortical responses to the same stimulus in younger and older adults. In older adults we found hyperexcitability in cortical activity relative to concomitant declines in afferent input that are consistent with central gain. Lower levels of cortical GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, were associated with greater central gain, which predicted poorer SIN. The results suggest that the cortex in older adults may adapt to attenuated sensory input by reducing inhibition to amplify the cortical response, but this amplification may lead to poorer SIN.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Layer-Specific Developmentally Precise Axon Targeting of Transient Suppressed-by-Contrast Retinal Ganglion Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>The mouse retina encodes diverse visual features in the spike trains of &gt;40 retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types. Each RGC type innervates a specific subset of the &gt;50 retinorecipient brain areas. Our catalog of RGC types and feature representations is nearing completion. Yet, we know little about where specific RGC types send their information. Furthermore, the developmental strategies by which RGC axons choose their targets and pattern their terminal arbors remain obscure. Here, we identify a genetic intersection (<I>Cck-Cre</I> and <I>Brn3c<sup>CKOAP</sup></I>) that selectively labels transient Suppressed-by-Contrast (tSbC) RGCs, a member of an evolutionarily conserved functionally mysterious RGC subclass. We find that tSbC RGCs selectively innervate the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and ventrolateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN) of the thalamus, the superior colliculus (SC), and the nucleus of the optic tract (NOT) in mice of either sex. They binocularly innervate dLGN and vLGN but project only contralaterally to SC and NOT. In each target, tSbC RGC axons occupy a specific sublayer, suggesting that they restrict their input to specific circuits. The tSbC RGC axons span the length of the optic tract by birth and remain poised there until they simultaneously innervate their four targets around postnatal day 3. The tSbC RGC axons choose the right targets and establish mature stratification patterns from the outset. This precision is maintained in the absence of Brn3c. Our results provide the first map of SbC inputs to the brain, revealing a narrow target set, unexpected laminar organization, target-specific binocularity, and developmental precision.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In recent years, we have learned a lot about the visual features encoded by RGCs, the output neurons of the eye. In contrast, we know little about where RGCs send their information and how RGC axons, which carry this information, target specific brain areas during development. Here, we develop an intersectional strategy to label a unique RGC type, the tSbC RGC, and map its projections. We find that tSbC RGC axons are highly selective. They innervate few retinal targets and restrict their arbors to specific sublayers within these targets. The selective tSbC RGC projection patterns develop synchronously and without trial and error, suggesting molecular determinism and coordination.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Enhancement of Hippocampal-Thalamocortical Temporal Coordination during Slow-Frequency Long-Duration Anterior Thalamic Spindles</a></h4>

              
                <p>Temporal nesting of cortical slow oscillations, thalamic spindles, and hippocampal ripples indicates multiregional neuronal interactions required for memory consolidation. However, how the thalamic activity during spindles organizes hippocampal dynamics remains largely undetermined. We analyzed simultaneous recordings of anterodorsal thalamus and CA1 in male mice to determine the contribution of thalamic spindles in cross-regional synchronization. Our results indicated that temporal hippocampo-thalamocortical coupling was more enhanced during slower and longer thalamic spindles. Additionally, spindles occurring closer to slow oscillation trough were more strongly coupled to ripples. We found that the temporal association between CA1 spiking/ripples and thalamic spindles was stronger following spatial exploration compared with baseline sleep. We further developed a hippocampal-thalamocortical model to explain the mechanism underlying the duration and frequency-dependent coupling of thalamic spindles to hippocampal activity. Our findings shed light on our understanding of the functional role of thalamic activity during spindles on multiregional information transfer.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The contribution of thalamic spindles with differential properties to cross-regional synchronization and information transfer still remains poorly understood. Using simultaneous anterodorsal thalamic and hippocampal recordings from naturally sleeping mice before and after exploration, we found strong coupling of CA1 units to anterodorsal thalamic spindles and increase of this coupling following spatial experience. We further showed that the temporal coupling of CA1 units and hippocampal ripples with thalamic spindles and the spindle-associated modulation of CA1 units with ripples were stronger for spindles with slower frequency of oscillations. Our experimental as well as computational findings using a hippocampal-thalamocortical model provide the first demonstration that spindle frequency and duration can provide valuable information about the underlying multiregional interactions essential for memory consolidation computations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Oscillatory Population-Level Activity of Dorsal Raphe Serotonergic Neurons Is Inscribed in Sleep Structure</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dorsal raphe (DR) 5-HT neurons regulate sleep&ndash;wake transitions. Previous studies demonstrated that single-unit activity of DR 5-HT neurons is high during wakefulness, decreases during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and ceases during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. However, characteristics of the population-level activity of DR 5-HT neurons, which influence the entire brain, are largely unknown. Here, we measured population activities of 5-HT neurons in the male and female mouse DR across the sleep&ndash;wake cycle by ratiometric fiber photometry. We found a slow oscillatory activity of compound intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals during NREM sleep. The trough of the concave 5-HT activity increased across sleep progression, but 5-HT activity always returned to that seen during the wake period. When the trough reached a minimum and remained there, REM sleep was initiated. We also found a unique coupling of the oscillatory 5-HT activity and wideband EEG power fluctuation. Furthermore, optogenetic activation of 5-HT neurons during NREM sleep triggered a high EMG power and induced wakefulness, demonstrating a causal role of 5-HT neuron activation. Optogenetic inhibition induced REM sleep or sustained NREM, with an EEG power increase and EEG fluctuation, and pharmacological silencing of 5-HT activity using a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor led to sustained NREM, with an EEG power decrease and EEG fluctuation. These inhibitory manipulations supported the association between oscillatory 5-HT activity and EEG fluctuation. We propose that NREM sleep is not a monotonous state, but rather it contains dynamic changes that coincide with the oscillatory population-level activity of DR 5-HT neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previous studies have demonstrated single-cell 5-HT neuronal activity across sleep&ndash;wake conditions. However, population-level activities of these neurons are not well understood. We monitored DR 5-HT population activity using a fiber photometry system in mice and found that activity was highest during wakefulness and lowest during REM sleep. Surprisingly, during non-REM sleep, the 5-HT population activity decreased with an oscillatory pattern, coinciding with EEG fluctuations. EEG fluctuations persisted when DR 5-HT neuron activity was silenced by either optogenetic or pharmacological interventions during non-REM sleep, suggesting an association between the two. Although oscillatory DR 5-HT neuron activity did not generate EEG fluctuations, it provides evidence that non-REM sleep exhibits at least binary states.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Non-Neural Factors Influencing BOLD Response Magnitudes within Individual Subjects</a></h4>

              
                <p>To what extent is the size of the BOLD response influenced by factors other than neural activity? In a reanalysis of three neuroimaging datasets (male and female human participants), we find large systematic inhomogeneities in the BOLD response magnitude in primary visual cortex (V1): stimulus-evoked BOLD responses, expressed in units of percent signal change, are up to 50% larger along the representation of the horizontal meridian than the vertical meridian. To assess whether this surprising effect can be interpreted as differences in local neural activity, we quantified several factors that potentially contribute to the size of the BOLD response. We find relationships between BOLD response magnitude and cortical thickness, curvature, depth, and macrovasculature. These relationships are consistently found across subjects and datasets and suggest that variation in BOLD response magnitudes across cortical locations reflects, in part, differences in anatomy and vascularization. To compensate for these factors, we implement a regression-based correction method and show that, after correction, BOLD responses become more homogeneous across V1. The correction reduces the horizontal/vertical difference by about half, indicating that some of the difference is likely not because of neural activity differences. We conclude that interpretation of variation in BOLD response magnitude across cortical locations should consider the influence of the potential confounding factors of thickness, curvature, depth, and vascularization.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The magnitude of the BOLD signal is often used as a surrogate of neural activity, but the exact factors that contribute to its strength have not been studied on a voxel-wise level. Here, we examined several anatomical and measurement-related factors to assess their relationship with BOLD signal magnitude. We find that BOLD magnitude correlates with cortical anatomy, depth, and macrovasculature. To remove the contribution of these factors, we propose a simple, data-driven correction method that can be used in any fMRI experiment. After accounting for the confounding factors, BOLD magnitude becomes more spatially homogeneous. Our correction method improves the ability to make more accurate inferences about local neural activity from fMRI data.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Two Types of Motor Inhibition after Action Errors in Humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>Adaptive behavior requires the ability to appropriately react to action errors. Post-error slowing (PES) of response times is one of the most reliable phenomena in human behavior. It has been proposed that PES is partially achieved through inhibition of the motor system. However, there is no direct evidence for this link, or indeed, that the motor system is physiologically inhibited after errors altogether. Here, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation and electromyography to measure corticospinal excitability (CSE) across four experiments using a Simon task, in which female and male human participants sometimes committed errors. Errors were followed by reduced CSE at two different time points and in two different modes. Shortly after error commission (250 ms), CSE was broadly suppressed (i.e., even task-unrelated motor effectors were inhibited). During the preparation of the subsequent response, CSE was specifically reduced at task-relevant effectors only. This latter effect was directly related to PES, with stronger CSE suppression accompanying greater PES. This suggests that PES is achieved through increased inhibitory control during post-error responses. To provide converging evidence, we then reanalyzed an openly available EEG dataset that contained both Simon- and Stop-signal tasks using independent component analysis. We found that the same neural source component that indexed action cancellation in the stop-signal task also showed clear PES-related activity during post-error responses in the Simon task. Together, these findings provide evidence that post-error adaptation is partially achieved through motor inhibition. Moreover, inhibition is engaged in two modes (first nonselective, then selective), aligning with recent multistage theories of error processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is a common observation that humans implement a higher degree of caution when repeating an action during which they just committed a mistake. In the laboratory, such increased "caution" is reflected in post-error slowing of response latencies. Many competing theories exist regarding the precise neural mechanisms underlying post-error slowing. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, we show that, after error commission, the human corticomotor system is momentarily inhibited, both immediately after an error and during the preparation of the next action. Moreover, motor inhibition during the latter time period is directly predictive of post-error slowing. This shows that inhibitory control is a key mechanism humans engage to regulate their own behavior in the aftermath of error commission.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamics of Hierarchical Task Representations</a></h4>

              
                <p>Task representations are critical for cognitive control and adaptive behavior. The hierarchical organization of task representations allows humans to maintain goals, integrate information across varying contexts, and select potential responses. In this study we characterized the structure and interactive dynamics of task representations that facilitate cognitive control. Human participants (both males and females) performed a hierarchical task that required them to select a response rule while considering the contingencies from different contextual inputs. By applying time- and frequency-resolved representational similarity analysis to human electroencephalography data, we characterized properties of task representations that are otherwise difficult to observe. We found that participants formed multiple representations of task-relevant contexts and features from the presented stimuli, beyond simple stimulus&ndash;response mappings. These disparate representations were hierarchically structured, with higher-order contextual representations dominantly influencing subordinate representations of task features and response rules. Furthermore, this cascade of top-down interactions facilitated faster responses. Our results describe key properties of task representations that support hierarchical cognitive control.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Humans can adjust their actions in response to contingencies imposed by the environment. Although it has long been hypothesized that this ability depends on mental representations of tasks, the neural dynamics of task representations have been difficult to characterize. Our study used electroencephalography data from human participants to demonstrate the neural organization and interactive dynamics of task representations. Our results revealed a top-down, hierarchically organized representational structure that encoded multiple contexts and features from the environment. To support cognitive control, higher-level contextual representations influenced subordinate representations of task-relevant features and potential responses, facilitating response selection in a context-dependent manner. Our results provide direct evidence of organizational properties of task representations, which are cornerstones of cognitive control theories.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Alpha Oscillations Track Content-Specific Working Memory Capacity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Although the neural basis of working memory (WM) capacity is often studied by exploiting interindividual differences, capacity may also differ across memory materials within a given individual. Here, we exploit the content dependence of WM capacity as a novel approach to investigate the oscillatory correlates of WM capacity, focusing on posterior 9&ndash;12 Hz alpha activity during retention. We recorded scalp electroencephalography (EEG) while male and female human participants performed WM tasks with varying memory loads (two vs. four items) and materials (English letters vs. regular shapes vs. abstract shapes). First, behavioral data confirmed that memory capacity was fundamentally content dependent; capacity for abstract shapes plateaued at around two, whereas the participants could remember more letters and regular shapes. Critically, content-specific capacity was paralleled in the degree of attenuation of EEG-alpha activity that plateaued in a similar content-specific manner. Although we observed greater alpha attenuation for higher loads for all materials, we found larger load effects for letters and regular shapes than for abstract shapes, which is consistent with our behavioral data showing a lower capacity plateau for abstract shapes. Moreover, when only considering two-item trials, alpha attenuation was greater for abstract shapes where two items were close to the capacity plateau than for other materials. Multivariate decoding of alpha activity patterns reinforced these findings. Finally, for each material, load effects on capacity (<I>K</I>) and alpha attenuation were correlated across individuals. Our results demonstrate that alpha oscillations track memory capacity in a content-specific manner and track not just the number of items but also their complexity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> WM is limited in its capacity. We show that capacity is not fixed for an individual but is rather memory-content dependent. Moreover, we used this as a novel approach to investigate the neural basis of WM capacity with EEG. We found that both behavioral capacity estimates and neural oscillations in the alpha band varied with memory loads and materials. The critical finding is a capacity plateau of approximately two items only for the more complex materials, accompanied by a similar plateau in the EEG alpha attenuation. The load effects on capacity and alpha attenuation were furthermore correlated across individuals for each of the materials. Our results demonstrate that alpha oscillations track the content-specific nature of WM capacity.</p>

                <p>Fragile X Syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder and the most common monogenic cause of intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, and anxiety disorders. Loss of fragile x mental retardation protein results in disruptions of synaptic development during a critical period of circuit formation in the BLA. However, it is unknown how these alterations impact microcircuit development and function. Using a combination of electrophysiologic and behavioral approaches in both male (<I>Fmr1</I>-/y) and female (<I>Fmr1</I>&ndash;/&ndash;) mice, we demonstrate that principal neurons in the <I>Fmr1</I>KO BLA exhibit hyperexcitability during a sensitive period in amygdala development. This hyperexcitability contributes to increased excitatory gain in fear-learning circuits. Further, synaptic plasticity is enhanced in the BLA of <I>Fmr1</I>KO mice. Behavioral correlation demonstrates that fear-learning emerges precociously in the <I>Fmr1</I>KO mouse. Early life 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo [5,4-c]pyridin-3ol intervention ameliorates fear-learning in <I>Fmr1KO</I> mice. These results suggest that critical period plasticity in the amygdala of the <I>Fmr1</I>KO mouse may be shifted to earlier developmental time points.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In these studies, we identify early developmental alterations in principal neurons in the Fragile X syndrome BLA. We show that, as early as P14, excitability and feedforward excitation, and synaptic plasticity are enhanced in Fmr1KO lateral amygdala. This correlates with precocious emergence of fear-learning in the <I>Fmr1</I>KO mouse. Early life 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo [5,4-c]pyridin-3ol intervention restores critical period plasticity in WT mice and ameliorates fear-learning in the <I>Fmr1</I>KO mouse.</p>

                <p>Conversion of astroglia into functional neurons has been considered a promising therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies reported that downregulation of the RNA binding protein, polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1), converts astrocytes into neurons <I>in situ</I> in multiple mouse brain regions, consequently improving pathologic phenotypes associated with Parkinson's disease, RGC loss, and aging. Here, we demonstrate that PTBP1 downregulation using an astrocyte-specific AAV-mediated shRNA system fails to convert hippocampal astrocytes into neurons in both male and female wild-type (WT) and &beta;-amyloid (5<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT>FAD) and tau (PS19) Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models and fails to reverse synaptic/cognitive deficits and AD-associated pathology in male mice. Similarly, PTBP1 downregulation cannot convert astrocytes into neurons in the striatum and substantia nigra in both male and female WT mice. Together, our study suggests that cell fate conversion strategy for neurodegenerative disease therapy through manipulating one single gene, such as PTBP1, warrants more rigorous scrutiny.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our results do not support some of the recent extraordinary and revolutionary claims that resident astrocytes can be directly and efficiently converted into neurons. Our study is critical for the field of neural regeneration and degeneration. In addition, our study is financially important because it may prevent other researchers/organizations from wasting a vast amount of time and resources on relevant investigations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Tripartite Crosstalk between Cytokine IL-1{beta}, NMDA-R and Misplaced Mitochondrial Anchor in Neuronal Dendrites Is a Novel Pathway for Neurodegeneration in Inflammatory Diseases</a></h4>

              
                <p>The mitochondrial anchor syntaphilin (SNPH) is a key mitochondrial protein normally expressed in axons to maintain neuronal health by positioning mitochondria along axons for metabolic needs. However, in 2019 we discovered a novel form of excitotoxicity that results when SNPH is misplaced into neuronal dendrites in disease models. A key unanswered question about this SNPH excitotoxicity is the pathologic molecules that trigger misplacement or intrusion of SNPH into dendrites. Here, we identified two different classes of pathologic molecules that interact to trigger dendritic SNPH intrusion. Using primary hippocampal neuronal cultures from mice of either sex, we demonstrated that the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1&beta; interacts with NMDA to trigger SNPH intrusion into dendrites. First, IL-1&beta; and NMDA each individually triggers dendritic SNPH intrusion. Second, IL-1&beta; and NMDA do not act independently but interact. Thus, blocking NMDAR by the antagonist MK-801 blocks IL-1&beta; from triggering dendritic SNPH intrusion. Further, decoupling the known interaction between IL-1&beta; and NMDAR by tyrosine inhibitors prevents either IL-1&beta; or NMDA from triggering dendritic SNPH intrusion. Third, neuronal toxicity caused by IL-1&beta; or NMDA is strongly ameliorated in SNPH<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> neurons. Together, we hypothesize that the known bipartite IL-1&beta;/NMDAR crosstalk converges to trigger misplacement of SNPH in dendrites as a final common pathway to cause neurodegeneration. Targeting dendritic SNPH in this novel tripartite IL-1&beta;/NMDAR/SNPH interaction could be a strategic downstream locus for ameliorating neurotoxicity in inflammatory diseases.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> SNPH is a key mitochondrial protein normally expressed specifically in healthy axons to help position mitochondria along axons to match metabolic needs. In 2019 we discovered that misplacement of SNPH into neuronal dendrites causes a novel form of excitotoxicity in rodent models of multiple sclerosis. A key unanswered question about this new form of dendritic SNPH toxicity concerns pathologic molecules that trigger toxic misplacement of SNPH into dendrites. Here, we identified two major categories of pathologic molecules, the pro-inflammatory cytokines and NMDA, that interact and converge to trigger toxic misplacement of SNPH into dendrites. We propose that a dendritic mitochondrial anchor provides a novel, single common target for ameliorating diverse inflammatory and excitatory injuries in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Improving the predictive power of xenograft and syngeneic anti-tumour studies using mice humanised for pathways of drug metabolism [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Drug development is an expensive and time-consuming process, with only a small fraction of drugs gaining regulatory approval from the often many thousands of candidates identified during target validation. Once a lead compound has been identified and optimised, they are subject to intensive pre-clinical research to determine their pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties, procedures which inevitably involve significant numbers of animals - mainly mice and rats, but also dogs and monkeys in much smaller numbers and for specific types of drug candidates. Many compounds that emerge from this process, having been shown to be safe and efficacious in pre-clinical studies, subsequently fail to replicate this outcome in clinical trials, therefore wasting time, money and, most importantly, animals. The poor predictive power of animal models in pre-clinical studies is predominantly due to lack of efficacy or safety reasons, which in turn can be attributed mainly to the significant species differences in drug metabolism between humans and animals. To circumvent this, we have developed a complex transgenic mouse model – 8HUM - which faithfully replicates human Phase I drug metabolism (and its regulation), and which will generate more human-relevant data [REFINEMENT] from fewer animals [REDUCTION] in a pre-clinical setting and reduce attrition in the clinic. One key area for the pre-clinical application of animals in an oncology setting – almost exclusively mice - is their use in anti-tumour studies. We now further demonstrate the utility of the 8HUM mouse using a murine melanoma cell line as a syngeneic tumour and also present an immunodeficient version 8HUM_Rag2-/- - for use in xenograft studies. These models will be of significant benefit not only to Pharma for pre-clinical drug development work, but also throughout the drug efficacy, toxicology, pharmacology, and drug metabolism communities, where fewer animals will be needed to generate more human-relevant data.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Predictors of face mask use during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia: Application of the health belief model, psychological distress and health motivation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: High infection rates of COVID-19 in Indonesia require attention, especially transmission and prevention behaviors. One way to lower infection rates is the use of face masks. However, people's adherence to its usage when in public is still low. This necessitates the exploration of predictors of the use of masks to increase community compliance. This study further aims to investigate the predictors of face mask use by applying the Health Belief Model, anxiety, stress, depression, and health motivation. Methods: A total of 255 respondents from Jakarta, Bandung, Tangerang, and Banten filled out an online questionnaire. Furthermore, hierarchical multiple regression was used to detect predictors associated with face mask use. Results: The results showed that the high perceived benefits and health motivation were higher in individuals who used a face mask when in public, while those who have high perceived barriers likely do not use masks. The respondent's level of psychological distress, including depression, anxiety, and stress were not associated with face mask use. Conclusions: Therefore, these findings highlight the importance of personal appraisal regarding COVID-19 and its prevention behaviors. Comfortable mask design, and emphasizing the benefits of using masks in the community improve compliance.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Focal leptomeningeal disease, atypical cancer of unknown primary site [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Leptomeningeal metastasis is an infrequent form of cancer expression, and it has a poor prognosis due to its torpid evolution and its challenging diagnosis. Case report: We report the case of a 68-year-old woman with rapidly progressing cognitive decline and focal epilepsy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive gyriform hypersignal in the right precentral sulcus region, without mass effect, tenuous contrast uptake, and hydrocephalus with transependymal edema. The body tomographic study was negative for solid cancer and the 18F-FDG PET-CT revealed a severe hypermetabolism in the right lung upper lobe. These findings were suggestive of lung cancer with leptomeningeal metastasis. We performed a brain biopsy, finding atypical cells in the leptomeningeal region with positive immunohistochemical staining for CK7 and negative for CK20 corresponding to lung adenocarcinoma. The patient was evaluated in the oncology service and scheduled for radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Conclusions: Focal leptomeningeal disease is an entity that should be considered as a differential diagnosis in all cases of focal leptomeningitis. Timely diagnosis and adequate cancer management can increase patient survival.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Liability of Artificial Intelligence's Moral Dilemma [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents the fundamentals of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Its advancement in technology has brought benefit to mankind over the years, which helps to amplify our daily lives in numerous ways. Among the technologies that have been innovated utilizing AI are Artificial Intelligence Lawyers (AI Lawyers), autonomous vehicles, AI judges, augmented drafting services and delivery drones. Although AI has brought many advancements in our lives, concerns are raised with regards to the moral implication of AI. This study aims to examine the situation wherein tools which incorporate AI would have to face a moral dilemma situation, or situations where AI had acted beyond what was instructed or programmed by the manufacturers. Thus, this work discusses whether the torts theory of liability on negligence is applicable in such a context. Methods: The methodology involved a doctrinal research in analysing the legal rules and existing studies in relation to AI and the negligence principle to develop a critical analysis of the literature. Besides, this research finds the application of principle negligence adopted in other countries, particularly in the United States, since it has employed AI much earlier compared to other countries. Results: The findings suggest that the question of the liability of AI is still at its infancy, as policy makers or regulators have yet to decide the liability of AI. However, the findings also suggest that theories of liabilities such as product liability and strict liability are possible to adduce liability on AI, so long as AI could be defined as a product. The research limitation is the scarcity amount of related studies available in the literature. The motivation of this work is in the importance to determine whether advanced AI may be liable for ‘moral decisions’ that cause damage to the victim under the principle of negligence.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Inflammatory cytokines affecting cardiovascular function: a scoping review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A chronic inflammatory process can cause disorders on the cardiovascular system. It is caused by an enhancement of inflammatory cytokines that can decrease the heart working-function. This article aims to review inflammatory cytokines that can cause the cardiovascular system disease. Methods: The review process began by taking articles from two databases, namely PubMed and SpringerLink without using the publication year limit. The reviewed article was a research article using human samples, which analyzed the impact of inflammatory cytokines on cardiovascular disease or the risk level of cardiovascular disease. Result: From a total of 3926 articles originating from two databases, 21 obtained articles have matched with the inclusion criteria for the review process. Of those 21 articles, 17 reported an increased effect of inflammatory cytokines on cardiovascular disease, while four articles showed no association between increased inflammatory cytokines and cardiovascular disease. There were six inflammatory cytokines that could affect cardiovascular disease, namely: TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-17 where cytokine IL-6 is confirmed by as many as 14 articles, TNF-α as many as six articles, and IL-1 β as many as three articles as inflammatory cytokines that could affect cardiovascular function. Conclusion: The increased level of inflammatory cytokines can be a trigger for decreased function and cause the disease in the cardiovascular system.

                The taxon Elasmobranchii (sharks and rays) contains one of the long-established evolutionary lineages of vertebrates with a tantalizing collection of species occupying critical aquatic habitats. To overcome the current limitation in molecular resources, we launched the Squalomix Consortium in 2020 to promote a genome-wide array of molecular approaches, specifically targeting shark and ray species. Among the various bottlenecks in working with elasmobranchs are their elusiveness and low fecundity as well as the large and highly repetitive genomes. Their peculiar body fluid composition has also hindered the establishment of methods to perform routine cell culturing required for their karyotyping. In the Squalomix consortium, these obstacles are expected to be solved through a combination of in-house cytological techniques including karyotyping of cultured cells, chromatin preparation for Hi-C data acquisition, and high fidelity long-read sequencing. The resources and products obtained in this consortium, including genome and transcriptome sequences, a genome browser powered by JBrowse2 to visualize sequence alignments, and comprehensive matrices of gene expression profiles for selected species are accessible through https://github.com/Squalomix/info.

                Background: Breast milk is a critical element in developing a baby's immunity through immune transfer. Antibodies are an essential unit of immunity against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This paper explores antibodies in breast milk in postpartum women who have been vaccinated or exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Duration of antibody appearance was studied to determine the adequate time in transferring antibodies by breastfeeding. Methods: Three databases, PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect, were used as sources of articles. Inclusion criteria applied in selecting articles were prospective observational study or experimental design study in English, evaluating antibodies in breast milk, and conducted between 2019–2021. Article quality and risk of bias were assessed with Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). The data found were synthesized in a narrative manner. Results: This systematic review included 20 articles. A total of 306 postpartum women who were infected with COVID-19, 20 postpartum women who had viral symptoms and 495 postpartum women who had been vaccinated were studied. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were found in the breast milk of infected and vaccinated postpartum women. SARS CoV-2 infection is associated with the presence of IgA dominant, whereas vaccination is related to the presence of IgG dominant. Antibodies persisted from day 10 of onset to 10 months in infected postpartum women and started from three days to six weeks in vaccinated postpartum women. Meta-analysis could not be carried out due to the variety of articles. Conclusions: Antibodies found in breast milk in infected and vaccinated postpartum women have different dominant types. Further research needs to be done regarding the mechanism of antibody transfer in breast milk, longer research duration and studies that directly examine the comparison of antibodies in breast milk in vaccinated and infected postpartum women. Registration: PROSPERO (CRD42022340859, 23 June 2022).

                A recent modelling paper on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in the US (Bartsch et al.) suggested that maintaining face mask use until a high vaccine coverage (70–90%) is achieved is generally cost-effective or even cost-saving in many of the scenarios considered. Their conclusion was based on the assumed effectiveness of continued face mask use, cited from a study that reported an 18% reduction in the effective reproduction number associated with the introduction of state-level mask mandate policies in the US in the summer of 2020. However, using this value implicitly assumes that the effect of face mask use in 2021 through 2022 is the same as that of summer 2020, when stringent nonpharmaceutical interventions were in place. The effectiveness of universal mask wearing in 2021–2022 is probably more uncertain than considered in Bartsch et al. and rigorous sensitivity analysis on this parameter is warranted.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">GenOtoScope: Towards automating ACMG classification of variants associated with congenital hearing loss</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Damianos P. Melidis, Christian Landgraf, Gunnar Schmidt, Anja Schöner-Heinisch, Sandra von Hardenberg, Anke Lesinski-Schiedat, Wolfgang Nejdl, Bernd Auber</p>

Since next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become widely available, large gene panels containing up to several hundred genes can be sequenced cost-efficiently. However, the interpretation of the often large numbers of sequence variants detected when using NGS is laborious, prone to errors and is often difficult to compare across laboratories. To overcome this challenge, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) have introduced standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequencing variants. Additionally, disease-specific refinements have been developed that include accurate thresholds for many criteria, enabling highly automated processing. This is of particular interest for common but heterogeneous disorders such as hearing impairment. With more than 200 genes associated with hearing disorders, the manual inspection of possible causative variants is particularly difficult and time-consuming.
To this end, we developed the open-source bioinformatics tool GenOtoScope, which automates the analysis of all ACMG/AMP criteria that can be assessed without further individual patient information or human curator investigation, including the refined loss of function criterion (“PVS1”). Two types of interfaces are provided: (i) a command line application to classify sequence variants in batches for a set of patients and (ii) a user-friendly website to classify single variants.
We compared the performance of our tool with two other variant classification tools using two hearing loss data sets, which were manually annotated either by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Gene Curation Expert Panel or the diagnostics unit of our human genetics department. GenOtoScope achieved the best average accuracy and precision for both data sets. Compared to the second-best tool, GenOtoScope improved the accuracy metric by 25.75% and 4.57% and precision metric by 52.11% and 12.13% on the two data sets, respectively. The web interface is accessible via: http://genotoscope.mh-hannover.de:5000 and the command line interface via: https://github.com/damianosmel/GenOtoScope.

Understanding how animals display diverse and complex behaviours remains a central question in biology. A new study in PLOS Biology suggests that the emergence of clusters of parvalbumin neurons in the forebrain could reflect a convergent mechanism underlying the evolution of skilled behaviours in birds.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The primary familial brain calcification-associated protein MYORG is an α-galactosidase with restricted substrate specificity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Richard W. Meek, Jacob Brockerman, Osei B. Fordwour, Wesley F. Zandberg, Gideon J. Davies, David J. Vocadlo</p>

Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is characterised by abnormal deposits of calcium phosphate within various regions of the brain that are associated with severe cognitive impairments, psychiatric conditions, and movement disorders. Recent studies in diverse populations have shown a link between mutations in myogenesis-regulating glycosidase (MYORG) and the development of this disease. MYORG is a member of glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 31 (GH31) and, like the other mammalian GH31 enzyme α-glucosidase II, this enzyme is found in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Though presumed to act as an α-glucosidase due to its localization and sequence relatedness to α-glucosidase II, MYORG has never been shown to exhibit catalytic activity. Here, we show that MYORG is an α-galactosidase and present the high-resolution crystal structure of MYORG in complex with substrate and inhibitor. Using these structures, we map detrimental mutations that are associated with MYORG-associated brain calcification and define how these mutations may drive disease progression through loss of enzymatic activity. Finally, we also detail the thermal stabilisation of MYORG afforded by a clinically approved small molecule ligand, opening the possibility of using pharmacological chaperones to enhance the activity of mutant forms of MYORG.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Identification of prognostic biomarkers of invasive ductal carcinoma by an integrated bioinformatics approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common breast cancer worldwide. Nowadays, due to IDC heterogeneity and its high capacity for metastasis, it is necessary to discover novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Thus, this study aimed to identify new prognostic genes of IDC using an integrated bioinformatics approach. Methods: Using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we downloaded publicly available data of the whole-genome mRNA expression profile from the first three stages of IDC in two expression profiling datasets, GSE29044 and GSE32291; intra-group data repeatability tests were conducted using Pearson’s correlation test, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the online tool GEO2R, followed by the construction of a protein‑protein interaction network (PPI-net) with the common DEGs identified in the three analyzed stages using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database and Cytoscape software, from these PPI-net we identify the hub genes (prognostic genes). Results: We found seven genes [WW domain-containing E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase 1 (WWP1), STIP1 homology and U-box containing protein 1 (STUB1), F-box and WD repeat domain containing 7 (FBXW7), kelch like family member 13 (KLHL13), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 Q1 (UBE2Q1), tripartite motif-containing 11 (TRIM11), and the beta-transducin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (BTRC)] as potential candidates for IDC prognostic biomarkers, which were mainly enriched in the Ubiquitin-specific protease activity, cytoskeletal protein binding, and ligase activity. The role of these genes in the pathophysiology of IDC is not yet well characterized, representing a way to improve our understanding of the process of tumorigenesis and the underlying molecular events of IDC. Conclusions: Genes identified may lead to the discovery of new prognostic targets and precise therapeutics for IDC.

     alt="Aversive memory reactivation: A possible role for delta oscillations in the hippocampus–amygdala circuit"/>
<p>While rats were retrieving a fear memory, changes in oscillatory patterns were observed in dorsal hippocampus and basolateral amygdala, favoring delta oscillations and their interaction with gamma oscillations, associated with increase in plasticity markers levels. Few differences were observed between controls (non-handled) and maternal separation rats.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Memory labilization, the process by which memories become susceptible to update, is essential for memory reconsolidation and has been a target for novel therapies for traumatic memory-associated disorders. Maternal separation (MS) in male rats produced memories resistant to labilization in adulthood. Based on previous results, we hypothesized that temporal desynchronization between the dorsal hippocampus (DHc) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA), during memory retrieval, could be responsible for this impairment. Our goal was to investigate possible differences in oscillatory activity and synchrony between the DHc and BLA during fear memory reactivation, between MS and non-handled (NH) rats. We used male adult Wistar rats, NH or MS, with electrodes for local field potential (LFP) recordings implanted in the DHc and BLA. Animals were submitted to aversive memory reactivation by exposure to the conditioned context (Reat) or to <i>pseudo</i>-reactivation in a neutral context (pReat), and LFP was recorded. Plasticity markers linked to reconsolidation were evaluated one hour after reactivation. The power of delta oscillations and DHc-BLA synchrony in Reat animals was increased, during freezing. Besides, delta modulation of gamma oscillations amplitude in the BLA was associated with the increase in DHc Zif268 levels, an immediate early gene specifically associated with reconsolidation. Concerning early life stress, we found lower power of delta and strength of delta-gamma oscillations coupling in MS rats, compared to NH, which could explain the low Zif268 levels in a subgroup of MS animals. These results suggest a role for delta oscillations in memory reactivation that should be further investigated.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Systemic metabolic alteration dependent on the thyroid‐liver axis in early PD</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by initial involvement of the olfactory bulb/amygdala or autonomic nerves followed by nigral degeneration. Although autonomic innervation strictly regulates multiorgan systems including endocrine functions, circulation, and digestion, how dysautonomia in PD affects systemic metabolism has not been identified. In this study, we tried to estimate the pathogenic linkage of PD by nuclear medicine techniques, trans-omic analysis of blood samples and cultured cell experiments.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Thyroid mediastinum ratio of MIBG scintigraphy was measured in 1158 PD patients. Furthermore, serum exosome miRNA transcriptome analysis and plasma metabolome analysis followed by trans-omic analysis were performed in <i>de novo</i> PD patients and age-matched healthy control persons. Additionally, thyroid hormone was administered to skeletal muscle and liver derived cells to evaluate the effect of hypothyroidism for these organs.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Sympathetic denervation of thyroid correlating with its cardiac denervation was confirmed in 1158 PD patients by <sup>123</sup>I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy. Among patients with drug-naïve PD, comprehensive metabolome analysis revealed decreased levels of thyroxine and insufficient fatty acid β-oxidation, which positively correlate with one another. Likewise, both plasma metabolome data and transcriptome data of circulating exosomal miRNAs, revealed specific enrichment of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARα) axis. Finally, association of thyroid hormone with PPARα-dependent β-oxidation regulation was confirmed by <i>in vitro</i> experiments.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest that interorgan communications between the thyroid and liver are disorganized in the early stage of PD, which would be a sensitive diagnostic biomarker for PD.</p>

                Canonically, axons are considered the output structures of neurons, relaying signals generated at the dendrites and soma. In this issue of Neuron, Kramer et al. challenge this notion by showing that dopaminergic axons can be depolarized directly by cholinergic interneurons and even generate action potentials independent of somatic activity.

                Nicotine has both rewarding and aversive effects. In this issue of Neuron, Liu et al. show that nicotine aversion depends on both desensitization of high-affinity nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) that activate midbrain dopamine neurons and activation of low-affinity nAChRs that inhibit dopamine neurons via the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT).

                Cortical responses are influenced by cognitive and behavioral states, but how these states modulate individual neurons is unknown. Kanamori and Mrsic-Flogel show that despite similar effects on neural responses, spatial attention and running act independently to modulate individual neurons in the primary visual cortex, suggesting separable mechanisms for their implementation.
