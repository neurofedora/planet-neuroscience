              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20580">Resonance Complexity Theory and the Architecture of Consciousness: A Field-Theoretic Model of Resonant Interference and Emergent Awareness</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.20580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Resonance Complexity Theory (RCT), which proposes that consciousness emerges from stable interference patterns of oscillatory neural activity. These patterns, shaped by recursive feedback and constructive interference, must exceed critical thresholds in complexity, coherence, gain, and fractal dimensionality to give rise to conscious experience. The resulting spatiotemporal attractors encode subjective awareness as dynamic resonance structures distributed across the neural field, enabling large-scale integration without symbolic representation or centralized control.
  To formalize this idea, we define the Complexity Index (CI), a composite metric that synthesizes four core properties of conscious systems: fractal dimensionality (D), signal gain (G), spatial coherence (C), and attractor dwell time (tau). These elements are combined multiplicatively to capture the emergence and persistence of structured, integrative neural states.
  To test the theory empirically, we developed a biologically inspired yet minimal neural field simulation composed of radial wave sources emitting across a continuous 2D space. The system exhibits recursive constructive interference, producing coherent, attractor-like excitation patterns without external input, regional coding, or imposed structure. These patterns meet the theoretical thresholds for CI and reflect the core dynamics predicted by RCT.
  The findings demonstrate that resonance-based attractors -- and by extension, consciousness-like dynamics -- can arise purely from the physics of wave interference. RCT thus offers a unified, dynamical framework for modeling awareness as an emergent property of organized complexity in oscillatory systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21304">Optimizing fMRI Data Acquisition for Decoding Natural Speech with Limited Participants</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.21304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate optimal strategies for decoding perceived natural speech from fMRI data acquired from a limited number of participants. Leveraging Lebel et al. (2023)'s dataset of 8 participants, we first demonstrate the effectiveness of training deep neural networks to predict LLM-derived text representations from fMRI activity. Then, in this data regime, we observe that multi-subject training does not improve decoding accuracy compared to single-subject approach. Furthermore, training on similar or different stimuli across subjects has a negligible effect on decoding accuracy. Finally, we find that our decoders better model syntactic than semantic features, and that stories containing sentences with complex syntax or rich semantic content are more challenging to decode. While our results demonstrate the benefits of having extensive data per participant (deep phenotyping), they suggest that leveraging multi-subject for natural speech decoding likely requires deeper phenotyping or a substantially larger cohort.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20378">Hyperbolic embedding of multilayer networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.20378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilayer networks offer a powerful framework for modeling complex systems across diverse domains, effectively capturing multiple types of connections and interdependent subsystems commonly found in real world scenarios. To analyze these networks, embedding techniques that project nodes into a lower-dimensional geometric space are essential. This paper introduces a novel hyperbolic embedding framework that advances the state of the art in multilayer network analysis. Our method, which supports heterogeneous node sets across networks and inter-layer connections, generates layer-specific hyperbolic embeddings, enabling detailed intra-layer analysis and inter-layer comparisons, while simultaneously preserving the global multilayer structure within hyperbolic space, a capability that sets it apart from existing approaches, which typically rely on independent embedding of layers. Through experiments on synthetic multilayer stochastic block models, we demonstrate that our approach effectively preserves community structure, even when layers consist of different node sets. When applied to real brain networks, the method successfully clusters disease-related brain regions from different patients, outperforming layer-independent approaches and highlighting its relevance for comparative analysis. Overall, this work provides a robust tool for multilayer network analysis, enhancing interpretability and offering new insights into the structure and function of complex systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20480">BrainStratify: Coarse-to-Fine Disentanglement of Intracranial Neural Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.20480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoding speech directly from neural activity is a central goal in brain-computer interface (BCI) research. In recent years, exciting advances have been made through the growing use of intracranial field potential recordings, such as stereo-ElectroEncephaloGraphy (sEEG) and ElectroCorticoGraphy (ECoG). These neural signals capture rich population-level activity but present key challenges: (i) task-relevant neural signals are sparsely distributed across sEEG electrodes, and (ii) they are often entangled with task-irrelevant neural signals in both sEEG and ECoG. To address these challenges, we introduce a unified Coarse-to-Fine neural disentanglement framework, BrainStratify, which includes (i) identifying functional groups through spatial-context-guided temporal-spatial modeling, and (ii) disentangling distinct neural dynamics within the target functional group using Decoupled Product Quantization (DPQ). We evaluate BrainStratify on two open-source sEEG datasets and one (epidural) ECoG dataset, spanning tasks like vocal production and speech perception. Extensive experiments show that BrainStratify, as a unified framework for decoding speech from intracranial neural signals, significantly outperforms previous decoding methods. Overall, by combining data-driven stratification with neuroscience-inspired modularity, BrainStratify offers a robust and interpretable solution for speech decoding from intracranial recordings.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17820">Hyperbolic embedding of brain networks can predict the surgery outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.17820v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epilepsy surgery, particularly for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), remains a vital treatment option for patients with drug-resistant seizures. However, accurately predicting surgical outcomes remains a significant challenge. This study introduces a novel biomarker derived from brain connectivity, analyzed using non-Euclidean network geometry, to predict the surgery outcome in TLE. Using structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 51 patients, we examined differences in structural connectivity networks associated to surgical outcomes. Our approach uniquely utilized hyperbolic embeddings of pre- and post-surgery brain networks, successfully distinguishing patients with favorable outcomes from those with poor outcomes. Notably, the method identified regions in the contralateral hemisphere relative to the epileptogenic zone, whose connectivity patterns emerged as a potential biomarker for favorable surgical outcomes. The prediction model achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87 and a balanced accuracy of 0.81. These results underscore the predictive capability of our model and its effectiveness in individual outcome forecasting based on structural network changes. Our findings highlight the value of non-Euclidean representation of brain networks in gaining deeper insights into connectivity alterations in epilepsy, and advancing personalized prediction of surgical outcomes in TLE.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18361">Task-Optimized Convolutional Recurrent Networks Align with Tactile Processing in the Rodent Brain</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.18361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tactile sensing remains far less understood in neuroscience and less effective in artificial systems compared to more mature modalities such as vision and language. We bridge these gaps by introducing a novel Encoder-Attender-Decoder (EAD) framework to systematically explore the space of task-optimized temporal neural networks trained on realistic tactile input sequences from a customized rodent whisker-array simulator. We identify convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) as superior encoders to purely feedforward and state-space architectures for tactile categorization. Crucially, these ConvRNN-encoder-based EAD models achieve neural representations closely matching rodent somatosensory cortex, saturating the explainable neural variability and revealing a clear linear relationship between supervised categorization performance and neural alignment. Furthermore, contrastive self-supervised ConvRNN-encoder-based EADs, trained with tactile-specific augmentations, match supervised neural fits, serving as an ethologically-relevant, label-free proxy.
  For neuroscience, our findings highlight nonlinear recurrent processing as important for general-purpose tactile representations in somatosensory cortex, providing the first quantitative characterization of the underlying inductive biases in this system. For embodied AI, our results emphasize the importance of recurrent EAD architectures to handle realistic tactile inputs, along with tailored self-supervised learning methods for achieving robust tactile perception with the same type of sensors animals use to sense in unstructured environments.

                arXiv:2411.00152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the spike-adding mechanism in a class of three-dimensional fast-slow systems with three distinct timescales, inspired by the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model driven by periodic input. First, we numerically generate a spike-adding diagram for the FHN model by varying the frequency and amplitude of the input, revealing that as the frequency decreases and the amplitude increases, the number of spikes within each burst grows. We demonstrate that a similar spike-adding structure occurs in the more realistic, periodically forced Morris-Lecar neuronal model. Next, we apply methods from geometric singular perturbation theory to compute critical and super-critical manifolds of the fast-slow system. We use them to characterize the emergence of new burst-spikes in the FHN model, when the periodic forcing resembles a low frequency-band brain rhythm. We then describe how the uncovered spike-adding mechanism defines the boundaries that separate regions with different spike counts in the parameter space.

                arXiv:2505.20712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization is an emerging field that focuses on finding a set of behaviorally diverse and high-quality solutions. While the quality is typically defined w.r.t. a single objective function, recent work on Multi-Objective Quality-Diversity (MOQD) extends QD optimization to simultaneously optimize multiple objective functions. This opens up multi-objective applications for QD, such as generating a diverse set of game maps that maximize difficulty, realism, or other properties. Existing MOQD algorithms use non-adaptive methods such as mutation and crossover to search for non-dominated solutions and construct an archive of Pareto Sets (PS). However, recent work in QD has demonstrated enhanced performance through the use of covariance-based evolution strategies for adaptive solution search. We propose bringing this insight into the MOQD problem, and introduce MO-CMA-MAE, a new MOQD algorithm that leverages Covariance Matrix Adaptation-Evolution Strategies (CMA-ES) to optimize the hypervolume associated with every PS within the archive. We test MO-CMA-MAE on three MOQD domains, and for generating maps of a co-operative video game, showing significant improvements in performance.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20720">Hybrid Wave-wind System Power Optimisation Using Effective Ensemble Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Algorithm</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.20720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floating hybrid wind-wave systems combine offshore wind platforms with wave energy converters (WECs) to create cost-effective and reliable energy solutions. Adequately designed and tuned WECs are essential to avoid unwanted loads disrupting turbine motion while efficiently harvesting wave energy. These systems diversify energy sources, enhancing energy security and reducing supply risks while providing a more consistent power output by smoothing energy production variability. However, optimising such systems is complex due to the physical and hydrodynamic interactions between components, resulting in a challenging optimisation space. This study uses a 5-MW OC4-DeepCwind semi-submersible platform with three spherical WECs to explore these synergies. To address these challenges, we propose an effective ensemble optimisation (EEA) technique that combines covariance matrix adaptation, novelty search, and discretisation techniques. To evaluate the EEA performance, we used four sea sites located along Australia's southern coast. In this framework, geometry and power take-off parameters are simultaneously optimised to maximise the average power output of the hybrid wind-wave system. Ensemble optimisation methods enhance performance, flexibility, and robustness by identifying the best algorithm or combination of algorithms for a given problem, addressing issues like premature convergence, stagnation, and poor search space exploration. The EEA was benchmarked against 14 advanced optimisation methods, demonstrating superior solution quality and convergence rates. EEA improved total power output by 111%, 95%, and 52% compared to WOA, EO, and AHA, respectively. Additionally, in comparisons with advanced methods, LSHADE, SaNSDE, and SLPSO, EEA achieved absorbed power enhancements of 498%, 638%, and 349% at the Sydney sea site, showcasing its effectiveness in optimising hybrid energy systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20834">Fully Spiking Neural Networks for Unified Frame-Event Object Tracking</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.20834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of image and event streams offers a promising approach for achieving robust visual object tracking in complex environments. However, current fusion methods achieve high performance at the cost of significant computational overhead and struggle to efficiently extract the sparse, asynchronous information from event streams, failing to leverage the energy-efficient advantages of event-driven spiking paradigms. To address this challenge, we propose the first fully Spiking Frame-Event Tracking framework called SpikeFET. This network achieves synergistic integration of convolutional local feature extraction and Transformer-based global modeling within the spiking paradigm, effectively fusing frame and event data. To overcome the degradation of translation invariance caused by convolutional padding, we introduce a Random Patchwork Module (RPM) that eliminates positional bias through randomized spatial reorganization and learnable type encoding while preserving residual structures. Furthermore, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Regularization (STR) strategy that overcomes similarity metric degradation from asymmetric features by enforcing spatio-temporal consistency among temporal template features in latent space. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior tracking accuracy over existing methods while significantly reducing power consumption, attaining an optimal balance between performance and efficiency. The code will be released.

                arXiv:2505.21034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful class of algorithms for optimizing expensive black-box functions, but designing effective BO algorithms remains a manual, expertise-driven task. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for automating scientific discovery, including the automatic design of optimization algorithms. While prior work has used LLMs within optimization loops or to generate non-BO algorithms, we tackle a new challenge: Using LLMs to automatically generate full BO algorithm code. Our framework uses an evolution strategy to guide an LLM in generating Python code that preserves the key components of BO algorithms: An initial design, a surrogate model, and an acquisition function. The LLM is prompted to produce multiple candidate algorithms, which are evaluated on the established Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking (BBOB) test suite from the COmparing Continuous Optimizers (COCO) platform. Based on their performance, top candidates are selected, combined, and mutated via controlled prompt variations, enabling iterative refinement. Despite no additional fine-tuning, the LLM-generated algorithms outperform state-of-the-art BO baselines in 19 (out of 24) BBOB functions in dimension 5 and generalize well to higher dimensions, and different tasks (from the Bayesmark framework). This work demonstrates that LLMs can serve as algorithmic co-designers, offering a new paradigm for automating BO development and accelerating the discovery of novel algorithmic combinations.

Abstract: Extremely increased unstructured data brought by the large-scale intelligent sensing devices application have big challenges not only in data storing and processing but also power consumption surging. Therefore, to improve energy efficiency and processing speed, a new generation system structure and construction strategy is necessary. Most biological nervous systems, especially the tactile system, have a good flexibility and data processing performance with low power usage. Inspired from this mechanism, to optimize the intelligent system, we report a universal fully flexible neuromorphic perception system with a strong compatibility and multi-threshold signal processing strategy by mimicking tactile nervous system. Peak signal accumulated from spike encoded sensor signal in front-end processing unit can be used for recognition task directly since the bionic synaptic plasticity. Compared with conventional systems, power consumption of our system significantly decreases about 1 order of magnitude in a same recognition task. What is more, the design of voltage-based matching circuit and multithreshold processing circuit provide an excellent compatibility and multi-signal processing capability in our system. In feasibility verification, our system can output trend of different input signals (continuous signal and frequency signal etc.) accurately and have a high recognition accuracy of 90% in the symbol pattern and 90% in Morse code. These properties of our neuromorphic system show a great application potential in intelligent devices and bionic robots.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23302">A Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem Involving Reconfigurable Machine Tools Under Industry 5.0</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.23302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of Industry 5.0 has introduced new demands for manufacturing companies, requiring a shift in how production schedules are managed to address human centered, environmental, and economic goals comprehensively. The flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSSP), which involves processing operations on various capable machines, accurately reflects the complexities of modern manufacturing settings. This paper investigates the FJSSP involving reconfigurable machine tools with configuration dependent setup times, while integrating human aspects like worker assignments, moving time, and rest periods, as well as minimizing total energy consumption. A mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is developed to simultaneously optimize these objectives. The model determines the assignment of operations to machines, workers, and configurations while sequencing operations, scheduling worker movements, and respecting rest periods, and minimizing overall energy consumption. Given the NPhard nature of the FJSSP with worker assignments and reconfigurable tools, a memetic algorithm (MA) is proposed. This metaheuristic evolutionary algorithm features a three layer chromosome encoding method, specialized crossover and mutation strategies, and neighborhood search mechanisms to enhance solution quality and diversity. Comparisons of MA with MIP and genetic algorithms (GA) on benchmark instances demonstrate the MA efficiency and effectiveness, particularly for larger problem instances where MIP becomes impractical. This research paves the way for sustainable and resilient production schedules tailored for the factory of the future under the Industry 5.0 paradigm. The work bridges a crucial gap in current literature by integrating worker and environmental impact into the FJSSP with reconfigurable machine models.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17629">Learn from Global Correlations: Enhancing Evolutionary Algorithm via Spectral GNN</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.17629v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) simulate natural selection but have two main limitations: (1) they rarely update individuals based on global correlations, limiting comprehensive learning; (2) they struggle with balancing exploration and exploitation, where excessive exploitation causes premature convergence, and excessive exploration slows down the search. Moreover, EAs often depend on manual parameter settings, which can disrupt the exploration-exploitation balance.To address these issues, we propose Graph Neural Evolution (GNE), a novel EA framework. GNE represents the population as a graph, where nodes represent individuals, and edges capture their relationships, enabling global information usage. GNE utilizes spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) to decompose evolutionary signals into frequency components, applying a filtering function to fuse these components. High-frequency components capture diverse global information, while low-frequency ones capture more consistent information. This explicit frequency filtering strategy directly controls global-scale features through frequency components, overcoming the limitations of manual parameter settings and making the exploration-exploitation control more interpretable and effective.Extensive tests on nine benchmark functions (e.g., Sphere, Rastrigin, Rosenbrock) show that GNE outperforms classical (GA, DE, CMA-ES) and advanced algorithms (SDAES, RL-SHADE) under various conditions, including noise-corrupted and optimal solution deviation scenarios. GNE achieves solutions several orders of magnitude better (e.g., 3.07e-20 mean on Sphere vs. 1.51e-07).

                arXiv:2502.20411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically inspired computational paradigm that emulates neuronal activity through discrete spike-based processing. Despite their advantages, training SNNs with traditional backpropagation (BP) remains challenging due to computational inefficiencies and a lack of biological plausibility. This study explores the Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm as an alternative learning framework for SNNs. Unlike backpropagation, which relies on forward and backward passes, the FF algorithm employs two forward passes, enabling layer-wise localized learning, enhanced computational efficiency, and improved compatibility with neuromorphic hardware. We introduce an FF-based SNN training framework and evaluate its performance across both non-spiking (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST) and spiking (Neuro-MNIST, SHD) datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model surpasses existing FF-based SNNs on evaluated static datasets with a much lighter architecture while achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art backpropagation-trained SNNs. On more complex spiking tasks such as SHD, our approach outperforms other SNN models and remains competitive with leading backpropagation-trained SNNs. These findings highlight the FF algorithm's potential to advance SNN training methodologies by addressing some key limitations of backpropagation.

                arXiv:2412.10312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A popular end-to-end architecture for selective rationalization is the select-then-predict pipeline, comprising a generator to extract highlights fed to a predictor. Such a cooperative system suffers from suboptimal equilibrium minima due to the dominance of one of the two modules, a phenomenon known as interlocking. While several contributions aimed at addressing interlocking, they only mitigate its effect, often by introducing feature-based heuristics, sampling, and ad-hoc regularizations. We present GenSPP, the first interlocking-free architecture for selective rationalization that does not require any learning overhead, as the above-mentioned. GenSPP avoids interlocking by performing disjoint training of the generator and predictor via genetic global search. Experiments on a synthetic and a real-world benchmark show that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art competitors.

                arXiv:2503.14434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated feature engineering plays a critical role in improving predictive model performance for tabular learning tasks. Traditional automated feature engineering methods are limited by their reliance on pre-defined transformations within fixed, manually designed search spaces, often neglecting domain knowledge. Recent advances using Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the integration of domain knowledge into the feature engineering process. However, existing LLM-based approaches use direct prompting or rely solely on validation scores for feature selection, failing to leverage insights from prior feature discovery experiments or establish meaningful reasoning between feature generation and data-driven performance. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-FE, a novel framework that combines evolutionary search with the domain knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to automatically discover effective features for tabular learning tasks. LLM-FE formulates feature engineering as a program search problem, where LLMs propose new feature transformation programs iteratively, and data-driven feedback guides the search process. Our results demonstrate that LLM-FE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly enhancing the performance of tabular prediction models across diverse classification and regression benchmarks.

A total of 123 college student dyads completed a creative ideation task and a contrast task while their brain activity was simultaneously recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Results identified three distinct ideation pathways—flexibility, persistence, and convergence—that collectively drove group creativity, accompanied by three interbrain synchrony states. STATE2, characterized by enhanced prefrontal–temporal interbrain synchrony, positively predicted group creative performance, whereas STATE3, marked by reduced frontal–parietal interbrain synchrony, negatively predicted it. Specifically, STATE2 facilitated group creativity through three mediating pathways: (1) the flexibility pathway alone, (2) combined flexibility–persistence or flexibility–convergence pathways, and (3) a sequential flexibility–persistence–convergence pathway with chain mediation effects. These findings provide neurobehavioral evidence for the triple-pathway model, underscoring the pivotal role of prefrontal–temporal interbrain synchrony in group creativity. They further demonstrate the dynamic, multi-pathway nature of group creative ideation, showing that a single cohort can flexibly employ three interchangeable pathways to generate novel ideas collaboratively.</span>

                <p>Pavlovian conditioning tasks have been used to identify the neural systems involved with learning cue&ndash;outcome relationships. In delay conditioning, the conditioned stimulus (CS) overlaps or co-terminates with the unconditioned stimulus (US). Prior studies demonstrate that dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) regulates behavioral responding during delay conditioning. Furthermore, the dopamine response to the CS reflects the relative value of the upcoming reward in these tasks. In contrast to delay conditioning, trace conditioning involves a "trace" period separating the end of the CS and the US delivery. While dopamine has been implicated in trace conditioning, no studies have examined how NAc dopamine responds to reward-related stimuli in these tasks. Here, we developed a within-subject trace conditioning task where distinct CSs signaled either a short trace period (5&nbsp;s) or a long trace period (55&nbsp;s) prior to food reward delivery. Male rats exhibited greater conditioned responding and a faster response latency to the Short Trace CS relative to the Long Trace CS. Voltammetry recordings in the NAc found that the CS-evoked dopamine response increased on Short Trace trials but decreased on Long Trace trials. Conversely, US-evoked dopamine responses were greater on Long Trace trials relative to Short Trace trials. The CS dopamine response correlated with the response latency and not with conditioned responding. Furthermore, the relationship between CS dopamine and latency was best explained by an exponential function. Our results collectively illustrate that the trace period is encoded by the bidirectional NAc dopamine response to the CS during pavlovian conditioning.</p>

                <p>Cell shape is crucial to cell function, particularly in neurons. The cross-sectional diameter, also known as caliber, of axons and dendrites is an important parameter of neuron shape, best appreciated for its influence on the speed of action potential propagation. Many studies of axon caliber focus on cell-wide regulation and assume that caliber is static. Here, we have characterized local variation and dynamics of axon caliber in vivo using the peripheral axons of zebrafish touch-sensing neurons at embryonic stages, prior to sex determination. To obtain absolute measurements of caliber in vivo, we paired sparse membrane labeling with super-resolution microscopy of neurons in live fish. We observed that axon segments had varicose or "pearled" morphologies and thus vary in caliber along their length, consistent with reports from mammalian systems. Sister axon segments originating from the most proximal branch point in the axon arbor had average calibers that were uncorrelated with each other. Axon caliber also tapered across the branch point. Varicosities and caliber, overall, were dynamic on the timescale of minutes, and dynamicity changed over the course of development. By measuring the caliber of axons adjacent to dividing epithelial cells, we found that skin cell division is one aspect of the cellular microenvironment that may drive local differences and dynamics in axon caliber. Our findings support the possibility that spatial and temporal variation in axon caliber could significantly influence neuronal physiology.</p>

Breathing plays a critical role not only in homeostatic survival, but also in modulating other non-interoceptive perceptual and affective processes. Recent evidence from both human and rodent models indicates that neural and behavioural oscillations are influenced by respiratory state as breathing cycles from inspiration to expiration. To explore the mechanisms behind these effects, we carried out a psychophysical experiment where 41 participants categorised dot motion and facial emotion stimuli in a standardised discrimination task. When comparing behaviour across respiratory states, we found that inspiration accelerated responses in both domains. We applied a hierarchical evidence accumulation model to determine which aspects of the latent decision process best explained this acceleration. Computational modelling showed that inspiration reduced evidential decision boundaries, such that participants prioritised speed over accuracy in the motion task. In contrast, inspiration shifted the starting point of affective evidence accumulation, inducing a bias towards categorising facial expressions as more positive. These findings provide a novel computational account of how breathing modulate distinct aspects of perceptual and affective decision-dynamics.

                <p>by Lucie Riglet, Catherine Quilliet, Christophe Godin, Karin John, Isabelle Fobis-Loisy</p>

In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, successful fertilisation relies on the precise guidance of the pollen tube as it navigates through the female tissues to deliver sperm cells to ovules. While prior research has focused on pistil signals directing pollen tubes towards the ovules, the pollen tube growth within the stigmatic epidermis has received limited attention. Our recent work comparing wild-type pollen tube paths on wild-type and <i>katanin1-5</i> stigmatic cells, revealed a tight connection between pollen tube directionality and mechanical properties of the invaded stigmatic cell. Given that most mechanical properties of the stigmatic tissue are experimentally challenging to access, we used mathematical modelling to investigate the mechanisms underlying early pollen tube guidance through the papilla cell wall. We found that in <i>ktn1-5</i>, the wild-type pollen tube navigates freely across the curved papilla surface, following curves close to geodesics, whereas the wild-type papilla imposes directional guidance. The order of magnitude analysis of the mechanical forces required for pollen tubes to progress at the papilla surface indicates that both the elongated geometry of the papilla and the difference in rigidity of its cell wall layers combine to efficiently orient the pollen tube towards the papilla base.

                <p>by Yanbo Lian, Anthony N. Burkitt</p>

Sparse coding, predictive coding and divisive normalization have each been found to be principles that underlie the function of neural circuits in many parts of the brain, supported by substantial experimental evidence. However, the connections between these related principles are still poorly understood. Sparse coding and predictive coding can be reconciled into a learning framework with predictive structure and sparse responses, termed as sparse/predictive coding. However, how sparse/predictive coding (a learning model) is connected with divisive normalization (not a learning model) is still not well investigated. In this paper, we show how sparse coding, predictive coding, and divisive normalization can be described within a unified framework, and illustrate this explicitly within the context of a two-layer neural learning model of sparse/predictive coding. This two-layer model is constructed in a way that implements sparse coding with a network structure that is constructed by implementing predictive coding. We demonstrate how a homeostatic function that regulates neural responses in the model can shape the nonlinearity of neural responses in a way that replicates different forms of divisive normalization. Simulations show that the model can learn simple cells in the primary visual cortex with the property of contrast saturation, which has previously been explained by divisive normalization. In summary, the study demonstrates that the three principles of sparse coding, predictive coding, and divisive normalization can be connected to provide a learning framework based on biophysical properties, such as Hebbian learning and homeostasis, and this framework incorporates both learning and more diverse response nonlinearities observed experimentally. This framework has the potential to also be used to explain how the brain learns to integrate input from different sensory modalities.

                <p>by Luis de la Cuesta-Ferrer, Christina Koß, Sarah Starosta, Nils Kasties, Daniel Lengersdorf, Frank Jäkel, Maik C. Stüttgen</p>

In dynamic environments, animals must select actions based on sensory input as well as expected positive and negative consequences. This type of behavior is typically studied using perceptual decision making (PDM) tasks. The arguably most influential framework for describing the cognitive processes underlying PDM is signal detection theory (SDT). One central assumption of SDT is that observers make perceptual decisions by comparing sensory evidence to a static decision criterion. However, mounting evidence suggests that the criterion is in fact highly dynamic and that observers adjust it flexibly according to task demands. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which observers integrate stimulus and reward information for adaptive criterion learning remain not well understood. Here, we systematically investigated the factors influencing criterion setting at the single-trial level. To that end, we first specified three SDT-based models that learn either from reward, reward omission, or both. Next, by concomitantly manipulating stimulus and reward probabilities, we constructed experimental conditions in which these models make divergent predictions. Finally, we subjected rats and pigeons to a PDM task comprising these conditions. We find that subjects adopted decision criteria that maximize total reward in all experimental conditions. Detailed behavioral analyses reveal that criterion learning is driven by the integration of rewards, not reward omissions, and that reward integration is influenced by two additional factors: first, the degree of stimulus uncertainty, and second, the difference in the relative reward rates (rather than the absolute reward rates) between the choice alternatives. A model incorporating these factors accounts well for criterion dynamics across experimental conditions for both species and links signal detection theory to a learning mechanism operating at the level of single trials which, in the steady state, produces behavior similar to the matching law, a central tenet of learning theory.

                <p>by Miriam Goldman, Chunyu Zhao, Katherine S. Pollard</p>

Microbiome association studies typically link host disease or other traits to summary statistics measured in metagenomics data, such as diversity or taxonomic composition. But identifying disease-associated species based on their relative abundance does not provide insight into why these microbes act as disease markers, and it overlooks cases where disease risk is related to specific strains with unique biological functions. To bridge this knowledge gap, we developed microSLAM, a mixed-effects model and an R package that performs association tests that connect host traits to the presence/absence of genes within each microbiome species, while accounting for strain genetic relatedness across hosts. Traits can be quantitative or binary (such as case/control). MicroSLAM is fit in three steps for each species. The first step estimates population structure across hosts. Step two calculates the association between population structure and the trait, enabling detection of species for which a subset of related strains confer risk. To identify specific genes whose presence/absence across diverse strains is associated with the trait, step three models the trait as a function of gene occurrence plus random effects estimated from step two. Applying microSLAM to 710 gut metagenomes from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) samples, we discovered 56 species whose population structure correlates with IBD, meaning that different lineages are found in cases versus controls. After controlling for population structure, 20 species had genes significantly associated with IBD. Twenty-one of these genes were more common in IBD patients, while 32 genes were enriched in healthy controls, including a seven-gene operon in <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i> that is involved in utilization of fructoselysine from the gut environment. The vast majority of species detected by microSLAM were not significantly associated with IBD using standard relative abundance tests. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for within-species genetic variation in microbiome studies.

Bacteria deploy a diverse arsenal of toxic effectors to antagonize competitors, profoundly influencing the composition of microbial communities. Previous studies have identified an interbacterial toxin predicted to exhibit proteolytic activity that is broadly distributed among gram-negative bacteria. However, the precise mechanism of intoxication remains unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that one such protease toxin from <i>Escherichia coli</i>, Cpe1, disrupts DNA replication and chromosome segregation by cleaving conserved sequences within the ATPase domain of type II DNA topoisomerases GyrB and ParE. This cleavage effectively inhibits topoisomerase-mediated relaxation of supercoiled DNA, resulting in impaired bacterial growth. Cpe1 belongs to the papain-like cysteine protease family and is associated with toxin delivery pathways, including the type VI secretion system and contact-dependent growth inhibition. The structure of Cpe1 in complex with its immunity protein reveals a neutralization mechanism involving competitive substrate binding rather than active site occlusion, distinguishing it from previously characterized effector-immunity pairs. Our findings unveil a unique mode of interbacterial intoxication and provide insights into how bacteria protect themselves from self-poisoning by protease toxins.

                <p>by Bharath Ananthasubramaniam, Ramji Venkataramanan</p>

The study of ubiquitous circadian rhythms in human physiology requires regular measurements across time. Repeated sampling of the different internal tissues that house circadian clocks is both practically and ethically infeasible. Here, we present a novel unsupervised machine learning approach (COFE) that can use single high-throughput omics samples (without time labels) from individuals to reconstruct circadian rhythms across cohorts. COFE can simultaneously assign time labels to samples and identify rhythmic data features used for temporal reconstruction, while also detecting invalid orderings. With COFE, we discovered widespread de novo circadian gene expression rhythms in 11 different human adenocarcinomas using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The arrangement of peak times of core clock gene expression was conserved across cancers and resembled a healthy functional clock except for the mistiming of a few key genes. Moreover, rhythms in the transcriptome were strongly associated with the cancer-relevant proteome. The rhythmic genes and proteins common to all cancers were involved in metabolism and the cell cycle. Although these rhythms were synchronized with the cell cycle in many cancers, they were uncoupled with clocks in healthy matched tissue. The targets of most of FDA-approved and potential anti-cancer drugs were rhythmic in tumor tissue with different amplitudes and peak times. These findings emphasize the utility of considering “time" in cancer therapy, and suggest a focus on clocks in healthy tissue rather than free-running clocks in cancer tissue. Our approach thus creates new opportunities to repurpose data without time labels to study circadian rhythms.

Toxin-antidote systems are selfish genetic elements composed of a linked toxin and antidote. The <i>peel-1 zeel-1</i> toxin-antidote system in <i>C. elegans</i> consists of a transmembrane toxin protein PEEL-1 which acts cell autonomously to kill cells. Here we investigate the molecular mechanism of PEEL-1 toxicity. We find that PEEL-1 requires a small membrane protein, PMPL-1, for toxicity. Together, PEEL-1 and PMPL-1 are sufficient for toxicity in a heterologous system, HEK293T cells, and cause cell swelling and increased cell permeability to monovalent cations. Using purified proteins, we show that PEEL-1 and PMPL-1 allow ion flux through lipid bilayers and generate currents which resemble ion channel gating. Our work suggests that PEEL-1 kills cells by co-opting PMPL-1 and creating a cation channel.

<p>The main building blocks of the cerebral cortex, the pyramidal neurons, show characteristic spine morphologies across brain regions and species, although there does appear to be a conserved cortical dendritic spine size-density balance. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons are the targets of most excitatory synapses in the cerebral cortex, and dendritic spine morphology directly reflects their function. However, there are scarce data available regarding both the detailed morphology of these structures for the human cerebral cortex and the extent to which they differ in comparison with other species. Thus, in the present study, we used intracellular injections of Lucifer yellow to reconstruct—in three dimensions—the morphology of basal dendritic spines from pyramidal cells in the human and mouse CA1 hippocampal region and compared these spines with those of the human temporal and cingular cortex. We found that human hippocampal dendrites show lower spine density, larger volume, and longer length of dendritic spines than mouse CA1 spines. Furthermore, human hippocampal dendrites show higher spine density, smaller spine volume, and shorter length compared to dendritic spines from the human temporal and cingular cortex. This morphological diversity suggests an equally large variability of synaptic strength and learning rules across these brain regions in humans and between humans and mice. Nevertheless, a balance between size and density was found in all cases, which may be a cortical rule maintained across cortical areas and species.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-341/v2?src=rss">Hybrid optimization technique for matrix chain multiplication using Strassen’s algorithm [version 2; peer review: 3 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Matrix Chain Multiplication (MCM) is a fundamental problem in computational mathematics and computer science, often encountered in scientific computing, graphics, and machine learning. Traditional MCM optimization techniques use Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization to determine the optimal parenthesization for minimizing the number of scalar multiplications. However, standard matrix multiplication still operates in O(n3) time complexity, leading to inefficiencies for large matrices. Methods In this paper, we propose a hybrid optimization technique that integrates Strassen’s algorithm into MCM to further accelerate matrix multiplication. Our approach consists of two key phases: (i) matrix chain order optimization, using a top-down memoized DP approach, we compute the best multiplication sequence, and (ii) hybrid multiplication strategy, we selectively apply Strassen’s algorithm for large matrices (n ≥ 128), reducing the complexity from O(n3) to O(n2.81), while using standard multiplication for smaller matrices to avoid recursive overhead. We evaluate the performance of our hybrid method through computational experiments comparing execution time, memory usage, and numerical accuracy against traditional MCM and Strassen’s standalone multiplication. Results Our results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid method achieves significant speedup (4x–8x improvement) and reduces memory consumption, making it well-suited for large-scale applications. This research opens pathways for further optimizations in parallel computing and GPU-accelerated matrix operations. Conclusion This study presents a hybrid approach to Matrix Chain Multiplication by integrating Strassen’s algorithm, reducing execution time and memory usage. By selectively applying Strassen’s method for large matrices, the proposed technique improves efficiency while preserving accuracy. Future work can focus on parallel computing and GPU acceleration for further optimization.

                Background The utilization of palm kernel cake (PKC) as a feed ingredient for ruminants has yielded inconsistent findings regarding its effects on animal physiology, feeding behavior, and meat quality. To address these discrepancies, a meta-analysis was conducted by synthesizing data from multiple studies that met specific inclusion criteria. Methods The analysis employed a mixed-model approach to evaluate the impact of PKC inclusion on nitrogen utilization, blood metabolites, feeding behavior, and the physicochemical properties of the Longissimus muscle in ruminants from 20 relevant articles. These articles originated from Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Springer Link using the keywords “palm kernel cake” and “ruminant.” The analysis was undertaken using the PROC MIXED procedure in SAS® OnDemand for Academics. Results The findings indicate that increasing PKC levels had no significant effects on feeding behavior, nitrogen utilization, blood metabolism, or muscle physicochemical traits. However, a quadratic response (P<0.05) was observed for nitrogen excretion, absorbed nitrogen, and cholesterol levels, suggesting a threshold beyond which PKC inclusion may affect metabolic efficiency. Notably, PKC did not alter meat color, a crucial determinant of consumer preference, implying that its market acceptability remains unchanged. Conclusion These results underscore the viability of PKC as a sustainable protein and fiber source in ruminant diets without compromising animal performance or product quality. Further investigations should explore the optimal inclusion levels of PKC to maximize its benefits while mitigating potential metabolic alterations.

                Background The discovery of an ideal and effective therapy is urgently required for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease that appear before the clinical symptoms are neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, brain inflammation, and neuronal atrophy throughout the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. GSK-3β (Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3β) is regarded as the most important and promising target for therapeutic use because GSK-3β expression levels increase with age and are the most abundant and hyperactive in the brains of patients with AD. GSK-3β activation or upregulation can contribute to neurodegeneration by promoting amyloid beta (Aβ) production and tau hyperphosphorylation. Whereas the underlying mechanism for abnormal production of GSK-3β in AD brains remains unclear. Methods Maestro was used, which is Schrodinger, for our computational simulation studies. In the present work, different modules that were used in previous studies with a little modification, the modules such as Protein Preparation with the help of Protein Preparation Wizard, Ligand Preparation with the help of LigPrep, for ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion) prediction Qikprop was used, for docking studies Glide module was used, Binding energy prediction the Prime was used and Molecular dynamic simulation (MDs) studies done using Desmond. Results Our focus is mainly on an in-silico approach, focusing on library generation; first draw an IMID2 (imidazo [1,5-a]pyridine-3-carboxamide) scaffold structure at Enamine and subjected it to a substructure search to target the receptor grid region (ATP-competitive site) of 6Y9R. They were then subjected to various screening processes. Finally, nine compounds were subjected to MDs studies. Conclusions Nine compounds showed good results with the most stable interactions. Among all the MD studies, the compound (Z3336252116) has shown good interaction and a good docking score. Further experiments and studies are required to confirm these results.

                Background Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Perioperative or adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival in patients with stage 1B or higher cancers. Moringa oleifera and Plukenetia volubilis (Sacha inchi) have been reported to enhance various biological functions, including antitumor and antiproliferative activity. Methods In order to evaluate this potential present in crude extracts of the leaves of these plants, as well as the seed oil of P.volubilis, the antitumor activity was determined according to the effect of these derivatives on different biological parameters such as cytotoxicity, proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis (among others), in AGS cells (CRL-1739). Results All extracts tested were cytotoxic at 90 and 160 μg/ml concentrations. P. volubilis seed oil showed 95% mortality at 1% concentration (CC50 = 46.7%). Cell proliferation was inhibited, and all extracts affected the cell cycle, but the P. volubilis oil significantly induced an accumulation of AGS cells in the sub G1 phase, inducing DNA fragmentation as a mechanism of cell death. The ethanolic M. oleifera leaf extract also inhibited cell migration. Conclusion M. oleifera, P. volubilis leaf extracts and P. volubilis seed oil can potentially be antitumor products. Further validation in a murine model of gastric cancer is needed to investigate the antitumor potential of these extracts further and to continue the development of herbal products that can help in the management of this type of tumor.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-521/v1?src=rss">Different Dental Students’ Attitude toward General Surgery Subject? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Dental schools may adopt different educational approaches in relation to general surgery subjects. In Iraqi Dental Schools, general surgery subjects are usually given to fourth-year students. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has investigated undergraduate dental students’ attitudes toward different aspects of this subject. Aims To determine the influence of general surgery on oral surgery subjects and students’ preference for the lecturer’s specialty. Materials and methods A Google questionnaire of the three main domains was circulated to fourth- and fifth-year dental students in three dental schools. These students were given lectures on general surgery by either a physician or oral surgeon. Results Two hundred sixty-five students participated in this study; the majority of responses were positive for general surgery subjects. The chi-square Test showed a highly significant relationship (P=0.000) between the relevance of GS to OS and the extent to which general surgery help in understanding oral surgery. The same test showed a significant relationship (P=0.021) between willingness to become an OMF surgeon and the wish to be given a GS subject by an oral surgeon. Conclusion General surgery enjoys a reasonable level of popularity among undergraduate senior dental students. This popularity seems to have influenced undergraduate students’ willingness to become oral and maxillofacial surgeons. This, in turn, made students prefer general surgery subjects given by an oral surgeon.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103047">Household clustering and seasonal genetic variation of Plasmodium falciparum at the community-level in The Gambia</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the genetic diversity and transmission dynamics of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, the causative agent of malaria, is crucial for effective control and elimination efforts. In some endemic regions, malaria is highly seasonal with no or little transmission during up to 8 mo, yet little is known about how seasonality affects the parasite population genetics. Here, we conducted a longitudinal study over 2.5 y on 1516 participants in the Upper River Region of The Gambia. With 425 <i>P. falciparum</i> genetic barcodes genotyped from asymptomatic infections, we developed an identity by descent (IBD) based pipeline and validated its accuracy against 199 parasite genomes sequenced from the same isolates. Genetic relatedness between isolates revealed a very low inbreeding level, suggesting continuous recombination among parasites rather than the dominance of specific strains. However, isolates from the same household were sixfold more likely to be genetically related compared to those from other villages, suggesting close transmission links within households. Seasonal variation also influenced parasite genetics, with most differentiation occurring during the transition from the low transmission season to the subsequent high transmission season. Yet chronic infections presented exceptions, including one individual who had a continuous infection by the same parasite genotype for at least 18 mo. Our findings highlight the burden of asymptomatic chronic malaria carriers and the importance of characterizing the parasite genetic population at the community-level. Most importantly, ‘reactive’ approaches for malaria elimination should not be limited to acute malaria cases but be broadened to households of asymptomatic carriers.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99410">A Kv2 inhibitor combination reveals native neuronal conductances consistent with Kv2/KvS heteromers</a></h4>

              
                KvS proteins are voltage-gated potassium channel subunits that form functional channels when assembled into heteromers with Kv2.1 (<i>KCNB1</i>) or Kv2.2 (<i>KCNB2</i>). Mammals have 10 KvS subunits: Kv5.1 (<i>KCNF1</i>), Kv6.1 (<i>KCNG1</i>), Kv6.2 (<i>KCNG2</i>), Kv6.3 (<i>KCNG3</i>), Kv6.4 (<i>KCNG4</i>), Kv8.1 (<i>KCNV1</i>), Kv8.2 (<i>KCNV2</i>), Kv9.1 (<i>KCNS1</i>), Kv9.2 (<i>KCNS2</i>), and Kv9.3 (<i>KCNS3</i>). Electrically excitable cells broadly express channels containing Kv2 subunits and most neurons have substantial Kv2 conductance. However, whether KvS subunits contribute to these conductances has not been clear, leaving the physiological roles of KvS subunits poorly understood. Here, we identify that two potent Kv2 inhibitors, used in combination, can distinguish conductances of Kv2/KvS heteromers and Kv2-only channels. We find that Kv5, Kv6, Kv8, or Kv9-containing channels are resistant to the Kv2-selective pore-blocker RY785 yet remain sensitive to the Kv2-selective voltage sensor modulator guangxitoxin-1E (GxTX). Using these inhibitors in mouse superior cervical ganglion neurons, we find predominantly RY785-sensitive conductances consistent with channels composed entirely of Kv2 subunits. In contrast, RY785-resistant but GxTX-sensitive conductances consistent with Kv2/KvS heteromeric channels predominate in mouse and human dorsal root ganglion neurons. These results establish an approach to pharmacologically distinguish conductances of Kv2/KvS heteromers from Kv2-only channels, enabling investigation of the physiological roles of endogenous KvS subunits. These findings suggest that drugs which distinguish KvS subunits could modulate electrical activity of subsets of Kv2-expressing cell types.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105714">Integration of head and body orientations in the macaque superior temporal sulcus is stronger for upright bodies</a></h4>

              
                The neural processing of faces and bodies is often studied separately, despite their natural integration in perception. Unlike prior research on the neural selectivity for either head or body orientation, we investigated their interaction in macaque superior temporal sulcus (STS) using a monkey avatar with diverse head–body orientation angles. STS neurons showed selectivity for specific combinations of head–body orientations. Anterior STS (aSTS) neurons enabled more reliable decoding of head–body configuration angles compared to middle STS neurons. Decoding accuracy in aSTS was lowest for head–body angle pairs differing only in sign (e.g. head–body orientation difference of ±90° relative to the anatomical midline), and highest for aligned (0°) head–body orientations versus those with maximum angular difference. Inverted bodies showed diminished decoding of head–body orientation angle compared to upright bodies. These findings show that aSTS integrates head and body orientation cues, revealing configuration-specific neural mechanisms, and advance our understanding of social perception.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103328">An antisense oligonucleotide-based strategy to ameliorate cognitive dysfunction in the 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Adults and children with the 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome demonstrate cognitive, social, and emotional impairments and high risk for schizophrenia. Work in mouse model of the 22q11.2 deletion provided compelling evidence for abnormal expression and processing of microRNAs. A major transcriptional effect of the microRNA dysregulation is upregulation of <i>Emc10,</i> a component of the ER membrane complex, which promotes membrane insertion of a subset of polytopic and tail-anchored membrane proteins. We previously uncovered a key contribution of EMC10 in mediating the behavioral phenotypes observed in 22q11.2 deletion mouse models. Here, we show that expression and processing of miRNAs is abnormal and <i>EMC10</i> expression is elevated in neurons derived from 22q11.2 deletion carriers. Reduction of <i>EMC10 levels</i> restores defects in neurite outgrowth and calcium signaling in patient neurons. Furthermore, antisense oligonucleotide administration and normalization of <i>Emc10</i> in the adult mouse brain not only alleviates cognitive deficits in social and spatial memory but remarkably sustains these improvements for over 2 months post-injection, indicating its therapeutic potential. Broadly, our study integrates findings from both animal models and human neurons to elucidate the translational potential of modulating <i>EMC10</i> levels and downstream targets as a specific venue to ameliorate disease progression in 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94029">Reliable protein–protein docking with AlphaFold, Rosetta, and replica exchange</a></h4>

              
                Despite the recent breakthrough of AlphaFold (AF) in the field of protein sequence-to-structure prediction, modeling protein interfaces and predicting protein complex structures remains challenging, especially when there is a significant conformational change in one or both binding partners. Prior studies have demonstrated that AF-multimer (AFm) can predict accurate protein complexes in only up to 43% of cases (Yin et al., 2022). In this work, we combine AF as a structural template generator with a physics-based replica exchange docking algorithm to better sample conformational changes. Using a curated collection of 254 available protein targets with both unbound and bound structures, we first demonstrate that AF confidence measures (pLDDT) can be repurposed for estimating protein flexibility and docking accuracy for multimers. We incorporate these metrics within our ReplicaDock 2.0 protocol to complete a robust in silico pipeline for accurate protein complex structure prediction. AlphaRED (AlphaFold-initiated Replica Exchange Docking) successfully docks failed AF predictions, including 97 failure cases in Docking Benchmark Set 5.5. AlphaRED generates CAPRI acceptable-quality or better predictions for 63% of benchmark targets. Further, on a subset of antigen-antibody targets, which is challenging for AFm (20% success rate), AlphaRED demonstrates a success rate of 43%. This new strategy demonstrates the success possible by integrating deep learning-based architectures trained on evolutionary information with physics-based enhanced sampling. The pipeline is available at <a href="https://github.com/Graylab/AlphaRED">https://github.com/Graylab/AlphaRED</a>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101170">Comparative analysis of the syncytiotrophoblast in placenta tissue and trophoblast organoids using snRNA sequencing</a></h4>

              
                The syncytiotrophoblast (STB) is a multinucleated cell layer that forms the outer surface of human chorionic villi. Its unusual structure, with billions of nuclei in a single cell, makes it difficult to resolve using conventional single-cell methods. To better understand STB differentiation, we performed single-nucleus and single-cell RNA sequencing on placental tissue and trophoblast organoids (TOs). Single-nucleus RNA-seq was essential for capturing STB populations, revealing three nuclear subtypes: a juvenile subtype co-expressing CTB and STB markers, one enriched in oxygen sensing genes, and another in transport and GTPase signaling. Organoids grown in suspension culture (STBout) showed higher expression of STB markers, hormones, and a greater proportion of the transport-associated nuclear subtype while TOs grown with an inverted polarity (STBin) exhibited a higher proportion of the oxygen sensing nuclear subtype. Gene regulatory analysis identified conserved STB markers, including the chromatin remodeler RYBP. Although RYBP knockout did not impair fusion, it downregulated CSH1 and upregulated oxygen-sensing genes. Comparing STB expression in first trimester, term, and TOs revealed shared features but context-dependent variability. These findings establish TOs as a robust platform to model STB differentiation and nuclear heterogeneity, providing insight into the regulatory networks that shape placental development and function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102857">Scrutinized lipid utilization disrupts Amphotericin-B responsiveness in clinical isolates of Leishmania donovani</a></h4>

              
                The management of <i>Leishmania donovani</i> (LD), responsible for fatal visceral leishmaniasis (VL), faces increasing challenges due to rising drug unresponsiveness, leading to increasing treatment failures. While hypolipidemia characterizes VL, LD, a cholesterol auxotroph, relies on host lipid scavenging for its intracellular survival. The aggressive pathology, in terms of increased organ parasite load, observed in hosts infected with antimony-unresponsive-LD (LD-R) as compared to their sensitive counterparts (LD-S), highlights LD-R’s heightened reliance on host lipids. Here, we report that LD-R-infection in mice promotes fluid-phase endocytosis in the host macrophages, selectively accumulating neutral lipids while excluding oxidized-low-density lipoprotein (LDL). LD-R enhances the fusion of endocytosed LDL-vesicles with its phagolysosomal membrane and inhibits cholesterol mobilization from these vesicles by suppressing NPC-1. This provides LD-R amastigotes with excess lipids, supporting their rapid proliferation and membrane synthesis. This excess LDL-influx leads to an eventual accumulation of neutral lipid droplets around LD-R amastigotes, thereby increasing their unresponsiveness toward Amphotericin-B, a second-line amphiphilic antileishmanial. Notably, VL patients showing relapse with Amphotericin-B treatment exhibited significantly lower serum LDL and cholesterol than cured cases. Treatment with Aspirin, a lipid droplet blocker, reduced lipid droplets around LD-R amastigotes, restoring Amphotericin-B responsiveness.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100601">Phase transition of WTAP regulates m6A modification of interferon-stimulated genes</a></h4>

              
                <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is the most prevalent modification of mRNA which controls diverse physiological processes. Although m<sup>6</sup>A modification has been reported to regulate type I interferon (IFN) responses by targeting the mRNA of IFN-β and the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), the detailed mechanism of how m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase complex (MTC) rapidly responds to conduct the modification on nascent mRNA during IFN-β stimulation remains largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate that WTAP, the adaptor protein of m<sup>6</sup>A MTC, undergoes dephosphorylation-regulated phase transition from aggregates to liquid-like condensates under IFN-β stimulation, thereby mediating m<sup>6</sup>A modification of a subset of ISGs to restrict their expression. The phase transition of WTAP promotes the interaction with nucleus-translocated transcription factor STAT1, recruits MTC to the promoter regions of ISGs and directs the co-transcriptional m<sup>6</sup>A modification on ISG mRNAs. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel regulatory role of WTAP phase transition in manipulating signaling pathways and fine-tuning immune response by orchestrating dynamic m<sup>6</sup>A modification through the cooperation of transcription factors and MTC. Our findings unveil a novel mechanism by which WTAP phase transition controls immune homeostasis via transcription factor-MTC-driven dynamic m<sup>6</sup>A modification, thereby proposing a potential therapeutic target for alleviating immune dysregulation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93180">Optogenetic control of a GEF of RhoA uncovers a signaling switch from retraction to protrusion</a></h4>

              
                The ability of a single protein to trigger different functions is an assumed key feature of cell signaling, yet there are very few examples demonstrating it. Here, using an optogenetic tool to control membrane localization of RhoA nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), we present a case where the same protein can trigger both protrusion and retraction when recruited to the plasma membrane, polarizing the cell in two opposite directions. We show that the basal concentration of the GEF prior to activation predicts the resulting phenotype. A low concentration leads to retraction, whereas a high concentration triggers protrusion. This unexpected protruding behavior arises from the simultaneous activation of Cdc42 by the GEF and sequestration of active RhoA by the GEF PH domain at high concentrations. We propose a minimal model that recapitulates the phenotypic switch, and we use its predictions to control the two phenotypes within selected cells by adjusting the frequency of light pulses. Our work exemplifies a unique case of control of antagonist phenotypes by a single protein that switches its function based on its concentration or dynamics of activity. It raises numerous open questions about the link between signaling protein and function, particularly in contexts where proteins are highly overexpressed, as often observed in cancer.

                A conserved <i>N</i>-glycan-dependent endoplasmic reticulum protein quality control (ERQC) system has evolved in eukaryotes to ensure accuracy during glycoprotein folding. The human pathogen <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> possesses a unique <i>N</i>-glycosylation pathway that affects microbial physiology and interactions with the infected host. To investigate the molecular features and functions of the ERQC system in <i>C. neoformans,</i> we characterized a set of mutants with deletion of genes coding for the ERQC sensor UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (<i>UGG1</i>) and putative α1,2-mannose-trimming enzymes (<i>MNS1</i>, <i>MNS101</i>, <i>MNL1</i>, and <i>MNL2</i>). The <i>ugg1</i>Δ, <i>mns1</i>Δ, <i>mns101</i>Δ, and <i>mns1</i>Δ<i>101</i>Δ mutants showed alterations in <i>N</i>-glycan profiles, defective cell surface organization, decreased survival in host cells, and varying degrees of reduced <i>in vivo</i> virulence. The <i>ugg1</i>Δ strain exhibited severely impaired extracellular secretion of capsular polysaccharides and virulence-related enzymes. Comparative transcriptome analysis showed the upregulation of protein folding, proteolysis, and cell wall remodeling genes, indicative of induced endoplasmic reticulum stress. However, no apparent changes were observed in the expression of genes involved in protein secretion or capsule biosynthesis. Additionally, extracellular vesicle (EV) analysis combined with proteomic analysis showed significant alterations in the number, size distribution, and cargo composition of EVs in <i>ugg1</i>Δ. These findings highlight the essential role of the functional ERQC system for cellular fitness under adverse conditions and proper EV-mediated transport of virulence factors, which are crucial for the full fungal pathogenicity of <i>C. neoformans</i>.

">Parallel and dynamic attention allocation during natural reading</a></h4>

              
                During natural reading, attention constantly shifts across words, yet how linguistic properties (e.g., lexical frequency) impact the allocation of attention remains unclear. In this study, we co-registered MEG data and eye movements while participants read one-line sentences containing target words of either low or high lexical frequency. Using rapid invisible frequency tagging (RIFT), we simultaneously tracked attention to target and post-target words by flickering them at different frequencies. First, we provide neural evidence that attention was allocated simultaneously to both foveal target and parafoveal post-target words. Second, we found an early parafoveal lexical effect, whereby lower frequency targets demanded more attention prior to fixation, and, additionally, a foveal load effect whereby lower frequency targets reduced the amount of attention allocated to post-targets. Furthermore, flexibility in attention shifts between foveal and parafoveal processing correlated with individual reading speed. These results suggest attention is distributed across multiple words and is flexibly adjusted during reading.

">Changes in social reward across adolescence in male mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: In humans, adolescence is a time of dynamic behavioral and emotional changes, including a transient decrease in affect associated with being among family members. It is not clear if a similar change occurs in rodent species used to model human psychiatric disorders. Here, we investigated in the developmental profile of the reward value of interactions with siblings across adolescence in mice. Methods: Social conditioned place preference test was performed in male mice representing early (around postnatal day 33 [P33]), middle (P38) and late (P43) adolescence stages. Additionally, social interaction in the partition test and cocaine conditioned place preference were measured to assess the specificity of changes observed in social reward. Results: The reward value of interactions with siblings in adolescent male mice followed a similar course to that in humans: high in preadolescence, it decreased in mid-adolescence and returned to the initial level in late adolescence. No age-dependent changes in social interaction or in the preference for cocaine-conditioned context were detected. Limitations: The main limitation of our study is that it does not examine potential developmental changes in the proximate psychological mechanisms underlying social place preference. Conclusions: Taken together, these data show similarities between mice and humans in developmental changes in sensitivity to the rewarding effects of interactions with familiar kin.

">Efficient Generation of Expandable Dorsal Forebrain Neural Rosette Stem Cell Lines</a></h4>

              
                Neural stem cells (NSCs) represent an interesting option for developing in vitro disease models and drug screening assays due to their differentiation capacity into neurons and glial cells. Additionally, NSCs are under investigation in on-going clinical trials for treatment of various human neurological disorders. NSCs can be isolated from the central nervous system or derived in vitro from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). However, the current methods for generating NSCs typically include a phase of neural rosette formation and subsequent manual isolation of these tiny structures. As this is a laborious process characterized by operator-dependent variability and scalability challenges, there is a pressing need to develop optimized and scalable protocols to obtain pure NSC populations. In this study, we present a new method for generating highly pure and expandable dorsal forebrain FOXG1+OTX2+TLE4+SOX5+ neural rosette stem cell (NRSC) lines without the necessity for manual isolation of rosette structures. Our findings demonstrate the reproducibility of this protocol through the characterization of different NRSC lines over multiple passages, highlighting the robustness of the process. These NRSCs can be expanded for up to 12 passages without compromising their rosette-formation capacity or their initial dorsal forebrain identity. Furthermore, we show the differentiation capacity of these NRSCs to generate pure populations of TUBB3+ neurons, and under specific conditions, their ability to differentiate into early glial progenitor cells including GFAP+ astrocytes and O4+ oligodendrocytes. Collectively, these results show the capabilities of our protocol to generate an expandable NRSC population suitable for in vitro disease modeling and drug screening, while also suggesting a viable strategy for scalable NRSC production for clinical application.

">Focused ultrasound to the bilateral thalamus causally modulates human cognitive attention in a frequency- and intensity-dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                The centromedian nucleus of the thalamus (CMT) is a core arousal center with potential for enhancing cognitive attention. While emergent focused ultrasound can reach this area, the stimulation paradigms which may enhance function in humans remain unknown. Here we performed bilateral stimulation of the CMT using a novel ultrasound neuromodulation wearable device using 3 distinct pulse frequencies. We found that a brief 25Hz stimulation enhanced reaction time in a in a directed attention Oddball task for at least 40 minutes. Pre-post task electrocortical EEG revealed a correlation between reaction time and the prevalence of arousal related alpha and theta cortical activity. Examination of dose dependence revealed bidirectional modulation of arousal state, with lower intensities preferentially enhancing cognitive function. Pre- and post-MRI scans showed no neuroradiological changes due to stimulation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that targeted LIFU stimulation of the CMT can safely enhance cognitive function in healthy individuals with carefully designed parameters.

">System-wide dissociation of reward and aversive dopaminergic signals</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine is central to reinforcement learning, classically linked to reward prediction error signaling. However, recent findings suggest a more complex picture, with dopamine neurons responding to aversive or non-reward-related events and displaying diverse projection patterns. To investigate how dopamine release varies across the brain, we used multi-site fiber photometry to recors dopamine dynamics in mice performing tasks involving both rewarding and aversive outcomes. We found that while reward-related dopamine signals were broadly distributed, responses to aversive events were region-specific, enabling classification of projection targets from these dopamine dynamics. By examining the main axis of covariance of dopamine release across the brain, we found that reward prediction error signals are encoded by parallel manifolds, whereas aversive stimulus signals are encoded by orthogonal manifolds. Thus, our findings support a distributed, vector-valued model of dopaminergic signaling, in which anatomically and functionally distinct pathways contribute to encoding of reinforcement-related variables across the brain.

">NeuroConText: Contrastive Learning for Neuroscience Meta-Analysis with Rich Text Representation</a></h4>

              
                Coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) is a common approach to synthesize information about human brain function across existing literature, enabling researchers to formulate hypotheses and contextualize new findings. However, automated CBMA tools face challenges such as inconsistent terminology, limited ability to analyze long texts, and difficulty capturing semantic meaning, as they still rely on bag-of-words approaches. In addition, sparse coordinate reporting distorts the activation distribution due to incomplete data. This paper introduces NeuroConText, an automated CBMA tool that bridges neuroscience text, brain location coordinates, and brain images by creating a shared latent space for encoding text and brain maps. Our method relies on a multi-objective loss combining contrastive and reconstruction terms. It leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract neuroscientific information from full-text articles and employs an LLM-based text augmentation strategy to improve generalization to short-text inputs. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate NeuroConText's ability to enhance text-to-brain retrieval performance and reconstruct brain maps from neuroscience texts. We also show that CBMA tools can infer brain activations in regions discussed in articles but absent from reported coordinates, potentially addressing the challenge of sparse coordinate reporting.

">Correlations of neural predictability and information transfer in cortex and their relation to predictive coding</a></h4>

              
                Predictive-coding like theories agree in describing top-down communication through the cortical hierarchy as a transmission of predictions generated by internal models of the inputs. With respect to the bottom-up connections, however, these theories differ in the neural processing strategies suggested for updating the internal model. Some theories suggest a coding strategy where unpredictable inputs, i.e., those not captured by the internal model, are passed on through the cortical hierarchy, whereas others claim that the predictable part of the inputs is passed on. Here, we addressed which neural coding strategy is employed in cortico-cortical connections using an information-theoretic approach. Our framework allows for quantifying two core aspects of both strategies, namely, predictability of inputs and information transfer, through local active information storage and local transfer entropy, respectively. A previous study on the neural processing of retinal ganglion cells connected to the lateral geniculate nucleus showed a coding for predictable information, captured by an increase in the information transfer with the predictability of inputs. Here, we further investigate predictive coding strategies at the cortical level. In particular, we analyzed LFP activity obtained from intracranial EEG recordings in humans and spike recordings from mouse cortex. We detected cortico-cortical connections with increasing information transfer with the predictability of inputs in recorded channels from frontal, parietal and temporal areas in human cortex. In the mouse visual system, we detected connections exhibiting both an increase and decrease in the information transfer with input predictability, although the former was predominant. Our evidence supports the presence of both predictive coding strategies at the cortical level, with a potential predominance of encoding for predictable information.

">Stress-Induced Alteration of Small Extracellular Vesicles Drives Amyloid-Beta Sequestration and Exacerbates Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis</a></h4>

              
                While small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are implicated in amyloid-beta (A {beta}) trafficking, the mechanisms governing their interaction with A {beta} ; aggregates and plaque formation remain unresolved. Here, we report a paradigm-shifting discovery: sEVs undergo dynamic structural remodelling in response to stress, enabling selective binding to A {beta} ; aggregates- a phenomenon absent under normal physiological conditions. Using multimodal stressors, including mechanical (ultrasonication/agitation), physical (hyperthermia), and biological (oxidative damage), we demonstrate that stress-modified sEVs exhibit high-affinity binding to small A {beta} ; aggregates (SA) through scaffold reorganization, as validated by super-resolution microscopy and quantitative colocalization assays. Crucially, these remodelled sEVs act as potent carriers, enhancing SA internalization by neuronal cells in vitro. Strikingly, in post-mortem Alzheimer' s disease (AD) brains and APP-PS1 transgenic mice, sEVs were spatially enriched at amyloid plaque margins, suggesting a direct role in A {beta} ; sequestration and plaque expansion. Consistent with clinical relevance, sEVs isolated from AD patients exhibited an intrinsic SA-binding capacity, recapitulating stress-induced interactions observed experimentally. Our findings reveal that stress-primed sEVs function as pathological chaperones, binding to and internalizing A {beta} ; aggregates, thereby accelerating plaque nucleation and disease progression. This study provides the first evidence of stress-mediated sEV plasticity as a critical driver of A {beta} ; pathology, redefining therapeutic strategies targeting extracellular vesicle biology in neurodegenerative disorders.

">Promoting social connectedness through multi-person neurofeedback</a></h4>

              
                Humans are inherently driven to build meaningful relationships, but attempts to socially connect with others are not always successful. This study investigates whether social connectedness can be improved by intentionally regulating inter-brain coupling, a neural correlate of successful social interactions. Using a multi-person neurofeedback system (i.e., a multi-brain computer interface), we showed dyads real-time visualizations of the extent to which their brainwaves (EEG signals) were "in sync". Our results showed that, compared to a sham control group, dyads who received multi-brain neurofeedback exhibited an increase in inter-brain coupling, and, critically, that this increase was associated with a higher sense of social connectedness. A chain mediation analysis suggested that this experience of enhanced social connectedness may have been driven by a sense of joint control and shared intentionality. Together, our findings showcase the potential for regulating inter-brain coupling to optimize human social relationships and behaviors.

">MACHINE LEARNING FOR MISSING DATA IMPUTATION IN ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH: PREDICTING MEDIAL TEMPORAL LOBE FLEXIBILITY</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) begins years before symptoms appear, making early detection essential. The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is one of the earliest regions affected, and its network flexibility, a dynamic measure of brain connectivity, may serve as a sensitive biomarker of early decline. Cognitive (acquisition, generalization), genetic (APOE, ABCA7), and biochemical (P-tau217) markers may predict MTL dynamic flexibility. Given the high rate of missing data in AD research, this study uses machine learning with advanced imputation methods to predict MTL dynamic flexibility from multimodal predictors in an aging cohort. METHODS: In an ongoing study at Rutgers's Aging and Brain Health Alliance, data from 656 participants are utilized, including cognitive assessments, genetic and blood-derived biomarkers, and demographics. Due to MRI-related constraints, only 34.15% of participants had measurable MTL dynamic flexibility from resting-state fMRI. To estimate MTL dynamic flexibility from available data, we evaluated four missing data handling methods (case deletion, MICE, MissForest, and GAIN), and trained five regression models: Ridge, k-NN, SVR, regression trees (bagging, random forest, boosting), and ANN. Hyperparameters were optimized via grid search with 3-fold cross-validation. Model performance was assessed using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and runtime through 5-fold cross-validation repeated 25 times to ensure robustness in clinical data settings. RESULTS: A total of 1,866 missing values (25.86%) were identified in the dataset, with only 42 complete cases (6.40%) remaining after listwise deletion, highlighting the need for effective imputation. In the initial analysis using only complete cases, support vector regression (SVR) achieved the lowest mean absolute error (MAE = 0.184), though overall performance was limited due to small sample size. In the second phase, three imputation techniques were applied, significantly improving model accuracy. MissForest combined with Random Forest produced the best results (MAE = 0.083), representing a 54.7% improvement over case deletion. Statistical analysis confirmed significant differences in performance across imputation methods (p < 0.001), with MissForest outperforming GAIN and MICE. GAIN was the fastest imputation method. DISCUSSION: The findings underscore the importance of using robust imputation strategies to maximize data utility and model reliability in studies with high missingness. Further research is needed, particularly incorporating additional neuroimaging measures, to localize the brain regions most affected by biomarker-driven changes and to refine predictive models for clinical applications.

">An information theory framework for capturing multi-connectivity via spatial network encoding reveals reduced population count (Hamming weight) localized to auditory, visual, and motor networks</a></h4>

              
                The human brain operates as a complex system where functional networks evolve and interact across spatially distributed regions. In traditional neuroimaging analyses, functional connectivity (FC), based on pairwise correlations or statistical dependencies of temporal fluctuations in the BOLD signal, has been a primary method for exploring interactions between brain regions and decoding brain function. However, traditional FC methods often overlook the intricate, multi-way interplay among brain elements that emerge from the brain's densely interconnected nature. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel voxel-centric framework that captures the multi-way interactions between voxels and networks identified via high-model order independent component analysis. This framework posits that individual voxels serve as critical mediators of multi-network communication, reflecting the brain's complex functional architecture. By encoding voxel contributions from brain networks into binary representations and quantifying the population count at each voxel via Hamming weights, the proposed method prioritizes high-contribution voxels that facilitate inter-network interactions. This approach provides new insights into the brain's functional organization, revealing previously unrecognized patterns of voxel-to-network entanglement. Specifically, in the context of schizophrenia, our method enables the identification of spatial patterns that may underpin the cognitive and perceptual disturbances characteristic of the disorder. This enhanced understanding could improve diagnostic precision and help tailor interventions that target specific dysfunctional networks, offering a pathway to more effective treatments and better patient outcomes in schizophrenia.

">Differential age effects on functional network development link to contextual memory disruption in APOE4 versus APOE3 homozygous mice</a></h4>

              
                Apolipoprotein-{varepsilon}4 (APOE4) homozygosity is the strongest genetic risk-factor for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The combined effects of APOE4 with age on the brain are unclear. In the present work, we tested the hypothesis that age alters contextual fear memory, functional network topology, diffusion imaging measures, and RNA expression differentially between APOE4 and APOE3 homozygous mice. Male and female mice, 1.5-5.5 month (young) and 9-13.5 month (adult), homozygous for human APOE4 or APOE3, were scanned using an 11.1 Tesla MRI scanner. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were performed, and images were processed and analyzed, followed by a contextual fear conditioning (CFC) protocol to test contextual memory. Functional imaging revealed decreases in various functional network measures and decreased network development for APOE4 adults as well as significant differences between groups in brain activity in motor, sensory, memory, and emotional processing related regions. APOE3 adult mice showed increasing network complexity with aging. DTI-based fractional anisotropy (FA) increased with age independent of genotype. Behaviorally APOE4 adult mice experienced contextual memory dysfunction relative to other groups. No sex differences were observed. The results suggest that in APOE4 adult mice there may be a link of network connectivity changes with increases in fear behavior and a decreased ability to recognize contextual changes. Furthermore, the lack of network development in aging APOE4 mice is indicative of a loss of functional network resilience in the brains of AD-susceptible individuals.

">Combining cortical and spinal stimulation maximizes improvement of gait after spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                Most spinal cord injuries (SCI) spare descending motor pathways and sublesional networks, which can be activated through motor cortex and spinal cord stimulation to mitigate locomotor deficits. However, the potential synergy between cortical and spinal stimulation as a neuroprosthetic intervention remains unknown. Here, we first investigated phase-locked electrical stimulation of the motor cortex and lumbar spinal cord at 40 Hz in a rat model of unilateral SCI. Combining cortical and lumbar stimulation around the anticipated lift synergistically enhanced leg movements. When integrated into rehabilitation training, cortical stimulation proved essential for recovery of skilled locomotion. As a further refinement, we next investigated the effects of high-frequency (330 Hz) lumbar and sacral stimulation combined with cortical stimulation. Timely integration during the swing phase showed that cortical and rostral lumbar stimulations enhance the initial and mid-swing phases, while sacral stimulation improves extension velocity in the late swing. These findings indicate that supraspinal and sublesional neuromodulation offer complementary neuroprosthetic effects in targeted SCI gait rehabilitation.

">Epigenetic modifiers to treat retinal degenerative diseases</a></h4>

              
                We have previously demonstrated the ability of inhibitors of LSD1 and HDAC1 to block rod degeneration, preserve vision, maintain rod-specific transcripts and downregulate those involved in inflammation, gliosis, and cell death in the rd10 mouse model of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP). To extend our findings we tested the hypothesis that this effect was due to altered chromatin structure by using a range of inhibitors of chromatin condensation to prevent photoreceptor degeneration in the rd10 mouse model. We used inhibitors for G9A/GLP that catalyzes methylation of H3K9, for EZH2 that catalyzes trimethylation of H3K27, and compared them to the actions of inhibitors of LSD1 and HDAC. All the inhibitors decondense chromatin and all preserve, to different extents, retinas from degeneration in rd10 mice, but they act through different metabolic pathways. One group of inhibitors, modifiers for LSD1 and EZH2, demonstrate a high level of maintenance of rod-specific transcripts, activation of Ca+2 and Wnt signaling pathways with inhibition of antigen processing and presentation, immune response and microglia phagocytosis. Another group of inhibitors, modifiers for HDAC and G9A/GLP work through upregulation of NGF-stimulated transcription, while down-regulating genes belong to immune response, extracellular matrix, cholesterol signaling and programmed cell death. Our results provide robust support for our hypothesis that inhibition of chromatin condensation can be sufficient to prevent rod death in rd10 mice.

">Age-related changes in proprioception are of limited size, outcome-dependent and task-dependent.</a></h4>

              
                Our ability to sense of the position and movement of our limbs is essential for all activities of daily living. This ability arises from the signal sent by muscle spindles to the brain. While there is clear evidence for age-related changes in the quantity of muscle spindles and in their sensitivity, behavioral assessment of age-related changes in position sense have produced mixed findings. Yet, study results are difficult to compare since there is no golden standard for assessment of proprioception. Therefore, we measured upper limb proprioception across several standard proprioceptive tasks together with key factors that could influence behavioral results such as touch, motor function, and cognition in 37 young (19-32 years old) and 35 older (53-71 years old) adults. We tested age-related differences in behavioral outcomes and their associations across tasks. Our results showed that age-related effects were very variable across position sense tasks, ranging from tasks where older participants performed better to tasks where they exhibit large age-related differences in position sense. These results were confirmed by meta-analysis based on data from hundreds of participants tested in our laboratory on the exact same tasks. Even within a task, different outcomes exhibit opposite age-related effects. Associations between outcome variables across or within proprioceptive tasks were overall negligible to weak. In conclusion, age-related changes in proprioception are limited, task- and outcome-dependent, and current tasks used to assess proprioception do not provide consistent evidence of age-related impairment in upper limb proprioception.

">Cellular and subcellular specialization enables biology-constrained deep learning</a></h4>

              
                Learning and memory in the brain depend on changes in the strengths of synaptic connections between neurons. While the molecular and cellular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity have been extensively studied experimentally, much of our understanding of how plasticity is organized across populations of neurons during task learning comes from training artificial neural networks (ANNs) using computational methods. However, the architectures of modern ANNs and the algorithms used to train them are not compatible with fundamental principles of neuroscience, leaving a gap in understanding how the brain coordinates learning across multiple layers of neural circuitry. Here we leverage recent experimental evidence to test an emergent theory that biological learning depends on specialization of distinct neuronal cell types and compartmentalized signaling within neuronal dendrites. We demonstrate that multilayer ANNs comprised of separate recurrently connected excitatory and inhibitory cell types, and neuronal units with separate soma and dendrite compartments, can be trained to accurately classify images using a fully biology-compatible deep learning algorithm called dendritic target propagation. By adhering to strict biological constraints, this model is able to provide unique insight into the biological mechanisms of learning and to make experimentally testable predictions regarding the roles of specific neuronal cell types in coordinating learning across different brain regions.

">Obesity dysregulates feeding-evoked response dynamics in hypothalamic satiety neurons</a></h4>

              
                Melanocortin-4 receptor-expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH-MC4R) integrate hunger-promoting and hunger-suppressing signals to regulate satiety. Food consumption-evoked responses in PVH-MC4R neurons increase gradually during meal consumption to promote satiety, and disrupting this process drives massive obesity. These critical satiety neurons are strongly affected by a high-fat diet, yet the impact on their functional properties remains unknown. We used fiber photometry to track PVH-MC4R neuron responses to the consumption of drops of milkshake in animals fed a chow diet or a high-fat diet (HFD), both after obesity was established and after its reversal. PVH-MC4R neurons in HFD-fed animals showed greater consumption-evoked responses than chow-fed animals at the early stages of meal consumption, and these responses did not increase further during the meal. HFD-fed animals also showed reduced licking vigor and motivation to consume Ensure. Switching HFD-fed obese animals to a normal chow diet (NCD) re-engaged the motivation to consume Ensure, partially restoring early-meal neural responses to a lower level, but did not restore the increase in consumption-evoked response magnitude across the meal. These findings highlight functional alterations in hypothalamic satiety-promoting neurons in obesity and provide insight into the pathological neural consequences of an obesogenic environment.

">Predictive remapping and allocentric coding as consequences of energy efficiency in recurrent neural network models of active vision</a></h4>

              
                Despite moving our eyes from one location to another, our perception of the world is stable - an aspect thought to rely on predictive computations that use efference copies to predict the upcoming foveal input. Are these complex computations genetically hard-coded, or can they emerge from simpler principles? Here we consider the organism's limited energy budget as a potential origin. We expose a recurrent neural network to sequences of fixation patches and saccadic efference copies, training the model to minimise energy consumption (preactivation). We show that targeted inhibitory predictive remapping emerges from this energy efficiency optimization alone. As furthermore demonstrated, this computation relies on the model's learned ability to re-code egocentric eye-coordinates into an allocentric (image-centric) reference frame. Together, our findings suggest that both allocentric coding and predictive remapping can emerge from energy efficiency constraints during active vision, demonstrating how complex neural computations can arise from simple physical principles.

">Propagation of Beta bursts from the motor cortex to the motor units of multiple upper-limb muscles</a></h4>

              
                Beta band (13-30 Hz) oscillations are crucial for motor control, though their functional significance remains debated. Recent research suggests that beta activity occurs in transient bursts, which may better capture its role in movement regulation than sustained oscillations. While cortical and subcortical beta bursts have been extensively studied, their transmission to muscles - particularly in the upper limb - remains poorly understood and has been limited by traditional bipolar EMG techniques. In this study, we used high-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) and electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the cortico-peripheral dynamics of beta bursts in forearm extensor muscles during isometric contractions at the motor unit (MU) level. We show that MU activity in the upper limb exhibits discrete beta bursts that are temporally aligned with cortical beta activity. Notably, beta bursts in the periphery were time-locked to cortical bursts, suggesting strong coordination and synchronisation of bursting across the corticospinal tract. We also found stronger beta synchronisation in the extensor carpi ulnaris compared to the extensor carpi radialis, indicating muscle-specific differences in shared neural drive. These findings provide the first demonstration of beta burst propagation from cortex to upper-limb MUs and show that HDsEMG can reliability detect such events in the upper limb. This work supports the cortical origin and structure of peripheral beta activity and demonstrates its potential as a neurophysiological biomarker for targeting corticospinal dynamics in motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease.

                Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a key regulator of microglial function, and its loss-of-function variants are linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neurodegenerative disorders. While TREM2 activation is a promising therapeutic strategy, no small molecule agonists acting via direct TREM2 binding have been reported to date. Here, we describe the discovery of first-in-class, direct small molecule TREM2 agonists identified through DNA-encoded library (DEL) screening. The DEL hit (4a) demonstrated TREM2 binding affinity, as validated by three biophysical screening platforms (TRIC, MST, and SPR), induced Syk phosphorylation, and enhanced microglial phagocytosis. Preliminary optimization yielded 4i, which maintained TREM2 engagement with improved selectivity over TREM1 and no cytotoxicity. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that 4a stabilizes a transient binding pocket on TREM2, suggesting a novel mechanism for receptor activation. These findings provide the first proof-of-concept for direct pharmacological TREM2 agonism, offering a foundation for developing therapeutics against AD and related disorders.

">Effects of bilateral and unilateral mental practice on actual motor performance and event-related desynchronization</a></h4>

              
                Bilateral hand movement has been reported to enhance actual motor performance and increase motor cortex activation more than unilateral hand movement. This study investigated the interaction effects of bilateral and unilateral mental practice on event-related desynchronization (ERD) amplitude and unilateral motor performance, to explore better clinical rehabilitation for stroke patients with hemiparesis. The task was a ball rotation, where participants circulated two balls on their palm by using their fingers. Seventy-six healthy young adults were randomly assigned to one of three mental practice groups or a control group without mental practice. In the mental practice groups, three subgroups of participants engaged in ball-rotation motor imagery for two blocks in different orders: bilateral hand imagery followed by left hand imagery (BL group), left hand imagery followed by bilateral hand imagery (LB group), and consecutive left hand imagery (LL group).  The results showed greater improvement in actual motor performance in the BL group than in the control group, while the performance of the LB and LL groups did not significantly differ from that of the control group. Greater ERD was observed in the BL group than in the LL group in the early sets of the first block. However, ERD amplitude decreased with continued mental practice, and significant correlations between ERD and motor performance were limited. These results suggest that engaging in bilateral mental practice before unilateral mental practice is beneficial in improving unilateral motor performance. Bilateral mental practice following unilateral mental practice may provide neither notable improvements nor detrimental effects on unilateral motor action. Our findings also reveal a mismatch between ERD and motor performance, implying that these two measures are not straightforwardly linked.

                Mating status often modulates responses to courtship sounds in animals. The neural mechanisms underlying this modulation, however, have not been well clarified. Here, we show that dopaminergic signals are involved in modulating the responses of auditory sensory neurons in Drosophila melanogaster females depending on their mating status. These neurons abundantly express three types of dopamine receptors, with some having direct synaptic connections with dopaminergic neurons. Of these receptors, suppressing the expression of Dop1R2 reduces sound responses of auditory sensory neurons in unmated but not mated females. Moreover, expression of Dop1R2 in auditory sensory neurons enhances the song response behavior of unmated females, manifested by copulation receptivity when exposed to songs. Our research suggests that dopaminergic modulation via Dop1R2 is involved in mating state-dependent regulation of auditory sensory processing.

">Mechanical compression induces neuronal apoptosis, reduces synaptic activity, and promotes glial neuroinflammation in mice and humans</a></h4>

              
                Mass effect, characterized by the compression and deformation of neural tissue from space-occupying lesions, can lead to debilitating neurological symptoms and poses a significant clinical challenge. In the primary brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM), we have shown previously that compressive solid stress originating from the growing tumor reduces cerebral blood flow, leads to neuronal loss, increased functional impairment, and poor clinical outcomes. However, the direct effects of compression on neurons and the underlying biophysical mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, using multi-scale compression systems and physiologically relevant in vitro and in vivo models, we find that mechanical compression induces neuronal apoptosis and synapse loss, leading to disrupted neural network activity. This is accompanied by increased HIF-1 signaling and upregulation of downstream stress-adaptive genes in neurons. We further show that compression triggers AP-1 - driven gene expression in glial cells, promoting a neuroinflammatory response. Together, these findings reveal that solid stress directly contributes to neuronal dysfunction and inflammation caused by GBM by activating distinct pathways that can be targeted in future studies for neuroprotection.

">An algorithm to model the non-random connectome of cortical circuitry</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal connectivity has been characterized at various scales and with respect to various structural aspects. In models of connectivity, it has so far remained difficult to match all of them at once, in particular the higher-order structure appears to be elusive. Here we introduce a new type of graph model that matches non-random structure characterized and described as relevant in biological neuronal networks. The structure emerges because the algorithm considers the need for axons to physically bridge the gap from soma to dendrites. If it targets one neuron, probabilities that it also targets other nearby neurons increase. We demonstrate that the algorithm can be successfully fit to complex, biologically relevant reference connectomes. Furthermore, we outline an intuitive expansion of the model from merely local to a combination of local and long-range connectivity. We provide a performant implementation that can be used to instantiate point neuron or morphologically-detailed network models at whole-cortex scale.

">Node persistence from topological data analysis reveals changes in brain functional connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Large-scale analyses of brain functional connectivity can uncover disruptions in regional activity and connectivity that are commonly associated with neurological disorders or cognitive decline associated with healthy aging. In our study, we employ persistent homology (PH), a prominent tool in topological data analysis (TDA), to investigate changes in resting-state functional connectivity in healthy aging and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We analyze functional connectivity changes across three distinct scales: (a) global scale (brain-wide changes), (b) mesoscopic scale (resting-state network-level changes), and (c) local scale (region-level changes). At the local scale, we introduce node persistence, a novel and scalable PH-based measure that detects brain regions with significant differences in healthy aging or ASD. Notably, these regions overlap with regions whose non-invasive stimulation improves motor function in the elderly or alleviates ASD symptoms, suggesting the utility of node persistence in identifying clinically relevant brain regions affected by aging and ASD.

">Numerical validation of 3D-VAR data assimilation for estimating network dynamics in multivariate EEGs</a></h4>

              
                Data assimilation (DA) is widely used as a data-driven system identification method, enhancing our understanding of the generative mechanisms in the observational data based on the identified model and its parameters. Due to this advantage, DA has gradually begun to be applied in neuroscience studies. Recently, we introduced a DA-based method for reconstructing the internal state of the brain using the neural mass model and human scalp electroencephalography (EEG). This method allows us to estimate the balance of synaptic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons (E/I balance) in the brain only from observed EEGs. Although we confirmed the neurophysiological validity of the proposed EEG-DA method in our recent works, this method cannot be applied to multivariate EEGs to parallelly infer the E/I balance changes and underlying network dynamics. In this study, to address this issue, we proposed an extended version of our DA method specified to multivariate observed EEGs. This method enables us to estimate sensor-level functional network and E/I balance changes of each EEG sensor in parallel. The method was validated by showing that it could parallelly estimate sensor-level network structures and E/I balance changes from synthetic multivariate EEGs. The results of this study indicate that it has the potential to quantify how the E/I balance changes functionally affect the brain network dynamics.

">Unveiling functional-metabolic synergy in the healthy brain: multivariate integration of dynamic FDG-PET and resting-state fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Despite accounting for only 2% of body weight, the human brain requires significant amounts of glucose, even at rest, underscoring the importance of functional-metabolic relationships. Previous studies revealed moderate associations between resting-state fMRI functional connectivity (FC) and local metabolism via [18F]FDG-PET, yet much remains to be understood, particularly regarding their coupling between functional and metabolic networks. To this end, we employed multivariate Partial Least Squares Correlation (PLSC) to investigate the functional-metabolic relationship at both nodal and network level. From dynamic [18F]FDG-PET data we estimated parameters describing glucose metabolism-delivery rate (K1), phosphorylation rate (k3), and fractional uptake (Ki)-and generated within-individual metabolic connectivity (MC) networks. FC was derived from fMRI data filtered into two frequency bands and summarized as region-wise strength to capture nodal characteristics. Our findings revealed that glucose delivery is linked with FC strength, particularly when fMRI signal frequencies include greater hemodynamic contributions. Even stronger functional-metabolic coupling occurs at the network level in the low-frequency fMRI band, with higher MC between sensory/attention and transmodal networks supporting stronger FC within sensory/attention areas. By leveraging PLSC, this work deepens our understanding of the functional-metabolic synergy in the healthy brain, providing new insights into its organization.

">Effects of speaker and listener sex on auditory attention decoding performance</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Auditory Attention Decoding (AAD) is a technique utilizing brain signals to decode on which sound the listener focuses the attention. In most current studies, the effect of type of speech materials used and sex of the listener is not considered. We investigated the effect on AAD performance of factors related to the speaker (such as the sex of the speaker, background noise level, and same versus mixed-sex conditions) and the listener (sex of the listener). Design: Forty-two young adults with normal hearing participated in the study. They listened to 2 competing speakers and were instructed to attend to one speaker and ignore the other speaker, whilst electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) were measured. Background noise was introduced in half of the conditions. AAD performance was compared across eight experimental conditions. Results: A significant main effect of speaker sex was found: A male target and/or male masker speaker resulted in higher AAD performance compared to a female speaker with a higher fundamental frequency. These effects were found to be small and therefore likely clinically irrelevant. Conclusion: While no substantial effects were found on the factors investigated in this study, including diverse and realistic training scenarios remains a valuable approach to prevent potential influences from other factors.

">Interictal activity fluctuations follow rather than precede seizures on multiple time scales in a mouse model of focal cortical dysplasia</a></h4>

              
                The unpredictability of seizure occurrence is a major debilitating factor for people with epilepsy. A seizure forecasting system would greatly improve their quality of life. Successful seizure forecasting necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing seizure timing at multiple temporal scales. In this study, we investigated multiscale properties of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and seizure parameters in a highly realistic mouse model of focal cortical dysplasia-related epilepsy. We analyzed the properties' evolution at four timescales, ranging from epilepsy progression and seizure clusters to circadian and peri-ictal changes. We discovered that the FCD-related epilepsy syndrome was progressive in terms of interictal activity rate and seizure characteristics. Sixty percent of seizures occurred in clusters. During the clusters, the seizure duration, seizure power, and IED rate were increasing. Circadian rhythm influenced seizure occurrence with the peak seizure probability at 4 p.m. under a standard 12/12 light dark cycle with lights-on at 6 a.m. Peri-ictal analysis revealed no significant change in IED rate preceding individual seizures; however, a consistent two-peak pattern of IED elevation was observed following seizures. Specifically, an initial peak in IED rate emerged 5-10 minutes post-seizure, returning to baseline within two hours, followed by a secondary peak 6-12 hours later, which again subsided to baseline levels in 24-48 hours. This pattern could be fitted with a sum of three exponentials. Using the three-exponential pattern, we simulated IED rate fluctuations in each animal. The smoothed simulated IED rates showed good agreement with the smoothed real recorded IED rates, suggesting that the cumulative effect of post-ictal IED patterns can account for long-term fluctuations in IED rate. Our results indicate that, in our model of FCD-related epilepsy, consistent IED rate fluctuations follow rather than precede individual seizures. Therefore, fluctuations in IED rate can be viewed as a reflection of cyclic seizure occurrence. This implies that either IED rate fluctuations or accurate seizure records may be equally valuable for seizure risk forecasting.

Adopting a network perspective, we examine the functional connectivity patterns during the early stages of learning, demonstrating that the brain undergoes extensive network reorganization, regardless of the acquisition method. Our findings reveal a general segregation of task-positive networks from the default mode network, which is paralleled by and may facilitate the integration within and between task-positive networks. This segregation-integration pattern likely reflects a balance between internal and external task-related processes, modulated by learning progression and task difficulty across different acquisition modes. Differences between learning conditions, as well as brain connectivity–behavior associations between rule learning and rule implementation, point to varying cognitive demands: more efficient learning in instruction-based learning, inhibitory processes in observation-based learning, and the integration of reward, valence, and somatomotor processes in trial-and-error learning. We conclude that while extensive neural reorganization occurs during the initial learning trials, irrespective of response implementation or acquisition mode, this reorganization also exhibits distinct features that support the unique demands of each learning method.</span>

We propose that memory consolidation during sleep is a continuation of the neurodevelopmental process that proceeds through a kind of inversion of waking active inference: NREM sleep first refines the brain’s representations of new, unpredicted experiences during waking, implementing inhibitory mechanisms of long-term depression that both differentiate and stabilize new representations for consolidation. REM sleep then updates the organism’s generative world model in light of this new learning through excitatory long-term potentiation of synaptic plasticity.

The role of microglia (the brain-resident immune cells) in mediating this process remains uncertain. In this study, our findings showed that sleep loss induces mania-like behavior, microglial loss, and time-dependent gene expression changes. Moreover, diurnal oscillations in circadian rhythm-associated and inflammation-related gene expression in the mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC) were altered following sleep deprivation (SD). Further correlative analysis revealed correlations in gene expression between marker genes for microglia and <span style="font-style:italic;">Clock</span> genes. In addition, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Clock</span> mutation induces mania-like behavior, inhibition of neural activity, and microglial loss. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant alterations in inflammatory pathways, circadian rhythm-related pathways, and the major histocompatibility protein complex in <span style="font-style:italic;">Clock</span><sup>Δ19</sup> mice. Subsequent correlative analysis demonstrated significant correlations in gene expression among inflammation-, circadian rhythm-, and synapse-related genes within the PFC and hypothalamus of both male and female <span style="font-style:italic;">Clock</span><sup>Δ19</sup> mice. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated behavioral, cellular, and molecular changes in SD-induced mice and <span style="font-style:italic;">Clock</span>-mutant mice models. Microglia and <span style="font-style:italic;">CLOCK</span> were associated with mania-like behaviors. Future research will likely focus on microglia-targeted approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of BD.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Microglia exhibit complex and dynamic morphology that is linked to function. Altered microglia function has been implicated in multiple diseases of the brain, including elevated phagocytosis of neuronal dendritic spines in schizophrenia. However, understanding the relationship between altered microglia and pathophysiology first requires a clearer picture of microglia morphology in the non-diseased brain, which has yet to be fully established. Here, we deploy immunostaining and confocal microscopy to sample over 1,300 microglia from two prefrontal cortex (PFC) subregions in postmortem human brain (3 males, 3 females). We use Neurolucida 360 to trace the 3-dimensional structure of these microglia and quantify interactions with dendritic spines. We find that PFC microglia in male subjects display overall more complex branching than in female subjects, and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) microglia are more complexly branched with more round somas than those in the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), irrespective of sex. Furthermore, a lower proportion of phagocytic burden in sgACC microglia involves engulfment of dendritic spines compared to DLPFC. Overall, our results paint a detailed and nuanced picture of microglia morphology and function in subjects unaffected by psychiatric or neurologic illness that can be used as a benchmark for future studies of the diseased brain.</span>

                Paulsen et al. demonstrate that multiple KSHV miRNAs suppress STING expression to evade innate immunity. Deletion of these miRNAs restores STING-dependent innate immunity, delaying KSHV lytic reactivation from latency. This study discovers a mechanism of viral immune evasion through miRNA-mediated regulation of the cGAS/STING pathway.

                <p>The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is thought to play a central role in human social perception, cognition, and behavior. In adults, the mPFC is involved in representing and interpreting the mental states in self and others. Developmental research using neuroimaging techniques like functional near-infrared spectroscopy and functional magnetic resonance imaging has begun to extend these findings into infancy. Novel evidence reviewed in this opinion demonstrates that infant mPFC (1) plays a specialized, proactive, and evaluative role in social perception, (2) is involved in connecting with other minds while interacting and when watching other minds interact, and (3) predicts overt social behavior beyond infancy.

                Background The Thai version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale (WHOQOL-BREF-THAI) has been verified among a variety of populations. However, there is a lack of existing research on its comprehensive psychometric properties, specifically when used with nursing students. This study examined the WHOQOL-BREF’s unique psychometric features with Thai nursing students in northeast Thailand. Methods In this cross-sectional study, Thai nursing students were recruited using multi-stage simple random sampling from universities located in the northeast of Thailand. The data was collected via self-assessment questionnaires, and the 3,570 participants were then randomly split into two subsamples (group 1, n=2,000, and group 2, n=1,570). After reducing the number of items using statistical methods, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was carried out on group 1 to explore the factor structure of the WHOQOL-BREF-THAI. Finally, group 2 was used in a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to validate the EFA’s modified structure along with an assessment of the construct validity of the WHOQOL-BREF-THAI. Results Principal component analysis on a random subsample supported a four-factor model with 24 items, originally suggested for factorial construct validity; these 24 items were distributed across the original four domain. The domain structure for the purpose showed a good fit in the CFA on the other subsample. Internal reliability was satisfactory (Cronbach’s alpha was greater than 0.70) for both the total scale and subscales. In terms of convergent validity, average variance extracted (AVE) revealed that all WHOQOL-BREF-THAI subscales achieved convergence, with AVE values ranging from 0.50 to 0.69. Conclusion These results reveal that the WHOQOL-BREF-THAI is a valid and reliable tool which health care providers can utilize to measure QOL among Thai nursing students. Therefore, the WHOQOL-BREF can serve as an essential tool for researching the factors influencing nursing students’ QOL, with implications for nursing education.

                Background This study explores the complex relationship between organizational politics, emotional intelligence and employee behavior in contemporary settings. Organizational politics, which is widespread in organizational settings, has a substantial impact on different aspects of employee behavior. Emotional Intelligence has become a vital factor in individuals’ capacity to successfully traverse the complexities of an organization. This study consolidates current material to offer insights into the impact of organizational politics on employee behavior and the mediating role of emotional intelligence in this connection. Methods A survey was undertaken with a sample size of 500 employees hailing from several Information Technology (IT) and Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES) firms in the Dehradun (Uttarakhand) region. The study employed quantitative methodologies to investigate the correlations between Emotional Intelligence, Perceived Organizational Politics and Employee Behavior. The data were evaluated using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) to examine the hypothesized correlations and mediation effects. Results The study identified substantial correlations between Emotional Intelligence, Perceived Organizational Politics, and Employee Behavior. Emotional Intelligence was discovered to have a positive impact on Behavioral Dynamics. Perceived Organizational Politics had a substantial influence on both Emotional Intelligence and Behavioral Dynamics. Factors such as Need for Power, Relationship Conflict, Resource Constraints, Role Conflict, and Workforce Diversity were discovered to have an impact on Perceived Organizational Politics. Conclusions The results confirm strong connections between organizational politics, emotional intelligence, and employee behavior, highlighting the significance of these concepts in comprehending employee behavior in organizational environments. The study proposes that enhancing employees' emotional intelligence can alleviate the adverse effects of organizational politics, resulting in enhanced behavioral dynamics. The study also addresses the limits, outlines potential areas for further research, and highlights the managerial implications. It suggests that firms should prioritize the development of emotional intelligence to cultivate a favorable work environment.

                <p>by Yuxiang Zhan, Francesco Musella, Frank Alber</p>

The genome is organized into distinct chromatin compartments with at least two main classes, a transcriptionally active A and an inactive B compartment, broadly corresponding to euchromatin and heterochromatin. Chromatin regions within the same compartment preferentially interact with each other over regions in the opposite compartment. A/B compartments are traditionally identified from ensemble Hi-C contact frequency matrices using principal component analysis of their covariance matrices. However, defining compartments at the single-cell level from sparse single-cell Hi-C data is challenging, especially since homologous copies are often not resolved. To address this, we present MaxComp, an unsupervised method, for inferring single-cell A/B compartments based on 3D geometric considerations in single-cell chromosome structures—derived either from multiplexed FISH-omics imaging or 3D structure models derived from Hi-C data. By representing each 3D chromosome structure as an undirected graph with edge-weights encoding structural information, MaxComp reformulates compartment prediction as a variant of the Max-cut problem, solved using semidefinite graph programming (SPD) to optimally partition the graph into two structural compartments. Our results show that the population average of MaxComp single-cell compartment annotations closely matches those derived from ensemble Hi-C principal component analysis, demonstrating that compartmentalization can be recovered from geometric principles alone, using only the 3D coordinates and nuclear microenvironment of chromatin regions. Our approach reveals widespread cell-to-cell variability in compartment organization, with substantial heterogeneity across genomic loci. When applied to multiplexed FISH imaging data, MaxComp also uncovers relationships between compartment annotations and transcriptional activity at the single-cell level. In summary, MaxComp offers a new framework for understanding chromatin compartmentalization in single cells, connecting 3D genome architecture, and transcriptional activity with the cell-to-cell variations of chromatin compartments.

                <p>by Owen M. O’Connor, Mary J. Dunlop</p>

Deep learning-based methods for identifying and tracking cells within microscopy images have revolutionized the speed and throughput of data analysis. These methods for analyzing biological and medical data have capitalized on advances from the broader computer vision field. However, cell tracking can present unique challenges, with frequent cell division events and the need to track many objects with similar visual appearances complicating analysis. Existing architectures developed for cell tracking based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have tended to fall short in managing the spatial and global contextual dependencies that are crucial for tracking cells. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Cell-TRACTR (Transformer with Attention for Cell Tracking and Recognition), a novel deep learning model that uses a transformer-based architecture. Cell-TRACTR operates in an end-to-end manner, simultaneously segmenting and tracking cells without the need for post-processing. Alongside this model, we introduce the Cell-HOTA metric, an extension of the Higher Order Tracking Accuracy (HOTA) metric that we adapted to assess cell division. Cell-HOTA differs from standard cell tracking metrics by offering a balanced and easily interpretable assessment of detection, association, and division accuracy. We test our Cell-TRACTR model on datasets of bacteria growing within a defined microfluidic geometry and mammalian cells growing freely in two dimensions. Our results demonstrate that Cell-TRACTR exhibits strong performance in tracking and division accuracy compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, while also meeting traditional benchmarks in detection accuracy. This work establishes a new framework for employing transformer-based models in cell segmentation and tracking.

Wavelet analysis has been recognized as a widely used and promising tool in the fields of signal processing and data analysis. However, the application of wavelet-based method in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is little known. Here, we present M-band wavelet-based scRNA-seq multi-view clustering of cells (WMC). We applied for integration of M-band wavelet analysis and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) to a panel of single cell sequencing datasets by breaking up the data matrix into an approximation or low resolution component and <i>M</i>–1 detail or high resolution components. Our method is armed with multi-view clustering of cell types, identity, and functional states, enabling missing cell types visualization and new cell types discovery. Distinct to standard scRNA-seq workflow, our wavelet-based approach is a new addition to uncover rare cell types with a fine resolution.

                <p>by Joseph James Tharayil, Jorge Blanco Alonso, Silvia Farcito, Bryn Lloyd, Armando Romani, Elvis Boci, Antonino Cassara, Felix Schürmann, Esra Neufeld, Niels Kuster, Michael Reimann</p>

As the size and complexity of network simulations accessible to computational neuroscience grows, new avenues open for research into extracellularly recorded electric signals. Biophysically detailed simulations permit the identification of the biological origins of the different components of recorded signals, the evaluation of signal sensitivity to different anatomical, physiological, and geometric factors, and selection of recording parameters to maximize the signal information content. Simultaneously, virtual extracellular signals produced by these networks may become important metrics for neuro-simulation validation. To enable efficient calculation of extracellular signals from large neural network simulations, we have developed <i>BlueRecording</i>, a pipeline consisting of standalone Python code, along with extensions to the Neurodamus simulation control application, the CoreNEURON computation engine, and the SONATA data format, to permit online calculation of such signals. In particular, we implement a general form of the reciprocity theorem, which is capable of handling non-dipolar current sources, such as may be found in long axons and recordings close to the current source, as well as complex tissue anatomy, dielectric heterogeneity, and electrode geometries. To our knowledge, this is the first application of this generalized (i.e., non-dipolar) reciprocity-based approach to simulate EEG recordings. We use these tools to calculate extracellular signals from an <i>in silico</i> model of the rat somatosensory cortex and hippocampus and to study signal contribution differences between regions and cell types.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003189">Predictable motion is progressively extrapolated across temporally distinct processing stages in the human visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by William Turner, Charlie Sexton, Philippa A. Johnson, Ella Wilson, Hinze Hogendoorn</p>

Neural processing of sensory information takes time. Consequently, to estimate the current state of the world, the brain must rely on predictive processes—for example, extrapolating the motion of a ball to determine its probable present position. Some evidence implicates early (pre-cortical) processing in extrapolation, but it remains unclear whether extrapolation continues during later-stage (cortical) processing, where further delays accumulate. Moreover, the majority of such evidence relies on invasive neurophysiological techniques in animals, with accurate characterization of extrapolation effects in the human brain currently lacking. Here, we address these issues by demonstrating how precise probabilistic maps can be constructed from human EEG recordings. Participants (<i>N</i> = 18, two sessions) viewed a stimulus moving along a circular trajectory while EEG was recorded. Using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classification, we extracted maps of stimulus location over time and found evidence of a forwards temporal shift occurring across temporally distinct processing stages. This accelerated emergence of position representations indicates extrapolation occurring at multiple stages of processing, with representations progressively shifted closer to real-time. We further show evidence of representational overshoot during early-stage processing following unexpected changes to an object’s trajectory, and demonstrate that the observed dynamics can emerge without supervision in a simulated neural network via spike-timing-dependent plasticity.

                Background Stroke survivors, particularly those of working age, are at an increased risk of recurrent stroke within one–five years of the initial event, largely due to suboptimal management of risk factors. This study aimed to identify lifestyle and occupational factors associated with recurrent stroke in this demographic population. Methods This case-control study included 100 patients with recurrent ischemic stroke and 200 ischemic stroke survivors without recurrence, who were recruited from the hospital database. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify significant factors associated with recurrence, which were presented as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results The mean age was 45.4 years (SD = 15.1) among cases and 50.6 years (SD = 6.5) among controls. The male-to-female ratios were 1.17:1 and 1.94:1 in the case and control groups, respectively. Significant factors associated with recurrent stroke included female sex (aOR: 1.83; 95% CI [1.10–3.29]), high fasting blood sugar (aOR: 3.70; 95% CI [1.66–8.27]), current alcohol consumption (aOR: 3.63; 95% CI [2.01–6.54]), sedentary lifestyle (aOR: 2.77; 95% CI [1.50–5.13]), and lack of workplace support for health (aOR: 2.02; 95% CI [1.13–3.63]). The associations between these factors and stroke recurrence varied according to the age group. Conclusions This study highlights the critical role of modifiable lifestyle and occupational factors in stroke recurrence among working-age adults. Tailored age-specific prevention strategies—emphasizing physical activity, reduced alcohol use, and improved workplace health environments—may reduce the risk of recurrence and enhance health outcomes in this population.

                The alpine tree frog (Litoria verreauxii alpina) is a threatened species found only above 1,200 meters within the Australian Alps. This species’ distribution has been severely limited due to the pathogentic amphibian chytrid fungus, and current populations persist by recruitment. Here, we provide the first publicly available genome for the genus. We used PacBio HiFi reads as well as Omni-C scaffolding data to construct a high-quality genome. We also generated a reproduction focused transcriptome from brain, liver, and gonad tissues. The genome was 2.77 Gb in length and consisted of 962 contigs with a contig N50 of 37.2 Mb and an L50 of 19. This study provides the first publicly available reference genome for the Litoria genus to assist in conservation and reproduction focused works in amphibian management.
