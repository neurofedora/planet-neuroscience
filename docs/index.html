     alt="[18F]FDG brain uptake of C57Bl/6 male mice is affected by locomotor activity after cocaine use: A small animal positron emission tomography study"/>
<p>Cocaine effects on brain glucose metabolism were evaluated in three different situations: after maintaining animals in a home cage; exposing them to open field; keeping them under anesthesia. When performing brain PET scanning, locomotor activity induced by cocaine might be a relevant factor, as in animals under anesthesia an acute cocaine injection induced higher [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG brain uptake. This is not seen when animals are left awake to experience the locomotor stimulant effect of the drug.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We verified if cocaine-induced peripheral activation might disrupt [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG brain uptake after a cocaine challenge and suggested an optimal protocol to measure cocaine-induced brain metabolic alterations in mice. C57Bl/6 male mice were injected with [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG and randomly separated into three groups. Groups 1 and 2 were kept conscious after [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG administration and after 5 min received saline or cocaine (20 mg/kg). The animals in group 1 (<i>n</i> = 5) were then evaluated in the open field for 30 min and those from group 2 (<i>n</i> = 6) were kept alone in a home cage for the same period. Forty-five minutes after [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG administration, images were acquired for 30 min. Group 3 (<i>n</i> = 6) was kept anesthetized and image acquisition started immediately after tracer injection, for 75 min. Saline (Day 1) or cocaine (Day 2) was injected 5 min after starting acquisition. Another set of animals (<i>n</i> = 5) were treated with cocaine every other day for 10 days or saline (<i>n</i> = 6) and were scanned with the dynamic protocol to verify its efficacy. [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG uptake increased after cocaine administration when compared to baseline only in animals kept under anesthesia. No brain effect of cocaine was observed in animals submitted to the open field or kept in the home cage. The use of anesthesia is essential to visualize cocaine-induced changes in brain metabolism by [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET, providing an interesting preclinical approach to investigate naïve subjects and enabling a bidirectional translational science approach for better understanding of cocaine use disorder.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is an adult-onset neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive ptosis, dysarthria, ophthalmoplegia, and distal muscle weakness. Recent studies revealed that GGC repeat expansions in 5′-UTR of <i>LRP12</i>, <i>GIPC1</i>, and <i>NOTCH2NLC</i> are associated with OPDM. Despite these advances, approximately 30% of OPDM patients remain genetically undiagnosed. Herein, we aim to investigate the genetic basis for undiagnosed OPDM patients in two unrelated Chinese Han families.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Parametric linkage analysis was performed. Long-read sequencing followed by repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction and amplicon length polymerase chain reaction were used to determine the genetic cause. Targeted methylation sequencing was implemented to detect epigenetic changes. The possible pathogenesis mechanism was investigated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, RNA fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization, and immunofluorescence staining of muscle biopsy samples.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The disease locus was mapped to 12q24.3. Subsequently, GGC repeat expansion in the promoter region of <i>RILPL1</i> was identified in six OPDM patients from two families, findings consistent with a founder effect, designated as OPDM type 4. Targeted methylation sequencing revealed hypermethylation at the <i>RILPL1</i> locus in unaffected individuals with ultralong expansion. Analysis of muscle samples showed no significant differences in <i>RILPL1</i> mRNA or RILPL1 protein levels between patients and controls. Public CAGE-seq data indicated that alternative transcription start sites exist upstream of the RefSeq-annotated <i>RILPL1</i> transcription start site. Strand-specific RNA-seq data revealed bidirectional transcription from the <i>RILPL1</i> locus. Finally, fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization/immunofluorescence staining showed that both sense and antisense transcripts formed RNA foci, and were co-localized with hnRNPA2B1 and p62 in the intranuclear inclusions of OPDM type 4 patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings implicate abnormal GGC repeat expansions in the promoter region of <i>RILPL1</i> as a novel genetic cause for OPDM, and suggest a methylation mechanism and a potential RNA toxicity mechanism are involved in OPDM type 4 pathogenesis. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Background: Fetal-neonatal iron deficiency (ID) causes long-term neurocognitive and affective dysfunctions. Clinical and preclinical studies showed that early-life ID produced sex-specific effects. However, little is known about molecular mechanisms behind the sex-specific effects of early-life ID on neural gene regulation. Objective: To illustrate sex-specific transcriptome alteration in adult rat hippocampus induced by fetal-neonatal ID and prenatal choline treatment. Methods: Pregnant rats were fed iron-deficient (4 mg/kg Fe) or iron-sufficient (200 mg/kg Fe) diet from gestational day (G) 2 to postnatal day (P) 7 with or without choline supplementation (5 g/kg choline) from G11-18. Hippocampi were collected from P65 offspring of both sexes and analyzed for changes in gene expression. Results: Both early-life ID and choline treatment induced more transcriptional changes in female rat hippocampus than males with a less than 10 percent overlap between sexes. While both sexes showed alterations in gene networks related to increased risks of neurocognitive disorders, males also showed enhanced anti-inflammatory activities in response to ID, contrary to activated pro-inflammatory responses in females. Prenatal choline treatment to ID animals partially rescued ID-induced dysregulations in males but showed less effects in females. However, choline treatment to iron-sufficient rats showed more negative effects on the regulation of genes associated with cognition and affective behaviors, especially in females. Conclusions: This study provided unbiased global assessments of gene expression regulated by iron and choline in a sex-specific manner, with greater negative effects in female than male rats. Our new findings highlight potential sex-specific gene networks for further investigation.

                Human brain experiences vibration of certain frequency during various physical activities such as vehicle transportation and machine operation or accidents, which may cause traumatic brain injury or other brain diseases. However, little is known about what happened to brain after vibration stimuli. Here, with a custom-built electromagnetic actuator, vibration was induced in the brain while cerebral blood flow (CBF) and brain stiffness were measured at 20, 30, 40 Hz for 52 healthy volunteers. With increasing frequency, multiple regions of the brain showed increasingly reduced CBF, while the size of such regions also expanded. The vibration-induced CBF reduction regions largely fell inside the brain's default mode network (DMN), with about 58 or 46 % overlap at 30 or 40 Hz, respectively. By establishing a biomechanical co-variance network based on tissue stiffness, analysis of small-world properties and modularity showed an increased disruption of the network with increased frequency. These findings demonstrate frequency-dependent features of vibration modulation to brain. Furthermore, the overlap between CBF reduction regions and DMN, and the vibration-induced decrease of biomechanical network connections suggest a interweaved relationship between blood flow, tissue stiffness, and cognitive functions. These may provide critical insights into the mechanical stimulus to brain and vibration-induced brain pathologies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">USP30 inhibition induces mitophagy and reduces oxidative stress in parkin-deficient and CCCP-stressed human iPSC-derived neurons</a></h4>

              
                Ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins plays an important role in the cellular regulation of mitophagy. The E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin (encoded by PARK2) and the ubiquitin-specific protease 30 (USP30) have both been reported to regulate ubiquitination of outer mitochondrial proteins and thereby mitophagy. Loss of E3 ligase activity is thought to be pathogenic in both sporadic and inherited Parkinson's disease (PD), with loss-of-function mutations in PARK2 being the most frequent cause of autosomal recessive PD. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether mitophagy induced by USP30 inhibition provides a functional rescue in isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons with and without PARK2 knockout (KO). Our data show that healthy neurons responded to CCCP-induced mitochondrial damage by clearing the impaired mitochondria and that this process was accelerated by USP30 inhibition. Parkin-deficient neurons showed an impaired mitophagic response to CCCP challenge, although mitochondrial ubiquitination was enhanced. USP30 inhibition promoted mitophagy in PARK2 KO neurons, independently of whether left in basal conditions or treated with CCCP. In PARK2 KO, as in control neurons, USP30 inhibition balanced oxidative stress levels by reducing excessive production of reactive oxygen species. Interestingly, non-dopaminergic neurons, were the main driver of the beneficial effects of USP30 inhibition. Our findings demonstrate that USP30 inhibition is a promising approach to boost mitophagy and improve cellular health, also in parkin-deficient cells, and support the potential relevance of USP30 inhibitors as a novel therapeutic approach in diseases with a need to combat neuronal stress mediated by impaired mitochondria.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cerebrospinal fluid and blood profiles of transfer RNA fragments show age, sex and Parkinson's disease-related changes</a></h4>

              
                Transfer RNA fragments (tRFs) have recently been shown to be an important family of small regulatory RNAs with diverse functions. Recent reports have revealed modified tRF blood levels in a number of nervous system conditions including epilepsy, ischemic stroke and neurodegenerative diseases, but little is known about tRF levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). To address this issue, we studied age, sex and Parkinsons disease (PD) distributions of tRFs in the CSF and blood data of PD patients and healthy controls from the NIH and the PPMI small RNA-seq datasets. The higher levels of long tRFs were found in the CSF than in the blood. Furthermore, the CSF showed pronounced age-associated declines of the level of 3prime-tRFs and i-tRFs and more pronounced differences between the sexes. Blood showed moderate elevation of 3prime-tFs levels with age. In addition, different distinct sets of tRFs segregated PD patients from controls in the CSF and in the blood. Finally, we found enrichment of tRFs predicted to target cholinergic mRNAs (Cholino-tRFs) in the mitochondrial originated tRFs, raising the possibility that the neurodegeneration-related mitochondrial impairment may lead to deregulation of cholinergic tone. Our findings suggest that CSF expressed tRFs are not a mirror of blood tRFs but rather potentially reflect the cerebral changes. Further, both CSF and blood present modified levels of tRFs in a sex-, age-and disease-related manner, calling for including this important subset of small RNA regulators to future studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Convergent gene expression highlights shared vocal motor microcircuitry in songbirds and humans</a></h4>

              
                Vocal learning is a skilled motor behavior observed in several mammalian and avian species and is critical for human speech. While convergent gene expression patterns have highlighted similar primary motor and striatal pathways for vocal imitation in songbirds and humans, the extent of molecular and circuit convergence remains unresolved. Here we profiled the four principal song nuclei of the zebra finch (HVC, LMAN, RA, Area X) and their surrounding brain regions using RNA-Seq and compared them with specialized markers we identified for human speech brain regions. Expanding previous work, both songbird RA and HVC exhibited convergent specialized gene expression of ~350 genes with human laryngeal sensorimotor cortex. The songbird HVCRA intratelencephalic (IT) neurons were the predominant cell type that was convergent with human, specifically layer 2/3 IT neurons, while the songbird RA extratelencephalic (ET) projection neurons exhibited convergent expression with human layer 5 ET projection neurons. The molecular specializations of both songbird LMAN and human Brocas area were more unique to each species. These findings demonstrate the extent of convergent molecular specializations in distantly related species for vocal imitation and emphasize important evolutionary constraints for this complex trait.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A brain-wide form of presynaptic active zone plasticity orchestrates resilience to brain aging in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                The brain as a central regulator of stress integration determines what is threatening, stores memories and regulates physiological adaptations across the aging trajectory. While sleep homeostasis is linked to brain resilience, how age-associated changes intersect to adapt brain resilience remains enigmatic. We here provide evidence that a brain-wide form of presynaptic active zone plasticity ("PreScale") promotes resilience by coupling sleep, longevity and memory during aging. PreScale increased until mid-age and contributed to the age-adaption of sleep patterns, in effect promoting longevity but not memory of aging flies. Mechanistically, imaging and electrophysiology suggest that genetically-encoded PreScale reprograms neuronal activity, membrane firing patterns and excitability of the sleep-promoting dorsal fan-shaped body neurons, qualitatively similar to aging. Flies metabolically reprogrammed by spermidine towards extended longevity and preserved memory skipped PreScale and subsequently age-associated sleep pattern changes. Acute deep sleep induction in mid-age flies reset PreScale back to juvenile levels and restored memory. Taken together, early along aging trajectory, PreScale seems to steer trade-offs between longevity and memory, illustrating how life strategy manifests on circuit and synaptic plasticity levels.

                The use of tonal and speech token auditory oddball tasks has been used abundantly in past literature; however, it has been argued that tasks using non-word sounds fail to capture the higher-level ability to interpret and discriminate stimuli based on meaning which are critical to language comprehension. As such this study aims to examine how neural signals associated with discrimination and evaluation-processes (P3b) from semantic stimuli compare with those elicited by pure tones and speech tokens. This study comprises of two experiments, both containing thirteen adults (Exp 1: (Mean(SD)age = 25.20(3.89) years and Exp 2: Mean(SD)age = 25.3(3.79) years) with normal hearing in both ears (PTA [&le;] 20dB HL). Scalp electroencephalography and auditory event related potentials was recorded in free field whilst they completed three different oddball tasks: 1) Tones, 2) Speech tokens and 3) Odd/Even numbers. In experiment two, the duration of each stimulus was the same. P3b peak latency was significantly different between all three tasks, in both experiments. P3b amplitude was identified to be sensitive to reaction time, with tasks that have a large reaction time variability resulting in the P3b amplitude to be smeared out, thereby reducing the amplitude size. The findings from this study highlight the need to take into consideration all factors of the task before attributing any effects to any additional process such as semantic processing and mental effort. Furthermore, it highlights the need for more cautious interpretation of P3b results in auditory oddball tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Enteric glial cells of the two plexi of the enteric nervous system exhibit phenotypic and functional inter-and intra-heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                Enteric glial cells (EGC) are a prominent cell type of all layers of the gut wall, virtually controlling all gastrointestinal functions. While the development of transgenic mice has led to major advances in understanding EGC biology, in vitro models are still fairly limited and do not allow for the robust and reproducible establishment of primary cultures discriminating EGC from the inner versus outer layers of the gut wall. Here we report a novel method to separately grow EGC from the inner and outer layers of the intestinal wall from the same mouse with a high degree of purity and cell heterogeneity. Our results indicate that EGC from the inner layers of the gut wall exhibit higher calcium response to ATP when compared to EGC from the outer layers. We also show that inner EGC cultures express lower levels of the transcription factor Sox 10 as compared to outer EGC cultures, which mirrors in situ differential expression of Sox10 in submucosal (inner) versus myenteric (outer) plexus assessed using wholemounts. Confocal microscopy analyses of wholemounts further demonstrate that a majority of calretinin-expressing ganglionic cells of the submucosal plexus express the EGC marker S-100{beta}, while this population is marginally represented in ganglia of the myenteric plexus. Altogether this study describes a novel method of EGC primary cultures permitting for the first time to compare inner versus outer EGC and provides in vitro and ex vivo evidence that inner EGC and outer EGC are phenotypically and functionally distinct.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">DNA methylation is a widespread mechanism of light-induced circadian clock period plasticity</a></h4>

              
                The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is a principal light-responsive circadian clock that adjusts circadian rhythms in mammalian physiology and behavior to changes in external light signals. Although mechanisms underlying how light acutely resets the timing of circadian rhythms have been characterized, it remains elusive how light signals induce lasting changes in circadian period, so-called period after-effects. Here we have found that the period after-effects on circadian behavior of changing photoperiods are blocked by application of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors directed to the SCN. At the level of single light pulses that act as clock-resetting stimulations, pharmacologically inhibiting DNA methylation in the SCN significantly attenuates period after-effects following acute phase shifts in behavioral rhythms in vivo, and blocks period after-effects on clock gene rhythms in the isolated ex vivo SCN. Acute clock resetting shifts themselves, however, do not appear to require DNA methylation at the SCN and behavioral levels, in contrast to subsequent period plasticity. Our results indicate that DNA methylation in the SCN mediates light-induced period after-effects in response to photoperiods, and single light pulses, and together with previous studies showing that DNA methylation in the SCN is essential for period after-effects of non-24hr light cycles (T-cycles), suggest that DNA methylation in the SCN is a widespread mechanism of light-induced circadian period plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chemical engineering of therapeutic siRNAs for allele-specific gene silencing in vivo in CNS</a></h4>

              
                Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are a new class of drugs, exhibiting sequence-driven, potent, and sustained silencing of gene expression in vivo. We recently demonstrated that siRNA chemical architectures can be optimized to provide efficient delivery to the CNS. Many genetically-defined neurodegenerative disorders are autosomal dominant favoring selective silencing of the mutant allele. In some cases, successful targeting of the mutant allele requires targeting of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) heterozygosity. Using Huntington's disease as a model, we demonstrate allele-specific RNAi-based silencing of gene expression in vivo and in neurons differentiated from HD patient-derived iPSCs. A series of in vitro screens, with chemical and thermodynamic optimization, identified compounds with >50-fold selectivity for the mutant HD-causing allele, based on a single nucleotide difference. The optimized compound exhibits selective silencing of mutant huntingtin (HTT) protein in patient-derived cells and throughout the HD mouse brain, providing a demonstration of SNP-based allele-specific RNAi silencing of gene expression in vivo in the CNS. The ability to target a disease-causing allele using RNAi-based therapies could be applied to a wide range of dominant CNS disorders, where maintenance of wild-type expression is essential.

                The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are devastating neurological diseases characterized by progressive cerebellar incoordination. While neurons bear the brunt of the pathology, a growing body of evidence suggests that glial cells are also affected. It has, however, been difficult to understand the role of glia, given the diversity of subtypes, each with their individual contributions to neuronal health. Using human SCA autopsy samples we have discovered that Bergmann glia the radial glia of the cerebellum, which form intimate functional connections with cerebellar Purkinje neurons display inflammatory JNK dependent cJun phosphorylation. This phosphorylation defines a signaling pathway not observed in other activated glial populations, providing an opportunity to specifically isolate the role of Bergmann glia in SCA inflammation. Turning to an SCA1 mouse model as a paradigmatic SCA, we demonstrate that inhibiting the JNK pathway reduces Bergmann glia inflammation accompanied by improvements in the SCA1 phenotype both behaviorally and pathologically. These findings demonstrate the causal role for Bergmann glia inflammation in SCA1 and point to a novel therapeutic strategy that could span several ataxic syndromes where Bergmann glia inflammation is a major feature.

                The most common genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the APOE4 allele, with evidence for gain- and loss-of-function mechanisms. ApoE knockout in mice abrogates AD phenotypes but causes severe atherosclerosis due to the role of liver ApoE in cholesterol homeostasis. Previous attempts to inhibit brain-specific ApoE with anti-sense oligonucleotides only modestly reduced ApoE expression and had no effect on amyloid burden in adult AD mice. Here, we optimized a divalent small interfering RNA (di-siRNA) to selectively and potently silence ApoE in the brain. Silencing brain ApoE in AD mice significantly reduced amyloid plaque formation without affecting systemic cholesterol levels, confirming that brain and liver APOE pools are spatially and functionally distinct. Mechanistically, APOE appears to be a scaffold for beta-amyloid aggregation that limits clearance by microglia. Di-siRNAs from this study can be taken to pre-clinical and clinical trials to accelerate development of AD-modifying therapies and establish siRNA-based modulation of ApoE as a viable path towards therapeutic development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">No functional contribution of the gustatory receptor, Gr64b, co-expressed in olfactory sensory neurons of Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Chemosensation is essential for the survival of insects. Activities like searching for food, mating, and oviposition in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster are to a great extent governed by chemical cues detected via olfaction and gustation. This chemical information is conveyed to higher brain centres via populations of diverse olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and gustatory sensory neurons (GSNs) expressing olfactory receptors (ORs) and gustatory receptors (GRs), respectively. ORs are exclusively expressed in the antenna and in the maxillary palps, while GRs are widely expressed in the labellum, tarsi, genitalia etc. Interestingly, 14 GRs were previously reported to be expressed in the antenna of D. melanogaster. However, the spatial expression pattern for all GRs and their functional role are still unclear. Recent data challenge the dogma that single OSNs express a single OR. In the present study, we studied the expression of 12 previously reported GRs among sensory structures on the fly antenna using the Gal4-UAS binary expression system. We observed antennal expression of nine out of the 12 reported. Out of these nine, consistent expression was only apparent for Gr64b, and we reconfirmed its presence in OSNs innervating three glomeruli in the antennal lobe. These glomeruli are known to be innervated by ab5A, ab5B and ab8A OSNs, respectively. Next, we generated double labelling crosses with Gr64b and observed co-expression of Gr64b with Or47a, which is expressed in the ab5B neuron. To elucidate the functional role of Gr64b co-expressed with Or47b, we challenged Or47a-expressing OSNs in wild type and Gr64b-/- mutant flies with odor stimulation using the single sensillum recording technique in two satiation states (fed and starved). Notably, we did not observe any significant odor sensitivity or specificity changes in Gr64b mutants as compared to wild type flies. Taken together, our results reveal co-expression of GRs with ORs in olfactory sensory neurons, while the functional contribution of the GR in this context remains obscure.

                Fibromyalgia is a debilitating widespread chronic pain syndrome that occurs in 2-4% of the population. The prevailing view that fibromyalgia results from central nervous system dysfunction has recently been challenged with data showing changes in peripheral nervous system activity. Using a mouse model of chronic widespread pain through hyperalgesic priming of muscle, we show that neutrophils invade sensory ganglia and confer mechanical hypersensitivity on recipient mice, whilst adoptive transfer of immunoglobulin, serum, lymphocytes or monocytes have no effect on pain behaviour. Neutrophil depletion abolishes the establishment of chronic widespread pain in mice. Neutrophils from patients with fibromyalgia also confer pain on mice. A link between neutrophil released mediators and peripheral nerve sensitisation is already established. These observations suggest new approaches for targeting fibromyalgia pain through an understanding of the mechanisms that cause altered neutrophil activity and interactions with sensory neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ion-channel degeneracy and heterogeneities in the emergence of complex spike bursts in CA3 pyramidal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Complex spike bursting (CSB) is a characteristic electrophysiological signature exhibited by several neurons and has been implicated in neural plasticity, learning, perception, anesthesia, and active sensing. Here, we address the question of how pronounced intrinsic and synaptic heterogeneities affect CSB, with hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons (CA3PN) as a substrate where CSB emergence and heterogeneities are well-characterized. We randomly generated 12,000 unique models and found 236 valid models that satisfied 11 characteristic CA3PN measurements. These morphologically and biophysically realistic valid models accounted for gating kinetics and somato-dendritic expression profiles of 10 active ion channels. This heterogeneous population of valid models was endowed with broad distributions of underlying parameters showing weak pair-wise correlations. We found two functional subclasses of valid models, intrinsically bursting and regular spiking, with significant differences in the expression of calcium and calcium-activated potassium conductances. We triggered CSB in all 236 models through different intrinsic or synaptic protocols and observed considerable heterogeneity in CSB propensity and properties spanning models and protocols. Finally, we employed virtual knockout analyses and showed that synergistic interactions between intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms regulated CSB emergence and dynamics. Specifically, although there was a dominance of calcium and calcium-activated potassium channels in the emergence of CSB, individual deletion of none of the several ion channels or N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors resulted in the complete elimination of CSB across all models. Together, our analyses critically implicate ion-channel degeneracy in the robust emergence of CSB and other characteristic signatures of CA3PNs, despite pronounced heterogeneities in underlying intrinsic and synaptic properties.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Presynaptic Rac1 controls synaptic strength through the regulation of synaptic vesicle priming.</a></h4>

              
                Synapses contain a limited number of synaptic vesicles (SVs) that can be released in response to action potentials (APs). Therefore, sustaining synaptic transmission over a wide range of AP firing rates and timescales depends on both SV release and replenishment. Although actin dynamics impact synaptic transmission, how regulators of actin dynamics control SV release and replenishment remain unresolved. Rac1 is a regulator of actin signaling cascades that control synaptogenesis, neuronal development, and postsynaptic function, however, its presynaptic role in regulating synaptic transmission is unclear. To unravel the regulatory roles of presynaptic Rac1 in synaptic transmission, we ablated presynaptic Rac1 at the mature mouse calyx of Held. Presynaptic Rac1 deletion leads to increased synaptic strength due to increased SV release probability which results in faster SV replenishment and increased spontaneous SV release rates. Based on our data, we conclude that presynaptic Rac1 controls synaptic strength by regulating the intrinsic SV release probability through SV priming. Therefore, we propose that presynaptic Rac1 controls actin dynamics and acts as a key regulator of synaptic transmission and plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modelling the contributions to hyperexcitability in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal hyperexcitability is a feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Three main mechanisms have been proposed to explain it: i), dendritic degeneration leading to increased input resistance, ii), ion channel changes leading to enhanced intrinsic excitability, and iii), synaptic changes leading to excitation-inhibition (E/I) imbalance. However, the relative contribution of these mechanisms is not fully understood. Therefore, we performed biophysically realistic multi-compartmental modelling of excitability in reconstructed CA1 pyramidal neurons of wild-type and APP/PS1 mice, a well-established animal model of AD. We show that, for synaptic activation, the excitability promoting effects of dendritic degeneration are cancelled out by excitability decreasing effects of synaptic loss. We find an interesting balance of excitability regulation with enhanced degeneration in the basal dendrites of APP/PS1 cells potentially leading to increased excitation by the apical but decreased excitation by the basal Schaffer collateral pathway. Furthermore, our simulations reveal that three additional pathomechanistic scenarios can account for the experimentally observed increase in firing and bursting of CA1 pyramidal neurons in APP/PS1 mice. Scenario 1: increased excitatory burst input; scenario 2: enhanced E/I ratio and scenario 3: alteration of intrinsic ion channels (IAHP down-regulated; INap, INa and ICaT up-regulated) in addition to enhanced E/I ratio. Our work supports the hypothesis that pathological network and ion channel changes are major contributors to neuronal hyperexcitability in AD. Overall, our results are in line with the concept of multi-causality and degeneracy according to which multiple different disruptions are separately sufficient but no single disruption is necessary for neuronal hyperexcitability.

                Sanfilippo syndrome type B (Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB or MPS IIIB) is a recessive genetic disorder that severely affects the brain due to a deficiency in the enzyme -N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU), leading to intralysosomal accumulation of partially degraded heparan sulfate. There are no effective treatments for this disorder. In this project, we carried out an ex vivo lentiviral correction of neural stem cells derived from Naglu-/- mice (iNSCs) using a modified enzyme in which the NAGLU is fused to an Insulin-like Growth Factor II receptor (IGFIIR) binding peptide in order to improve the cross-correction efficiency. After brain transplantation of these corrected iNSCs into Naglu-/- mice and long-term evaluation of the cross-correction, we successfully detected NAGLU-IGFII activity in all transplanted animals, as well as decreased lysosomal accumulation and reduced astrocytic and microglial activation throughout the transplanted brain. In addition, we identified a novel neuropathological phenotype in untreated brains characterized by decreased levels of MAP2 protein and accumulation of synaptophysin-positive aggregates in the brain. Following transplantation, this Naglu-/- -specific phenotype was altered with restored levels of MAP2 expression and significantly reduced formation of synaptophysin-positive aggregates. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and long-term benefit of genetically corrected iNSCs transplantation in the Sanfilippo B brain and effective cross-correction of Sanfilippo-associated pathology in Naglu-/- mice. Our findings suggest that genetically engineered iNSCs can be used to effectively deliver the missing enzyme to the brain and treat Sanfilippo type B-associated neuropathology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modelling Instantaneous Firing Rate of DBS Target Neuronal Ensembles in Basal Ganglia and Thalamus</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder symptom, and is closely related to the dysfunction of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical network. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for suppressing PD motor symptoms; however, the underlying mechanisms of DBS remain elusive. A recent study demonstrated that different substructures of the basal ganglia and thalamus respond differently to various frequencies of DBS. Despite the capability of existing models in qualitatively interpreting experimental data, there are very few unified computational models that quantitatively capture the dynamics of the neuronal activity of varying stimulated substructures - including subthalamic nucleus (STN), substantia nigra pars reticulate (SNr) and ventralis intermedius (Vim) - across different DBS frequencies. Here, we developed a novel mathematical model to represent the firing rate of nuclei receiving DBS (microstimulation), including STN, SNr and Vim - across different DBS frequencies. In our model, the DBS pulses are filtered through a synapse model and a transfer function to formulate the firing rate variability. To consistently fit the model in varying frequencies of DBS, we developed a novel parameter optimization method based on the concatenated data from all DBS frequencies. Our model accurately reproduces the firing rates observed and calculated from both experimental and synthetic data. The optimal model parameters are consistent across different DBS frequencies, and this consistency conforms to the relatively static synaptic structures in short durations of DBS. Our model can be potentially implemented in navigating the DBS parameter space and improves DBS clinical effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rodent perirhinal cortex, but not ventral hippocampus, inhibition induces approach bias under object-based approach-avoidance conflict</a></h4>

              
                Neural models of approach-avoidance (AA) conflict behavior and its dysfunction have focused traditionally on the hippocampus, with the assumption that this medial temporal lobe (MTL) structure plays a ubiquitous role in arbitrating AA conflict. We challenge this perspective by using three different AA behavioural tasks in conjunction with optogenetics, to demonstrate that a neighbouring region in rats, perirhinal cortex, is also critically involved but only when conflicting motivational values are associated with objects and not contextual information. The ventral hippocampus, in contrast, was found not to be essential for object-associated AA conflict, suggesting its preferential involvement in context-associated conflict. We propose that stimulus type can impact MTL involvement during AA conflict and that a more nuanced understanding of MTL contributions to impaired AA behaviour (e.g., anxiety) is required. These findings serve to expand upon the established functions of the perirhinal cortex while concurrently presenting innovative behavioural paradigms that permit the assessment of different facets of AA conflict behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rhythmic information sampling in the brain during visual recognition</a></h4>

              
                Several studies observed behavioral oscillations in perceptual sensitivity across stimulus presentation time, and these fluctuations have been linked to oscillatory processing in the brain. However, whether specific brain areas show oscillations across stimulus time (i.e., oscillatory sampling) has not been investigated. Here, we randomly revealed features of face images across time and recorded participants' brain activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG) while they performed two recognition tasks. This allowed us to quantify how each snapshot of visual information coming from the stimulus is processed across time and across the brain. Oscillatory sampling was mostly visible in early visual areas, at theta and low beta frequencies. Furthermore, it explained a larger part of brain activity than oscillatory processing. Other parts of the brain showed distinct sampling patterns. These results advance our understanding of the oscillatory neural dynamics associated with visual processing and show the importance of considering the temporal dimension of stimuli when studying visual recognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural activity and theta rhythmicity in the anterior hypothalamic nucleus are involved in regulating social investigation</a></h4>

              
                Social interactions are highly complex, involving both approach and avoidance actions towards specific individuals, dependent on the social context. Currently, the brain regions subserving these behaviors are not fully known. The anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHN) is a relatively unstudied and poorly defined brain area, known as part of the medial hypothalamic defensive system. Recent studies that examined the role of the AHN in various contexts have yielded contradicting results regarding its contribution to approach, avoidance, and escape behaviors. Yet, none of these studies has directly examined its role in social interactions. Here we explored the role of AHN neurons in regulating approach and avoidance actions towards distinct stimuli during various types of social interactions, using electrophysiological recording of neural activity in the AHN of behaving mice, c-Fos staining, and direct optogenetic stimulation. We found that theta rhythmicity in the AHN was enhanced during affiliative interactions, but decreased during aversive ones. Moreover, spiking activity of AHN neurons was found to be elevated more persistently during investigation of social stimuli, as compared to objects. Notably, AHN neuronal firing was found to be modulated by theta rhythmicity during social interactions. Finally, we found that during social interaction, direct optogenetic stimulation of AHN neurons augmented approach behavior towards stimuli associated with the optogenetic activation. Overall, our results suggest a context-dependent role for AHN neuronal activity in regulating approach behavior during social interactions, and for theta rhythmicity in mediating the valence of the social context.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain-wide connectivity map of mouse thermosensory cortices</a></h4>

              
                In the thermal system, skin cooling is represented in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and the posterior insular cortex (pIC). Whether S1 and pIC are nodes in anatomically separated or overlapping thermal sensorimotor pathways is unclear, as the brain-wide connectivity of the thermal system has not been mapped. We address this using functionally targeted, dual injections of anterograde viruses or retrograde tracers into S1 and pIC. Our data show that inputs to S1 and pIC originate from two non-overlapping populations, supporting the existence of parallel input pathways. While outputs from S1 and pIC were more widespread and share a number of cortical and subcortical regions, within target structures axonal projections were often separable. We observed a high degree of reciprocal connectivity with thalamic and cortical regions from both S1 and pIC, but output to the mid- and hind- brain was unidirectional. Notably, pIC showed exclusive connectivity with regions associated with thermal processing. Together, these data indicate that cutaneous thermal information is routed to the cortex via multiple, parallel streams of information which are forwarded to overlapping downstream regions for the binding of complex somatosensory percepts and integration with ongoing behavior.

	<p>Background: Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) is an acute-phase protein that has been linked to insulin resistance, diabetes, and neuroinflammatory diseases. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) has been also implicated in microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. However, the potential role of LCN2 on TREM2 in diabetic mouse models is not fully understood. Methods: We investigated hepatic and hippocampal TREM2 expressions in high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic LCN2 knockout (KO) mice. Results: In addition to increased serum LCN2 level, diabetic wild-type (WT) mice had insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. However, LCN2 deletion attenuated these metabolic parameters in diabetic mice. We also found that LCN2 deletion reduced hepatic inflammation and microglial activation in diabetic mice. In particular, diabetic LCN2 KO mice had a reduction in hepatic and hippocampal TREM2 expressions compared with diabetic WT mice. Furthermore, we found that many TREM2-positive Kupffer cells and microglia in diabetic WT mice were reduced through LCN2 deletion. Conclusions: These findings indicate that LCN2 may promote hepatic inflammation and microglial activation via upregulation of TREM2 in diabetic mice.</p>

                Aim: To determine the effectiveness of capacity building program on palliative care (PC) in enhancing the capacity of the primary health care workers in need assessment and symptom management of cancer patients.  Background: In India, less than one percent of people living with cancer have access to palliative care since most are from low- and middle-income groups. Accredited social health activist (ASHA) and primary health care workers are grassroots workers who are the first contact with family members and are seldom aware of PC in India. It is essential to train them to give practical and efficient care to needy people. Design: A quasi-experimental design with follow-up will be conducted using an evaluative approach. Methods: The study population consists of 1440 Primary Health Care Workers (staff nurses, ANMs, and ASHA workers) of three taluks of Udupi District, Karnataka State, India. Training on PC will be provided for ASHA workers for one day and ANM/Staff nurses for three days. After their training, they are expected to demonstrate the gain in knowledge & skill in providing PC for cancer patients by identifying and implementing PC services using a mobile app at the primary healthcare level.  Discussion: Palliative home care can give comfort and reduce patients' financial burden, and this training may help to improve the quality of life of needy patients. Impact: If this palliative care training program succeeds, it can be integrated into the healthcare continuum, making it an essential component of primary healthcare delivery to achieve universal health coverage. Moreover, home-based PC supports patients who want to die at home even though it reduces hospital stay costs. Trial registration: CTRI/2020/04/024792.

                Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) releases nucleocapsid proteins (NP) into the blood circulation in infected patients. We investigated whether plasma NP analysis could be used for diagnosing an infection and used for nosocomial screening. Methods: We collected blood samples from patients admitted to the hospital during a period with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based-screening of patients for SARS-CoV-2. Retrospectively the SARS-CoV-2 NP plasma concentrations were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method and used for an initial time course study to find the optimal time-point for sampling blood. Next, we estimated the diagnostic accuracy i.e. the clinical sensitivity and specificity at different plasma NP cut-off concentrations. Results: The time course study revealed profiles with rapid or more slow declines in NP titers after the RT-PCR result. Nevertheless, in the time interval 0 – 7 days after the RT-PCR result, the NP concentration was always above the level of detection at 1.66 pg/ml suggesting that the diagnosis could be established in the time interval of 0 - 7 days. The median time gap between the plasma NP and RT-PCR results was 0.0 days (n = 1957, interval: -26 to + 21 days). Reducing the time gap to seven days, the clinical sensitivity was 90.0% (n= 60, 95% CI, 82.4% to 97.6%) at a specificity of 95.9% (n=1876, 95% CI, 95.0% to 96.8%). Curve analysis by receiver operation characteristics identified a cut-off concentration of 1.87 pg/mL NP as optimal resulting in a positive predictive value of 41.2%, a negative predictive value of 99.7% and a prevalence of 3.1%. Conclusions: In conclusion, the NP method is acceptable for making the laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, and an intended use of plasma NP as a prospective nosocomial screening method is considered feasible.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Level of development, foreign direct investment and domestic investment in food manufacturing [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Whilst the literature on the complementarity and substitutability of foreign direct investment (FDI) on domestic investment (DI) is not uncommon, the facet of food manufacturing is non-existent. This paper fills this void by investigating the effect of FDI on DI in the food manufacturing sector for developing, economies in transition and developed countries. Methods: Using an unbalanced panel data of 49 countries from 1993 to 2016, from FAOSTAT, estimated by the system generalised method of moments (GMM), the Wald statistics for the short and long-run effects of FDI on DI were computed for the development groups. Results: Developed economies experienced a crowd-out effect of FDI on DI in the short run, whilst the others experienced no significant effect. In the case of the long run, the food manufacturing sectors of all three development groups exhibited a crowd-out effect. The effect in the long run for all development groups together is a crowd-in. Analysing all country groups together could mask the results of the various country groups. Conclusions: A review of investment policies to prioritise FDI entry mode that favour domestic investment is needed. Improvement of the investment regulatory and administrative efficiency among others are recommended.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A structured model and likelihood approach to estimate yeast prion propagon replication rates and their asymmetric transmission</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fabian Santiago, Suzanne Sindi</p>

Prion proteins cause a variety of fatal neurodegenerative diseases in mammals but are generally harmless to Baker’s yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>). This makes yeast an ideal model organism for investigating the protein dynamics associated with these diseases. The rate of disease onset is related to both the replication and transmission kinetics of propagons, the transmissible agents of prion diseases. Determining the kinetic parameters of propagon replication in yeast is complicated because the number of propagons in an individual cell depends on the intracellular replication dynamics and the asymmetric division of yeast cells within a growing yeast cell colony. We present a structured population model describing the distribution and replication of prion propagons in an actively dividing population of yeast cells. We then develop a likelihood approach for estimating the propagon replication rate and their transmission bias during cell division. We first demonstrate our ability to correctly recover known kinetic parameters from simulated data, then we apply our likelihood approach to estimate the kinetic parameters for six yeast prion variants using propagon recovery data. We find that, under our modeling framework, all variants are best described by a model with an asymmetric transmission bias. This demonstrates the strength of our framework over previous formulations assuming equal partitioning of intracellular constituents during cell division.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Histologically resolved multiomics enables precise molecular profiling of human intratumor heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tao Chen, Chen Cao, Jianyun Zhang, Aaron Streets, Tiejun Li, Yanyi Huang</p>

Both the composition of cell types and their spatial distribution in a tissue play a critical role in cellular function, organ development, and disease progression. For example, intratumor heterogeneity and the distribution of transcriptional and genetic events in single cells drive the genesis and development of cancer. However, it can be challenging to fully characterize the molecular profile of cells in a tissue with high spatial resolution because microscopy has limited ability to extract comprehensive genomic information, and the spatial resolution of genomic techniques tends to be limited by dissection. There is a growing need for tools that can be used to explore the relationship between histological features, gene expression patterns, and spatially correlated genomic alterations in healthy and diseased tissue samples. Here, we present a technique that combines label-free histology with spatially resolved multiomics in unfixed and unstained tissue sections. This approach leverages stimulated Raman scattering microscopy to provide chemical contrast that reveals histological tissue architecture, allowing for high-resolution in situ laser microdissection of regions of interests. These microtissue samples are then processed for DNA and RNA sequencing to identify unique genetic profiles that correspond to distinct anatomical regions. We demonstrate the capabilities of this technique by mapping gene expression and copy number alterations to histologically defined regions in human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Our approach provides complementary insights in tumorigenesis and offers an integrative tool for macroscale cancer tissues with spatial multiomics assessments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Formal definition of the MARS method for quantifying the unique target class discoveries of selected machine classifiers [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Conventional binary classification performance metrics evaluate either general measures (accuracy, F score) or specific aspects (precision, recall) of a model’s classifying ability. As such, these metrics, derived from the model’s confusion matrix, provide crucial insight regarding classifier-data interactions. However, modern- day computational capabilities have allowed for the creation of increasingly complex models that share nearly identical classification performance. While traditional performance metrics remain as essential indicators of a classifier’s individual capabilities, their ability to differentiate between models is limited. In this paper, we present the methodology for MARS (Method for Assessing Relative Sensitivity/ Specificity) ShineThrough and MARS Occlusion scores, two novel binary classification performance metrics, designed to quantify the distinctiveness of a classifier’s predictive successes and failures, relative to alternative classifiers. Being able to quantitatively express classifier uniqueness adds a novel classifier-classifier layer to the process of model evaluation and could improve ensemble model-selection decision making. By calculating both conventional performance measures, and proposed MARS metrics for a simple classifier prediction dataset, we demonstrate that the proposed metrics’ informational strengths synergize well with those of traditional metrics, delivering insight complementary to that of conventional metrics.

                Background: Earth's temperature has been rising since 1900, and the annual temperature has increased from 20°C to 24°C on the Mediterranean coastline. The external climate directly relates to indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and building performance, particularly in educational buildings. This paper proposes smart adaptive building envelopes (SABEs) as a potential solution for resilient architecture which is prone to unexpected weather patterns posed by climate change. Methods: A multi-dimensional criterion methodology is employed based on Egypt’s local climate, using SABEs to provide thermal comfort and natural daylight using minimum energy. The paper's novelty is in using a comparative methodology that is complemented with a software simulation (OpenStudio 3.0.1) to address the existing educational building design challenges in providing IEQ, and to assess the proposed SABE design’s performance, whilst providing better indoor thermal comfort and daylight. Results: The results show that the application of SABEs has led to significant reduction of the energy consumed, by 7.62% in summer and 5.42% in winter Conclusions: The implications of SABEs on IEQ in terms of thermal comfort and daylight are significant. SABEs also reduce energy consumption.

                Background: The 7+3 regimen is still the main choice of remission induction chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Successfully achieving complete remission (CR) and the time required to achieve it determine patient’s survival. Hence, bone marrow examination on 14th day of chemotherapy is recommended to predict CR. However, the examination is invasive and still inaccurate. Methods: A prognostic study with retrospective cohort design was conducted at two central hospitals in Indonesia based on medical record data of AML patients who underwent 7+3 induction chemotherapy from January 1st, 2015, to December 31st, 2019. The association of nadir leukocyte level and the time required to achieve it with CR occurrence was assessed. Results: One hundred and one subjects were recruited with median age 39 years and 55% men. A total of 55.4% subjects achieved CR. Nadir leukocyte level below 200/mcl was the most optimal cut-off point and independently associated with CR (OR 2.48; 95% CI 1.03–5.97) while time required to achieve it was not. Conclusions: The nadir leukocyte level is associated with an increase probability of CR but not for the time required to achieve it in AML patients undergoing 7+3 induction chemotherapy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Performance evaluation of the smartphone-based AI cough monitoring app - Hyfe Cough Tracker against solicited respiratory sounds [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Emerging technologies to remotely monitor patients’ cough show promise for various clinical applications. Currently available cough detection systems all represent a trade-off between convenience and performance. The accuracy of such technologies is highly contingent on the clinical settings in which they are intended to be used. Moreover, establishing gold standards to measure this accuracy is challenging. Objectives: We present the first performance evaluation study of the Hyfe Cough Tracker app, a passive cough monitoring smartphone application. We evaluate performance for cough detection using continuous audio recordings and cough counting by trained individuals as the gold standard. We propose standard procedures to use multi-observer cough sound annotation from continuous audio recordings as the gold standard for evaluating automated cough detection devices. Methods: This study was embedded in a larger digital acoustic surveillance study (clinicaltrial.gov NCT04762693). Forty-nine participants were included and instructed to produce a diverse series of solicited sounds in 10-minute sessions. Simultaneously, continuous audio recording was performed using a MP3 recorder and two smartphones running Hyfe Cough Tracker app monitored and identified cough events. All continuous audio recordings were independently labeled by three medically-trained researchers. Results: Hyfe Cough Tracker app showed sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 98% with a very high correlation between the cough rate measured by Hyfe and that of human annotators (Pearson correlation of 0.968). A standardized approach to establish an acoustic gold standard for identifying cough sounds with multiple observers is presented. Conclusion: This is the first performance evaluation of a new smartphone-based cough monitoring system. Hyfe Cough Tracker can detect, record and count coughs from solicited cough-like explosive sounds in controlled acoustic environments with very high accuracy. Additional steps are required to validate the system in clinical and community settings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The legal implications of prenatal diagnosis in Malaysia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prenatal diagnosis enables detection of any disease or disability of the fetus during the pregnancy of a woman. Parents whose fetus is found to have a serious disorder from antenatal testing may terminate the pregnancy if it is permitted by the law or continue with the pregnancy to term. However, the chance of terminating a pregnancy may be denied if there is prenatal negligence by the medical practitioner in terms of diagnosis or failure to advise on the test results correctly. The purpose of this research is to examine the possible legal implications of prenatal diagnosis in Malaysia. Methods: This study adopts doctrinal legal research in which the researcher examines statutes and decided cases in Malaysia, the United Kingdom (UK) and Singapore relating to abortion, wrongful birth and wrongful life claims, in order to determine the legal implications of prenatal diagnosis in Malaysia. Results: In Malaysia, abortion following a prenatal diagnosis is only legally possible if the statutory criteria in the Penal Code are met. Abortion is illegal if it is not done for therapeutic purposes. A wrongful birth action brought by a woman who claims to be deprived of the opportunity to terminate her pregnancy may be successful in Malaysia, if it can be proven that a legal abortion could have been performed if not because of the prenatal negligence of the medical practitioner. However, a wrongful life action brought in the child’s name for being allowed to be born with a disability may not be viable since the claim could hardly be established and it is against the public policy. Conclusions: Theoretically, it is possible to bring a wrongful birth action resulted from negligence in prenatal diagnosis successfully in Malaysia, but the chance is relatively slim for wrongful life action.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The relationship of age, sex and prothrombin time related to the severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Looking at the prevalence data in the world and in Indonesia, the highest mortality rate due to COVID-19 involves age, gender and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus. Severity of the condition also refers to coagulation abnormalities, such as abnormal prothrombin time values. Methods: This systematic review study and meta-analysis used online literature sourced from PubMed, Science Direct, EBSCO, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The literature used here is literature that has data on age, sex and prothrombin time of COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus whose quality is assessed by the NOS (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) criteria and processing data using Review Manager 5.4. Results: Out of 8711 literatures that were traced from various search sources, there were 46 literatures that were included in this study. The results of the analysis on age showed the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) value of 0.45 and P <0.0001 (95% CI: 0.23–0.68), the gender analysis showed an Odds Ratio (OR) value of 3.28 and P = 0.01 (95% CI: 1.26–8.52) and the prothrombin time analysis showed SMD values of 0.41 and P = 0.07 (95%CI = -0.03–0.85). Conclusion: A person who is infected with COVID-19 and has comorbid diabetes mellitus has a high risk of disease severity and mortality if he is older and male.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A hospital-based prospective cohort study to assess the factors associated with transmission dynamics of SARS CoV-2 among healthcare workers in Delhi [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Healthcare personnel providing COVID-19 care are at increased risk of acquiring infection. Understanding the factors associated with the transmission of infection amongst healthcare workers provides input for the development of prevention strategies. The objectives of this study were to study the adherence to Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures followed between different categories of healthcare workers, to estimate seroconversion rate based on the type of exposure with COVID-19 patients and to study the association between seroconversion and IPC practices. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted from December 2020 to June 2021 among the healthcare workers in two tertiary healthcare institutes selected by purposive sampling. All Healthcare workers (HCW) participating in the clinical management or having any exposure to a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case were included. A total of 817 subjects were enrolled in the study. At baseline, details on IPC training and adherence along with details of the type of exposure with the COVID-19 patient were collected. The end-line visit was scheduled at 22-31 (preferably 28 days) days from the first visit for the collection of the symptom diary and end-line form.  Results: Hand hygiene practices were found to be best among paramedics (98.0%), followed by doctors (84.5%) and nurses (90.1%). Maximum HCWs (99.5%; 99.8%; 97.1%) reported using Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) appropriately and regular availability of PPE in the hospital setting. Among the various categories of HCWs, nurses had the highest proportion (28.7%) of untrained personnel. Conclusion: The HCWs who had contact with the surroundings of an infected patient showed higher odds of seroconversion although not statistically significant. Further, analyzing the types of PPE used, we found that the use of masks and gloves were protective in preventing infection. Strengthening IPC training through refresher training and demonstrating the correct use of PPE can enhance adherence to IPC measures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Resilience and entrepreneurial intentions of people with disabilities: in search of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: There is a significant gap in employment between people with and without disabilities, despite the importance of work in achieving their independence, autonomy, and integration into society. There are several reasons that cause this gap to exist, such as: people with disabilities feel less prepared, there is a stigma or discrimination to hire people with disabilities and the incompatibility of schedules due to medical issues, among others. That is why entrepreneurship emerges as a good option for the integration of people with disabilities in our society, improves their confidence and promotes some of the Sustainable Development Goals set out in the 2030 Agenda. According to existing literature, people with disabilities have certain virtues such as resilience and motivation that favor entrepreneurship. Thus, the purpose of this study is to provide new insights into the variables that determine the entrepreneurial intention of people with disabilities. Methods: In order to respond to this objective, an online questionnaire was given to people with disabilities between the ages of 16 and 65 years, residing in diverse regions of Spain. To analyze the results, this study uses Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) in a sample of 235 people with disabilities in Spain using as a framework Krueger´s improved model, adding resilience as a new variable. Results: The results reflect the importance of resilience, the subjective norm, and perceived collective efficacy in the entrepreneurial processes of people with disabilities. Conclusions: This study contributes to the underdeveloped literature on entrepreneurship in people with disabilities; it provides insights that can have a practical effect on the reduction of the inequality gap between people with and without disabilities making recommendations to clinicians, vocational psychologists, and policymakers; also, this study would advance the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals 8 and 10.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Nutritional status, nutrient imbalances, food-related behaviors and dietary supplements use among patients with celiac disease in Lebanon: a national cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten, that occurs in susceptible individuals and is associated with dietary restriction and subsequent nutritional deficiencies. This study investigated the diet quality, nutrition imbalances and nutrition status among young children, adolescents and adults with CD who were referred to several hospitals in Lebanon. Methods: A cross-sectional study in 50 individuals (31.74 ± 15.64 years) with CD was conducted, using biochemical parameters, anthropometric measurements, dietary and physical activity assessments. Results: Of the 50 participants, 38% and 16% were presenting low serum levels of iron and vitamin B12, respectively. The majority of participants were physically inactive and around 40% of them had low muscle mass. A weight loss of 10% to 30% indicating mild to moderate malnutrition was shown in 14% of individuals. The assessment of food-related behaviors shows that 80% of participants were reading nutrition labels and 96% of them were following gluten-free diets (GFD). Some barriers including family ignorance (6%), language of the nutrition labels (20%) and expensive GF products (78%) were limiting the adherence to GFD. The inadequacy of the daily energy intake along with insufficient intakes of calcium and vitamin D were remarked among individuals with CD. However, protein and iron intake were exceeding the recommendations among all age groups, except in males aged 4-8 years and 19-30 years. Half the study participants were using dietary supplements where 38%, 10%, 46%, 18%, 16% and 4% used vitamin D, vitamin B12, iron, calcium, folate and probiotics, respectively. Conclusion: GFD is the key treatment for CD. However, it is not without inadequacies and may cause certain deficiencies such as calcium and vitamin D leading to reduced bone density. This underlines the critical role of dietitians in education and maintenance of healthy GFD among individuals with CD.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Long-term transverse imaging of the hippocampus with glass microperiscopes</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus consists of a stereotyped neuronal circuit repeated along the septal-temporal axis. This transverse circuit contains distinct subfields with stereotyped connectivity that support crucial cognitive processes, including episodic and spatial memory. However, comprehensive measurements across the transverse hippocampal circuit in vivo are intractable with existing techniques. Here, we developed an approach for two-photon imaging of the transverse hippocampal plane in awake mice via implanted glass microperiscopes, allowing optical access to the major hippocampal subfields and to the dendritic arbor of pyramidal neurons. Using this approach, we tracked dendritic morphological dynamics on CA1 apical dendrites and characterized spine turnover. We then used calcium imaging to quantify the prevalence of place and speed cells across subfields. Finally, we measured the anatomical distribution of spatial information, finding a non-uniform distribution of spatial selectivity along the DG-to-CA1 axis. This approach extends the existing toolbox for structural and functional measurements of hippocampal circuitry.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Response to immune checkpoint blockade improved in pre-clinical model of breast cancer after bariatric surgery</a></h4>

              
                Bariatric surgery is becoming more prevalent as a sustainable weight loss approach, with vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) being the first line of surgical intervention. We and others have shown that obesity exacerbates tumor growth while diet-induced weight loss impairs obesity-driven progression. It remains unknown how bariatric surgery-induced weight loss impacts cancer progression or alters responses to therapy. Using a pre-clinical model of diet induced obesity followed by VSG or diet-induced weight loss, breast cancer progression and immune checkpoint blockade therapy was investigated. Weight loss by bariatric surgery or weight matched dietary intervention before tumor engraftment protected against obesity-exacerbated tumor progression. However, VSG was not as effective as dietary intervention in reducing tumor burden despite achieving a similar extent of weight and adiposity loss. Circulating leptin did not associate with changes in tumor burden, however circulating IL-6 was elevated in mice after VSG. Uniquely, tumors in mice that received VSG displayed elevated inflammation and immune checkpoint ligand PD-L1+ myeloid and non-immune cells. Further, mice that received VSG had reduced tumor T lymphocytes and markers of cytolysis suggesting an ineffective anti-tumor microenvironment. VSG-associated elevation of PD-L1 prompted us to next investigate the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in lean, obese, and formerly obese mice that lost weight by VSG or weight matched controls. While obese mice were resistant to immune checkpoint blockade, anti-PD-L1 potently impaired tumor progression after VSG through improved anti-tumor immunity. Thus, in formerly obese mice, surgical weight loss followed by immunotherapy reduced breast cancer burden. Last, we compared transcriptomic changes in adipose tissue after bariatric surgery from both patients and mouse models that revealed a conserved bariatric surgery associated weight loss signature (BSAS). Importantly, BSAS significantly associated with decreased tumor volume. Our findings demonstrate conserved impacts of obesity and bariatric surgery-induced weight loss pathways associated with breast cancer progression.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Synaptic location is a determinant of the detrimental effects of α-Synuclein pathology to glutamatergic transmission in the basolateral amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The presynaptic protein α-synuclein (αSyn) has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). In PD, the amygdala is prone to develop insoluble αSyn aggregates, and it has been suggested that circuit dysfunction involving the amygdala contributes to the psychiatric symptoms. Yet, how αSyn aggregates affect amygdala function is unknown. In this study, we examined αSyn in glutamatergic axon terminals and the impact of its aggregation on glutamatergic transmission in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). We found that αSyn is primarily present in the vesicular glutamate transporter 1-expressing (vGluT1<sup>+</sup>) terminals in mouse BLA, which is consistent with higher levels of αSyn expression in vGluT1<sup>+</sup> glutamatergic neurons in the cerebral cortex relative to the vGluT2<sup>+</sup> glutamatergic neurons in the thalamus.  We found that αSyn aggregation selectively decreased the cortico-BLA, but not the thalamo-BLA, transmission; and that cortico-BLA synapses displayed enhanced short-term depression upon repetitive stimulation. In addition, using confocal microscopy, we found that vGluT1<sup>+</sup> axon terminals exhibited decreased levels of soluble αSyn, which suggests that lower levels of soluble αSyn might underlie the enhanced short-term depression of cortico-BLA synapses. In agreement with this idea, we found that cortico-BLA synaptic depression was also enhanced in αSyn knockout mice. In conclusion, both basal and dynamic cortico-BLA transmission were disrupted by abnormal aggregation of αSyn and these changes might be relevant to the perturbed cortical control of the amygdala that has been suggested to play a role in psychiatric symptoms in PD.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Genetic dissection of the RNA polymerase II transcription cycle</a></h4>

              
                How DNA sequence affects the dynamics and position of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) during transcription remains poorly understood. Here we used naturally occurring genetic variation in F1 hybrid mice to explore how DNA sequence differences affect the genome-wide distribution of Pol II. We measured the position and orientation of Pol II in eight organs collected from heterozygous F1 hybrid mice using ChRO-seq. Our data revealed a strong genetic basis for the precise coordinates of transcription initiation and promoter proximal pause, allowing us to redefine molecular models of core transcriptional processes. Our results implicate DNA sequence, including both known and novel DNA sequence motifs, as key determinants of the position of Pol II initiation and pause. We report evidence that initiation site selection follows a stochastic process similar to Brownian motion along the DNA template. We found widespread differences in the position of transcription termination, which impact the primary structure and stability of mature mRNA. Finally, we report evidence that allelic changes in transcription often affect mRNA and ncRNA expression across broad genomic domains. Collectively, we reveal how DNA sequences shape core transcriptional processes at single nucleotide resolution in mammals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inner membrane complex proteomics reveals a palmitoylation regulation critical for intraerythrocytic development of malaria parasite</a></h4>

              
                Malaria is caused by infection of the erythrocytes by the parasites <i>Plasmodium</i>. Inside the erythrocytes, the parasites multiply via schizogony, an unconventional cell division mode. The Inner Membrane Complex (IMC), an organelle located beneath the parasite plasma membrane, serving as the platform for protein anchorage, is essential for schizogony. So far, complete repertoire of IMC proteins and their localization determinants remain unclear. Here we used biotin ligase (TurboID)-based proximity labelling to compile the proteome of the schizont IMC of rodent malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium yoelii</i>. In total, 300 TurboID-interacting proteins were identified. 18 of 21 selected candidates were confirmed to localize in the IMC, indicating good reliability. In light of the existing palmitome of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, 83 proteins of the <i>P. yoelii</i> IMC proteome are potentially palmitoylated. We further identified DHHC2 as the major resident palmitoyl-acyl-transferase of the IMC. Depletion of DHHC2 led to defective schizont segmentation and growth arrest both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. DHHC2 was found to palmitoylate two critical IMC proteins CDPK1 and GAP45 for their IMC localization. In summary, this study reports an inventory of new IMC proteins and demonstrates a central role of DHHC2 in governing IMC localization of proteins during the schizont development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Life-history predicts global population responses to the weather in terrestrial mammals</a></h4>

              
                With the looming threat of abrupt ecological disruption due to a changing climate, predicting which species are most vulnerable to environmental change is critical. The life-history of a species is an evolved response to its environmental context, and therefore a promising candidate for explaining differences in climate-change responses. However, we need broad empirical assessments from across the worlds ecosystems to explore the link between life-history and climate-change responses. Here, we use long-term abundance records from 157 species of terrestrial mammal and a two-step Bayesian meta-regression framework to investigate the link between annual weather anomalies, population growth rates, and species-level life-history. Overall, we found no directional effect of temperature or precipitation anomalies or variance on annual population growth rates. Furthermore, population responses to weather anomalies were not predicted by phylogenetic covariance, and instead there was more variability in weather responses for populations within a species. Crucially, however, long-lived mammals with smaller litter sizes had smaller absolute population responses to weather anomalies compared to their shorter-living counterparts with larger litters. These results highlight the role of species-level life-history in driving responses to the environment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Conformational fingerprinting of allosteric modulators in metabotropic glutamate receptor 2</a></h4>

              
                Activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is an allosteric process. It involves conformational coupling between the orthosteric ligand binding site and the G protein binding site. Factors that bind at non-cognate ligand binding sites to alter the allosteric activation process are classified as allosteric modulators and represent a promising class of therapeutics with distinct modes of binding and action. For many receptors, how modulation of signaling is represented at the structural level is unclear. Here, we developed FRET sensors to quantify receptor modulation at each of the three structural domains of metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2). We identified the conformational fingerprint for several allosteric modulators in live cells. This approach enabled us to derive a receptor-centric representation of allosteric modulation and to correlate structural modulation to the standard signaling modulation metrics. Single-molecule FRET analysis revealed that a NAM increases the occupancy of one of the intermediate states while a PAM increases the occupancy of the active state. Moreover, we found that the effect of allosteric modulators on the receptor dynamics is complex and depend on the orthosteric ligand. Collectively, our findings provide a structural mechanism of allosteric modulation in mGluR2 and suggest possible strategies for design of future modulators.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Enhanced hippocampal LTP but typical NMDA receptor and AMPA receptor function in a novel rat model of CDKL5 deficiency disorder</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the X-linked gene cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) cause a severe neurological disorder characterised by early-onset epileptic seizures, autism and intellectual disability (ID). Impaired hippocampal function has been implicated in other models of monogenic forms of autism spectrum disorders and ID and is often linked to epilepsy and behavioural abnormalities. Many individuals with CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) have null mutations and complete loss of CDKL5 protein, therefore in the current study we used a novel Cdkl5 KO rat model to elucidate the impact of CDKL5 loss on cellular excitability and synaptic function of CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs). We hypothesised abnormal pre and/or post synaptic function underlie the enhanced LTP we observe in the hippocampus of Cdkl5 KO rats. We tested this hypothesis using a combination of extracellular and whole-cell electrophysiological recordings, biochemistry, and histology. We show that NMDA receptor function and subunit expression are unaltered throughout development, and Ca2+ permeable AMPA receptor mediated currents are unchanged in Cdkl5 KO rats. We observe reduced mEPSC frequency accompanied by increased spine density in basal dendrites of CA1 PCs, however we find no evidence supporting an increase in silent synapses when assessed using a minimal stimulation protocol in slices. Additionally, we found no change in paired-pulse ratio, consistent with normal release probability in Cdkl5 KO rats and supported by typical expression of pre-synaptic proteins in synaptosome preparations. Together these data indicate a role for CDKL5 in hippocampal synaptic function and raise the possibility that altered intracellular signalling rather than synaptic deficits might contribute to the altered plasticity.

                Mutations within GLT8D1 contribute to familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Pathogenic mutations impair GLT8D1 glycosyltransferase enzymatic function via a dominant negative mechanism, yet the downstream mechanism leading to neurotoxicity is unclear. Here we show that a p.R92C mutation causes fragmentation of the Golgi network and reduces ganglioside expression within membrane lipid rafts (MLRs), leading to impaired neurotrophin signalling. Expression of p.R92C-GLT8D1 in HEK293 cells and mouse primary neurons reduces expression of GM1 gangliosides within the cell plasma membrane leading to disruption of MLRs. Furthermore, p.R92C-GLT8D1 reduces TrkB-mediated pro-survival signalling in MLRs isolated from primary neurons. Interestingly, up-regulation of wild-type GLT8D1 enhances MLRs and promotes pro-survival signalling through TrkB. This closely mirrors findings for another ALS gene, CAV1, suggesting convergence on a common pathogenic pathway. Other ALS genes have been associated with Golgi dysfunction and may disrupt the same pathway, suggesting a potential new therapeutic approach via upregulation of GLT8D1.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Linking impulsivity to activity levels in pre-supplementary motor area during sequential gambling</a></h4>

              
                Impulsivity refers to the tendency to act prematurely or without forethought, and excessive impulsivity is a key problem in many neuropsychiatric disorders. Since the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) has been implicated in inhibitory control, this region may also contribute to impulsivity. Here, we examined whether functional recruitment of preSMA may contribute to risky choice behavior (state impulsivity) during sequential gambling and its relation to self-reported trait impulsivity. To this end, we performed task-based functional MRI (fMRI) after low-frequency (1 Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the preSMA. We expected low-frequency rTMS to modulate task-related engagement of the preSMA and hereby, tune the tendency to make risky choices. 24 healthy volunteers (12 females, 19-52 years) received real or sham rTMS on separate days in counterbalanced order. Thereafter, participants performed a sequential gambling task with concurrently increasing stakes and risk during whole-brain fMRI. In the sham-rTMS session, self-reported trait impulsivity scaled positively with state impulsivity (riskier choice behavior) during gambling. The higher the trait-impulsivity, the lower was the task-related increase in preSMA activity with increasingly risky choices. Following real-rTMS, low-impulsivity participants increased their preference for risky choices, while the opposite was true for high-impulsivity participants resulting in an overall decoupling of trait impulsivity and state impulsivity during gambling. This rTMS-induced behavioral shift was mirrored in the rTMS-induced change in preSMA activation. These results provide converging evidence for a causal link between the level of task-related preSMA activity and the propensity for impulsive risk-taking behavior in the context of sequential gambling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Noradrenergic signaling in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex is required to update goal-directed actions.</a></h4>

              
                In a constantly changing environment, organisms must track the current relationship between actions and their specific consequences and use this information to guide decision-making. Such goal-directed behavior relies on circuits involving cortical and subcortical structures. Notably, a functional heterogeneity exists within the medial prefrontal, insular, and orbitofrontal cortices (OFC) in rodents. The role of the latter in goal-directed behavior has been debated, but recent data indicate that the ventral and lateral subregions of the OFC are needed to integrate changes in the relationships between actions and their outcomes. Neuromodulatory agents are also crucial components of prefrontal functions and behavioural flexibility might depend upon the noradrenergic modulation of prefrontal cortex. Therefore, we assessed whether noradrenergic innervation of the OFC plays a role in updating action-outcome relationships. We used an identity-based reversal task and found that depletion or chemogenetic silencing of noradrenergic inputs within the OFC rendered rats unable to associate new outcomes with previously acquired actions. Silencing of noradrenergic inputs in the medial prefrontal cortex or depletion of dopaminergic inputs in the OFC did not reproduce this deficit. Together, our results indicate that noradrenergic projections to the OFC are required to update goal-directed actions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prioritization of semantic over visuo-perceptual aspects in multi-item working memory</a></h4>

              
                Working Memory (WM) keeps information temporarily available for upcoming tasks. How the contents of WM are distinguished from perceptual representations on the one hand, and from long-term memories on the other, is still debated. Here, we leveraged recent evidence for a reversal of processing dynamics when retrieving episodic long-term memories as opposed to perceiving visual input. In two experiments (n=75 and n=103), we asked participants to hold one or more items in WM and to report their low-level perceptual and high-level semantic qualities. In both experiments, we found faster responses to the items' semantic qualities, indicating prioritization over visuo-perceptual aspects, when two or more items were held concurrently in WM. These dynamics of accessing information in multi-item WM were akin to those in retrieving episodic long-term memories and opposite to those in processing visual inputs. Little to no semantic prioritization was evident during single-item maintenance, consistent with a strictly capacity-limited focus of attention within which WM information can be transformed into a prospective action plan.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Thalamocortical contribution to cognitive task activity</a></h4>

              
                Thalamocortical interaction is a ubiquitous functional motif in the mammalian brain. Previously (Hwang et al., 2021), we reported that lesions to network hubs in the human thalamus are associated with multi-domain behavioral impairments in language, memory, and executive functions. Here we show how task-evoked thalamic activity and thalamocortical interactions are organized to support these broad cognitive abilities. To address this question, we analyzed functional MRI data from human subjects that performed 127 tasks encompassing a broad range of cognitive representations. We first investigated the spatial organization of task-evoked activity and found that multi-task thalamic activity converged onto a low-dimensional structure, through which a basis set of activity patterns are evoked to support processing needs of each task. Specifically, the anterior, medial, and posterior-medial thalamus exhibit hub-like activity profiles that are suggestive of broad functional participation. These thalamic task hubs overlapped with network hubs interlinking cortical systems. To further determine the cognitive relevance of thalamocortical interactions, we built a data-driven thalamocortical interaction model to test whether thalamocortical functional connectivity transformed thalamic activity to cortical task activity. The thalamocortical model predicted task-specific cortical activity patterns, and outperformed comparison models built on cortical, hippocampal, and striatal regions. Simulated lesions to low-dimensional, multi-task thalamic hub regions impaired task activity prediction. This simulation result was further supported by profiles of neuropsychological impairments in human patients with focal thalamic lesions. In summary, our results suggest a general organizational principle of how thalamocortical interactions support cognitive task activity.

	<p>Symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) include excessive activity, difficulty sustaining attention, and inability to act in a reflective manner. Early diagnosis and treatment of ADHD is key but may be influenced by the observation and communication skills of caregivers, and the experience of the medical professional. Attempts to obtain additional measures to support the medical diagnosis, such as reaction time when performing a task, can be found in the literature. We propose an information recording system that allows to study in detail the behavior shown by children already diagnosed with ADHD during a car driving video game. We continuously record the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; activity throughout the task and calculate the error committed. Studying the trajectory graphs, some children showed uniform patterns, others lost attention from one point onwards, and others alternated attention/inattention intervals. Results show a dependence between the age of the children and their performance. Moreover, by analyzing the positions by age over time using clustering, we show that it is possible to classify children according to their performance. Future studies will examine whether this detailed information about each child&amp;amp;rsquo;s performance pattern can be used to fine-tune treatment.</p>

	<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has come to be recognized as a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with poorly understood underlying mechanisms. We hypothesized that a history of TBI would be associated with greater tau deposition in elders with high-risk for dementia. A Groups of 20 participants with self-reported history of TBI and 100 without any such history were scanned using [18F]-AV1451 positron emission tomography as part of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Scans were stratified into four groups according to TBI history, and by clinical dementia rating scores into cognitively normal (CDR = 0) and those showing cognitive decline (CDR ≥ 0.5). We pursued voxel-based group comparison of [18F]-AV1451 uptake to identify the effect of TBI history on brain tau deposition, and for voxel-wise correlation analyses between [18F]-AV1451 uptake and different neuropsychological measures and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Compared to the TBI-/CDR ≥ 0.5 group, the TBI+/CDR ≥ 0.5 group showed increased tau deposition in the temporal pole, hippocampus, fusiform gyrus, and inferior and middle temporal gyri. Furthermore, the extent of tau deposition in the brain of those with TBI history positively correlated with the extent of cognitive decline, CSF-tau, and CSF-amyloid. This might suggest TBI to increase the risk for tauopathies and Alzheimer’s disease later in life.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Metabolic and epigenetic dysfunctions underlie the arrest of in vitro fertilized human embryos in a senescent-like state</a></h4>

Around 60% of in vitro fertilized (IVF) human embryos irreversibly arrest before compaction between the 3- to 8-cell stage, posing a significant clinical problem. The mechanisms behind this arrest are unclear. Here, we show that the arrested embryos enter a senescent-like state, marked by cell cycle arrest, the down-regulation of ribosomes and histones and down-regulation of MYC and p53 activity. The arrested embryos can be divided into 3 types. Type I embryos fail to complete the maternal-zygotic transition, and Type II/III embryos have low levels of glycolysis and either high (Type II) or low (Type III) levels of oxidative phosphorylation. Treatment with the SIRT agonist resveratrol or nicotinamide riboside (NR) can partially rescue the arrested phenotype, which is accompanied by changes in metabolic activity. Overall, our data suggests metabolic and epigenetic dysfunctions underlie the arrest of human embryos.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A versatile new tool derived from a bacterial deubiquitylase to detect and purify ubiquitylated substrates and their interacting proteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mengwen Zhang, Jason M. Berk, Adrian B. Mehrtash, Jean Kanyo, Mark Hochstrasser</p>

Protein ubiquitylation is an important posttranslational modification affecting a wide range of cellular processes. Due to the low abundance of ubiquitylated species in biological samples, considerable effort has been spent on methods to purify and detect ubiquitylated proteins. We have developed and characterized a novel tool for ubiquitin detection and purification based on OtUBD, a high-affinity ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD) derived from an <i>Orientia tsutsugamushi</i> deubiquitylase (DUB). We demonstrate that OtUBD can be used to purify both monoubiquitylated and polyubiquitylated substrates from yeast and human tissue culture samples and compare their performance with existing methods. Importantly, we found conditions for either selective purification of covalently ubiquitylated proteins or co-isolation of both ubiquitylated proteins and their interacting proteins. As proof of principle for these newly developed methods, we profiled the ubiquitylome and ubiquitin-associated proteome of the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. Combining OtUBD affinity purification with quantitative proteomics, we identified potential substrates for the E3 ligases Bre1 and Pib1. OtUBD provides a versatile, efficient, and economical tool for ubiquitin research with specific advantages over certain other methods, such as in efficiently detecting monoubiquitylation or ubiquitin linkages to noncanonical sites.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Patient perspectives on home-based rehabilitation exercise and general physical activity after total hip arthroplasty: A qualitative study (PHETHAS-2) [version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Home-based rehabilitation exercise following Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) shows similar outcomes compared to supervised outpatient rehabilitation exercise. Little is known about patients' experiences with home-based rehabilitation, and this study aimed to investigate how patients perceived home-based rehabilitation exercise and general physical activity after THA, focusing on facilitators and barriers. Methods: Semi-structured interviews of qualitative design were conducted with 22 patients who had undergone THA and who had performed home-based rehabilitation exercise. The study took place in a regional hospital in Denmark between January 2018 and May 2019. Data were analyzed using an interpretive thematic analysis approach, with theoretical underpinning from the concept ‘conduct of everyday life’. The study is embedded within the Pragmatic Home-Based Exercise Therapy after Total Hip Arthroplasty-Silkeborg trial (PHETHAS-1). Results: The main theme, ‘wishing to return to the well-known everyday life’, and the subtheme ‘general physical activity versus rehabilitation exercise’ were identified. Generally, participants found the home-based rehabilitation exercise boring but were motivated by the goal of returning to their well-known everyday life and performing their usual general physical activities. Participants enrolled in the PHETHAS-1 study used the enrollment as part of their motivation for doing the exercises.  Both pain and the absence of pain were identified as barriers for doing home-based rehabilitation exercise. Pain could cause insecurity about possible medical complications, while the absence of pain could lead to the rehabilitation exercise being perceived as pointless. Conclusions: The overall goal of returning to the well-known everyday life served as a facilitator for undertaking home-based rehabilitation exercise after THA along with the flexibility regarding time and place for performing exercises. Boring exercises as well as both pain and no pain were identified as barriers to the performance of home-based rehabilitation exercise. Participants were motivated towards performing general physical activities which were part of their everyday life.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Dry textile electrode for ambulatory monitoring after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation: A pilot study of simultaneous comparison to the Holter electrocardiogram [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standard for ambulatory monitoring of atrial fibrillation (AF) but it is insufficient because of its limited recording time. Although several consumer ECG devices provide longer recording time, they generally do not undergo the regulatory process for medical use. Furthermore, current medical-grade devices for longer ECG monitoring are not continuous or too invasive for AF monitoring. A wearable ECG with a medical-grade dry textile electrode is a promising technology to remedy this limitation. This pilot study aimed to simultaneously compare the wearable and Holter ECGs for ambulatory monitoring in a clinical setting. Methods: This prospective observational study enrolled 18 patients who underwent AF ablation. One day after AF ablation, ambulatory ECG was obtained for three hours simultaneously using both the wearable and Holter ECG devices. Automatic ECG interpretations between devices were compared with correlation and agreement analyses. Results: Simultaneous ECG monitoring demonstrated a comparable analysis time and total heart beats between the two devices. Almost complete correlation and agreement were also demonstrated in all clinically relevant testing aspects except in R-wave amplitude (r = 0.743, p < .001). AF was detected in three patients. AF duration was the same in both ECG devices in two patients with continuous AF. In the remaining patient with intermittent AF, AF duration was shortened by 0.6% with the wearable ECG as compared to that with the Holter ECG. Conclusions: Simultaneous ECG comparison revealed a high consistency between the wearable and Holter ECG devices. The results of this study warrant further clinical studies for long-term monitoring of ambulatory ECG after AF ablation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Determinants of under-five anaemia in the high prevalence regions of Ghana [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Anaemia is a serious public health issue that mostly affects children and women throughout their lives, resulting in a high morbidity and mortality burden. It is the third most dominant cause of hospital admission among children under-five in Ghana and the fourth leading cause of under-five mortality in Ghana.  This study aims to identify the determinants of under-five anaemia in the high prevalent regions of Ghana using the Ghana Malaria Indicator Survey (2019 GMIS). Methods: An analytic cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the Ghana Malaria Indicator Survey (2019 GMIS). The data was analysed using SPSS version 20.  The relationship between the dependent and independent variables was established using the chi-square test and binary logistic regression model. A p-value of 0.05 was used to determine the statistical significance of the study. Results: There were 913 eligible under-five children for this study, with 50.2% males and 49.8% females. The prevalence of under-five anaemia recorded in this current study for the three northern regions was 68.0%. The region with dominant (72.9%) prevalence was the Upper East region. Children of lower age group were more likely to be diagnosed with anaemia (P < 0.05). Children with female household heads were 35% less likely to be diagnosed with anaemia (AOR=0.65, 95% C.I.= 0.421-0.995). Those who had mothers with higher educational attainment were 79% less likely to be diagnosed with anaemia (AOR=0.21, 95% C.I.=0.085–0.541). Finally, those with history of fever in the last weeks were 62% more likely (AOR=1.62, 95% C.I. = 1.155–2.282). Conclusions: The high prevalence in the three northern regions of Ghana can be corrected with women empowerment through higher formal educational achievement and improved income status.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Expressive writing in a Saudi university English foreign language (EFL) classroom: Evaluating gains in syntactic complexity [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This study determines if the English foreign language (EFL) Saudi students achieve greater syntactic complexity when they engage in expressive writing than when they write about a general topic. Methods: This study employs an ex post facto research design to compare the writing output of EFL learners. The sample comprised of 24 college students enrolled in an English writing course, at Department of English and Translation, College of Sciences and Arts, Qassim University, Saudi Arabia for the academic year 2021-2022. The participants were assigned randomly, and their writing was analyzed using the computer software named Web-based L2 Syntactic Complexity Analyzer. Lu’s (2010) four board element of syntactic complexity and 14 units is employed to analyze the data. Results: Results show that students achieve higher syntactic complexity when engaging in writing on emotional topics (expressive writing) than when writing on general topics. Further, analysis shows that students' emotional writings are significant on three syntactic complexity measures, i.e., length of production units; amount of subordination; and phrase sophistication. The fourth measure, i.e., coordination, does not reflect significant differences between their expressive writing and general writing. Conclusions: The study's implications are expected to aid EFL instructors and curriculum designers in successfully implementing language education, particularly in writing, in the Saudi context. In line with the input hypothesis, this research suggests that writing about personal emotional events may enhance the quality of language two (L2) writing by increasing syntactic complexity. In this dimension, this study could be additional evidence of the Krashen hypothesis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Detection of mecA gene and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated from milk and risk factors from farms in Probolinggo, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Staphylococcus aureus is commonly found in dairy cows and is a source of contamination in milk. S. aureus that are resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics are referred to as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The spread of MRSA cannot be separated from sanitation management during milking; it can originate from milk collected from the udder or from the hands of farmers during the milking process. The purpose of this study was to examine the level of MRSA contamination in dairy cow's milk and farmer's hand swabs. Methods: A total of 109 samples of dairy cow’s milk and 41 samples of farmers’ hand swabs were collected at a dairy farm in Probolinggo, East Java, Indonesia. Samples were cultured and purified using mannitol salt agar (MSA). The profile of S. aureus resistance was established by disk diffusion test using a disk of beta-lactam antibiotics, namely oxacillin and cefoxitin. Results: The S. aureus isolates that were resistant to oxacillin and cefoxitin antibiotics were then tested for oxacillin resistance screening agar base (ORSAB) as a confirmation test for MRSA identity. S. aureus isolates suspected to be MRSA were then tested genotypically by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to detect the presence of the mecA gene. The results of the isolation and identification found 80 isolates (53.33%) of S. aureus. The results of the resistance test found that 42 isolates (15%) of S. aureus were resistant to oxacillin and 10 isolates (12.5%) were resistant to cefoxitin. The ORSAB test found as many as 20 isolates (47.62%) were positive for MRSA. In PCR testing to detect the presence of the mecA gene, three isolates (30%) were positive for the mecA gene. Conclusions: This study shows that several S. aureus isolates were MRSA and had the gene encoding mecA in dairy farms.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Jamaica salt consumption, Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (Salt-KAP) study: A research protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Excess dietary salt consumption is a major contributor to hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Public education programs on the dangers of high salt intake, and population level interventions to reduce the salt content in foods are possible strategies to address this problem. In Jamaica, there are limited data on the levels of salt consumption and the population’s knowledge and practices with regards to salt consumption. This study therefore aims to obtain baseline data on salt consumption, salt content in foods sold in restaurants, and evaluate knowledge, attitudes, and practices of Jamaicans regarding salt consumption. Methods: The study is divided into four components. Component 1 will be a secondary analysis of data on urinary sodium from spot urine samples collected as part of a national survey, the Jamaica Health and Lifestyle Survey 2016-2017. Component 2 will be a survey of chain and non-chain restaurants in Jamaica, to estimate the sodium content of foods sold in restaurants. Component 3 is another national survey, this time on a sample 1,200 individuals to obtain data on knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding salt consumption and estimation of urinary sodium excretion. Component 4 is a validation study to assess the level of agreement between spot urine sodium estimates and 24-hour urinary sodium from 120 individuals from Component 3. Discussion: This study will provide important baseline data on salt consumption in Jamaica and will fulfil the first components of the World Health Organization SHAKE Technical Package for Salt Reduction. The findings will serve as a guide to Jamaica’s Ministry of Health and Wellness in the development of a national salt reduction program. Findings will also inform interventions to promote individual and population level sodium reduction strategies as the country seeks to achieve the national target of a 30% reduction in salt consumption by 2025.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Knowledge and practice of community pharmacists towards SGLT2 inhibitors [version 2; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of oral anti-diabetic drugs which improve glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by preventing the kidney from reabsorbing glucose back to blood. Community pharmacists have long-term relationships with most of their chronic patients, so they play a key role in care for people with diabetes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess pharmacists’ knowledge and practice towards SGLT2 inhibitors. Thus, improving pharmacists’ knowledge about this group of medications could improve the treatment outcome of people with diabetes. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to meet the study objectives. A convenience sample of 348 community pharmacists in Jordan was recruited. knowledge and practice were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire created for the purpose of this study. Results: A total of 400 community pharmacists were reached, of whom 348 answered the survey (response rate 87%). The results indicated that SGLT2 inhibitors knowledge score among community pharmacists in Jordan was 6.61 (out of 12). Factors like age, gender, location of the pharmacy, years of pharmacists’ experience had no effect on knowledge score; however, pharmacists who attended training courses on diabetes had higher knowledge scores. Additionally, pharmacists’ dispensing practice toward SGLT2 inhibitors had insufficient knowledge, such as lack of knowledge about the superiority of SGLT2 inhibitors over other anti-diabetics and inability to give the best advice to patients. Conclusions: Our findings reflect a moderate knowledge among community pharmacists about SGLT2 inhibitors which may negatively affect the patients’ outcome; thus, continuous education for the pharmacists is essential.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The central melanocortin system is fundamentally important for controlling food intake and energy homeostasis. Melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R) is one of two major receptors of the melanocortin system found in the brain. In contrast to the well-characterized melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R), little is known regarding the organization of MC3R-expressing neural circuits. To increase our understanding of the intrinsic organization of MC3R neural circuits, identify specific differences between males and females, and gain a neural systems level perspective of this circuitry, we conducted a brain-wide mapping of neurons labeled for MC3R and characterized the distribution of their projections. Analysis revealed MC3R neuronal and terminal labeling in multiple brain regions that control a diverse range of physiological functions and behavioral processes. Notably, dense labeling was observed in the hypothalamus, as well as areas that share considerable connections with the hypothalamus, including the cortex, amygdala, thalamus, and brainstem. Additionally, MC3R neuronal labeling was sexually dimorphic in several areas, including the anteroventral periventricular area, arcuate nucleus, principal nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and ventral premammillary region. Altogether, anatomical evidence reported here suggests that MC3R has the potential to influence several different classes of motivated behavior that are essential for survival, including ingestive, reproductive, defensive, and arousal behaviors, and is likely to modulate these behaviors differently in males and females.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Scientific literacy and preferred resources used by Latin American medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic: A multinational survey [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This study aims to identify the preferred sources for acquiring knowledge about COVID-19 and to evaluate basic knowledge on critical scientific literature appraisal in students from medical schools located in Spanish speaking countries in Latin America.  Methods: We designed an online survey of 15 closed-ended questions related to demographics, preferred resources for COVID-19 training, and items to assess critical appraisal skills. A snowball method was used for sampling. We conducted a descriptive analysis and Chi-squared tests to compare the proportion of correct identification of the concept of a preprint and a predatory journal when considering a) self-perceived level of knowledge, b) public vs private school, c) inclusion of a scientific literature appraisal subject in the curriculum, and d) progress in medical school. Results: Our sample included 770 valid responses, out of which most of the participants included were from Mexico (n=283, 36.8%) and Ecuador (n=229, 29.7%). Participants preferred using evidence-based clinical resources (EBCRs) to learn more about COVID-19 (n=182, 23.6%). The preferred study design was case report/series (n=218, 28.1%). We found that only 265 participants correctly identified the concept of a preprint (34.4%), while 243 students (31.6%) correctly identified the characteristics of a predatory journal. We found no significant differences in the proportion of correct answers regardless of the self-perceived level of knowledge, progress in medical school, or scientific literature critical appraisal classes. Conclusion: This study is novel in its approach of identifying sources of knowledge used by Latin American medical students and provides insights into the need to reinforce training in critical appraisal of scientific literature during medical school.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Trends in prevalence and patterns of use of a heated tobacco product (IQOSTM) in Japan: A three-year repeated cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Numerous smoke-free tobacco or nicotine-containing product (TNP) alternatives have been introduced to support individual- and population-level harm reduction relative to continued cigarette smoking. This article details the nationwide prevalence and patterns of TNP use between 2016 and 2019 in Japan following the commercialization of IQOSTM, a smoke-free heated tobacco product (HTP). Methods: Cross-sectional surveys were conducted over a period of three study years (2016/2017, 2017/2018, and 2018/2019) in representative samples of the Japanese general adult population and samples of Japanese adult IQOS users registered in the IQOS owner database of Philip Morris International’s affiliate in Japan. Results: Across the three study years (Y1-Y3), the prevalence of overall current TNP use (Y1-Y3: 18.5%, 18.9%, and 18.2%) and overall TNP use by age and sex remained similar. However, there was a growing shift from cigarette smoking to smoke-free TNP use across the three study years. While the cigarette smoking prevalence (Y1-Y3: 17.6%, 17.3%, and 16.0%) decreased, the use prevalence of smoke-free TNPs, including the HTP IQOS (Y1-Y3: 1.8%, 3.2%, and 3.3%) and e-cigarettes (Y1-Y3, 0.7%, 1.6%, and 2.0%) increased. At the same time, TNP initiation, TNP relapse, and TNP reinitiation with IQOS were all very low across the three study years. Across Y1-Y3, exclusive use of only one type of TNP (Y1-Y3: 82.3%, 75.0%, and 70.4%) decreased, while dual use of two types of TNPs (Y1-Y3: 14.3%, 17.2%, and 16.7%) increased, and poly-TNP use (Y1-Y3: 2.1%, 6.1%, and 10.0%) increased markedly. Moreover, the majority of adult IQOS users were exclusive IQOS users. Conclusions: These findings suggest that current IQOS use behavior trends are in line with the principles of tobacco harm reduction and that HTPs are effective tools for complementing current tobacco control measures.

                  Background: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic and the global spread had created several challenges for the general public and the healthcare workers across the world, the primary aim of this study was to assess the psychological stress, sleep quality, and health-related quality of life (QoL) of individuals with multiple health issues during home quarantine caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The study was conducted between 28th March to 30th April 2020. We recruited 50 individuals who have a history of chronic health issues, and 50 individuals with no health issues for this cross-sectional study. Three questionnaires were used to evaluate the mental health [depression anxiety stress scale (DASS-21)], sleep quality [Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI)], and QoL [short form of health-related questionnaire (SF-36)] of the participants. Statistical analysis was carried out with Student’s t-test, using SPSS software v16. Results: Baseline demographic characteristics were homogenous for both groups of participants. Intergroup analysis revealed statistically significant differences in mental health (p<0.001), sleep quality (p<0.001), and QoL (p<0.001) between the two groups.  The results showed high levels of depression, anxiety and stress; poor sleep quality and low health-related QoL in Group A as compared to Group B. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that individuals with chronic health issues exhibit higher mental health problems, lower quality of sleep and have a lower health-related QoL. More research is required and also government should plan on taking care of those patients.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Cracking the encoding of human scent in the mosquito brain</a></h4>

              
                In a recent study, Zhao et al. decipher how the olfactory system encodes human versus animal odors in the mosquito Aedes aegypti. By combining genome engineering, in vivo calcium imaging, advanced chemistry, and behavioral analysis, the authors provide compelling evidence that the discriminatory coding of host odors is surprisingly simple – and bridges labeled line with combinatorial coding.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Adaptor linked K63 di-Ubiquitin activates Nedd4/Rsp5 E3 ligase</a></h4>

              
                Nedd4/Rsp5 family E3 ligases mediate numerous cellular processes, many of which require the E3 ligase to interact with PY-motif containing adaptor proteins. Several Arrestin-Related Trafficking adaptors (ARTs) of Rsp5 were self-ubiquitinated for activation, but the regulation mechanism remains elusive. Remarkably, we demonstrate that Art1, Art4, and Art5 undergo K63 linked di-Ubiquitination by Rsp5. This modification enhances the PM recruitment of Rsp5 by Art1 or Art5 upon substrate induction, required for cargo protein ubiquitination. In agreement with these observations, we find that di-ubiquitin strengthens the interaction between the Pombe orthologs of Rsp5 and Art1, Pub1 and Any1. Further, we discover that the HECT domain exosite protects the K63 linked di-Ubiquitin on the adaptors from cleavage by the deubiquitination enzyme Ubp2. Together, our study uncovers a novel ubiquitination modification implemented by Rsp5 adaptor proteins, underscoring the regulatory mechanism of how adaptor proteins control the recruitment and activity of Rsp5 for the turnover of membrane proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Gene expression phylogenies and ancestral transcriptome reconstruction resolves major transitions in the origins of pregnancy</a></h4>

              
                Structural and physiological changes in the female reproductive system underlie the origins of pregnancy in multiple vertebrate lineages. In mammals, the glandular portion of the lower reproductive tract has transformed into a structure specialized for supporting fetal development. These specializations range from relatively simple maternal nutrient provisioning in egg-laying monotremes to an elaborate suite of traits that support intimate maternal-fetal interactions in Eutherians. Among these traits are the maternal decidua and fetal component of the placenta, but there is considerable uncertainty about how these structures evolved. Previously we showed that changes in uterine gene expression contributes to several evolutionary innovations during the origins of pregnancy (Marinic, Mika, and Lynch 2021). Here we reconstruct the evolution of entire transcriptomes ('ancestral transcriptome reconstruction') and show that maternal gene expression profiles are correlated with degree of placental invasion. These results indicate that an epitheliochorial-like placenta evolved early in the mammalian stem-lineage and that the ancestor of Eutherians had a hemochorial placenta, and suggest maternal control of placental invasiveness. These data resolve major transitions in the evolution of pregnancy and indicate that ancestral transcriptome reconstruction can be used to study the function of ancestral cell, tissue, and organ systems.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">State-dependent activity dynamics of hypothalamic stress effector neurons</a></h4>

              
                The stress response necessitates an immediate boost in vital physiological functions from their homeostatic operation to elevated emergency response. However, neural mechanisms underlying this state-dependent change remain largely unknown. Using a combination of <i>in vivo</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> electrophysiology with computational modeling, we report that corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), the effector neurons of hormonal stress response, rapidly transition between distinct activity states through recurrent inhibition. Specifically, <i>in vivo</i> optrode recording shows that under non-stress conditions, CRH<sub>PVN</sub> neurons often fire with rhythmic brief bursts (RB), which, somewhat counterintuitively, constrains firing rate due to long (~2 s) inter-burst intervals. Stressful stimuli rapidly switch RB to continuous single spiking (SS), permitting a large increase in firing rate. A spiking network model shows that recurrent inhibition can control this activity-state switch, and more broadly the gain of spiking responses to excitatory inputs. In biological CRH<sub>PVN</sub> neurons <i>ex vivo</i>, the injection of whole-cell currents derived from our computational model recreates the <i>in vivo</i>-like switch between RB and SS, providing a direct evidence that physiologically relevant network inputs enable state-dependent computation in single neurons. Together, we present a novel mechanism for state-dependent activity dynamics in CRH<sub>PVN</sub> neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disruption of lactate metabolism in the peripheral nervous system leads to motor-selective deficits</a></h4>

              
                Schwann cells (SCs) myelinate and provide trophic support to axons in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and disruption of SC cellular metabolism leads to demyelination and axon degeneration, both symptoms of peripheral neuropathies. The lactate shuttle hypothesis proposes that glycolytic support cells supply lactate to adjacent axons to sustain their high metabolic demands, a process that requires the interconversion of lactate and pyruvate via lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in both SCs and neurons. To test this hypothesis in the PNS, we selectively knocked out the genes for both LDH enzymes, LDHA and LDHB, in motor neurons (MNs), sensory neurons (SNs), or SCs. Interestingly, motor axons and their synapses progressively degenerate when LDH is deleted from either MNs or SCs; however, defects in sensory axons or their terminals were not observed when LDH was excised from either SNs or SCs. Deletion of LDH in SCs also leads to a decrease in total ATP levels in peripheral nerves despite a marked accumulation of pyruvate and glycolytic intermediates, consistent with the failure of pyruvate to lactate conversion in SCs leading to energetic deficits in axons. These results support a model in which motor axons are more dependent on SC-derived lactate than are sensory axons, a specific dependency that suggests LDH and lactate shuttling influence the course of motor-dominated neuropathies such as ALS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Local axonal translation sustains synapse-type-specific neurotransmission</a></h4>

              
                Dendritic protein synthesis is a well-known regulator of neurotransmission in the central nervous system. For example, local on-demand protein synthesis in dendrites is required for hippocampal long-term and homeostatic plasticity. Although axonal protein synthesis is a key regulator in neural circuit assembly during early development, it is unclear if local translation in mature axons plays a functional role in neurotransmission of the mammalian central nervous system. Here we show that local translation in axons regulates pyramidal cell neurotransmission in primary visual cortex microcircuits in a synapse-type-specific manner. Using paired recordings to manipulate pre- and postsynaptic neurons independently, we found that presynaptic translation sustains neurotransmission and regulates short-term plasticity. This was mediated via mTOR and cap-dependent translation, with presynaptic NMDA receptors acting as an up-stream trigger. By isolating the axon from the soma with laser microsurgery, we unveiled that axonal translation was required to sustain neurotransmission. With live endogenous RNA imaging, we found that RNA granules stably docked in individual presynaptic compartments, suggesting bouton-specific regulation. In agreement, presynaptic translation influenced pyramidal cell synapses to neighbouring pyramidal cells, but not to inhibitory Martinotti cells. Our study establishes local protein synthesis in mature axons as a fundamental regulatory principle that governs information transfer at central synapses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Interictal Suppression Hypothesis in Focal Epilepsy: Electrographic and Structural Evaluation</a></h4>

              
                Why are people with focal epilepsy not constantly seizing? Previous molecular work has implicated gamma-aminobutyric acid balance as integral to seizure generation and termination, but is the high-level distributed brain network involved in suppressing seizures? Recent intracranial electrographic evidence has suggested that seizure onset zones have an increased inward connectivity. Accordingly, we hypothesize that seizure onset zones are actively suppressed by the rest of the brain network during interictal states. We tested this hypothesis on 81 subjects with drug resistant focal epilepsy undergoing presurgical evaluation. We utilized intracranial electrographic resting-state and neurostimulation recordings to evaluate the network connectivity of seizure onset, propagative, and non-involved regions. We then utilized diffusion imaging to acquire estimates of white matter connectivity to evaluate structure-function coupling effects on connectivity findings. Finally, using our observations, we generated a resting-state classification model to assist clinicians in detecting seizure onset and propagative zones without the need for multiple ictal recordings. Our findings indicate that seizure onset and propagative zones demonstrate markedly increased inward connectivity and decreased outward connectivity on both resting-state and neurostimulation analyses. When controlling for distance between regions, the difference between inward vs. outward connectivity remained stable up to 80 mm between brain connections. Structure-function coupling analyses revealed that seizure onset zones exhibit abnormally enhanced coupling (hypercoupling) of surrounding regions compared to presumably healthy tissue. Using these observations, our classification models achieved a maximum held-out testing set accuracy of 92.0+/-2.2%. These results indicate that seizure onset zones are actively segregated and suppressed by a widespread brain network. Furthermore, this electrographically observed functional suppression is disproportionate to any observed structural connectivity alterations of the seizure onset zones. These findings have implications for the identification of seizure onset zones using only brief resting-sate recordings to reduce patient morbidity and augment the presurgical evaluation of drug resistant epilepsy. Furthermore, testing of the interictal suppression hypothesis can provide insight into potential new resective, ablative, and neuromodulation approaches to improve surgical success rates in those suffering from drug resistant focal epilepsy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Circadian regulation of dentate gyrus excitability mediated by G-protein signaling</a></h4>

              
                The central circadian regulator within the suprachiasmatic nucleus transmits time of day information by a diurnal spiking rhythm that is driven by intrinsic activity of molecular clock genes controlling membrane excitability. Most brain regions, including the hippocampus, harbor similar intrinsic circadian transcriptional machinery but whether these molecular programs generate oscillations of membrane properties is unexplored. Here, we show that intrinsic excitability of mouse dentate granule neurons exhibits a 24-hour oscillation that controls spiking probability. Diurnal changes in excitability are mediated by antiphase G-protein regulation of potassium and sodium conductances to reduce excitability during the light phase. Disruption of the circadian transcriptional machinery by conditional deletion of Bmal1 enhances excitability selectively during the light phase, increasing engram recruitment and spatial discrimination memory. These results reveal that circadian transcriptional machinery regulates intrinsic excitability, highlighting the role of cell-autonomous oscillations in hippocampal function and behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electrical Signaling in Cochlear Efferents is Driven by an Intrinsic Neuronal Oscillator</a></h4>

              
                Efferent neurons are believed to play essential roles in maintaining auditory function. The lateral olivocochlear (LOC) neurons, which project from the brainstem to the inner ear where they release multiple transmitters including peptides, catecholamines and acetylcholine, are the most numerous yet least understood elements of efferent control of the cochlea. Using in vitro calcium imaging and patch-clamp recordings, we found that LOC neurons in juvenile and young adult mice exhibited extremely slow waves of activity (~0.1 Hz). These seconds-long bursts of Na+ spikes were driven by an intrinsic oscillator dependent on L-type Ca2+ channels, and were not observed in prehearing mice, suggesting an age-dependent mechanism underlying the intrinsic oscillator. Using optogenetic approaches, we identified both ascending (cochlear nucleus) and descending (auditory cortex) sources of synaptic excitation, as well as the synaptic receptors used for such excitation. Additionally, we identified potent inhibition originating in the glycinergic medial nucleus of trapezoid body (MNTB). Conductance-clamp experiments revealed an unusual mechanism of electrical signaling in LOC neurons, in which synaptic excitation and inhibition served to switch on and off the intrinsically generated spike burst mechanism, allowing for prolonged periods of activity or silence controlled by brief synaptic events. Protracted bursts of action potentials may be essential for effective exocytosis of the diverse transmitters released by LOC fibers in the cochlea.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Retrieving fMRI data in real-time: difficulties and pitfalls</a></h4>

              
                One of the significant challenges in real-time fMRI environments is to ensure that the functional images are exported in real-time. The prerequired ability to reconstruct these images immediately after the acquisition has already been resolved in 2004. Nowadays, more sophisticated sequences allow for higher resolution and faster repetition times and thereby challenging the ability to export this data in real-time. In this article, we tackle the potentially arising problem of sending the reconstructed data from the MRI to an external PC to perform the real-time fMRI analysis. We show that depending on the implementation of the data transfer, long delays can occur that can differ drastically in time and how often they occur. In addition, we propose a solution for SIEMENS MRI devices which was tested and applied already on multiple MRI devices including 3T and 7T machines on different vendor software versions. This new technique can be used as a blueprint that can be directly applied to other manufacturers. We also provide the source code of the described solution and show that the delay in the data transfer can be completely resolved using our proposed procedure. Finally, we integrate measurement options for the data transfer times to improve quality measures in real-time fMRI environments (e.g., clinical) that can implement the proposed solution. Efforts should be taken by the real-time community and MRI manufacturers to employ a standardized real-time export e.g., similar to the lab streaming layer which is used as a standard export method in EEG environments.

                The complexity of affected brain regions and cell types is a challenge for Huntington disease (HD) treatment. Here we used single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) to investigate mechanism of pathology in the cortex and striatum from R6/2 mice at 8 and 12w and in three regions of human HD post-mortem tissue. We identified cell type-specific and cell agnostic signatures and found changes suggesting oligodendrocytes (OLs) and oligodendrocyte precursors (OPCs) were arrested in intermediate maturation states. OL-lineage regulators OLIG1 and OLIG2 were negatively correlated with CAG length in human OPCs, and ATACseq analysis of HD mouse NeuN-negative cells showed decreased accessibility of sites regulated by OL maturation genes. Glucose and lipid metabolism were implicated in abnormal cell maturation and PRKCE and Thiamine Pyrophosphokinase 1 were identified as central genes. High dose thiamine/biotin treatment of R6/1 HD mice to target thiamine metabolism not only restored OL maturation, but also rescued pathology in neurons. These findings reveal insights into HD OL pathology that spans multiple brain regions and link OL maturation deficits to abnormal thiamine metabolism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Impaired neuromodulator crosstalk delays vigilance-dependent astroglia Ca2+ activation in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Degeneration in neuronal nuclei producing the neuromodulators acetylcholine and norepinephrine is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therapeutic interventions that increase acetylcholine in brain ameliorate AD symptoms in human patients, and augmenting norepinephrine restores cognitive function in mouse models of AD as well as Down Syndrome, the most frequent cause of early onset AD. A prominent cellular target of noradrenergic and potentially cholinergic signaling during states of heightened vigilance are astroglia and recent studies indicate that astroglia Ca2+ dynamics in awake mice contribute to optimal cognitive performance. Here we tested the hypothesis that vigilance-dependent Ca2+ signaling in mouse primary visual cortex astrocytes is altered in mouse models of AD and provide mechanistic insight into upstream neuromodulator signaling that shapes astrocyte Ca2+ dynamics in healthy and AD conditions. In two mouse models of AD (APPswe/PSEN1dE9 and AppNL-F KI), we consistently observed delayed and less coordinated astrocyte Ca2+ elevations in response to locomotion, a well-controlled behavioral paradigm triggering widespread Ca2+ activation in astroglia throughout the brain. Combining pharmacological and genetic manipulations, we found that noradrenergic signaling to astrocytes was facilitated by cholinergic signaling, but this neuromodulator crosstalk was impaired in AppNL-F mice. Pharmacological facilitation of norepinephrine release rescued delayed and less coordinated astrocyte Ca2+ activation in AppNL-F mice and suggests that astrocytes preserve a functional reserve that can be recruited even during late-stage disease. Our findings of delayed and less coordinated astroglia Ca2+ activation predict impaired noradrenergic signaling and may contribute to the cognitive decline in AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural Population Dynamics of Computing with Synaptic Modulations</a></h4>

              
                In addition to long-time scale rewiring, synapses in the brain are subject to significant modulation that occurs at much shorter time scales and allows them to process short-term information. Despite this, models of the brain like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) often have their weights frozen after training, relying on an internal state stored in neuron activity to process temporal information. Although networks with dynamical synapses have been explored previously, often said dynamics are added to networks that also have recurrent connections and thus the short-time scale computational capabilities of synapse modulation alone remain unclear. In this work, we analyze the dynamics of a network that relies solely on synaptic modulations to process short-time scale information, the multi-plasticity network (MPN). We thoroughly examine the neural population dynamics of the MPN trained on integration-based tasks and compare it to known RNN dynamics, findings the two to have fundamentally different behavior and attractor structure. We find said differences in dynamics allow the MPN to outperform its RNN counterparts on several neuroscience-relevant tasks. Of note, the MPN has a significantly simpler attractor structure that allows it to be more flexible in training and sequential-learning settings. Lastly, how the dynamics change for MPNs trained on contextual and continuous integration tasks is also investigated.

                Early access to categorical visual information plays an important role in real-world behaviour. Under fixed-gaze conditions, there are well-established electrophysiological signatures of categorical processing like the N170 EEG component. Here we aimed to study how the sensitivity to category information extends to a free viewing paradigm and consider how ecologically-relevant variables such as the particular task performed influence the brain activity. We co-registered EEG and eye-tracking to investigate fixation-related potentials to pictures of different categories during visual search and exploration. Participants were asked to observe or search for one target from an array of faces and objects embedded in random noise. We applied a deconvolution analysis approach to estimate the contribution of the different elements embedded in the task. Consistent with classical fixed-gaze experiments and a handful of free viewing studies, we found a robust categorial effect in occipital and occipitotemporal electrodes. We also report a task effect, which was reflected by a negative occipital activation and a positive frontal activation of the estimates. To further investigate the dynamics along the trial, we defined a trial progression score and found significant effects of trial progression, and the interaction between the trial progression and task effects. Overall, these results generalise the characterisation of early visual face processing to a wider range of experiments and show how a suitable analysis approach allows to discern among multiple neural contributions to the signal, preserving key attributes of real-world tasks.

                In the mammalian brain, presynaptic CaV2 channels play a pivotal role for synaptic transmission by mediating fast neurotransmitter exocytosis via influx of Ca2+ into the active zone of presynaptic terminals. However, the distribution and modulation of CaV2.2 channels at highly plastic hippocampal synapses remains to be elucidated. Here, we assess CaV2.2 channels during homeostatic synaptic plasticity, a compensatory form of homeostatic control preventing excessive or insufficient neuronal activity during which extensive active zone remodelling has been described. We show that chronic silencing of neuronal activity in mature hippocampal cultures resulted in elevated presynaptic Ca2+ transients, mediated by increased levels of CaV2.2 channels at the presynaptic site. This work focussed further on the role of 2{delta}-1 subunits, important regulators of synaptic transmission and CaV2.2 channel abundance at the presynaptic membrane. We find that 2{delta}-1-overexpression reduces the contribution of CaV2.2 channels to total Ca2+ flux without altering the amplitude of the Ca2+ transients. Levels of endogenous 2{delta}-1 decreased during homeostatic synaptic plasticity, whereas the overexpression of 2{delta}-1 prevented homeostatic synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons. Together, this study reveals a key role for CaV2.2 channels and novel roles for 2{delta}-1 during synaptic plastic adaptation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mice lacking dopamine production in neurotensin receptor 1 neurons voluntarily undergo time-restricted feeding of high fat diet and resist obesity</a></h4>

              
                The introduction of processed foods high in fat and sugars has caused a dramatic increase in obesity in humans. Diet-induced obesity (DIO) can be modeled in laboratory mice by increasing the fat content of their diet. Previously, it was determined that mice lacking dopamine receptor 1 (Drd1) are completely resistant to DIO and do not eat as much food during the day as control mice. Surprisingly, when Drd1 is restored to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is the central regulator of circadian rhythms, these mice increase day-eating and become obese. The source of dopamine in the SCN is the ventral tegmental area (VTA), but the genetic identity of the dopamine neurons is unknown. Here we create conditional deletion mutants for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) using neurotensin receptor 1 (Ntsr1) Cre and other Cre drivers and measure feeding and body weight homeostasis on standard and high fat diets. Control mice were susceptible to DIO and overate during the day whereas Ntsr1-Cre conditional knockouts for TH mice did not increase day-eating, nor did they gain much weight on HFD. We used an adeno-associated virus to selectively restore TH to the VTA Ntsr1 neurons and observed an increase in body weight and increased day-eating of HFD. These results implicate VTA Ntsr1 dopamine neurons as promoting out-of-phase feeding behavior on a high fat diet that could be an important contributor to diet-induced obesity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High Variability Periods in the EEG: A New Temporal Metric that Reflects Brain States</a></h4>

              
                Here we define a new metric to characterize temporal patterns of amplitude variability in the EEG signal and demonstrate that this feature of the signal varies significantly with brain state. The metric uses the standard deviation of waveform amplitude in a short moving time window of 3-20 seconds with 50% overlap. We define High Variability Periods or HVPs as segments when the moving standard deviation of the waveform amplitude is continuously higher than a cutoff defined as the 25th percentile of variability. HVPs typically last on the order of tens of seconds and are punctuated by Low Variability Periods or LVPs of shorter duration. We further show that the HVP characteristics differ between various conditions. HVPs in the resting state eyes closed condition are substantially and significantly shorter in duration and smaller in area relative to eyes open. In addition, in recordings from monkeys, HVPs disappear under anesthesia and do not reappear in early periods of recovery from anesthesia suggesting long term changes to the signal. Altogether this demonstrates that HVP metrics have discriminatory power and may therefore be important in predicting brain states and outcomes. Finally, they are fast to estimate and can be tracked in time, and therefore suited for near real-time monitoring in low-electrode configuration systems.
