<p>Our findings demonstrate that the human nodose ganglion expresses <i>Glp1r</i> mRNA and reveal species similarities and differences in <i>Glp1r</i> expression between humans and mice.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Given the rapidly expanding clinical use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) agonists—well-known for their antidiabetic and antiobesity effects—it is increasingly important to understand the precise distribution of GLP1R expression in the human body, as this knowledge is crucial for elucidating both their therapeutic effects and side effects. In this study, we investigated <i>Glp1r</i> mRNA expression in the human nodose ganglion, a key sensory relay between the periphery and the brain. We analyzed postmortem paraffin-embedded nodose ganglia sections from 10 human donors, using RNAscope analysis. We found that optimal tissue required fixation times under 48 h and postmortem intervals of approximately 10 h or less. Ultimately, nine nodose ganglia from six donors met quality standards for analysis. Using multiplex RNAscope, we detected moderate to high levels of <i>Glp1r</i> expression in approximately 7% of all nodose neurons, with no clear differences between sides, sex, or age. The proportion of neurons with low <i>Glp1r</i> expression rose to nearly 28%. Notably, <i>Glp1r</i> expression was also observed in nonneuronal cells within the perineurium, epineurium, and fascicles of the human vagus nerve. As a point of comparison, we also examined <i>Glp1r</i> expression in mice, where 17.9%–29.1% of nodose neurons were positive, with slightly higher expression on the right side. In mice, <i>Glp1r</i> expression was strictly neuronal. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the human nodose ganglion is a potential target for GLP1R-based therapeutics and reveal species similarities and differences in <i>Glp1r</i> expression between humans and mice.</p>

<p>Axons expressing the adrenaline-synthesizing enzyme, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), project widely throughout the spinal cord. Many of these axons are from C1 neurons of the rostral ventrolateral medulla. We confirm that dense arrays of PNMT-expressing, C1-derived axons surround thoracolumbar sympathetic preganglionic neurons, many of which are putative vasomotor neurons. The C1/PNMT axons are also more widespread, innervating sacral preganglionic neurons activated by the micturition reflex and, very sparsely, somatic motor neurons in the ventral horn.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>We examined the distribution of axons throughout the spinal cord of the rat that were either immunoreactive for the adrenaline-synthesizing enzyme, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), or derived from medullary C1 neurons, one of the three groups of neurons in the brain that synthesize PNMT. We observed that PMNT-immunoreactive axons, as well as C1 axons labelled with GFP from viral transduction, innervate most, but not all, sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the thoracolumbar spinal cord. GFP-positive C1 axons provided innervation to sympathetic preganglionic neurons that expressed cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript, an accepted marker of sympathetic vasomotor neurons. In addition, we observed axons from PNMT-containing and C1 neurons caudal to the distribution of sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the sacral spinal cord where they closely apposed parasympathetic preganglionic neurons retrogradely labelled from the major pelvic ganglion. We also found close appositions from PNMT-immunoreactive or GFP-labelled C1 axons on choline acetyltransferase-stained parasympathetic preganglionic neurons activated by the micturition reflex, thus providing clear evidence of a non-cardiovascular target for RVLM C1 neurons. Furthermore, we observed a few PNMT-positive and GFP-positive C1 axons making close appositions with somatic motor neurons in Onuf's nucleus in the sacral cord and in the ventral horn at more rostral levels. These data provide a comprehensive map of the distribution of adrenergic inputs to the spinal cord and identify parasympathetic preganglionic neurons, including those involved in the micturition reflex, as well as sympathetic preganglionic neurons as the major targets for these inputs.</p>

                Background Sensorineural hearing loss in children, when associated with specific risk factors, can negatively affect language development, which in turn impacts their quality of life as well as their family and social environment. Objective To determine the association between risk factors for severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss and auditory performance in post–cochlear implant patients at Instituto Nacional de Salud del Niño, San Borja, during the period from 2021 to 2024. Methods An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted. Data collection was performed through a review of medical records; information was obtained from children treated between 2021 and 2024, including sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of post–cochlear implant patients. Auditory performance was assessed using the PEACH test. Results Medical records from 100 children who underwent cochlear implant surgery were reviewed. Preterm children showed poorer auditory performance (52.8%) compared with those born at term (70.5%). Children with low birth weight recorded a PEACH score of 51.4%, whereas those with normal birth weight reached higher values (71.8%). Additionally, children implanted before their first year of life presented a lower rate of suboptimal performance (40%), while those implanted after the age of three reached 56.5% performance. Analysis of risk factors associated with auditory outcomes revealed that prematurity, low birth weight, severe asphyxia, and hydrocephalus were significantly associated with poorer auditory performance. Conclusions There is a significant association between risk factors and reduced auditory performance in children with sensorineural hearing loss who underwent cochlear implant surgery, particularly among those born prematurely, with low birth weight, severe asphyxia, or hydrocephalus.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-384/v4?src=rss">Integrated water quality assessment and health risk analysis of heavy metal and microbial contamination in the Ichu River, Peru [version 4; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The Ichu River serves as the primary water source for urban consumption, agricultural irrigation, and several local industrial operations in the Huancavelica region; however, increasing anthropogenic pressures including untreated municipal wastewater, mining effluents, agricultural runoff, and expanding urbanization have significantly deteriorated its water quality. These combined stressors highlight the need for an integrated assessment to understand the extent of contamination and associated human health risks. Methods The investigation measured water quality and health-related risks by analyzing physicochemical parameters, heavy metals, and microbial pollutants at eight sampling points, site 1 (S1) through (S8). Results The research data showed that water quality worsened progressively from upstream to downstream locations such as turbidity, TDS, conductivity, and BOD levels increased. Oil pollution and oxygen depletion arose from a reduction in dissolved oxygen from 6.3 to 4.5 mg/L at the different sampling sites (S1 to S8). Heavy metals (As, Pb, Cd, and Cr) in the samples exceeded the standards established by the World Health Organization (WHO) established standards because of mining and industrial wastewater and local wastewater discharge. The presence of excessive Escherichia coli (E. coli) and total coliforms in microbial tests proved that the water was severely contaminated by fecal matter. Principal Component Analysis showed that heavy metals exist with microbial pollution and organic load as the main sources of water quality decline, and pollution indicators were found to establish powerful relationships with depleted oxygen levels. Conclusion The severe contamination risks found in this study justify immediate pollution control measures, wastewater treatment enforcement, and sustainable watershed management practices. Urgent action is necessary because vital parameters surpass the standards set by the WHO and (United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to avoid enduring environmental damage and health problems. This research demonstrates the value of continuing water quality assessments while enforcing policies and raising public awareness to improve the water quality of the Ichu River.

                Background Neglect is the most prevalent manifestation of maltreatment of a child, which can have severe long-term and short-term consequences. The negative consequences of childhood neglect are not just limited to childhood but are found to be related to minor to major emotional issues during adulthood. Methods The study employs a cross-sectional research design to explore the effects of childhood neglect on difficulties in emotional regulation and a preference for solitude among young adults, using path analysis. Using the purposive sampling method, 209 young adults aged 19 to 30 years were selected. The Multidimensional Neglectful Behaviour Scale Form A, which measures neglect of physical needs (PN), supervisory needs (SN), cognitive needs (CN), and emotional needs (EN), as well as the Preference for Solitude scale and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale-Short Form I, were utilised for data collection. Result Path analysis revealed a significant direct effect of experiencing childhood emotional and supervisory neglect on difficulties in emotional regulation among young adults. A preference for solitude was not significantly predicted by childhood neglect or difficulties in emotional regulation. Conclusion The study signifies that the experience of various forms of childhood neglect does not occur in isolation and is not limited to troubled childhood, but can echo into adulthood, resulting in deprived emotional capacities.

                Objective The study aims to explore how the features and components of digital maturity influence the enhancement of e-service quality at Al-Rafidain Bank – Fallujah Branch. Design/Methodology The study employed a descriptive-analytical methodology, utilizing a questionnaire as the primary tool to measure the relationships between variables. Theoretical/Framework This study investigates the impact of digital maturity on e-service quality (reliability, trust, security, responsiveness, ease of invective, data confidentiality, etc.) to find out if Al-Rafidain Bank will be able to serve its customers more efficiently and effectively in the coming years Findings The findings showed a strong correlation and a significant impact of digital maturity on the quality of e-services offered. It was also established that digital maturity explained between 53% and 56% of the service quality variance. The strongest drivers in this regard included technological culture, organizational structures, and visions and perceptions, while the impact of technological tools was weak in the absence of effective implementation. These findings suggest that to achieve superior quality in e-services, having technology available is a prerequisite. However, having technology is not enough; it should be combined with organizational elements, staff empowerment, and a predominant digital vision. Thus, digital maturity is an essential determinant for performance improvement and institutional digital transformation. Conclusions The results showed that Al-Rafidain Bank – Fallujah Branch, Al-Rafidain Bank in the Fallujah branch, maintains a high level of digital maturity, which is a result of advanced technology coupled with quality e-services. The technological culture organization, and digital vision framework uniquely enhance service quality, demonstrating the need to provide all the digital components in order to attain a tangible transformation that is viable and efficient.

                Background Immune dysregulation—particularly involving cytokines and chemokines—contributes to breast cancer progression and metastasis. To compare circulating levels of interleukin-17 (IL-17), interleukin-34 (IL-34), and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) between premenopausal and postmenopausal women with breast cancer and age-matched healthy controls. Methods In this case–control study, 130 women were enrolled: 90 patients with breast cancer (45 premenopausal; 45 postmenopausal) and 40 healthy controls (20 premenopausal; 20 postmenopausal). Serum IL-17, IL-34, and CXCL12 concentrations were quantified by ELISA. Group differences were assessed using independent-samples t-tests. Results Mean serum levels of IL-17, IL-34, and CXCL12 were significantly higher in patients than in controls across both menopausal strata (all p < 0.001). The pattern of elevation was consistent in premenopausal and postmenopausal subgroups, indicating that the observed immune perturbations are not restricted by menopausal status. Conclusions IL-17, IL-34, and CXCL12 are markedly elevated in women with breast cancer irrespective of menopausal state and may serve as accessible immune biomarkers for disease detection and monitoring.

                Objective The main objective of the study lies in identifying the impact of brand leadership in achieving brand addiction, and Apple, Samsung, and Huawei companies were chosen as the field of study. Study Methodology and Tools In order to achieve the objectives of the study, the researchers adopted the descriptive-analytical method to collect data accurately and in detail about the phenomenon, and then analyze it to extract results and interpretations. Accordingly, the study investigated the opinions of a sample of customers of Apple, Samsung, and Huawei companies at the level of Iraq, in line with the nature of the studied variables. The questionnaire was formulated as the main tool for data collection, and (395) questionnaires were distributed electronically through a Google form, using the five-point Likert scale, and processed and analyzed using appropriate statistical methods. Results The study reached a set of results, the most important of which is the existence of a partial effect of brand leadership in achieving brand addiction in the investigated companies. The study concluded with a set of recommendations related to the study variables, the most important of which is focusing on strengthening brand leadership, which enhances customer addiction to the brand and the sustainability of their relationship with it, in addition to future research directions.

                Background Myocardial ischemia is a dynamic, complex process characterized by hyperkalemia, acidosis, and ATP depletion. While these three conditions alter cardiomyocyte electrophysiology, it is difficult to discern how much each one individually contributes to the resulting changes in action potential (AP). In this study, we test whether machine learning can deconvolute these distinct ischemic patterns within a single AP. Methods We developed a multi-target regression model trained on data generated by the Luo-Rudy (1991) computational model of a ventricular cardiomyocyte, simulating a wide range of ischemic conditions. The model was designed to predict two continuous variables: extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]o) and intracellular pH (pHi). Results The model achieved high accuracy on a held-out test set, with mean squared errors (MSE) below 0.25 for [K+]o and below 0.01 for pHi. To further generalize this model, we applied this trained model to a structurally distinct model, the Ten Tusscher (2006) framework. We were able to accurately predict [K+]o and pHi from APs, demonstrating that the learned principles are robust. A feature importance analysis revealed that resting membrane potential (RMP) was the strongest predictor for [K+]o, while action potential duration (APD) is most important for predicting pHi, underscoring these distinct cardiomyocyte electrophysiological patterns Conclusions Our approach can distinguish distinct ischemic drivers and has potential for in silico drug screening and mechanistic analysis.

">Lets talk about sex: Male and female mice show similar fear memory retention despite hippocampal activity differences during encoding and consolidation</a></h4>

              
                Accurate and efficient memory processing is essential for survival. Recent work in human subjects and animal models has suggested that memory processing may differ in meaningful ways between males and females. In mice, contextual fear memory (CFM) encoding, consolidation, and recall have been well studied, and the mouse hippocampus and amygdala have been implicated in these processes. The present study addresses how the specific contribution of these brain regions to each stage CFM processing in female vs. male mice. We find that male and female mice show no differences in CFM recall, nor in sleep behavior in the hours following single-trial contextual fear conditioning (CFC), which is essential for CFM consolidation. However, females, but not males, show significantly increased expression of cFos in dorsal hippocampal CA1 and CA2 neurons during CFM encoding. On the other hand, males, but not females, show increased cFos expression among DG granule cells during CFM consolidation. These findings highlight the fact that the neurobiological underpinnings of memory processing may differ between males and females, even when recall performance is identical.

">APPNL-F knock-in Alzheimer's Disease model mice reveal etiological convergence of aging and amyloidosis</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia worldwide, with a steadily increasing prevalence. Despite the advent of some plaque-degrading therapies, early intervention strategies are still suboptimal, largely due to an incomplete understanding of how early pathological events of amyloid-b (Ab) plaque deposition entail or accompany the neuroinflammatory processes that ensue. The APPNL-F mouse line is a second-generation endogenous-promoter knock-in AD model that represents a valuable tool to dissect disease mechanisms and evaluate therapeutic strategies. However, the early prodromal stage remains poorly characterized. Here we performed in-depth analyses in both homozygous (APPNL-F/NL-F) and heterozygous (APPNL-F/WT) mice at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of age. Among a battery of behavioural tests, the first phenotype was observed at 9 months with defects in spatial memory. Using hypersensitive MSD-ELISA technology assays we quantified distinct Ab species and found that Ab42 oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrillar aggregates were detectable as early as 6 months of age in homozygous APPNL-F/NL-F mice. By 9 months, their Ab42 levels increased markedly and overt Ab plaques were detected, histologically associated with recruited glial cells. Targeted RT-qPCR analysis of neuroinflammation-related genes in the cortex also identified 9 months as a molecular tipping point in these 'middle aged' APPNL-F mice. To characterize the etiological signal transduction at the cellular level, we isolated microglia, the brain resident immune cells, whose contribution to AD pathogenesis is now well established. Sequencing around 5,000 individual cells from both 12-month-old APPNL F/NL F and APPWT/WT CD11b+ myeloid cells revealed that the buildup of amyloidosis was associated with an accelerated shift of microglia from a homeostatic toward a senescent-like state. Together, these findings highlight the 6-12 month period of the APPNL-F/NL-F model as a powerful system to study the interdependence between microglial senescence and amyloidosis in driving AD progression.

">A Conserved Locus Coeruleus fMRI Signature of Brain-State Transitions across Sleep, Anesthesia, and Wakefulness</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulatory systems dynamically reconfigure large-scale brain networks to support adaptation across behavioral and cognitive states. The locus coeruleus (LC), which broadcasts noradrenaline throughout the forebrain, is a central regulator of arousal and state-dependent dynamics. However, how LC activity manifests in brain-wide organization across physiological contexts, and how it biases fMRI connectivity, remains poorly understood. Using an optogenetically informed cross-species framework, we identify a transient LC-derived spatiotemporal pattern of brain activity accompanying brain-state transitions under progressively naturalistic conditions: controlled LC stimulation and endogenous LC fluctuations in anesthetized mice, sleep-wake transitions in rodents and humans, and resting-state activity in awake humans. This LC-derived signature is conserved across species and contexts, leaving a robust and detectable imprint on the BOLD signal. Critically, the prevalence of LC events systematically biases functional connectivity metrics in human fMRI. These findings establish LC activity as a mechanistically interpretable source of variability in resting-state measurements, with direct implications for the interpretation of fMRI biomarkers in arousal-related disorders.

">Feasibility of PIANO-Cog for older adults: A randomised controlled pilot trial exploring changes in cognition and brain microstructure.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Executive functions are a key target of cognitive interventions for older adults due to their central role in daily functioning and maintaining a good quality of life. Piano training has been proposed as an ecologically valid method of improving cognition and brain structure in older adults. The primary aims of this study were to (i) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of Piano Instruction for Adult Novices as an Online Cognitive Intervention (PIANO-Cog), a novel bespoke 8-week self-guided piano training programme for adults over 50 years of age, and (ii) assess the feasibility of conducting a fully-powered randomised controlled trial (RCT), including recruitment, retention, and adherence. Secondary aims explored effects of PIANO-Cog on executive functions and brain microstructure using advanced diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Method: Thirty-three healthy music novices aged 51-80 years (M = 63.73, SD = 7.94) participated in a two-arm unblinded feasibility RCT. Participants were assigned by stratified allocation for age and sex to either (i) 8 weeks of PIANO-Cog, requiring 30 minutes of practice, 5 days per week, or (ii) a passive control group. Cognitive assessment and MRI scanning were conducted before and after the intervention using a strong-gradient (300mT/m) 3T Connectom scanner to acquire multi-shell DWI data with b-values ranging from 200 to 6,000 s/mm2. Grey and white matter microstructure were modelled with Soma And Neurite Density Imaging (SANDI) and Neurite Orientation Density and Dispersion Imaging (NODDI). Results: According to predefined criteria, feasibility was established for recruitment (91.6%), retention (75%) and adherence (>100%) rates. Preliminary observations suggest that piano training compared with control was associated with improvements in verbal fluency and multiple changes in brain microstructure including increases in apparent soma size and radius and reductions in extracellular signal in frontal and temporal cortical regions, larger apparent neurite density in right inferior frontal gyrus and changes in neurite dispersion in left middle temporal and right precentral gyri. Discussion: The results demonstrate that short-term remote piano training is a feasible cognitive intervention for healthy adults over 50. Preliminary evidence suggest that PIANO-Cog was associated cognitive improvements and changes in brain microstructure in executive, auditory and motor regions.

">Oscillatory and aperiodic neural dynamics shape temporal perception and weighting of perceptual priors in ADHD profiles</a></h4>

              
                Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by an atypically compressed sense of time, yet the neural mechanisms underlying this atypical temporal perception remain poorly understood. Temporal perception depends on the brain's ability to organize sensory input into coherent experiences, ensuring perceptual stability despite uncertainty. Oscillations in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) and aperiodic 1/f dynamics have been proposed as key neural mechanisms through which the visual system orchestrates sensory information over time. Individuals with ADHD show atypicalities in these neural dynamics, but how these features relate to ADHD differences in temporal processing remains unexplored. Here, we combined a sustained visual temporal integration task with resting-state EEG to test whether oscillatory and aperiodic neural dynamics jointly account for temporal processing performance across neurotypical participants with self-reported ADHD traits (n = 83). Higher ADHD features in both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive domains were associated with narrower temporal binding windows and reduced serial dependence on prior perception, indicating sharper temporal resolution but diminished perceptual stability. Resting-state EEG revealed systematically faster individual alpha frequency (IAF) and flatter aperiodic spectra in individuals with higher ADHD traits. Mediation analyses showed that faster IAF explained ADHD-related reductions in temporal integration thresholds and serial dependence, whereas increased neural noise selectively amplified perceptual history-dependent biases. These findings reveal distinct oscillatory and aperiodic neural pathways through which ADHD features shape temporal perception, suggesting a multidimensional neural architecture underlying atypical temporal processing in ADHD.

">Dopamine shapes brain metastate dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine's influence on large-scale network dynamics, especially on the default mode network (DMN), remains uncertain, as fMRI studies have produced mixed results. One likely contributor to these discrepancies is reliance on traditional functional connectivity analyses, which typically derive a single metric (e.g., the Pearson correlation coefficient) from the entire time series and thus fail to capture network dynamics. To address this issue, we combined a dopaminergic challenge (mazindol, a dopamine transporter [DAT] reuptake inhibitor), PET, resting-state fMRI, and hidden Markov modeling (HMM) to characterize time-varying alterations in human large-scale functional networks following acute DAT blockade. We found that mazindol-induced increases in endogenous dopamine altered the balance between the brain's functional "metastates," two recurrent higher-order network configurations that each encompass multiple HMM-derived brain states. Mazindol increased the time participants spent in an internally oriented cognitive metastate and decreased the time spent in a sensorimotor-perceptual metastate, with the DMN showing the most pronounced lengthening. In exploratory analyses, declines in [11C]raclopride binding, a PET index of D2 dopamine receptor availability reflecting increased striatal extracellular dopamine levels, tended to show a positive correlation with the prolongation of these cognitive states. These findings indicate that dopamine is closely linked to shifts from sensorimotor and perceptual to cognitive brain metastates, potentially underpinning the prioritization of internally oriented over externally driven psychological processes. Our results highlight the importance of dynamic, time-resolved connectivity approaches for understanding neuromodulatory actions in the human brain and suggest that dopamine helps regulate the dynamic balance between functionally competing large-scale brain networks.

">The richness of little voices: using artificial intelligence to understand early language development</a></h4>

              
                How informative are preschoolers' speech vocalizations? Preschoolers' speech is often imprecise, highly variable and hard to interpret by humans and machines; consequently, its predictive value for later developmental outcomes remains quite underexplored. Here, we analyzed 6.595 brief vocalizations (0.5-5s) from 127 preschoolers aged 3-4 years, including 74 children with diagnosed language delay, recorded in naturalistic environments. The vocalization models robustly distinguished children with and without language delay (ROC-AUC 0.90), beyond the acoustic properties of the recordings (ROC-AUC: 0.62), and outperformed similar models analyzing metadata that literature reports as predictive factor for early language development (ROC-AUC: < 0.69 [95% CI: 0.08 - 0.15 to 0.48 - 0.73], P < 0.001]). This indicates that neural networks applied to foundational model audio vectorizations can extract meaningful developmental markers from brief samples of immature speech, to classify speech status, offering a promising, scalable approach for language abilities early screening.

">Neural representations of speech production in neocortical and cerebellar regions</a></h4>

              
                Speech production depends on the precise temporal integration of articulatory movements with phonation. While ventral primary motor cortex is known to encode articulatory features, how phonatory timing, and its coordination with articulation, is represented across cortical and cerebellar circuits remains poorly understood. Using 7T functional MRI, we examined neural representations during overt syllable production varying in place of articulation and voice onset time. Multivariate analyses revealed reliable, syllable-specific differences in activity patterns across both cortical and cerebellar speech regions. Ventral primary sensorimotor cortex distinguished syllables by place of articulation, whereas dorsal sensorimotor cortex was more sensitive to the timing of voice onset relative to articulation. Secondary sensorimotor speech areas, including the operculum and auditory cortex, showed a hybrid representational profile, integrating both articulatory and phonatory features. In the cerebellum, representational geometry was dominated by the place of articulation; however, overall syllable representations were most similar to those in the operculum, accounting for unique variance beyond that explained by ventral sensorimotor cortex. Together, these findings reveal feature-specific representational tuning across primary sensorimotor regions during speech production. The selective representational alignment between operculum and cerebellum may support the refinement of speech motor plans prior to execution.

">Topographical differences during motion processing in autistic and dyslexic children</a></h4>

              
                Atypical motion processing has been reported in multiple developmental conditions, including autism and dyslexia, and taken as support for a general developmental vulnerability in the dorsal stream. Yet by uncovering dynamically unfolding processes, electroencephalography can determine the extent to which motion processing signatures are shared or distinct across different developmental conditions. Here we used pre-registered topographical analyses across the whole high-density electrode array to determine, for the first time, whether autistic and dyslexic children activate the same or distinct brain pathways as typically developing children, when completing two motion processing tasks. Participants were 29 autistic, 44 dyslexic and 57 typically developing children aged 6 to 14 years. Group differences in overall brain response strength were found in both tasks. Topographical activity differed in both autistic and dyslexic children compared to typically developing children (but not between autistic and dyslexic children) in a motion coherence task between 456 - 560 ms. However, group differences in a direction integration task (with no incoherent motion) depended on stimulus difficulty and time window (434 - 500 ms and 538 - 638 ms), with different patterns of divergence from typical development in autism and dyslexia. These results suggest that there are differences in the brain networks used to accomplish motion processing tasks in both autistic and dyslexic children, and demonstrate the utility of a topographical approach for detecting group differences in neural mechanisms, which can be missed by univariate approaches.

">The progression of sex differences in brain networks across the lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Sex differences in brain connectivity are well documented, yet how these differences evolve across the human lifespan remains poorly understood. Rigorously assessing sex-dependent trajectories of brain network organization is challenging due to difficulty in acquiring, processing, and modeling high-dimensional connectomes. Here, we analyzed 15 types of functional and structural connectivity networks from 1286 healthy individuals aged 8-100+ years, using our new AI-based Krakencoder to derive a low-dimensional multimodal "fusion" connectome representation. Sex differences were minimal in early childhood, pronounced in young to mid-adulthood, and diverged across modalities in later life: functional connectivity grew less distinct and structural connectivity grew more distinct from midlife onward. Functional differences were driven predominantly by higher-order association networks (default mode, control), while structural differences concentrated in lower-order cerebellar and subcortical pathways. These findings provide a lifespan-wide, multimodal map of sex differences in brain networks which may help inform sex-specific vulnerability and resilience to brain disorders.

">Counting apples - How does the prefrontal region support early numerical understanding in preschool children?</a></h4>

              
                Because early maths skills strongly predict later outcomes, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms that shape early learning in children. The recent years have seen an increase in studying the neural correlates that support the acquisition of maths skills. However, existing work in early childhood has primarily focused on core number-processing regions in the parietal regions, with comparatively little attention to the supportive role of prefrontal regions. In this study, we examined the engagement of the prefrontal regions when matching numbers and objects. Children (N=60, 25 girls, aged 2.74-5.18 years) matched auditory small (1-3) and large (5-7) numbers, as well as objects (fruits) to corresponding visual pictures while their frontoparietal brain responses were recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Importantly, matching large numbers was substantially more difficult than matching small numbers or objects. The analysis revealed that children had increased activation in the right middle frontal gyrus when matching large numbers, compared to small numbers. However, there was no difference in the prefrontal region between matching small numbers and objects. The connectivity analysis further revealed increased frontoparietal connectivity when matching small numbers, but not large numbers or objects. Our findings suggest that prefrontal involvement during early numerical knowledge acquisition relies primarily on domain-general mechanisms, with number-specific responses likely to emerge later in development.

">Individual Differences in Dopaminergic Modulation of Exploration-Exploitation Behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine (DA) has been implicated in exploration-exploitation behaviour, i.e., exploring novel, potentiallybetter options vs. exploiting known, previously rewarding options. Impairments in this trade-off occur inpsychiatric disorders involving DAergic dysfunction, including addiction and schizophrenia. Pharmacologicalstudies revealed a contribution of DA to exploration, but inconsistent findings suggest that interindividualvariability in baseline DA may modulate effects. To address this, we investigated the effects of the DAprecursor L-DOPA on exploration-exploitation during reinforcement learning in a sample of N = 75 healthyparticipants (n = 32 women), following a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pre-registered design(https://osf.io/p2r7u). We assessed whether putative baseline DA markers, including spontaneouseye blink rate, working memory (WM) capacity, and impulsivity, modulated drug effects and probed visualfixation patterns and pupil dilation as markers of exploration. L-DOPA had no overall effect on computationalmodel parameters of random exploration, directed exploration or choice perseveration. WM capacitymoderated drug effects on random exploration, with stronger effects at higher WM capacity. Remaining DAproxies showed no credible effects. Pooling the data from male participants with that from an earlier male-only study (Chakroun et al., 2020; total N = 74), L-DOPA increased uncertainty-dependent value weightingand perseveration strength, while decreasing habit updating, indicating a stronger tendency to repeatprevious choices and slower decay of their influence over time. No credible drug effects were observed infemale participants. Pupil dilation was tonically increased under L-DOPA and scaled with explorationbehaviour and prediction error, confirming that pupillometry can index exploration-exploitation dynamics.Visual exploration patterns reflected uncertainty-driven sampling, but were unaffected by L-DOPA. Takentogether, results suggest that DAergic modulation of exploration and perseveration behaviour may becontingent on cognitive capacity and sex, rather than exerting uniform effects across individuals.

">Alpha oscillations are dysrhythmic in Fragile X syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Background: Alpha oscillations are dominant rhythms in the human brain, supporting inhibitory control and coordination of neural activity. Altered alpha dynamics are observed across many neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, including Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common monogenic cause of autism and intellectual disability. FXS exhibits paradoxical alpha power: elevated absolute but reduced relative power. To resolve this incongruity, we considered that conventional power metrics, relying on averaging, may obscure the underlying critical temporal dynamics of such neural rhythms. Methods: Here, we investigate alpha oscillations in FXS as a model to decompose nonspecific alpha abnormalities into underlying temporal features. We used cycle-by-cycle (bycycle) alpha burst analysis from source-localized resting-state EEG of 70 individuals with FXS and 71 age- and sex-matched typically developing controls. Statistical modeling examined group, sex, and regional differences in alpha burst features using generalized linear mixed-effects models. Results: We reveal that alpha bursts in FXS show reduced count only in males, prolonged periods across sexes, and elevated amplitudes, particularly in males. Spatial mapping identified differential circuit vulnerability: timing-associated dysregulation in cognitive-control regions and amplitude elevations in sensory cortices. Within the FXS group, global alpha burst amplitude correlated with hyperactivity symptoms and inversely with general intelligence scores, and burst count correlated with age. Limitations: This study is limited by its resting-state design and cross-sectional nature. Future studies should explore task-based modulation of alpha burst features and longitudinal trajectories in FXS. Additionally, fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) was not quantified for participants, limiting potential stratification by molecular severity. Conclusions: These findings resolve paradoxical alpha power in FXS into features consistent with interneuron dysfunction, demonstrating the potential for burst-level decomposition in mechanistic hypothesis generation and biomarker development across neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.

">Motor implementation of control and reward-based urgency regulation across impulsivity</a></h4>

              
                Everyday decisions unfold dynamically, with commitment shaped by a growing sense of urgency that can, when excessive, contribute to impulsive choices. Here we aimed at dissociating two modes of urgency regulation, control-driven (accuracy-oriented) and reward-driven (motivation-based), and asked whether their relative influence varies across individuals differing in impulsivity. We further investigated how these regulatory modes are implemented in the motor system, focusing on two modulatory effects: surround inhibition and broad modulation. Healthy participants, whose impulsivity was assessed with the UPPS urgency dimension, performed a modified Tokens task crossing control demands (low vs high control blocks) with motivational context (low vs high reward trials). In two separate sessions, single-pulse TMS was applied either over the hand motor representation to probe corticospinal excitability indexing surround inhibition, or over the leg representation to index broad modulations of motor activity. This design successfully dissociated the two regulatory modes: control-driven adjustments (across blocks) were most evident in less impulsive participants, whereas reward-driven adjustments (across trials) were most evident in more impulsive participants. Consistent with this dissociation, control-driven urgency regulation was associated with broad modulation of motor activity, whereas reward-driven urgency adjustments were associated with changes in surround inhibition. These motor signatures may serve as probes of the respective contributions of control- and reward-driven regulation even when they are not explicitly dissociated. Our findings suggest that impulsivity may not simply reflect 'more urgency' but a different weighting of the influences that shape it during decision making, a hypothesis that can now be tested in clinical conditions.

                <p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is one of the top behavioral causes of global disease burden in the United States. Repeated cycles of alcohol intoxication and abstinence induce neuroplastic alterations which induce excessive drinking and cognitive impairments. A system deeply dysregulated by chronic drinking is norepinephrine (NE). At moderate levels, NE has beneficial effects on cognition and behavior, mediated by the &alpha;2 adrenergic receptor (AR) subtype. Whether &alpha;2 AR activation blunts alcohol consumption in models of heavy drinking has not been determined, and whether &alpha;2 AR activation improves cognitive performance following chronic alcohol consumption is unknown. Here, we show that the &alpha;2 AR agonist clonidine worsens ethanol-induced hypothermia and sedation in male mice, while the more selective &alpha;2 AR agonist guanfacine is devoid of these effects. We also observed that, in male and female mice, while both clonidine and guanfacine reduce heavy alcohol drinking, guanfacine does so with higher potency. Furthermore, guanfacine improved cognitive performance in a temporal order test and, partially, in a novel object recognition test but had no effect in a novel spatial location test, in male and female ethanol-experienced mice. Finally, we found that chronic intermittent ethanol drinking increases the number of persistently activated NE neurons in both the locus ceruleus and the nucleus of the tractus solitarius, in both male and female mice. Our results highlight a central role for the &alpha;2 AR system in heavy alcohol drinking and associated cognitive deficits, suggesting that &alpha;2 AR stimulation may represent a viable pharmacological strategy to treat AUD.</p>

                <p>by Jian Miao, Dawei Li</p>

Transposable element (TE) variants, the presence or absence of TE sequences such as LINE-1, Alu, SVA, and endogenous retroviruses, are a major source of genomic diversity and play critical roles in human health, evolution, and disease. As interest in TE variants grows, developing related methods and tools for detection has become increasingly important. However, rigorous benchmarking of TE variant detection methods remains limited due to the lack of accurate and scalable TE variant simulation platforms and the absence of reliable ground truth data. Here, we developed TEvarSim, a novel TE variant simulator that generates TE-containing genomic data in multiple formats, including genomes, short- and long-read sequencing data, and VCF files. TEvarSim supports both random and real-world TE insertions and deletions, including variants derived from pangenome graphs. It can rapidly simulate hundreds to thousands of synthetic chromosomes or genomes and model natural variation at the haplotype, individual, and population levels, making it well suited for large-scale studies. In addition, TEvarSim can directly compare simulated VCF files with TEs reported by TE detection tools, streamlining the benchmarking of TE genotyping methods. TEvarSim provides an all-in-one toolkit for simulating, evaluating, and improving TE variant detection, advancing our ability to accurately study TEs in health and disease in various species.

Human brain dynamics are highly unique between individuals: functional neuroimaging studies have recently described functional features that can be used as neural fingerprints. However, the stability of these fingerprints is affected by aging and disease. As such, the stability of brain fingerprints may be a useful metric when studying normal and pathological neurodevelopment. Before examining clinically relevant deviations, the individual stability and variation of neuroimaging features across brain maturation in normally developing children need to be addressed with real clinical data. Here we applied Bayesian reduced-rank regression (BRRR) to extract low-dimensional representations of electroencephalography (EEG) power spectra measured during different non-REM sleep stages (N1 and N2) from 782 normally developing children aged between 6 weeks to 19 years. The representations learned within specific sleep stages successfully separated between subjects and generalized across sleep stages. Fingerprint stability increased with the age of the subjects. Compared to correlation-based fingerprinting methods, the BRRR model performed better, especially in fingerprinting across sleep stages, highlighting the usefulness of dimensionality reduction when the noise and signal of interest are correlated. While further studies are needed to address the possible non-linear maturation effects over developmental periods, our results demonstrate the existence of stable within-session neurofunctional fingerprints in pediatric populations.

The superficial white matter (SWM), immediately beneath the cortical mantle, is thought to play a major role in cortico-cortical connectivity as well as large-scale brain function. Yet, this compartment remains rarely studied due to its complex organization. Our objectives were to develop and disseminate a robust computational framework to study SWM organization based on 3D histology and high-field 7T MRI. Using data from the BigBrain and Ahead 3D histology initiatives, we first interrogated variations in cell staining intensities across different cortical regions and different SWM depths. These findings were then translated to in vivo 7T quantitative myelin-sensitive MRI, including T1 relaxometry (T1 map) and magnetization transfer saturation (MTsat). As indicated by the statistical moments of the SWM intensity profiles, the first 2 mm below the cortico-subcortical boundary were characterized by high structural complexity. We quantified SWM microstructural variation using a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method and examined the relationship of the resulting microstructural gradients with indices of cortical geometry, as well as structural and functional connectivity. Our results showed correlations between SWM microstructural gradients, as well as curvature and cortico-cortical functional connectivity. Our study provides novel insights into the organization of SWM in the human brain and underscores the potential of SWM mapping to advance fundamental and applied neuroscience research.

                <p>by Yu Sang, Jie Ren, Alejandro Aballay</p>

Neurodegenerative diseases are often associated with oxidative stress, and while probiotics may influence neuronal health, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using the <i>sod-1</i> A4V<sup>M</sup> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) model in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, we investigated the protective effects of the probiotic <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> against oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration. Animals fed <i>E. faecium</i> showed reduced motor neuron degeneration under oxidative stress compared to those maintained on a standard <i>Escherichia coli</i> diet. Transcriptome analysis revealed a significant enrichment of oxidoreductase genes, including cytochrome P450 (<i>cyp</i>) genes. RNAi-mediated knockdown of <i>cyp</i> genes impaired <i>E. faecium</i>-mediated neuroprotection, and this loss correlated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. We identified the conserved nuclear hormone receptor NHR-86 as a key regulator of <i>cyp</i> gene expression and neuroprotection. Loss of <i>nhr-86</i> abolished the probiotic’s protective benefits, while transgenic expression of <i>nhr-86</i> restored <i>cyp</i> induction and neuronal resilience. Importantly, intestinal expression of NHR-86 was sufficient to restore CYP induction and neuronal resilience, whereas neuronal knockdown had no effect, indicating that gut NHR-86 activity is essential for this protective pathway. These findings reveal a previously uncharacterized NHR-CYP regulatory axis activated by an intestinal probiotic, highlighting a mechanistic link between microbial signals and host neuroprotection.

                <p>by Moohebat Pourmajidian, Justine Y. Hansen, Golia Shafiei, Bratislav Misic, Alain Dagher</p>

Energy metabolism involves a series of biochemical reactions that generate ATP, utilizing substrates such as glucose and oxygen supplied via cerebral blood flow. Energy substrates are metabolized in multiple interrelated pathways that are cell- and organelle-specific. These pathways not only generate energy but are also fundamental to the production of essential biomolecules required for neuronal function and survival. How these complex biochemical processes are spatially distributed across the cortex is integral to understanding the structure and function of the brain. Here, using curated gene sets and whole-brain transcriptomics, we generate maps of five fundamental energy metabolic pathways: glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation and lactate metabolism. We find consistent divergence between primarily energy-producing and anabolic pathways, particularly in unimodal sensory cortices. We then explore the spatial alignment of these maps with multi-scale structural and functional attributes, including metabolic uptake, neurophysiological oscillations, cell type composition, laminar organization and macro-scale connectivity. We find that energy pathways exhibit unique relationships with the cellular and laminar organization of the cortex, pointing to the higher energy demands of large pyramidal cells and efferent projections. Finally, we show that metabolic pathways exhibit distinct developmental trajectories from the fetal stage to adulthood. The primary energy-producing pathways peak in childhood, while the anabolic pentose phosphate pathway shows greater prenatal expression and declines throughout life. Together, these results highlight the rich biochemical complexity of energy metabolism organization in the brain.

                This essay compares how Ngugi wa Thiong’o and Abdulrazak Gurnah, two leading East African writers, represent postcolonial identity and historical trauma through fiction. It examines their contrasting approaches to literary resistance: Ngugi embraces radical language politics and collective cultural reclamation, while Gurnah employs narrative ambiguity, exile experiences, and linguistic hybridity. The analysis reveals how intergenerational trauma operates in their works, with memory functioning as a morally charged force shaping identity and narrative authority. Despite their differences, Ngugi prioritizing political clarity and revolutionary consciousness, Gurnah exploring subtle psychological details and narrative dissonance, both authors demonstrate literature’s ethical power to contest historical erasure and reimagine postcolonial futures with compassion and complexity.

                Background This study examines how voucher systems compare to traditional redistributive policies—such as progressive taxation, subsidies, and public spending—in reducing income inequality. Methods We apply a counterfactual analysis approach, using panel data from twelve countries over 22 years. By employing econometric modelling, we simulate a series of “what-if” scenarios to assess the impact of each policy on the Gini coefficient, a key measure of income inequality. Results The results suggest that voucher systems can be particularly effective at targeting essential services, like education and healthcare, improving access for lower-income groups, and helping to reduce inequality. Public spending on education and healthcare proves to be incredibly potent in narrowing income disparities. These sectors are vital for addressing systemic inequalities, improving overall access and providing long-term benefits to disadvantaged groups. In contrast, progressive taxation and subsidies show mixed effectiveness. While higher tax revenues often correlate with reduced inequality, their impacts vary across countries and contexts. The effectiveness of progressive taxation depends on factors such as the efficiency of tax systems and the political environment, which can influence how well these policies work. Similarly, subsidies generally produce only modest or inconsistent reductions in income gaps, suggesting that while they provide temporary relief, they do not always address the root causes of inequality. Conclusions These findings suggest that well-designed voucher programs, when combined with progressive taxation and strategic public spending, can play a key role in enhancing redistribution efforts. By improving access to essential services and targeting lower-income groups, vouchers have the potential to reduce income inequality. However, achieving equitable economic outcomes requires careful policy design and attention to the broader economic context.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1426/v2?src=rss">Impact of sample size on optimisation algorithms for the MLP used in the prediction of client subscription to a term deposit [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background One of the disadvantages of the multilayer perception (MLP), which is a machine learning (ML) algorithm used in various fields, includes the uncontrollable growth of the number of total parameters, which may make MLP redundant in such high dimensions, and the uncontrollable growing stack of layers that ignores spatial information. Optimization algorithms were developed to determine the optimum number of parameters for MLP. Methods In this paper, the performances of the Genetic Algorithm (GA), Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA), and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) are compared. The study also sought to determine the impact of sample size variations on these optimization algorithms. A dataset on the direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution from the UCI Machine Learning Repository with a sample size of 4 521 was used. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied to balance the binary dependent variables for the training data across various sample sizes. Results Based on the classification accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, F-score, and execution time, the MLP based on CMA-ES (CMA-ES-MLP) was identified as the best classifier overall, as it maintained high rates of these classification metrics and was the second fastest to train. CMA-ES-MLP with a training sample of 5 114 was our ideal classifier, and it competes well with the classifiers that have been built by previous studies that used the same dataset. Conclusions The study found no consistent increase or decrease in the classification performance of the algorithms as the sample size increased, and the metrics fluctuated rapidly across sample sizes. It is recommended that future studies be conducted to compare the best-performing classifiers identified in previous studies with the CMA-ES-MLP in this study under the same experimental conditions.

                One of the most difficult types of agrarian dispute to resolve in conflict-prone countries is one involving corporations, governments, and powerful individuals. Indonesia has the sixth highest agrarian conflict rate in Asia. This dispute took place in 74% of all occurrences, 94% of all individual victims, and 84% of all impacted households. This article focuses on territorial boundaries between indigenous tribes as well as Indonesian government programs such as public infrastructure development, which includes roads, bridges, airports, ports, and trains. This study combines historical analysis with current developments to contribute to an empirical and theoretical understanding of land battles. This article gives a systematic evaluation of the literature on indigenous peoples using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic evaluation and Meta-Analysis) methodology. This review looks at three academic databases: Scopus, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, and Eric. These findings reveal that many indigenous tribes continue to lack legal or official recognition. Despite constitutional law, Indonesia, a multicultural country, has customary and religious rules among its indigenous tribes. Recognition of customary law and customary land still lacks a solid foundation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-153/v1?src=rss">Empowerment Model for The Elderly and Community to Improve the Welfare of the Elderly [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Rapid population ageing poses significant challenges to elderly welfare, particularly in communities with limited institutional support. This study aims to develop and empirically test an empowerment model involving older people and the community to sustainably improve elderly welfare. Using a mixed-method research design, the study combines quantitative analysis of welfare outcomes with qualitative exploration of empowerment processes. Quantitative data were collected through structured questionnaires administered to 210 elderly participants involved in community-based empowerment programs. Elderly welfare was measured across physical, psychological, social, and economic dimensions. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, paired-samples t-tests, and multiple regression. Qualitative data were obtained through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with elderly participants, family members, and community cadres. They were analysed thematically to enrich the interpretation of the statistical findings. The statistical results indicate a significant improvement in elderly welfare following program implementation. The mean welfare score increased from 3.12 to 3.89 on a five-point scale (t = 9.46, p < 0.001). Regression analysis shows that community participation (β = 0.41, p < 0.001) and elderly self-efficacy (β = 0.36, p < 0.01) are strong predictors of welfare improvement, explaining 52% of the variance in welfare outcomes (R2 = 0.52). Qualitative findings support these results, revealing enhanced independence, stronger social networks, and increased community recognition of older people as active contributors rather than dependents. The study concludes that an integrated empowerment model, combining health promotion, social engagement, economic micro-activities, and psychosocial support, effectively improves elderly welfare when supported by active community involvement. This research contributes to scientific discourse on empowerment-based ageing interventions and provides evidence-based recommendations for policymakers and practitioners in designing community-driven elderly welfare programs.

                Against the backdrop of the digital economy, government subsidies, as a key macroeconomic regulation tool, interact with enterprises’ digital marketing investment and consumer behavior, yet relevant in-depth research remains scarce. This study aims to explore the complex relationships between national subsidy policies, enterprises’ digital marketing strategies, and consumer purchase intentions, with a focus on the second-hand product market. Based on a review of existing literature, five core hypotheses are proposed: national subsidy policies significantly enhance enterprises’ digital marketing investment; enterprises’ digital marketing strategies under subsidies positively impact consumer purchase intentions; consumers’ awareness of subsidy policies strengthens their purchase intentions; consumers’ trust in digital marketing platforms moderates the impact of digital marketing on purchase intentions; and national subsidy policies reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase second-hand products. This research bridges the existing research gap, constructs a comprehensive theoretical framework for the interaction between government, enterprises, and consumers in the digital age, and provides theoretical basis and practical guidance for policy makers and business decision-makers.

                Wang et al. reveal how nerve injury causes mechanical allodynia. It triggers endocannabinoid release, which disables the spinal Gly-PKCγ “allodynia gate” by disrupting inhibitory control. They develop a peptide that reverses this process, offering a promising strategy to alleviate chronic pain.

                Tang et al. performed a large-scale metagenomic analysis that provided a deeper understanding of the microbial composition of the gut and skin of wild freshwater fish as well as the phylosymbiosis relationships between them. The assembled 705 MAGs have greatly enriched microbial genome resources for fish species.

                Stokes et al. demonstrate that PARP7 “senses” the levels of nuclear NAD+ during early adipogenic differentiation via an ADP-ribosylation-ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to regulate C/EBPβ-dependent proadipogenic gene expression through p300-mediated H3K27 acetylation. Stabilized PARP7 promotes the binding of C/EBPβ to chromatin genome-wide, enhancing lipid synthesis and adipogenesis in vivo.

                Li et al. reported that TCS HprSR contributes to UPEC colonization of kidneys. The underlying mechanism involves UPEC HprSR directly activating the expression of flagellar export apparatus genes (fliLMNOPQR) in response to host-derived ROS and RCS. This finding provides insights for the development of therapeutic agents to treat UPEC infection.

                Yue et al. find the subtype-specific regulation of Nmnat2 transcription by Raf-MEK-ERK in DRG neurons, while cortical and spinal neurons use a MEK-independent mechanism. This context-dependent axon survival paradigm helps explain differential MEKi vulnerability of PNS and CNS neurons, indicating Nmnat2 as a potential target to counteract MEKi-induced neuropathy.

              <h4><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-025-03110-5">Quantum computing isn’t just about scaling</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nature Physics, Published online: 30 January 2026; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-025-03110-5">doi:10.1038/s41567-025-03110-5</a></p>The race to demonstrate quantum error correction often focuses on making ever-larger devices. A demonstration showing that splitting a surface-code logical qubit into two simpler repetition codes substantially reduces logical gate errors reminds us that advancing quantum computing does not hinge solely on scaling qubit numbers.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94576">Causal evidence for a domain-specific role of left superior frontal sulcus in human perceptual decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Humans and animals can flexibly choose their actions based on different information, ranging from objective states of the environment (e.g., apples are bigger than cherries) to subjective preferences (e.g., cherries are tastier than apples). Whether the brain instantiates these different choices by recruiting either specialised or shared neural circuitry remains debated. Specifically, domain-general accounts of prefrontal cortex (PFC) function propose that prefrontal areas flexibly process either perceptual or value-based evidence depending on what is required for the present choice, whereas domain-specific theories posit that PFC sub-areas, such as the left superior frontal sulcus (SFS), selectively integrate evidence relevant for perceptual decisions. Here, we comprehensively test the functional role of the left SFS for choices based on perceptual- and value-based evidence, by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging with a behavioural paradigm, computational modelling, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Confirming predictions by a sequential sampling model, we show that TMS-induced excitability reduction of the left SFS selectively changes the processing of decision-relevant perceptual information and associated neural processes. In contrast, value-based decision-making and associated neural processes remain unaffected. This specificity of SFS function is evident at all levels of analysis (behavioural, computational, and neural, including functional connectivity), demonstrating that the left SFS causally contributes to evidence integration for perceptual but not value-based decisions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107636">The representation of facial emotion expands from sensory to prefrontal cortex with development</a></h4>

              
                Facial expression recognition develops rapidly during infancy and improves from childhood to adulthood. As a critical component of social communication, this skill enables individuals to interpret others’ emotions and intentions. However, the brain mechanisms driving the development of this skill remain largely unclear due to the difficulty of obtaining data with both high spatial and temporal resolution from young children. By analyzing intracranial EEG data collected from childhood (5–10 years old) and post-childhood groups (13–55 years old), we find differential involvement of high-level brain area in processing facial expression information. For the post-childhood group, both the posterior superior temporal cortex (pSTC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) encode facial emotion features from a high-dimensional space. However, in children, the facial expression information is only significantly represented in the pSTC, not in the DLPFC. Furthermore, the encoding of complex emotions in pSTC is shown to increase with age. Taken together, young children rely more on low-level sensory areas than on the prefrontal cortex for facial emotion processing, suggesting that the prefrontal cortex matures with development to enable a full understanding of facial emotions, especially complex emotions that require social and life experience to comprehend.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107796">A forebrain hub for cautious actions via the midbrain</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive goal-directed behavior requires dynamic coordination of movement, motivation, and environmental cues. Among these, cautious actions, where animals adjust their behavior in anticipation of predictable threats, are essential for survival. Yet, their underlying neural mechanisms remain less well understood than those of appetitive behaviors, where caution plays little role. Using calcium imaging in freely moving mice, we show that glutamatergic neurons in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) are robustly engaged by contraversive movement during cue-evoked avoidance and exploratory behavior. Model-based analyses controlling for movement and other covariates revealed that STN neurons additionally encode salient sensory cues, punished errors, and especially cautious responding, where their activity anticipates avoidance actions. Targeted lesions and optogenetic manipulations reveal that STN projections to the midbrain are necessary for executing cued avoidance. These findings identify a critical role for the STN in orchestrating adaptive goal-directed behavior by integrating sensory, motor, and punitive signals to guide timely, cautious actions via its midbrain projections.

">Higher-order intrinsic routes support flexible task-evoked communication</a></h4>

              
                Flexible task-evoked communication requires the brain to transiently establish functional interactions that are not evident during rest, yet the network mechanisms supporting these newly formed connections remain unresolved. Using whole-brain functional MRI from 92 participants performing six cognitive tasks, we show that task-evoked communication is implemented within a constrained intrinsic network architecture rather than through large-scale rewiring. Across tasks, we found that approximately 70% of functional connections were preserved from rest, forming a dominant stable core, while task engagement selectively reconfigured a smaller subset of connections, primarily at the between-network level. While existing activity-flow models explain task-evoked information transfer primarily through direct stable core connections, we demonstrate that newly formed connections between regions lacking direct resting-state coupling were supported by selectively strengthened indirect higher-order resting-state routes embedded within the intrinsic scaffold. Network-level analyses revealed a multiscale organization of information transfer: we observed that direct stable routes dominated within-network communication, most prominently in sensory-motor and default mode systems, whereas indirect higher-order routes preferentially supported between-network integration through control and attentional systems. By extending activity-flow modelling to incorporate these higher-order intrinsic routes, we show a significant improvement in the prediction of task-evoked activity at the global, between-network scale, confirming their functional recruitment during task performance. Together, our findings identify higher-order intrinsic routes as a key mechanism enabling flexible task-evoked communication within a stable large-scale network architecture.

">High-fidelity backpropagation through primate foveal cones</a></h4>

              
                Primate vision has exceptionally high spatial acuity and contrast sensitivity. This performance originates in specialized photoreceptors of the fovea. These cones transduce light into electrical signals in the outer segment, and convey these signals to the presynaptic terminal for transmission. Backpropagating signals are also possible, as the terminal receives gap-junctional input from neighboring cones. Such signals could influence phototransduction itself. To test this idea, we recorded electrophysiologically from both ends of single cones dissociated from the macaque fovea. We found that backpropagation was effective despite the extreme slenderness and length of these cells. Backpropagation was also effective in a passive compartmental model, indicating that amplification by voltage-gated channels is not required. We then modeled mosaics of foveal cones coupled by terminal gap junctions. Despite faithful backpropagation of these inputs, they appear unlikely to influence phototransduction. Thus, even though foveal cones exhibit effective backpropagation, their encoding of visual information remains compartmentalized.

">The schizophrenia associated protein DISC1 is a multivalent tetrameric hub of conserved ancient fold</a></h4>

              
                DISC1 is a pleiotropic protein with essential roles in neuronal proliferation and migration, intracellular signalling and cargo transport. It associates with a diverse array of partner molecules in these contexts. Mutations at the DISC1 locus are strongly associated with a spectrum of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression. Despite its clinical relevance, the molecular architecture and function of DISC1 have remained largely elusive. We present a cryo-EM structure of the entire conserved core region of DISC1. The structure reveals an intricate homotetrameric assembly that harbours conserved bacteria-derived UVR domains. Four of these domains, one from each monomer, mediate extensive contacts forming two asymmetric dimer units. The dimers in turn interface with each other at two distinct coiled coil domains to achieve a two-fold symmetric tetramer. Mutational analysis shows that this tetrameric architecture enables DISC1 to simultaneously bind multiple copies of NDE1 client protein. Importantly, tetramerization and partner binding are structurally independent functions of DISC1. Altogether, our study provides a compelling molecular model of an ancient bacteria protein fold participating in the assembly of a multivalent mammalian scaffold hub that can coordinate multiple partner molecules.

">Avatar facial expressions enhance social presence and inter-brain synchronization in virtual reality</a></h4>

              
                Virtual reality (VR) has become a prominent medium for computer-mediated social interaction, yet the psychological and neural mechanisms underpinning avatar-mediated communication remain insufficiently understood. This study investigated how dynamically modulated avatar facial expressions shape interpersonal interaction in VR. Pairs of participants engaged in a collaborative creativity task while interacting via avatars whose facial expressions were either amplified, natural, or expressionless. We collected subjective measures of body ownership, social presence, and interpersonal attraction, while simultaneously recording neural activity using functional near-infrared-spectroscopy-based hyperscanning to assess inter-brain synchrony (IBS). Avatars displaying facial expressions, particularly amplified ones, significantly enhanced body ownership, social presence, and interpersonal attraction compared to expressionless avatars. At the neural level, visible avatar facial expressions were associated with IBS in the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), regions that are commonly implicated in social-cognitive processes such as mentalizing and executive control. Although task performance did not differ across conditions, social presence was positively correlated with creative performance, suggesting that psychological connectedness supports collaborative creativity. Together, these findings indicate that avatar facial expressivity functions as a critical nonverbal social cue that facilitates affective and cognitive alignment between interaction partners. By linking subjective experience with inter-brain neural dynamics, this study provides empirical guidance for the design of virtual environments that promote social engagement and effective collaboration.

">An integrated virtual reality platform for naturalistic neuroimaging with magnetoencephalography</a></h4>

              
                Studying the brain in motion promises deep insights into the neural circuits that support complex, real-world behaviour. In humans, wearable optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) enable magnetoencephalography (MEG) with millisecond temporal resolution and millimetre spatial precision during movement. Integrating this technology with virtual reality (VR) could enable fully naturalistic experimental paradigms, but magnetic interference from existing head-mounted displays (HMDs) prevents reliable whole-brain MEG recordings. Here, we present and validate a VR system that integrates with wearable, OPM-based MEG. At its core is a purpose-designed HMD with minimal ferromagnetic material, resulting in magnetic flux density two orders of magnitude lower than consumer-grade alternatives at comparable resolution and weight. Using phantom measurements and established perceptual and cognitive benchmark tasks across participants, we demonstrate robust stimulus-induced neuronal activity at both sensor and source level. Crucially, these sources span the entire brain, including visual, motor and prefrontal cortices, as well as hippocampus. Our proposed VR system is straightforward to produce, readily extendable, and enables whole-brain MEG during immersive, naturalistic behaviours.

">A dual neural system supporting multi-tasking cognitive flexibility</a></h4>

              
                One ubiquitous feature of human intelligence is the ability to flexibly switch between multiple tasks. Abstract task representations provide a basis for task learning, switching, and generalization, yet how the brain coordinates multiple task representations to support multitasking and task-switching remains poorly understood. We recorded functional MRI activity in human participants while they concurrently held multiple task rules in working memory and prioritized different rules for stimulus processing across trials. Our results reveal two distinct coding schemes for task prioritization. First, an active coding scheme supports the spatial separation of prioritized and unprioritized task rules: prioritized rules are represented across a distributed cortical network, whereas unprioritized rules are only found in the posterior cortex. Second, besides this active scheme, subregions of the default mode network, including the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, contribute to offloading task representations into an unprioritized state and subsequently maintain sustained representations of these rules across trials via latent neural codes. Behavioral predictions using on-task, trial-wise and sustained, block-wise representations further support the neural dissociation. These findings unveil a dual neural system with distinct coding schemes that jointly enable cognitive flexibility for task implementation and switching.

">Compression Detects Changes in Spiking Neural Data from Cortical Lesions</a></h4>

              
                Objective: The complexity of neural data changes as the brain processes information during events. Universal lossless compression algorithms, which are broadly applicable and grounded in information theory, identify and exploit redundancies in data in order to compress it to essentially-optimal sizes regardless of underlying statistics. These algorithms may be used to conveniently and efficiently estimate a given signal's Shannon entropy rate, a biologically relevant measure of the complexity of a signal. It is therefore natural to explore their effectiveness in the analysis of spiking neural data. Approach: This work focuses on using compression to analyze recordings (96-channel Utah arrays) taken from motor cortex of animals performing reaching tasks for three days before and three days after administering electrolytic lesions (Subject U: 4 lesions, H: 3). In particular, we use the inverse compression ratio (ICR), which compares the sizes of compressed and uncompressed data to estimate the amount of statistically unique information. We calculate ICR with temporally-independent lossless compression (gzip) and temporally-dependent lossy compression (H.264, MPEG-2). Compression-based ICR was compared to single-neuron measures used to understand spiking data, such as average firing rates and Fano factor. Compression is also compared to common dimensionality reduction techniques, principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis (FA). Main Results: Statistical tests on aggregate data comparing each metric before and after lesioning reveal that ICR is able to significantly (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.01) detect lesions with higher accuracy than single-neuron metrics, but not dimensionality reduction (ICR methods: 85.7%, single-neuron methods: 78.6%, dimensionality reduction: 100%). Additionally, statistical results on the same data show that ICR metrics remain more stable than single-neuron methods after lesion. The bitrate parameter of lossy compression algorithms is swept to better understand the effect of information rates and "optimal" compression on lesion detection performance. Our conclusions are confirmed by the same analyses performed on several different simulated neural datasets. Significance: These results suggest that compression algorithms may be a useful tool to detect and better understand perturbations to the underlying structure of neural data. Information-theoretic analyses may complement techniques like dimensionality reduction and firing rate tuning as a convenient and useful tool to characterize neural data.

">Single cell profiling reveals GSM-15606 attenuates air pollution-induced inflammation and preserves hippocampal neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Air pollution (AirPoll) is a major environmental risk factor for age-related cognitive decline and dementia, yet we poorly understood the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying its effects and their potential attenuation. Methods: We combined single cell RNA sequencing with immunohistochemistry to determine transcriptional responses in microglia, astrocytes, neurons and neural stem cells in the hippocampus of mice following exposure to chronic diesel exhaust particle (DEP). Differential gene expression profiles were compared between filtered-air and DEP exposed animals. The gamma secretase modulator GSM-15606 (BPN) was used to probe selective rescue of inflammatory signatures across distinct cell populations. Results: DEP exposure triggered robust inflammatory programs in microglia and astrocytes, including upregulation of cytokine signaling components, innate immune receptors, stress-responsive transcription factors, and markers of reactive glial phenotypes. In neural stem cells, DEP induced activation of gliosis-associated pathways, including Il6st, Stat3, and Txnip, consistent with a pro-inflammatory state that may bias lineage decisions. Immunostaining confirmed a significant reduction in immature neurons in the neurogenic niche after AirPoll exposure. GSM-15606 attenuated many DEP-induced transcriptional alterations in microglia and astrocytes, reducing expression of inflammatory mediators and reactive gliosis markers, but did not modulate the inflammatory profile of neural stem cells. Conclusions: AirPoll activates divergent inflammatory pathways across hippocampal cell populations and suppresses neurogenesis. Targeting inflammation with GSM-15606 selectively reverses glial but not neural stem cell responses, highlighting cell-type-specific mechanisms and potential therapeutic pathways to mitigate pollution-related cognitive vulnerability. These results support GSM-15606 as a protective agent against AirPoll-induced hippocampal dysfunction and amyloidogenic stress.

">White Matter Lesion Asymmetry and Carotid Intraplaque Hemorrhage: A Novel Imaging Phenotype for Stroke Risk in Older Men</a></h4>

              
                Background: While identifying high-risk carotid disease remains a significant clinical challenge, the specific role of carotid intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) is poorly understood. Although IPH has been linked to white matter lesion (WML) burden, current assessments overlook the directional impact of plaque instability on the brain. This study sought to determine whether IPH is an independent driver of asymmetric WML pathology and evaluate if this phenotype can identify a high-risk demographic for TIA and stroke. Methods: This multi-center retrospective study analyzed 264 participants (mean age 71.8 years) from the Canadian Atherosclerosis Imaging Network (2010-2015). Participants underwent 3T MRI to assess carotid IPH and WMLs. We quantified WMLs using a deep-learning pipeline to extract three biomarkers: volume (WML-ICV), intensity (WML-Intensity), and intensity ratio (WML-IR). The Asymmetry Index Measure (AIM) defined the inter-hemispheric log-ratio, while the association between IPH and AIM was examined using multivariable linear regression adjusted for age, sex, stenosis, and scanner manufacturer. A secondary composite outcome of TIA/stroke was analyzed via logistic regression to evaluate the interaction between IPH, age, and sex. Results: While whole-brain WML burden did not significantly differ by IPH status (p > 0.60), IPH status was a robust independent predictor of hemispheric asymmetry (WML-ICV: p = 0.01; WML-Intensity, p = 0.01). Post-hoc analysis confirmed WML burden was significantly higher in IPH+ older males (=> 70 years) compared to younger cohorts (p < 0.04). This older male subgroup also demonstrated 4.57-fold higher adjusted odds of TIA/stroke (p = 0.02) compared to other demographic subgroups (all p > 0.87). Conclusions: Carotid IPH is independently associated with a rightward asymmetric WML phenotype not captured by global metrics. This imaging marker identifies a high-risk demographic of older males with a nearly five-fold increase in clinical events, suggesting that hemispheric-level analysis provides critical prognostic value for stroke risk stratification.

">From Sensory Details to Verbal Codes: Visual Memory Reinstatement of Location and Color Features</a></h4>

              
                Successful episodic memory depends on the reinstatement of encoding content and processes during retrieval. However, it remains unclear how such reinstatement (1) differs for various perceptual features, (2) supports subjective versus objective memory retrieval, and (3) relies on linguistic information. To investigate these three issues, we designed an fMRI study in which participants encoded and recalled the colors and spatial locations of object pictures, and provided subjective vividness and objective precision measures. We used encoding-retrieval similarity (ERS) to identify feature-level reinstatement for location or color features, and trial-specific reinstatement for individual location trials or individual color trials. The study yielded three main findings. First, feature-level reinstatement in frontoparietal and visual regions supported both location and color memory, whereas trial-specific reinstatement in early visual cortex contributed to location memory and feature-level reinstatement in lateral/anterior temporal cortices, to color memory. Second, trial-specific reinstatement in early visual cortex supported both location vividness and precision, while feature-level reinstatement in inferior frontal gyrus contributed to color vividness, and trial-specific reinstatement in posterior inferior temporal gyrus (including the color area), to color precision. Finally, color name richness (the number of names associated with a particular color) enhanced color memory precision and modulated trial-specific color reinstatement in right anterior inferior temporal gyrus. Together, these findings suggest that perceptual and linguistic reinstatement play complementary roles in visual episodic memory: perceptual replay provides fine-grained sensory details, whereas linguistic replay can scaffold and refine these representations, especially for features that are easier to verbalize such as colors.

">Perceptual and neural biomarkers of distraction from an external sound source are not associated with tinnitus severity</a></h4>

              
                Individuals with chronic tinnitus perceive a phantom sound that imposes either a bothersome and irrepressible distraction throughout waking hours or a relatively mild nuisance that often fades into subliminal awareness. The difference in tinnitus salience may reflect a general difference in inhibitory control over any distracting sound, whether externally or internally generated. To test this hypothesis, we investigated neural and behavioral signatures of external auditory distraction suppression in participants with chronic tinnitus that had mild or bothersome tinnitus but were otherwise matched for age and hearing loss. Participants in both groups underwent behavioral and EEG testing that asked them to report on a target stream of amplitude modulated tones that switched from a random arrangement to a repeating sequence. Using additional sounds that imposed varying levels of distraction, we documented neural and perceptual suppression of auditory distractors. Behaviorally, participants with mild versus bothersome tinnitus showed comparable reductions in accuracy in the presence of varying distractor loads. Neural synchronization to the target stimulus change rate provided a useful proxy for distraction effects but did not differ between tinnitus groups. Likewise, no group differences were observed in the neural synchronization to modulation rates of the target or distractor stimuli. Our results build on work showing that individuals with tinnitus perform as well as individuals with normal hearing on listening tasks in noisy environments and expand this observation into the neural representation of sounds. Suppression of the internally generated phantom percept does not appear to be linked to general deficits in suppressing distractors.

">D-Methionine Improves Spatial Navigation and Attenuates Oxidative Stress and Amyloid Pathology in a Sex-Specific Manner</a></h4>

              
                Background Oxidative stress and maladaptive neuroimmune activation contribute to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and represent therapeutic targets beyond amyloid-centered approaches. Objective To determine whether oral D-methionine (D-Met), a redox-active amino acid, reduces amyloid pathology and lipid peroxidation and confers disease-modifying benefits in AD mouse models. Methods Male and female APP/PS1 and APPNL-F mice with advanced AD pathology received oral D-Met or vehicle. Behavioral assessments included locomotor activity and hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory. Amyloid burden, lipid peroxidation, peripheral metabolic and inflammatory markers, and hippocampal microglial phenotypes were evaluated using biochemical and histological analyses. Results D-Met did not alter locomotor or exploratory behavior but improved spatial memory recall in both sexes of APP/PS1 mice and in female APPNL-F mice. APPNL-F males exhibited improved learning during Morris water maze (MWM) acquisition. Amyloid pathology was modestly and region-specifically reduced, including decreased hippocampal plaque size in male APPNL-F mice, reduced cortical plaque size in female APP/PS1 mice, and lower soluble amyloid-{beta} (A{beta})42 in male APP/PS1 mice. Lipid peroxidation, assessed by malondialdehyde, was reduced only in female APPNL-F mice. D-Met induced pronounced sex-dependent peripheral effects, increasing adiposity and pro-inflammatory adipose signaling in males, while reducing perigonadal white adipose tissue (pgWAT) IL-6 expression in female APPNL-F mice. In the hippocampus, D-Met remodeled microglial signatures, with female APPNL-F mice showing reduced Iba1 and disease-associated microglial (DAM) markers and increased Axl expression. Conclusion Short-term D-Met acts as a metabolic and redox modulator with modest amyloid-lowering effects mediated by improved microglial function. Therapeutic efficacy is strongly sex- and model-dependent, with the greatest benefit observed in female APPNL-F mice.

">Loss of Fmr1 reorganizes the multi-elemental composition of neural and somatic tissues in Fragile X mice</a></h4>

              
                Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a leading genetic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and results from a genetic mutation which silences the expression of Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein (FMRP). FMRP serves various roles regulating cellular protein synthesis and ion flux. However, a comprehensive comparison of multidimensional elemental balance (i.e., ionome) between FXS genotypes and tissues remains absent from the literature. Here, we measured the multivariate balance of 10 elements (i.e., ionome) in tissues of wild-type and Fmr1-knockout mice to compare ionomic composition of brain and somatic tissues within and across genotypes. We found that homogenized brain tissue including several regions (brain PMHTH; define at first use) differed in elemental balance between genotypes, according to MANOVA. We failed to observe differences between genotypes in the mean ratio of any individual element in PMHTH, but sodium displayed lower variance in knockout than wild-type PMHTH. Knockout striatum displayed lower variance in potassium than wild-type. Knockout olfactory bulbs contained higher mean iron and displayed higher variance in sodium and copper than wild-type. Wild-type feces contained higher mean magnesium and zinc than knockout. These results align with previous work showing FXS pathologies alter electrolytic and metal ion regulation, neuronal excitability, and gastrointestinal function. Further work is needed to identify the source of overall ionomic differences in heterogeneous brain tissue (PMHTH), which could be due to differences among regions. Future work should additionally test how elemental differences relate to function at the cellular level, as well as patterns of individual intake, digestion, assimilation, and/or excretion.

">Working Memory of Multi-Object Scenes in Primate Frontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Working memory allows primates to reason about complex scenes, yet how the brain maintains multiple objects in memory simultaneously remains unclear. Competing theories propose that objects are stored in discrete slots, represented dynamically through switching, or encoded by weighted combinations of single-object representations. We formalized these hypotheses in terms of their quantitative predictions at the level of single neurons and tested them against densely recorded neural data from the dorsomedial frontal cortex and frontal eye field of monkeys trained to perform a novel multi-object working-memory task. Across cross-validated neural data, a Gain model, where population activity reflects weighted compositions of individual object responses, consistently outperformed Slot and Switching models. Trial-specific gain estimates predicted behavioral errors and reaction times, indicating that these latent weights capture meaningful fluctuations in memory fidelity. All results replicated in an independent dataset with different spatial configurations. Together, our work provides a rigorous framework to adjudicate a longstanding debate about how the frontal cortex retains multiple objects, identifying a weighted-sum representation as the format that best explains the neural data.

">Intrinsic Circadian Organization of the Spinal Cord and Dorsal Root Ganglia</a></h4>

              
                Circadian rhythms coordinate daily fluctuations in physiology and behavior, yet their organization within primary sensory pathways remains poorly defined. Although somatosensory responsiveness varies across the day night cycle, it is unclear whether peripheral sensory circuits possess molecular mechanisms for temporal regulation. Here, we demonstrate that the spinal peripheral sensory axis harbors robust, tissue autonomous circadian clocks. Using real time bioluminescence imaging, we observed sustained oscillations of the core clock protein PER2 in the spinal dorsal horn and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs), indicating autonomous circadian timing within these tissues. To define the molecular scope of this regulation, we performed RNA sequencing across a 52 hours circadian time course in DRGs. Circadian analysis identified 626 rhythmic transcripts, representing 3.6% of expressed genes. These genes exhibited non uniform phase distributions and segregated into discrete temporal clusters. Functional annotation revealed phase specific enrichment of biological processes related to transport, neuronal structure, and proteostasis, suggesting coordinated temporal deployment of distinct molecular programs rather than uniform oscillations across the circadian cycle. Cross referencing circadian genes with neuropathic pain associated gene sets revealed limited overlap; however, overlapping genes aligned to specific baseline phase windows enriched for regenerative annotations. Potassium channel related signaling components implicated in neuropathic pain also showed baseline circadian modulation. Together, these findings establish the spinal dorsal horn and DRGs as intrinsically circadian tissues and reveal a temporally structured molecular landscape in primary sensory neurons, providing a framework for understanding how peripheral sensory processing, plasticity, and homeostatic regulation are coordinated across the day night cycle.

">mPFC Synaptosome Proteomics Reveals Novel Pathways and Muscarinic Receptor Changes in a Learned Helplessness Mouse Model</a></h4>

              
                Stressful events are a leading factor in development of depression. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is strongly associated with depression etiology and exposure to uncontrollable stressors results in synaptic dysfunction and loss. Learned helplessness is a behavioral paradigm that measures effects of repeated exposure to uncontrollable, inescapable stress on later responses to escapable stress. We therefore performed a proteomic analysis of mPFC synaptosomes in a mouse learned helplessness model to identify molecular changes that could contribute to functional consequences of inescapable stress. Male and female mice were evaluated at baseline and following exposure to escapable or inescapable stress followed by an active avoidance test. Label-free mass spectrometry followed by pathway and protein-protein interaction network analyses identified alterations in signaling pathways involved in energy metabolism, neurotransmitter signaling, and protein shuttling. Furthermore, phosphoproteomics revealed alterations related to synaptic function, neurotransmitter signaling and protein internalization, as well as changes in activity of kinases previously identified as mediators of antidepressant efficacy (GSK3B) and receptor internalization (ADRBK1). We more deeply examined alterations in the Acetylcholine Receptor Signaling Pathway, and identified muscarinic receptor proteins (Chrm1, Chrm2, Chrm4) and key proteins involved in their translocation to and from the membrane. These results identify substantial changes in the mPFC proteome following exposure to inescapable stressors. In addition, mPFC muscarinic cholinergic signaling is well placed to mediate responses to an inescapable stressor. This proteomic study will be useful in guiding studies of human mPFC relevant to depression. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD073765.

                <p>by Ruiwen Xu, Xiaoqing Cheng, Waiki Ching, Siyao Wu, Yuanben Zhang, Yidan Zhang</p>

The rational utilization of multimodal spatial transcriptomics (ST) data enables accurate identification of spatial domains, which is essential for investigating cellular structure and functions. In this study, we proposed SpaConTDS, a novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning with self-supervised multimodal contrastive learning. SpaConTDS generates positive and negative samples through data augmentation and a pseudo-label tuple perturbation strategy, enabling the learning of fused representations that capture global semantics and cross-modal interactions. The model’s hyper-parameters are dynamically optimized using reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across various resolutions and platforms demonstrate that SpaConTDS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in spatial domain identification and outperforms existing methods in downstream tasks such as denoising, trajectory inference, and UMAP visualization. Moreover, SpaConTDS effectively integrates multiple tissue sections and corrects batch effects without requiring prior alignment. Compared to existing approaches, SpaConTDS offers more robust fused representations of multimodal data, providing researchers with a flexible and powerful tool for a wide range of spatial transcriptomics analyses.

                Introduction The value of sleep in preserving health and well-being is widely understood, especially among young people. To improve cognitive abilities, especially memory retention, adequate sleep is essential. Inadequate sleep quality and the resulting daytime sleepiness can negatively affect young adults’ physical and cognitive health and performance. Objective To assess the sleep cycle pattern, quality, electronic usage at bedtime, and diet among young adults in an urban area of Wardha. Protocol An observational cross-sectional study will be carried out with young adults to evaluate sleep patterns. Sleep quality and related risk factors will be measured using self-reports by participants. The link between many risk variables and poor sleep quality will be investigated using logistic regression analysis. Study Implication The study will help understand and address sleep quality in young adults. The information gathered in the study can further help serve as data for future research. This study aims to improve the understanding of factors contributing to poor sleep quality and disturbed sleep cycle patterns among young adults in an urban setting.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Age of symptom onset is highly variable in familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration (f-FTLD). Accurate prediction of onset would inform clinical management and trial enrollment. Prior studies indicate that individualized maps of brain atrophy can predict conversion to dementia in f-FTLD. We used a Bayesian linear mixed-effect (BLME) prediction method for identifying accelerated brain volume loss to predict conversion to dementia.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants included 234 asymptomatic or prodromal carriers of <i>C9orf72</i>, <i>GRN</i>, or <i>MAPT</i> mutations (including 21 dementia converters) with ≥3 longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T1-weighted scans. The BLME models established individual voxel-wise gray matter trajectories using the first 2 scans. Person-specific clusters of accelerated volume loss were estimated in subsequent scans and tested as predictors of dementia conversion compared with other approaches in time-varying Cox proportional hazard models covarying for age. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves estimated utility of cluster volume in discriminating which participants converted to dementia within 24 months.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The BLME cluster volume predicted conversion to dementia in f-FTLD mutation carriers overall and separately in <i>C9orf72</i>, <i>GRN</i>, and <i>MAPT</i>, with comparable hazard ratios observed for atrophy W-maps and regional volumes. Within a 24-month timeframe, BLME cluster volume discriminated dementia converters from non-converters with larger areas under the curve (AUCs) than other approaches.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Bayesian-modeled individualized atrophy scores predict dementia progression among asymptomatic f-FTLD mutation carriers and may have increased utility compared with other structural imaging methods when studying individuals over shorter timeframes that align with clinical trial design.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Green nanotechnology presents an opportunity in management of osteomyelitis, whereby environmental friendly procedures are used to provide nanoparticles that are of minimal toxicity. Green nanomaterials have the potential of effectively delivering antibiotics to the infected bone sites by incorporation of biocompatible materials to improve the efficiency of the delivery as well as reducing side effects. This sustainable treatment does not only provide safer treatment but also enhances faster healing and curbs infection spread that provides a more viable and environmentally friendly solution in managing osteomyelitis. This study is the first to synthesize poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles by using Phoenix dactylifera L. (Zahidi date) seeds extract as a capping agent in a green approach. 120 osteomyelitis specimens were collected; the nanoparticles were fabricated via a modified double emulsion solvent evaporation/diffusion technique followed by lyophilization. Characterization via X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Antimicrobial activity and minimum inhibitory concentration of green-synthesized PLGA nanoparticles was determined. 40% of the specimens contained Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 20%, Staphylococcus aureus; 10%, Proteus mirabilis; 10%, Enterococcus faecium; and 20%, different Gram-negative bacilli. PLGA nanoparticles do not exhibit considerable crystallization using the date seed extract in XRD analysis, FTIR spectroscopic analysis of PLGA nanoparticles reveals absorption bands characteristic of the polymer’s chemical structure and indicates the presence of functional groups from both PLGA and the bioactive constituents of the date pit extract. (FE-SEM) confirmed the formation of uniformly sized spherical particles (23–33 nm) with an amorphous polymeric structure and maintaining the inherent chemical integrity of PLGA. Importantly, the incorporation of bioactive phytochemicals from the date seed extract was confirmed, indicating their participation in the functional activity of the nanoparticles. Antimicrobial activities determined using the broth microdilution method revealed high inhibition against Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC: 75–125 μg/mL) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC: 100–125 μg/mL). The findings highlight the significance of incorporating agro-industrial waste into the sustainable production of bioactive nanocarriers. The developed PLGA nanoparticles constitute an efficient carrier system with high antibacterial activity and represent a novel therapeutic strategy for treating osteomyelitis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-151/v1?src=rss">High Measles Complication Rates and Vaccine Breakthroughs Among Pediatric Cases in Iraq: A Cross-Sectional Study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Measles constitutes a substantial public health concern in Iraq. Despite concerted efforts to achieve elimination in accordance with World Health Organization targets, comprehensive understanding of its epidemiological patterns and vaccine effectiveness remains critically important. Objectives This investigation aimed to: (1) assess the relationship between age and clinical manifestations among measles patients; (2) evaluate Iraq’s progress toward measles elimination objectives; and (3) identify immunization coverage gaps. Methods This cross-sectional study enrolled 200 laboratory-confirmed measles cases (serological or molecular confirmation) from Ramadi Teaching Hospital, Al-Anbar Province, Iraq, during January 2023 to March 2024. Vaccination status was verified through official refrigerator immunization cards. Statistical analyses employed chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression to adjust for potential confounding variables. Results Among 200 confirmed measles cases, 32% were infants aged <12 months and 68% were children aged 1-9 years. Notably, 71% represented breakthrough infections among individuals who had received at least one vaccine dose. Severe complications included pneumonia (77%), diarrhea (73%), otitis media (45%), and encephalitis (23%). Unvaccinated children demonstrated 3.2-fold increased odds of developing pneumonia. Disease burden was disproportionately higher in rural populations (58%). Mean C-reactive protein concentration was 56.8 mg/dL. Conclusion Measles persists with substantial morbidity in Iraq. The breakthrough infection rate (71%) significantly exceeds World Health Organization Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office reports (45-50%), suggesting unique regional challenges. Achieving elimination necessitates urgent evaluation of vaccination programs, strengthening of routine immunization services, and enhancement of surveillance systems. Future investigations should assess post-vaccination seroconversion rates and conduct molecular genotyping studies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-150/v1?src=rss">Creative play and creativity development: A three level meta data analysis of moderators (age, culture, play type) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This study presents a comprehensive three-level meta-analysis examining the relationship between creative play and creativity development, focusing on the moderating effects of age, culture, and game type. Using meta-analytic methods, we systematically analyzed 78 empirical studies (N = 21,456 participants) published between 2000 and 2024. Results revealed a significant positive relationship between creative play engagement and creativity development (g = 0.62, 95% CI [0.58, 0.66]). Moderator analyses showed the relationship’s strength varied significantly by age group: early childhood (3–7 years) demonstrated the strongest effect (g = 0.74), followed by middle childhood (8–12 years; g = 0.61), and adolescence (13–18 years; g = 0.84). Cultural context significantly moderated the relationship, with collectivist cultures showing a stronger effect (g = 0.68) compared to individualist cultures (g = 0.57). Regarding play type, dramatic play exhibited the strongest relationship with creativity (g = 0.71), followed by constructive play (g = 0.65), and digital play (g = 0.52). These findings underscore the importance of developmentally and culturally appropriate play interventions for fostering creativity. This research offers valuable insights for educators, policymakers, and future researchers in designing effective creativity-enhancing programs across developmental stages and cultural contexts.

                Background Cultural heritage tourism presents unique challenges and opportunities in building long-term consumer–brand relationships. While brand loyalty is a key objective for destination marketers, the role of authentic quality experience in shaping trust and perceived brand value remains underexplored. This study aims to bridge that gap by examining how quality experience influences brand trust, brand value, and ultimately brand loyalty, using a multidisciplinary lens that integrates marketing theory, cultural studies, and psychology. Methods A quantitative survey was conducted involving 573 respondents from diverse demographic backgrounds who had visited cultural heritage destinations. Data were collected using structured questionnaires and analyzed through structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the relationships among quality experience, brand trust, brand value, and brand loyalty. Measurement validity and reliability were assessed prior to hypothesis testing. Results The results indicate that quality experience has a significant positive effect on both brand trust and brand value. Furthermore, brand trust and brand value act as mediating variables that strengthen the relationship between quality experience and brand loyalty. The structural model demonstrated strong fit indices, confirming the robustness of the proposed relationships. These findings underscore the importance of delivering authentic and meaningful experiences to enhance consumer perceptions and emotional attachment to heritage brands. Conclusions This study advances the theory of Relationship Marketing and Tourism Consumption by clarifying the key role of quality experience in building brand loyalty. Practically, the findings offer concrete recommendations for heritage site managers and destination marketers to develop branding strategies that emphasize authenticity, emotional resonance, and sustainable engagement. By focusing on quality experience, heritage destinations can foster greater trust, perceived value, and loyalty among visitors.

                Forest fires are becoming increasingly common worldwide, posing a threat to the environment, economy, and society. Spatiotemporal analysis of forest fires is important to understand their characteristics and causes and to inform decision-making. This type of analysis requires the availability of a number of factors that contribute to fire occurrence, such as land use, environment, climate, and human activities, at high spatial and temporal resolutions. The South American Amazon rainforest covers a large area, and acquiring a useful dataset for analysis requires extensive effort and computer-intensive processing. This study investigates potential data sources, establishes a methodology, and prepares a dataset of attributes useful for spatiotemporal fire analysis. We provide a raster-based dataset that includes fires, land use, environment, and climate factors at a spatial resolution of 500 m and monthly temporal resolution from 2001 to 2020, which facilitates the analysis of forest fires in the Amazon. Moreover, because data sources and implementation procedures are detailed, this work also encourages similar research in other parts of the world.

                Background In Peru, the legalization of Cannabis was given in 2017 and approved in 2019; however, there are discrepancies in the knowledge of the therapeutic use of this plant, causing rejection in its application as an alternative medicine. Methods The research was of a basic type with a quantitative approach and a non-experimental design, with a cross-sectional and descriptive scope. Non-probabilistic sampling was applied, with 324 participants aged 18-60. Data were collected through a virtual questionnaire of closed questions (KR-20 = 0.825). Descriptive statistics were used (frequencies and percentages), and inferential analyses Spearman’s correlation, simple linear regression, Monte Carlo exact tests, and a two-step cluster analysis to identify acceptance profiles. Results Participants expressed a favorable perception of the potential benefits of medical cannabis. However, their knowledge of its therapeutic indications and dosage was limited. Inferential analyses revealed a significant positive association between knowledge and acceptance of the therapeutic use of cannabis. Knowledge emerged as a significant predictor of acceptance, although it explained only a limited proportion of its variability. Cluster analysis identified distinct acceptance profiles within the study population, showing adequate internal cohesion and separation, and highlighting knowledge as the most influential factor in cluster formation. Despite moderate acceptance of regular use under medical supervision, participants emphasized that cannabis use should be limited to prescriptions from specialized physicians and supported by scientific evidence. Conclusion Study participants demonstrate limited knowledge about medical cannabis, despite moderate acceptance of its regulated use. Knowledge plays an important, though not exclusive, role in shaping acceptance, underscoring the need for targeted educational strategies and evidence-based public health policies.

                Abstract* Background The Workflow Description Language (WDL) is an open standard that is widely used for bioinformatics workflows. Due to its declarative nature WDL workflows can be easily presented and edited as graphs. Nextflow is both domain specific language for bioinformatics workflows and a convenient workflow execution engine. Our objective was to develop a tool that allows a user to edit WDL workflows visually as a graph providing synchronisation between its textual and graphical representation. Methods Translation of WDL workflows into Nextflow ones allows usage of both languages with the same execution engine. BioUML platform provides class library for object oriented presentation of most common workflow concepts as well as plugins for workflow visualisation and its graphical editing. Results We have developed a WDL parser that with some limitations maps content of WDL workflows into its object-oriented presentation (model). This model can be visualised and edited as a graph. WDL and Nextflow generators create WDL and Nextflow text from the same model. Conclusions Developed tools are available as a standalone Java program, web server, web service and a plugin for the BioUML platform.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-137/v1?src=rss">The Experimental Development of Solar Collector with Different Types of Nanofluid [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                In the present study, the flow rate and nanofluid effects on a parabolic trough solar collector were examined experimentally in Kirkuk city climate conditions during the period from May to July. Three flow rates, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 l/min were utilized. The theoretical and experimental results prove that lower flow rates enhance the thermal performance significantly as they increase the fluid residence time. According to the obtained results, two nanofluids, ZnO-water and MgO-water (at 0.2 wt. %), were experimentally evaluated at the optimal flow rate of 0.1 l/min. Both nanofluids showed better results than base fluid (water). Thus, MgO exhibited a better thermal efficiency of 66.9% at 12 pm than ZnO (62.7%) and water (57.19%). Directly, MgO generated the better thermal efficiency with maximum outlet temperature of MgO was 75.08°C. This could be due to the higher thermal efficiency of MgO-water, which is attributed to its much higher thermal conductivity (48.4 W/m·K) than ZnO (29 W/m·K). The exergy efficiency was nearly the same and negligible, that is, 13.8% for MgO, owing to the thermodynamic limitations. The practical results show that MgO nanofluid at a low flow rate could be an optimal solution for the parabolic trough solar collector.

                Background HFDs have adverse effects on metabolic health, which puts individuals at risk of obesity and liver and kidney dysfunction. Orlistat is an antihypertensive agent against obesity that prevents the absorption of dietary fats, although its impact on hepatic and renal functions is still disputed. In this study, the dose-dependent effects of orlistat on liver and renal functioning were in male rats on an HFD were assessed. Methods There was a control HFD group and three HFD groups with orlistat (360, 480 and 600 mg/kg) on male rats over 60 days. Lipid profiles, liver enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT, ALP), kidney (urea, creatinine, direct and indirect bilirubin), and hematological (hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, WBC counts, MCV, MCH, MCHC) serum tests were done. Histopathological analysis of liver and kidney tissues was done. Findings Orlistat caused dose-related changes in lipid profiles, increased liver enzymes, and an increased mark of kidney functioning. The hematological parameters were also greatly impaired, and the histopathology indicated structural and tissue damage in both of the organs, more so at higher doses. Conclusions Orlistat was used in HFD-conditions in male rats, which resulted in severe dose-related impairment of the liver and kidney. These results highlight the importance of close observation of hepatic and renal functions when using orlistat especially in the high-fat dietary situation.

                Background The incidence of stress and anxiety among nursing students is observed across all academic years of their educational training. Although Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) are helpful in healthcare education, they can be anxiety-inducing. This study aimed to assess the anxiety level among nursing students during the OSCE exams. Methods A descriptive study was carried out on a purposive sample by distributing an online survey among students from an undergraduate nursing program. Anxiety levels were measured using the State-trait anxiety inventory, including the subscales of the state and trait of anxiety. Results A total of 121 students with a mean age of 22.2 years (SD +/-3.6) participated in the study. The majority of the participants, 72.7%, were females, and 27.3% were males. Before attending the OSCE, 58.7% of the participants reported a mild degree of anxiety, 33.1% had a moderate level of anxiety, and only 10.7% had a severe level of trait anxiety. Conclusions The findings highlight the complex interplay between sociodemographic factors, academic performance, work-study balance, and anxiety levels among nursing students preparing for high-stakes assessments like the OSCE. Addressing anxiety levels among nursing students preparing for OSCE assessments requires a multifaceted approach that considers individual characteristics, academic performance, and external stressors.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-892/v2?src=rss">Why Are Christian Schools Popular in Japan Despite the Small Number of Christians? : A Case Study of a Catholic Girls’ Junior and Senior High School [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The proportion of Christians in Japan’s population is very small (0.7%). In contrast, Christian-affiliated schools are numerous and enjoy widespread popularity. As previous studies suggest, Christian schools—especially those for girls—are often associated with positive social images (such as being “refined” or “upper-class”), particularly among young women, and this association has been considered one reason for their popularity. However, much of the existing research is based on statistical analysis, literature review, or quantitative methods, and few studies have employed detailed qualitative approaches. Some earlier studies have applied Pierre Bourdieu’s theory of class reproduction to analyze the popularity of Christian girls’ schools, but they often frame this in terms of marriage as a pathway to upward social mobility—a perspective that does not fully align with the values of today’s youth, who tend to place greater emphasis on their individual careers. Therefore, this paper focuses on one Christian-affiliated integrated junior and senior high school for girls (referred to as School X) and explores the reasons for its popularity through semi-structured interviews with its alumni. Unlike previous research that has been constrained by gender biases, this study examines the appeal of such schools from the perspective of cultural capital. In particular, it emphasizes the relevance of alignment between the students’ values and the founding mission of the school. The findings reveal that the students perceived School X’s education as directly contributing to the acquisition of various forms of capital and habitus, as defined by Bourdieu (although not articulated in such terms by the students themselves). Additionally, These results indicate a strong sense of coherence between the school’s founding ideals and the students’ personal values. In conclusion, this paper offers insight—through the lens of cultural capital and habitus—into why Christian girls’ schools in Japan continue to be highly regarded.

                This study introduces an innovative Augmented Reality (AR) cultural application designed to enrich the tourism experience of the Dvaravati-Khmer civilization in Thailand. Addressing the scarcity of interactive digital tools at historical sites, which often fail to engage modern visitors effectively, our AR application integrates multiple functionalities, including 3D object scanning, VR site exploration, and a digital rally system. Developed using the Unity engine and Vuforia SDK, the application underwent rigorous user trials involving 43 participants to evaluate its impact on user experience, learning effectiveness, and engagement. Results demonstrated a 40% increase in historical knowledge retention, with 92% task completion rates and high user satisfaction (4.01/5). The application’s intuitive design and gamified elements significantly enhanced visitor interaction and learning. Here, we showcase an adaptable model for digital cultural tourism enhancement, providing practical insights for heritage preservation and visitor engagement.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-133/v1?src=rss">Perception of body donation among the Phase-1 medical students, a questionnaire-based study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study aimed to examine the knowledge, attitude, and perception of body donation among Phase-1 medical students at our institution. The objectives were to assist teachers in providing insight into the perception of this among students. Methods This was a cross-sectional, institution-based, time-bound study comprising 29 validated questions regarding comprehensive aspects of body donation. There were 396 medical students in Phase-1 from admissions for two consecutive years. Results Most students (94.4%) were aware of the source of cadavers in the dissection hall, which were either donated or unclaimed bodies from the hospital. However, 38.9% of them were unaware of the guidelines for body donation, and 79% were ignorant of the documents required to pledge. However, 84.3% were aware that it was mandatory to sign a pledge form. The time frame to procure the dead body to the department of anatomy of the institution was not known to 79% of the participants, and 93.2% of the participants opined that corpses from other neighboring states could be accepted. Opinions regarding the acceptance of donated bodies afflicted with long COVID were supported by 218 (55.1%), not supported by 47 (11.9%), and neutral by 131 (33.1%) participants in this study. Conclusion Specific knowledge gaps were encountered, including the timeframe, logistics, and legal issues in procuring the body. Since medical students play an important role in this societal motivation, it is suggested that a scientific session be planned in the curriculum of Phase-1 regarding the protocol of body donation. Apart from providing insights, this study also accomplishes the United Nations’ sustainable development goal-4 in offering quality medical education.

                Background Hydatid disease is a widespread disease that affects all human organs. Aims This study aimed to evaluate antibodies (IgA, IgG, and IgM), complement proteins (C3 and C4), MIF of PMNs cells, reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT), and phagocytic activity against Candida albicans. Methodology Hydatid cysts were collected from surgically injured patients at Fallujah Teaching Hospital, Twenty BALB/c mice were injected with Protoscolex antigen as treatment groups or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as control groups, at booster and challenge doses. Antibodies and complement concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the MIF of PMNs cells, reduction of NBT, and phagocytic activity against Candida albicans were measured to assess cellular activity. Results The results showed significant differences in the levels of antibodies compared to the control group 21 days after injection of the protoscolex antigen at a concentration of 0.5 ml subcutaneously. There were also significant differences between the treatment and control group in the levels of C3 and C4. NBT dye reduction and phagocytosis of Candida albicans by PMNs showed significant differences compared to the control group. The results also showed a significant decrease in PMN viability in the treatment group. An increase in neutrophil migration diameter was observed. The results showed a 50.4% decrease in the infection level in the treatments injected with the antigen, and the average diameter of the hydatid cysts decreased compared with the control group. Conclusions The results indicate that Protoscolex antigen activates the immune response and reduces severity of hydatid disease. This highlights its potential as a promising candidate for developing a vaccine or preventive strategy against hydatid disease.

     alt="Distribution of Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels and Scaffolding Proteins on Vestibular Calyx Ending Delineates the Axon Initial Segment"/>
<p>Various sodium channel isoforms and their scaffolding proteins are found in four different microdomains in vestibular calyx-bearing afferents. These microdomains serve different purposes, analogous to the heminode, axon initial segment, and synaptic domains of other types of sensory afferents.

</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The amniote inner ear contains an unusual type of hair cell and a unique postsynaptic calyx terminal with specialized ion channel expression and afferent transmission mechanisms. The calyceal afferent terminal enwraps the hair cell and leads to a heminode. It has morphological and functional microdomains with distinct complements of potassium channels and scaffolding proteins. Stimulation of hair cells gives rise to postsynaptic potentials in the membrane facing the hair cell that propagate along the outer face of the calyx and parent axon to the heminode, giving rise to spikes with timing and response properties that vary with location (epithelial zone) and afferent morphology (calyx-only vs. dimorphic with additional bouton terminals). Heminodes of calyx-only afferents lie within the epithelium, placing the calyces themselves closer to the heminode. We report that diverse voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>V</sub>) channel proteins (including Na<sub>V</sub>1.1–1.3, 1.5. 1.6, 1.8, and 1.9), HCN (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated) channels, and associated scaffolding proteins (ankyrins, βIV-spectrin, and ezrin) are differentially deployed across calyx microdomains, and specific complements of proteins also vary with innervation zone in vestibular epithelia. Our results suggest the calyx outer surface plays a role analogous to an axon initial segment in central neurons, and that systematic variation in Na<sub>V</sub> pore-forming subunits underlies differences in firing properties of vestibular afferents in different epithelial zones.</p>

                Qu et al. identify HRD1 as a key negative regulator of autophagosome-lysosome fusion. They demonstrate that HRD1 interacts with the SNARE protein SNAP29 to suppress its liquid-liquid phase separation. This work establishes the regulation of SNARE complex assembly via phase separation as a critical control mechanism for autophagy progression.
