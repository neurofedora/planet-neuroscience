	<p>The rupture of an intracranial aneurysm (IA) leads to life-threatening subarachnoid hemorrhage. Aside from well-established risk factors, recently published genome-wide association studies of IA revealed the strong association of a common variant near the endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA) gene with IA risk. However, the role of EDNRA in the pathogenesis of IA remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of a genetic modification within the EDNRA gene on IA pathogenesis in a novel in vivo model. Adult wild-type Sprague&amp;amp;ndash;Dawley rats (WT rats) and genetically modified rats (EDNRA rats) were used for the induction of IA using arterial hypertension (HT). Animals were stratified into four groups: WT rats without (WT_CTL) and with induction of HT (WT + HT), as well as EDNRA rats without (EDNRA_CTL) and with induction of HT (EDNRA + HT). Blood pressure (BP) was observed for 12 weeks. After the observation period, cerebral arteries were analyzed for morphological (i.e., aneurysmal) changes as well as histological and functional changes by immunofluorescence and functional investigation. In the groups of rats with induction of HT, BP was higher in EDNRA + HT compared with that in WT + HT. No IAs were observed in WT_CTL and EDNRA_CTL but were found in WT + HT and EDNRA + HT. There was no histological difference in the immunofluorescence of EDNRA between all groups. Contractility and potency of endothelin-1 differed between the groups in functional investigation. In summary, we created a new model that is suitable for further studies for better understanding of the role of EDNRA in IA pathogenesis.</p>

	<p>Neurofeedback (NF) is a type of biofeedback in which an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s brain activity is measured and presented to them to support self-regulation of ongoing brain oscillations and achieve specific behavioral and neurophysiological outcomes. NF training induces changes in neurophysiological circuits that are associated with behavioral changes. Recent evidence suggests that the NF technique can be used to train electrical brain activity and facilitate learning among children with learning disorders. Toward this aim, this review first presents a generalized model for NF systems, and then studies involving NF training for children with disorders such as dyslexia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and other specific learning disorders such as dyscalculia and dysgraphia are reviewed. The discussion elaborates on the potential for translational applications of NF in educational and learning settings with details. This review also addresses some issues concerning the role of NF in education, and it concludes with some solutions and future directions. In order to provide the best learning environment for children with ADHD and other learning disorders, it is critical to better understand the role of NF in educational settings. The review provides the potential challenges of the current systems to aid in highlighting the issues undermining the efficacy of current systems and identifying solutions to address them. The review focuses on the use of NF technology in education for the development of adaptive teaching methods and the best learning environment for children with learning disabilities.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Medication-related burden among Iraqi patients with rheumatoid arthritis: An observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronically progressing inflammatory disease having articular, extra-articular, and systemic manifestations of unclear origin. Medication-related burden (MRB) is a novel concept that focuses on unpleasant feelings associated with the therapeutic process. The purpose of this research was to examine MRB among Iraqi patients with rheumatoid arthritis from the patient's viewpoint. Methods: The present research was a cross-sectional study conducted on patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had previously been diagnosed and visited Baghdad Teaching Hospital/Medical City/Rheumatology department between December 2021 through March 2022. The Living with Medicines Questionnaire was used to assess MRB (LMQ). Results: The study recruited 250 RA patients. The average age of the patients was 47.29± 12.72 years. The vast majority were women, 80.8%. The mean LMQ score was 113.78± 13.95. Most participants experienced a moderate degree of burden of 72.0%, followed by a minimum commitment of 24.4%, a high burden of 2.8%, and no burden of 0.8%, with no patient experiencing a high burden of 0 %. Women had significantly higher medication-related burdens (total LMQ). RA patients with more than five chronic medications had substantially higher MRB than those with fewer scheduled medications. Patients with chronic diseases (other than RA) had significantly higher MRB than those without other chronic diseases. The total LMQ score had a significant positive correlation with the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) value. In other words, when disease severity increases, the MRB increases. Conclusion: A considerable proportion of the RA patients involved in the current study have experienced MRB. Female sex, polypharmacy, comorbidities, and more severe disease are associated with more MRB.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Acute effects of cigarette smoke on Endothelial Nitric Oxide synthase, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and aortic intima media thickness [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background. Cigarette smoking could induce endothelial dysfunction and the increase of circulating markers of inflammation by activation of monocytes. This can lead to increased intima media thickness (IMT) of entire blood vessels and result in acceleration of the atherosclerosis process. However, to our knowledge, little is known about the role of cigarette smoking in this atherosclerotic inflammatory process. The aim of this study is to explore the link between cigarette smoking and its effect on endothelial nitric oxide synthase (e-NOS) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1). Methods. An experimental study with a post-test only controlled group design was used. We used 18 Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus) randomly subdivided into two groups: group K (-) were not exposed to tobacco smoke, whereas group K (+) were exposed to smoke equivalent of more than 40 cigarettes for 28 days daily. After 28 days, samples were analyzed for e-NOS, VCAM-1 and aortic IMT. Results. Our results indicate that tobacco smoke can enhance the expression of VCAM-1 on rat cardiac vascular endothelial cells, resulting in a decreased expression of e-NOS level and increase of aortic IMT. Linear regression model found that eNOS level negatively correlated wiith aortic IMT (r2 = 0.584, β = -0.764, p < 0.001), whereas VCAM-1 expression did not correlate with aortic IMT (r2 = 0.197, p = 0.065). Conclusion. Low e-NOS level and high VCAM-1 level observed  after cigarette smoke exposure which may increase aortic IMT.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Sarcoidosis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Sarcoidosis is a chronic granulomatous disease with multisystem involvement and can present with vague symptoms, so the degree of suspicion should be high. Sarcoidosis has a wide range of clinical symptoms, owing to its multisystem involvement. The lungs, peripheral lymphatics, skin, liver, eye, spleen, bone, salivary glands, joints, and heart are the most commonly involved organ systems pathologically. Sarcoidosis often manifests in the fourth decade of life, but it might occasionally manifest in later years. We present a case of 69-year-old woman who initially complained of generalized weakness, fatigue, and joint pain which later progressed to pulmonary and cutaneous symptoms including cough, dyspnea, chest discomfort, and skin nodules. Examination revealed right cervical lymphadenopathy, bilateral basal crackles in lungs, non-tender nodules over the dorsum of bilateral forearm and hand along with erythema nodosum on bilateral legs. Chest radiograph and computed tomography scans were typical of sarcoidosis. Biopsy of the lymph node revealed noncaseating granuloma and serum angiotensinogen converting enzyme level was raised. Treatment was started with 40 mg prednisolone daily and tapered over a year. The patient had clinical and radiological improvement over the duration of therapy and was on regular follow-up with routine investigations. Clinically, the patient is doing well at follow-up. A high degree of suspicion, familiarity with imaging features, and prompt treatment in selected cases may help in diagnosing, evaluating the extent of disease, and guiding optimal health care.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours about gender equality: a cross-sectional survey of adolescents from rural India [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Gender equality is a fundamental human right and vital to accelerate global progress towards several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Adolescents’ involvement is essential to achieve such equality and SDGs to develop peaceful sustainable societies. However, there are limited data especially from developing countries such as India to plan gender equality related programmes targeted at adolescents. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess gender equality related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours among 16 to 19 year-old adolescents from sixty villages of the Maharashtra state of India. Results: Data from 1306 respondents (667 females and 639 males) showed a mean score of 30 out of 44, suggesting an overall moderate gender equality score in rural adolescents. The majority of girls (68.3%) were in the high scoring group, whereas the majority of boys were in the moderate group (60.3%). Regression analysis showed that responses from boys were associated with lower scores compared to responses from girls by five points (adjusted β-coefficient: -4.99, 95%CI: -5.85 to -4.12, p<0.001). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there is a need to involve adolescents with a major focus on boys to improve gender equality in rural areas of Maharashtra. This will help introduce concepts of equality from an early age to educate boys, empower girls, and address gender-based discrimination and violence against girls and women.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Excitatory and inhibitory effects of HCN channel modulation on excitability of layer V pyramidal cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tuomo Mäki-Marttunen, Verónica Mäki-Marttunen</p>

Dendrites of cortical pyramidal cells are densely populated by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, a.k.a. <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> channels. <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> channels are targeted by multiple neuromodulatory pathways, and thus are one of the key ion-channel populations regulating the pyramidal cell activity. Previous observations and theories attribute opposing effects of the <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> channels on neuronal excitability due to their mildly hyperpolarized reversal potential. These effects are difficult to measure experimentally due to the fine spatiotemporal landscape of the <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> activity in the dendrites, but computational models provide an efficient tool for studying this question in a reduced but generalizable setting. In this work, we build upon existing biophysically detailed models of thick-tufted layer V pyramidal cells and model the effects of over- and under-expression of <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> channels as well as their neuromodulation. We show that <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> channels facilitate the action potentials of layer V pyramidal cells in response to proximal dendritic stimulus while they hinder the action potentials in response to distal dendritic stimulus at the apical dendrite. We also show that the inhibitory action of the <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> channels in layer V pyramidal cells is due to the interactions between <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> channels and a hot zone of low voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at the apical dendrite. Our simulations suggest that a combination of <i>I</i><sub>h</sub>-enhancing neuromodulation at the proximal part of the apical dendrite and <i>I</i><sub>h</sub>-inhibiting modulation at the distal part of the apical dendrite can increase the layer V pyramidal excitability more than either of the two alone. Our analyses uncover the effects of <i>I</i><sub>h</sub>-channel neuromodulation of layer V pyramidal cells at a single-cell level and shed light on how these neurons integrate information and enable higher-order functions of the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">In the Body’s Eye: The computational anatomy of interoceptive inference</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Micah Allen, Andrew Levy, Thomas Parr, Karl J. Friston</p>

A growing body of evidence highlights the intricate linkage of exteroceptive perception to the rhythmic activity of the visceral body. In parallel, interoceptive inference theories of affective perception and self-consciousness are on the rise in cognitive science. However, thus far no formal theory has emerged to integrate these twin domains; instead, most extant work is conceptual in nature. Here, we introduce a formal model of cardiac active inference, which explains how ascending cardiac signals entrain exteroceptive sensory perception and uncertainty. Through simulated psychophysics, we reproduce the defensive startle reflex and commonly reported effects linking the cardiac cycle to affective behaviour. We further show that simulated ‘interoceptive lesions’ blunt affective expectations, induce psychosomatic hallucinations, and exacerbate biases in perceptual uncertainty. Through synthetic heart-rate variability analyses, we illustrate how the balance of arousal-priors and visceral prediction errors produces idiosyncratic patterns of physiological reactivity. Our model thus offers a roadmap for computationally phenotyping disordered brain-body interaction.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">An integrative systems biology approach to overcome venetoclax resistance in acute myeloid leukemia</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michelle Przedborski, David Sharon, Severine Cathelin, Steven Chan, Mohammad Kohandel</p>

The over-expression of the Bcl-2 protein is a common feature of many solid cancers and hematological malignancies, and it is typically associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. Bcl-2-specific inhibitors, such as venetoclax, have recently been approved for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma, and they are showing promise in clinical trials as a targeted therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, successful treatment of AML with Bcl-2-specific inhibitors is often followed by the rapid development of drug resistance. An emerging paradigm for overcoming drug resistance in cancer treatment is through the targeting of mitochondrial energetics and metabolism. In AML in particular, it was recently observed that inhibition of mitochondrial translation via administration of the antibiotic tedizolid significantly affects mitochondrial bioenergetics, activating the integrated stress response (ISR) and subsequently sensitizing drug-resistant AML cells to venetoclax. Here we develop an integrative systems biology approach to acquire a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind this process, and in particular, of the specific role of the ISR in the commitment of cells to apoptosis. Our multi-scale mathematical model couples the ISR to the intrinsic apoptosis pathway in venetoclax-resistant AML cells, includes the metabolic effects of treatment, and integrates RNA, protein level, and cellular viability data. Using the mathematical model, we identify the dominant mechanisms by which ISR activation helps to overcome venetoclax resistance, and we study the temporal sequencing of combination treatment to determine the most efficient and robust combination treatment protocol.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Strong evidence for the adaptive walk model of gene evolution in Drosophila and Arabidopsis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ana Filipa Moutinho, Adam Eyre-Walker, Julien Y. Dutheil</p>

Understanding the dynamics of species adaptation to their environments has long been a central focus of the study of evolution. Theories of adaptation propose that populations evolve by “walking” in a fitness landscape. This “adaptive walk” is characterised by a pattern of diminishing returns, where populations further away from their fitness optimum take larger steps than those closer to their optimal conditions. Hence, we expect young genes to evolve faster and experience mutations with stronger fitness effects than older genes because they are further away from their fitness optimum. Testing this hypothesis, however, constitutes an arduous task. Young genes are small, encode proteins with a higher degree of intrinsic disorder, are expressed at lower levels, and are involved in species-specific adaptations. Since all these factors lead to increased protein evolutionary rates, they could be masking the effect of gene age. While controlling for these factors, we used population genomic data sets of <i>Arabidopsis</i> and <i>Drosophila</i> and estimated the rate of adaptive substitutions across genes from different phylostrata. We found that a gene’s evolutionary age significantly impacts the molecular rate of adaptation. Moreover, we observed that substitutions in young genes tend to have larger physicochemical effects. Our study, therefore, provides strong evidence that molecular evolution follows an adaptive walk model across a large evolutionary timescale.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Functional architecture of pancreatic islets identifies a population of first responder cells that drive the first-phase calcium response</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vira Kravets, JaeAnn M. Dwulet, Wolfgang E. Schleicher, David J. Hodson, Anna M. Davis, Laura Pyle, Robert A. Piscopio, Maura Sticco-Ivins, Richard K. P. Benninger</p>

Insulin-secreting β-cells are functionally heterogeneous. Whether there exist cells driving the first-phase calcium response in individual islets, has not been examined. We examine “first responder” cells, defined by the earliest [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] response during first-phase [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] elevation, distinct from previously identified “hub” and “leader” cells. We used islets isolated from Mip-Cre<sup>ER</sup>; Rosa-Stop-Lox-Stop-GCamP6s mice (β-GCamP6s) that show β-cell-specific GCamP6s expression following tamoxifen-induced CreER-mediated recombination. First responder cells showed characteristics of high membrane excitability and lower electrical coupling to their neighbors. The first-phase response time of β-cells in the islet was spatially organized, dependent on the cell’s distance to the first responder cell, and consistent over time up to approximately 24 h. When first responder cells were laser ablated, the first-phase [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] was slowed down, diminished, and discoordinated compared to random cell ablation. Cells that were next earliest to respond often took over the role of the first responder upon ablation. In summary, we discover and characterize a distinct first responder β-cell state, critical for the islet first-phase response to glucose.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">ACE2-containing defensosomes serve as decoys to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Krystal L. Ching, Maren de Vries, Juan Gago, Kristen Dancel-Manning, Joseph Sall, William J. Rice, Clea Barnett, Alireza Khodadadi-Jamayran, Aristotelis Tsirigos, Feng-Xia Liang, Lorna E. Thorpe, Bo Shopsin, Leopoldo N. Segal, Meike Dittmann, Victor J. Torres, Ken Cadwell</p>

Extracellular vesicles of endosomal origin, exosomes, mediate intercellular communication by transporting substrates with a variety of functions related to tissue homeostasis and disease. Their diagnostic and therapeutic potential has been recognized for diseases such as cancer in which signaling defects are prominent. However, it is unclear to what extent exosomes and their cargo inform the progression of infectious diseases. We recently defined a subset of exosomes termed defensosomes that are mobilized during bacterial infection in a manner dependent on autophagy proteins. Through incorporating protein receptors on their surface, defensosomes mediated host defense by binding and inhibiting pore-forming toxins secreted by bacterial pathogens. Given this capacity to serve as decoys that interfere with surface protein interactions, we investigated the role of defensosomes during infection by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Consistent with a protective function, exosomes containing high levels of the viral receptor ACE2 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from critically ill COVID-19 patients was associated with reduced intensive care unit (ICU) and hospitalization times. We found ACE2+ exosomes were induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and activation of viral sensors in cell culture, which required the autophagy protein ATG16L1, defining these as defensosomes. We further demonstrate that ACE2+ defensosomes directly bind and block viral entry. These findings suggest that defensosomes may contribute to the antiviral response against SARS-CoV-2 and expand our knowledge on the regulation and effects of extracellular vesicles during infection.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Cytoskeletal vimentin regulates cell size and autophagy through mTORC1 signaling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ponnuswamy Mohanasundaram, Leila S. Coelho-Rato, Mayank Kumar Modi, Marta Urbanska, Franziska Lautenschläger, Fang Cheng, John E. Eriksson</p>

The nutrient-activated mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase complex 1) signaling pathway determines cell size by controlling mRNA translation, ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis, and autophagy. Here, we show that vimentin, a cytoskeletal intermediate filament protein that we have known to be important for wound healing and cancer progression, determines cell size through mTORC1 signaling, an effect that is also manifested at the organism level in mice. This vimentin-mediated regulation is manifested at all levels of mTOR downstream target activation and protein synthesis. We found that vimentin maintains normal cell size by supporting mTORC1 translocation and activation by regulating the activity of amino acid sensing Rag GTPase. We also show that vimentin inhibits the autophagic flux in the absence of growth factors and/or critical nutrients, demonstrating growth factor-independent inhibition of autophagy at the level of mTORC1. Our findings establish that vimentin couples cell size and autophagy through modulating Rag GTPase activity of the mTORC1 signaling pathway.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Preservation of heritage buildings in Alexandria, Egypt: an application of heritage digitisation process phases and new documentation methods [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Throughout the history of the city, the architecture of Alexandria, Egypt, has been in contact with world cultures, especially those of the Mediterranean sphere. Alexandria is rich with cultural features dating back seven thousand years. In Alexandria, the heritage value of the city has decreased because there is no suitable documentation system for these more recent assets. The development of a new technique for preserving heritage buildings is required. For example, image- based techniques can gather data using photography, panoramic photography, and close-range photogrammetry. In this research, we primarily seek to implement Heritage Digitisation Process Phases (HDPP) and establish new documentation methods in architectural conservation and built-heritage preservation, i.e., Virtual Reality (VR) and Website Heritage Documentation (WHD). Methods: The methodology is designed to preserve and manage cultural heritage using HDPP for the promotion of heritage building preservation in Alexandria. Results: The results show that the application of HDPP has led to the creation of a digital database about the Société Immobilière building, which was chosen as a case study for this research. Conclusions: Implementation of HDPP and usage of new documentation methods i.e., VR and WHD create a digital path to help strengthen its image and connect the place to users, recreational areas are created to communicate and explore the city’s architectural history.

                Background: Nocturia is a urological condition in which individuals urinate more frequently than usual at night and it affects both genders. The clinician frequently uses questionnaires to diagnose nocturia however, some validated questions were in English. This study evaluated the validity of the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire – Nocturia (ICIQ-N) in Indonesian patients. Methods: Two certified bilinguals (English-Indonesian) translated the ICIQ-N questionnaire from English to Indonesian. The reverse translation was done by two certified bilingual (Indonesian-English) translators, and the writers reviewed all of the translations leading to the final Indonesian translation. Instead of a linguistic translation, this technique ensured a thorough and unambiguous intellectual translation. The translated ICIQ-N was presented twice to the subjects, two weeks apart, to verify the questionnaire. The responses' validity and reliability were then investigated. Pearson and Cronbach’s alpha analysis were used to determine validity and reliability. Results: The r-Pearson correlation values ranged from 0.933 to 1 (p:0.001). The translated ICIQ-N questioner items were found to be reliable with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.994 (>0.6). Conclusions: The ICIQ-N Indonesian version generated for this study is valid and reliable. As a result, it may be utilized as a diagnostic tool in Indonesian population.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">ENA Source Attribute Helper: An Application Programming Interface to facilitate accurate reference to biological source data [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Metadata attributes of sequences that accurately reference their biological sources, as specimens or other materials of origin, and link with natural history collections, are essential to facilitate the connections between different fields in life sciences and promote reusability of data. However, metadata used to reference the biological source of sequences available within the molecular data repositories are not always well structured or comprehensive. Methods: Within the scope of the Horizon 2020 project Biodiversity Community Integrated Knowledge Library (BiCIKL), we have developed a tool, the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) Source Attribute Helper Application Programming Interface (API), to help users accurately report biological source-related sequence and sample attributes. This tool currently focuses on the attributes in which specimens, cultures or other materials are identified, from which the sequence data were derived, and uses curated data to obtain the unique codes for the institutions and collections holding the vouchers. The API's main functions include the presentation of metadata associated with queried institutions or collections, validation of institution and collection codes in the attribute strings provided by the user, and the construction of an attribute string based on user-entered data. The API does not however support the search of voucher specimen codes, as these need to be obtained directly from the voucher institutions. We describe the API and discuss use cases for its different endpoints. The API is available at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/sah/api/. Conclusions: We expect the API to promote and support the initial submission and any subsequent curation of biological source attributes, and hereby contribute to better links between sequence data and natural history collections, and hence on to taxonomy and biodiversity research, towards increasing the discoverability, reusability and impact of data.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Neuroprotection of Low Frequency Repetitive TMS after Ischemic Stroke in Rats</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Stroke is a leading cause of human death and disability. Effective early treatments with reasonable therapeutic windows remain critically important to improve the outcomes of stroke. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an established non-invasive technique that has been applied clinically and in animal research for multiple brain disorders, but few studies examined acute neuroprotection against ischemic stroke. The present investigation tested the novel approach of low frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS) as an acute treatment after ischemic stroke.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Adult male rats received a focal ischemic surgery through occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery for 60 min. The rats received either rTMS or sham treatment with 1.5, 3, 4, or 7 hrs delay after the onset of stroke. Low frequency and low intensity rTMS was applied to the rat brain for two 30-min episodes separated by 1-hr interval.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Three days after stroke, compared to stroke controls, rats receiving rTMS treatment with a 1.5 hr-delay showed a 35% reduction of infarct volume. Protective effects were also seen with 3- or 4-hr delayed treatments by rTMS, shown as reduced infarct volume and cell death. RTMS treatment upregulated the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 and downregulated the pro-apoptotic caspase-3 cleavage, expressions of Bax and MMP-9. In sensorimotor functional assessments 3-21 days after stroke, rats receiving rTMS treatment with a 1.5- or 3-hr delay showed significantly better performance compared to stroke controls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results support the inference that low frequency rTMS may be feasible as a neuroprotective acute treatment after ischemic stroke.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Dietary-protein sources modulate host susceptibility to Clostridioides difficile infection through the gut microbiota</a></h4>

              
                Susceptibility to Clostridioides difficile infection is influenced by gut microbiota and diet. Yakabe et al. demonstrate that soy protein promotes the growth of C. difficile by enhancing the intestinal levels of amino acids (aas). Furthermore, soy protein enhances the relative abundance of Lactobacillus, which digests soy protein to generate aas.

                Kathania et al. show that Pak2, a Ser/Thr kinase, associates with RORγt and phosphorylates Ser-316 of RORγt. Deletion of Pak2 in Th17 cells enhances IL-17 expression and colitis severity. Pak2-mediated phosphorylation causes a conformational change resulting in increased ubiquitination of RORγt by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch.

                Zhu et al. report that in mammary tumors, adipocytes undergo metabolic reprograming and de-differentiation. They acquire myofibroblast- and macrophage-like features, a process referred to as “adipocyte mesenchymal transition,” which modifies the tumor microenvironment via ECM remodeling and activation of the immune response and likely contributes to tumor progression.

                Teranishi et al. show the mechanism involved in selective autophagy recognizing and removing damaged lysosomes, termed lysophagy. The CUL4A-DDB1-WDFY1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex mediates K48-linked poly-ubiquitination of LAMP2 upon lysosomal damage, which recruits the autophagic machinery. These findings reveal how cells selectively tag damaged lysosomes to initiate lysophagy.

                Theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TBS) has become a standard non-invasive technique to induce offline changes in cortical excitability in human volunteers. Yet, TBS suffers from a high variability across subjects. A better knowledge about how TBS affects neural activity in vivo could uncover its mechanisms of action and ultimately allow its mainstream use in basic science and clinical applications. To address this issue, we applied continuous TBS (cTBS, 300 pulses) in awake behaving rhesus monkeys and quantified its after-effects on neuronal activity. Overall, we observed a pronounced, long-lasting, and highly reproducible reduction in neuronal excitability after cTBS in individual parietal neurons, with some neurons also exhibiting periods of hyperexcitability during the recovery phase. These results provide the first experimental evidence of the effects of cTBS on single neurons in awake behaving monkeys, shedding new light on the reasons underlying cTBS variability.

                <i>Plasmodium falciparum,</i> the causative agent of malaria, remains a global health threat as parasites continue to develop resistance to antimalarial drugs used throughout the world. Accordingly, drugs with novel modes of action are desperately required to combat malaria. <i>P. falciparum</i> parasites infect human red blood cells where they digest the host’s main protein constituent, hemoglobin. Leucine aminopeptidase <i>Pf</i>A-M17 is one of several aminopeptidases that have been implicated in the last step of this digestive pathway. Here, we use both reverse genetics and a compound specifically designed to inhibit the activity of <i>Pf</i>A-M17 to show that <i>Pf</i>A-M17 is essential for <i>P. falciparum</i> survival as it provides parasites with free amino acids for growth, many of which are highly likely to originate from hemoglobin. We further show that loss of <i>Pf</i>A-M17 results in parasites exhibiting multiple digestive vacuoles at the trophozoite stage. In contrast to other hemoglobin-degrading proteases that have overlapping redundant functions, we validate <i>Pf</i>A-M17 as a potential novel drug target.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Controllability boosts neural and cognitive signatures of changes-of-mind in uncertain environments</a></h4>

              
                In uncertain environments, seeking information about alternative choice options is essential for adaptive learning and decision-making. However, information seeking is usually confounded with changes-of-mind about the reliability of the preferred option. Here, we exploited the fact that information seeking requires control over which option to sample to isolate its behavioral and neurophysiological signatures. We found that changes-of-mind occurring with control require more evidence against the current option, are associated with reduced confidence, but are nevertheless more likely to be confirmed on the next decision. Multimodal neurophysiological recordings showed that these changes-of-mind are preceded by stronger activation of the dorsal attention network in magnetoencephalography, and followed by increased pupil-linked arousal during the presentation of decision outcomes. Together, these findings indicate that information seeking increases the saliency of evidence perceived as the direct consequence of one’s own actions.

Intercropping is generally implemented using commercial seeds that were bred for maximal productivity in monocultures, thereby ignoring the ability of plants to adapt over generations to the surrounding neighbourhood, notably through increased complementarity, i.e. reduced competition or increased facilitation. This is why using monoculture-adapted seeds for intercropping might limit the benefits of crop diversity on yield. However, the adaptation potential of crops and the corresponding changes in complementarity have not been explored in annual crop systems. Here we show that plant-plant interactions among annual crops shifted towards reduced competition and/or increased facilitation when the plants were growing in the same community type as their parents did in the previous two generations. Total yield did not respond to this common coexistence history, but in fertilized conditions, we observed increased overyielding in mixtures with a common coexistence history. Surprisingly, we observed character convergence between species sharing the same coexistence history for two generations, in monocultures but also in mixtures: the six crop species tested converged towards taller phenotypes with lower leaf dry matter content. This study provides the first empirical evidence for the potential of parental diversity affecting plant-plant interactions, species complementarity and therefore potentially ecosystem functioning of the following generations in annual cropping systems. Although further studies are required to assess the context-dependence of these results, our findings may still have important implications for diversified agriculture as they illustrate the potential of targeted cultivars to increase complementarity of species in intercropping, which could be achieved through specific breeding for mixtures.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">BRCA2 BRC missense variants disrupt RAD51-dependent DNA repair</a></h4>

              
                Pathogenic mutations in the BRCA2 tumor suppressor gene predispose to breast, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, and other cancers. BRCA2 maintains genome stability through homology-directed repair (HDR) of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and replication fork protection. Nonsense or frameshift mutations leading to truncation of the BRCA2 protein are typically considered pathogenic, however, missense mutations resulting in single amino acid substitutions can be challenging to functionally interpret. The majority of missense mutations in BRCA2 have been classified as Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS) with unknown functional consequences. In this study, we identified three BRCA2 VUS located within the BRC repeat region to determine their impact on canonical HDR and fork protection functions. We provide evidence that S1221P and T1980I, which map to conserved residues in the BRC2 and BRC7 repeats, compromise the cellular response to chemotherapeutics and ionizing radiation, and display deficits in fork protection. We further demonstrate biochemically that S1221P and T1980I disrupt RAD51 binding and diminish the ability of BRCA2 to stabilize RAD51-ssDNA complexes. The third variant, T1346I, located within the spacer region between BRC2 and BRC3 repeats, is fully functional. We conclude that T1346I is a benign allele whereas S1221P and T1980I are hypomorphic disrupting the ability of BRCA2 to fully engage and stabilize RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments. Our results underscore the importance of correctly classifying BRCA2 VUS as pathogenic variants can impact both future cancer risk and guide therapy selection during cancer treatment.

                Physician-scientists have epitomized the blending of deep, rigorous impactful curiosity with broad attention to human health for centuries. While we aspire to prepare all physicians with an appreciation for these skills, those who apply them to push the understanding of the boundaries of human physiology and disease, to advance treatments, and to increase our knowledge base in the arena of human health can fulfill an essential space for our society, economies, and overall well-being. Working arm in arm with basic and translational scientists as well as expert clinicians, as peers in both groups, this career additionally serves as a bridge to facilitate the pace and direction of research that ultimately impacts health. Globally, there are remarkable similarities in challenges in this career path, and in the approaches employed to overcome them. Herein, we review how different countries train physician-scientists and suggest strategies to further bolster this career path.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Isometric spiracular scaling in scarab beetles: implications for diffusive and advective oxygen transport</a></h4>

              
                The scaling of respiratory structures has been hypothesized to be a major driving factor in the evolution of many aspects of animal physiology. Here we provide the first assessment of the scaling of the spiracles in insects using ten scarab beetle species differing 180x in mass, including some of the most massive extant insect species. Using X-ray microtomography, we measured the cross-sectional area and depth of all eight spiracles, enabling the calculation of their diffusive and advective capacities. Each of these metrics scaled with geometric isometry. Because diffusive capacities scale with lower slopes than metabolic rates, the largest beetles measured require 10-fold higher PO2 gradients across the spiracles to sustain metabolism by diffusion compared to the smallest species. Large beetles can exchange sufficient oxygen for resting metabolism by diffusion across the spiracles, but not during flight. In contrast, spiracular advective capacities scale similarly or more steeply than metabolic rates, so spiracular advective capacities should match or exceed respiratory demands in the largest beetles. These data illustrate a general principle of gas exchange: scaling of respiratory transport structures with geometric isometry diminishes the potential for diffusive gas exchange but enhances advective capacities; combining such structural scaling with muscle-driven ventilation allows larger animals to achieve high metabolic rates when active.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Innexin function dictates the spatial relationship between distal somatic cells in the Caenorhabditis elegans gonad without impacting the germline stem cell pool</a></h4>

              
                Gap-junctional signaling mediates myriad cellular interactions in metazoans. Yet, how gap junctions control the positioning of cells in organs is not well understood. Innexins compose gap junctions in invertebrates and affect organ architecture. Here, we investigate the roles of gap-junctions in controlling distal somatic gonad architecture and its relationship to underlying germline stem cells in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We show that a reduction of soma–germline gap-junctional activity causes displacement of distal sheath cells (Sh1) towards the distal end of the gonad. We confirm, by live imaging, transmission electron microscopy, and antibody staining, that bare regions—lacking somatic gonadal cell coverage of germ cells—are present between the distal tip cell (DTC) and Sh1, and we show that an innexin fusion protein used in a prior study encodes an antimorphic gap junction subunit that mispositions Sh1. We determine that, contrary to the model put forth in the prior study based on this fusion protein, Sh1 mispositioning does not markedly alter the position of the borders of the stem cell pool nor of the progenitor cell pool. Together, these results demonstrate that gap junctions can control the position of Sh1, but that Sh1 position is neither relevant for GLP-1/Notch signaling nor for the exit of germ cells from the stem cell pool.

                The rapid development of new imaging approaches is generating larger and more complex datasets, revealing the time evolution of individual cells and biomolecules. Single-molecule techniques, in particular, provide access to rare intermediates in complex, multistage molecular pathways. However, few standards exist for processing these information-rich datasets, posing challenges for wider dissemination. Here, we present Mars, an open-source platform for storing and processing image-derived properties of biomolecules. Mars provides Fiji/ImageJ2 commands written in Java for common single-molecule analysis tasks using a Molecule Archive architecture that is easily adapted to complex, multistep analysis workflows. Three diverse workflows involving molecule tracking, multichannel fluorescence imaging, and force spectroscopy, demonstrate the range of analysis applications. A comprehensive graphical user interface written in JavaFX enhances biomolecule feature exploration by providing charting, tagging, region highlighting, scriptable dashboards, and interactive image views. The interoperability of ImageJ2 ensures Molecule Archives can easily be opened in multiple environments, including those written in Python using PyImageJ, for interactive scripting and visualization. Mars provides a flexible solution for reproducible analysis of image-derived properties, facilitating the discovery and quantitative classification of new biological phenomena with an open data format accessible to everyone.

                Low complexity regions (LCRs) play a role in a variety of important biological processes, yet we lack a unified view of their sequences, features, relationships, and functions. Here, we use dotplots and dimensionality reduction to systematically define LCR type/copy relationships and create a map of LCR sequence space capable of integrating LCR features and functions. By defining LCR relationships across the proteome, we provide insight into how LCR type and copy number contribute to higher order assemblies, such as the importance of K-rich LCR copy number for assembly of the nucleolar protein RPA43 in vivo and in vitro. With LCR maps, we reveal the underlying structure of LCR sequence space, and relate differential occupancy in this space to the conservation and emergence of higher order assemblies, including the metazoan extracellular matrix and plant cell wall. Together, LCR relationships and maps uncover and identify scaffold-client relationships among E-rich LCR-containing proteins in the nucleolus, and revealed previously undescribed regions of LCR sequence space with signatures of higher order assemblies, including a teleost-specific T/H-rich sequence space. Thus, this unified view of LCRs enables discovery of how LCRs encode higher order assemblies of organisms.

                How does binge drinking alcohol change synaptic function, and do these changes maintain binge consumption? The anterior insular cortex (AIC) and dorsolateral striatum (DLS) are brain regions implicated in alcohol use disorder. In male, but not female mice, we found that binge drinking alcohol produced glutamatergic synaptic adaptations selective to AIC inputs within the DLS. Photoexciting AIC→DLS circuitry in male mice during binge drinking decreased alcohol, but not water consumption and altered alcohol drinking mechanics. Further, drinking mechanics alone from drinking session data predicted alcohol-related circuit changes. AIC→DLS manipulation did not alter operant, valence, or anxiety-related behaviors. These findings suggest that alcohol-mediated changes at AIC inputs govern behavioral sequences that maintain binge drinking and may serve as a circuit-based biomarker for the development of alcohol use disorder.

                Lysosomes are essential for cellular recycling, nutrient signaling, autophagy, and pathogenic bacteria and viruses invasion. Lysosomal fusion is fundamental to cell survival and requires HOPS, a conserved heterohexameric tethering complex. On the membranes to be fused, HOPS binds small membrane-associated GTPases and assembles SNAREs for fusion, but how the complex fulfills its function remained speculative. Here, we used cryo-electron microscopy to reveal the structure of HOPS. Unlike previously reported, significant flexibility of HOPS is confined to its extremities, where GTPase binding occurs. The SNARE-binding module is firmly attached to the core, therefore, ideally positioned between the membranes to catalyze fusion. Our data suggest a model for how HOPS fulfills its dual functionality of tethering and fusion and indicate why it is an essential part of the membrane fusion machinery.

                The evolution of multicellular life cycles is a central process in the course of the emergence of multicellularity. The simplest multicellular life cycle is comprised of the growth of the propagule into a colony and its fragmentation to give rise to new propagules. The majority of theoretical models assume selection among life cycles to be driven by internal properties of multicellular groups, resulting in growth competition. At the same time, the influence of interactions between groups on the evolution of life cycles is rarely even considered. Here, we present a model of colonial life cycle evolution taking into account group interactions. Our work shows that the outcome of evolution could be coexistence between multiple life cycles or that the outcome may depend on the initial state of the population – scenarios impossible without group interactions. At the same time, we found that some results of these simpler models remain relevant: evolutionary stable strategies in our model are restricted to binary fragmentation – the same class of life cycles that contains all evolutionarily optimal life cycles in the model without interactions. Our results demonstrate that while models neglecting interactions can capture short-term dynamics, they fall short in predicting the population-scale picture of evolution.

                Here we follow the call to target measurement reliability as a key prerequisite for individual-level predictions in translational neuroscience by investigating i) longitudinal reliability at the individual and ii) group level, iii) internal consistency and iv) response predictability across experimental phases. 120 individuals performed a fear conditioning paradigm twice six months apart. Analyses of skin conductance responses, fear ratings and BOLD-fMRI with different data transformations and included numbers of trials were conducted. While longitudinal reliability was rather limited at the individual level, it was comparatively higher for acquisition but not extinction at the group-level. Internal consistency was satisfactory. Higher responding in preceding phases predicted higher responding in subsequent experimental phases at a weak to moderate level depending on data specifications. In sum, the results suggest that while individual-level predictions are meaningful for (very) short time frames, they also call for more attention to measurement properties in the field.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Regulation of oligodendrocyte lineage development by VAMP2/3 in the developing mouse spinal cord</a></h4>

              
                In the developing and adult CNS, new oligodendrocytes (OLs) are generated from a population of cells known as oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). As they begin to differentiate, OPCs undergo a series of highly regulated changes to morphology, gene expression, and membrane organization. This stage represents a critical bottleneck in oligodendrogenesis, and the regulatory program that guides it is still not fully understood. Here we show that in vivo toxin-mediated cleavage of the vesicle associated SNARE proteins VAMP2/3 in the OL lineage of both male and female mice impairs the ability of early OLs to mature into functional, myelinating OLs. In the developing mouse spinal cord, many VAMP2/3-deficient OLs appeared to stall in the premyelinating, early OL stage, resulting in an overall loss of both myelin density and OL number. The Src kinase Fyn, a key regulator of oligodendrogenesis and myelination, is highly expressed among premyelinating OLs, but its expression decreases as OLs mature. We found that OLs lacking VAMP2/3 in the spinal cord white matter showed significantly higher expression of Fyn compared to neighboring control cells, potentially due to an extended premyelinating stage. Overall, our results show that functional VAMP2/3 in OL lineage cells is essential for proper myelin formation and plays a major role in controlling the maturation and terminal differentiation of premyelinating OLs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Time-resolved dynamic computational modeling of human EEG recordings reveals gradients of generative mechanisms for the MMN response</a></h4>

              
                Despite attempts to unify the different theoretical accounts of the mismatch negativity (MMN), there is still an ongoing debate on the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this complex brain response. On one hand, neuronal adaptation to recurrent stimuli is able to explain many of the observed properties of the MMN, such as its sensitivity to controlled experimental parameters. On the other hand, several modeling studies reported evidence in favor of Bayesian learning models for explaining the trial-to-trial dynamics of the human MMN. However, direct comparisons of these two main hypotheses are scarce, and previous modeling studies suffered from methodological limitations. Based on reports indicating spatial and temporal dissociation of physiological mechanisms within the timecourse of mismatch responses in animals, we hypothesized that different computational models would best fit different temporal phases of the human MMN. Using electroencephalographic data from two independent studies of a simple auditory oddball task (n = 82), we compared adaptation and Bayesian learning models ability to explain the sequential dynamics of auditory deviance detection in a time-resolved fashion. We first ran simulations to evaluate the capacity of our design to dissociate the tested models and found that they were sufficiently distinguishable above a certain level of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In subjects with a sufficient SNR, our time-resolved approach revealed a temporal dissociation between the two model families, with high evidence for adaptation during the early MMN window (from 90 to 150-190 ms post-stimulus depending on the dataset) and for Bayesian learning later in time (170-180 ms or 200-220ms). In addition, Bayesian model averaging of fixed-parameter models within the adaptation family revealed a gradient of adaptation rates, resembling the anatomical gradient in the auditory cortical hierarchy reported in animal studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential role of dopamine D3 receptor through balanced modulation of Akt/mTOR and ERK1/2 activity in the reactivation of cocaine rewarding memories evoked by psychological versus physiological stress</a></h4>

              
                Stress is an important trigger of relapses in cocaine use. These relapses engage the activity of memory-related nuclei, such as the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the dentate gyrus (DG). Further, preclinical research signals D3 receptor (D3R) antagonists as promising therapeutic tools to attenuate cocaine reward and relapse. Therefore, we assessed the effect of SB-277011-A, a D3R antagonist, in the activity of Akt/mTOR and MEK/ERK1/2 pathways in these areas during the reinstatement of cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) evoked by psychological (restraint) and physiological (tail pinch) stress. Both stimuli reactivated the extinguished cocaine-CPP, but only restrained animals decreased their locomotor activity during reinstatement. Moreover, p-Akt, p-mTOR and p-ERK1/2 activity in the BLA and DG of restrained animals decreased during the reactivation of cocaine memories, contrasting to tail-pinched mice. While D3R blockade prevented stress-induced CPP reactivation and plasmatic corticosterone enhancement, SB-277011-A distinctly modulated Akt, mTOR and ERK1/2 activities in the BLA and DG based on the stressor and the dose of antagonist. Corticosterone may be partially responsible for these variations as we found high correlations among its levels and mTOR and/or Akt activity in the BLA and DG of restrained animals receiving SB-277011-A. Besides, locomotor activity of animals receiving 48 mg/kg of the antagonist highly correlated with p-mTOR/mTOR and p-ERK1/2 /ERK1/2 in the BLA during restraint- and tail pinch-induced relapse in cocaine-CPP, respectively. Hence, our study endorses D3R antagonists as therapeutic tools to prevent stress-induced relapses in drug use through a complex balance of Akt/mTOR and MEK/ERK1/2 pathways in memory-processing brain nuclei.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The perception of auditory motion in sighted and early blind individuals</a></h4>

              
                Motion detection is a fundamental property of the visual system that plays an important role across many of the human senses. In vision, motion processing is classically described using a motion energy model which assumes spatiotemporally selective (i.e., non-separable) filters that capture the smooth continuous change in spatial position over time afforded by moving objects. However, in the case of audition, it is still not clear whether or not the primary mechanisms underlying motion sensitivity are spatiotemporally selective. We used a psychophysical reverse correlation paradigm, where participants discriminated the direction of a motion signal in the presence of spatiotemporal noise, to determine whether the filters underlying auditory motion discrimination were spatiotemporally separable or non-separable. We then examined whether these auditory motion filters were altered as a result of early blindness. We found that both sighted and early blind individuals have separable filters. However, early blind individuals show increased sensitivity to auditory motion, with reduced susceptibility to noise, with filters that were more accurate in detecting motion onsets/offsets. An ideal observer model suggested that the reliance on separable filters may be more optimal given the limited spatial resolution in auditory input.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Practical scan-length considerations for mapping upper limb movements to the somatosensory/motor cortex at 7T</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between motor cortex (M1) and upper limb movements has been investigated extensively using functional MRI (fMRI). While most research has focused on applications, very few studies have focused on practical aspects related to developing the fMRI protocol. Thus, the effect of scan length on M1 activations during various upper limb movements remains unclear. Scan length constraints are important for conducting motor experiments within a 60- or 90-min scan session. We targeted this gap by studying 7T fMRI activations in a male participant while performing eight different upper limb movements (of the fingers, wrist, and elbow) across 16 task runs (8 with the left arm, 8 with the right arm, 88 mins total fMRI duration). Standard activation analyses were performed (Z>3.1, p<0.01, cluster thresholded) independently for 14 different cases (2 runs through 8 runs, left and right arm) and compared. We found diminishing returns with higher number of runs (activations gradually plateaued with runs). We observed two clusters of movements, one with generally higher activation (more activated voxels and higher Z-stats) and the other with lower activation. To achieve similar statistical power, movements with lower activation required longer scanning (more runs). Based on these observations, we propose a - one size does not fit all - practical protocol within a 60-, 75-, or 90- min scan session, wherein different number of runs are assigned for different movements. Our study could benefit researchers who are designing upper limb fMRI experiments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Subtype-specific roles of ellipsoid body ring neurons in sleep regulation in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                The ellipsoid body (EB) is a major structure of the central complex of the Drosophila melanogaster brain. 22 subtypes of EB ring neurons have been identified based on anatomical and morphological characteristics with light-level microscopy and EM connectomics. A few studies have associated ring neurons with the regulation of sleep homeostasis and structure. However, cell type-specific and population interactions in the regulation of sleep remain unclear. Employing a unbiased thermogenetic screen of collected EB drivers, we found: 1) multiple ring neurons are involved in the modulation of amount of sleep and structure in a synergistic manner; 2) analysis of data for {triangleup}P(doze)/ {triangleup}P(wake) using a mixed Gaussian model detected 5 clusters of GAL4 drivers which had similar effects on sleep pressure and/or depth: lines driving arousal contained R4m neurons, whereas lines that increased sleep pressure had R3m cells; 3) a general linear model analysis correlating ring cell subtype and activity-dependent changes in sleep parameters across all the lines identified several cell types significantly associated with specific sleep effects: R3p for daytime sleep promotion, and R4m for nighttime wake-promoting; and 4) another subclass, R3d cells present in 5HT7-GAL4+ neurons and in GAL4 lines from our screen which exclusively affect sleep structure, were found to contribute to fragmentation of sleep during both day and night. Thus, multiple subtypes of ring neurons distinctively control sleep amount and/or structure, and the unique highly interconnected structure of the EB and its connections with other regions of brain suggest a local-network model worth future investigation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Two gustatory receptors involved in host plant recognition of silkworm larvae</a></h4>

              
                Herbivorous insects can identify their host plants by sensing plant secondary metabolites as chemical cues. We previously reported the two-factor host acceptance system of the silkworm Bombyx mori larvae. The chemosensory neurons in the maxillary palp (MP) of the larvae detect mulberry secondary metabolites, chlorogenic acid (CGA), and isoquercitrin (ISQ), with ultrahigh sensitivity, for host plant recognition and feeding initiation. Nevertheless, the molecular basis for the ultrasensitive sensing of these compounds remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that two gustatory receptors (Grs), BmGr6 and BmGr9, are responsible for sensing the mulberry compounds with attomolar sensitivity for host plant recognition by silkworm larvae. Calcium imaging assay using cultured cells expressing the silkworm putative sugar receptors (BmGr4-10) revealed that BmGr6 and BmGr9 serve as receptors for CGA and ISQ with attomolar sensitivity in human embryonic kidney 293T cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout (KO) of BmGr6 and BmGr9 resulted in a low probability of making a test bite of the mulberry leaves, suggesting that they lost the ability to recognize host leaves specifically. Electrophysiological recordings showed that the loss of host recognition ability in the Gr-KO strains was due to a drastic decrease in MP sensitivity toward ISQ in BmGr6-KO larvae and toward CGA and ISQ in BmGr9-KO larvae. Our findings unraveled that the two Grs, which have been regarded as sugar receptors, are molecules responsible for detecting plant phenolics in host plant recognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Roles of the 5-HT2C receptor on zebrafish sociality</a></h4>

              
                Serotonin (5-HT) receptors have been implicated in social behavior in vertebrates. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have been increasingly being used behavioral neuroscience to study the neurobiological correlates of behavior, including sociality. Nonetheless, the role of 5-HT2C receptors in different social functions were not yet studied in this species. Zebrafish were treated with the agonist MK-212 (2 mg/kg) or the antagonist RS-102221 (2 mg/kg) and tested in the social interaction and social novelty tests, conditional approach test, or mirror-induced aggressive displays. MK-212 increased preference for an unknown conspecific in the social investigation test, but also increased preference for the known conspecific in the social novelty test; RS-102221, on the other hand, decreased preference in the social investigation test but increased preference for the novel conspecific in the social novelty test. MK-212 also decreased predator inspection in the conditional approach test. While RS-102221 decreased time in the display zone in the mirror-induced aggressive display test, it increased display duration. Overall, these results demonstrate the complex role of 5-HT2C receptors in different social contexts in zebrafish, revealing a participation in social plasticity in vertebrates.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Methamphetamine Self-Administration Differential Effects on Mesolimbic Glutathione Levels, Mitochondrial Respiration, and Dopamine Neuron Firing Activity</a></h4>

              
                Acute and neurotoxic regimens of METH are known to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS), affect redox homeostasis, and lead to cellular damage in dopamine neurons. However, functional changes induced by long-term METH self-administration on mitochondrial respiratory metabolism and redox homeostasis are less known. To fill this gap in our knowledge, we implanted adult mice with a jugular catheter and trained them to nose poke for METH infusions in operant chambers. After completing several weeks of METH self-administration exposure, we collected samples of the ventral striatum (vSTR) and the ventral midbrain (vMB), containing the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), respectively. We used HPLC to determine the levels of the ROS scavenger glutathione in its reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) forms. Then, we used high-resolution respirometry to determine the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of mitochondrial complexes under several substrates and inhibitors. Finally, we used in vivo single-unit extracellular recordings to assess changes in dopamine neuron firing activity in the VTA. METH self-administration produces a progressive decrease of the GSH pool in vST, which correlates with METH lifetime intake. We observed increased mitochondrial respiration across the two mesolimbic regions, but only vMB OCR correlates with METH lifetime intake. We recorded an increased number of spontaneously active dopamine neurons with decreased firing rate and burst activity in the VTA. METH lifetime intake inversely correlates with firing rate, the percentage of spikes in a burst, and directly correlates with the number of neurons per track. We conclude that METH self-administration progressively decreased the antioxidant pool in sites of higher dopamine release and produced an increased mitochondrial metabolism in the mesolimbic areas, probably derived from the increased number of dopamine neurons actively firing. However, dopamine neuron firing activity is decreased by METH self-administration, reflecting a new basal level of dopamine neurotransmission in response to the prolonged effects of METH on dopamine release and circuitry feedback.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The individual vulnerability to develop compulsive adjunctive behavior is associated with the recruitment of activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) within the Locus Coeruleus</a></h4>

              
                Some compulsive disorders have been considered to stem from the loss of control over coping strategies, such as displacement. However, the cellular mechanisms involved in the acquisition of coping behaviors and their ensuing compulsive manifestation in vulnerable individuals have not been elucidated. Considering the role of the locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenaline dependent system in stress and related excessive behaviors, we hypothesised that neuroplastic changes in the LC may be involved in the acquisition of an adjunctive polydipsic water drinking, a prototypical displacement behavior, and the subsequent development of compulsion in vulnerable individuals. Thus, male Sprague Dawley rats were characterised for their tendency, or not, to develop compulsive polydipsic drinking in a schedule-induced polydipsia (SIP) procedure before their fresh brains were harvested. A new quantification tool for RNAscope assays revealed that the development of compulsive adjunctive behavior was associated with a low mRNA copy number of the plasticity marker Arc in the LC which appeared to be driven by specific adaptations in an ensemble of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)+, zif268- neurons. This ensemble was specifically engaged by the expression of compulsive adjunctive behavior, not by stress, because its functional recruitment was not observed in individuals that no longer had access to the water bottle before sacrifice while it consistently correlated with the levels of polydipsic water drinking only when it had become compulsive. Together these findings suggest that downregulation of Arc mRNA levels in a population of a TH+zif268- LC neurons represents a signature of the tendency to develop compulsive coping behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Subthreshold serotonin signals combined by the G proteins Gαq and Gαs activate the C. elegans egg-laying muscles</a></h4>

              
                Individual neuron or muscle cells express many G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) for neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. It remains unclear how these cells integrate multiple GPCR signals that all must act through the same few G proteins. We investigated how two serotonin GPCRs, Gq-coupled SER-1 and Gs-coupled SER-7, function together on the C. elegans egg-laying muscles to promote contraction and thus cause eggs to be laid. Using receptor null mutations and cell-specific knockdowns, we found that serotonin signaling through either SER-1/Gq or SER-7/Gs alone does not induce egg laying, but these subthreshold signals can combine to promote egg laying. However, using designer receptors or optogenetics to artificially induce high levels of either Gq signaling or Gs signaling in the muscles was sufficient to induce egg laying. Conversely, knocking down both Gq and Gs in the egg-laying muscle cells induced egg-laying defects stronger than those of a ser-7 ser-1 double knockout. These results suggest that, in the egg-laying muscles, multiple GPCRs for serotonin and other signals each produce weak effects that individually do not result in strong behavioral outcomes. However, they can combine to produce sufficient levels of Gq and Gs signaling to promote muscle activity and egg laying.

                Activity-induced changes in protein palmitoylation can regulate the plasticity of synaptic connections, critically impacting learning and memory. Palmitoylation is a reversible post-translational modification regulated by both palmitoyl-acyl transferases that mediate palmitoylation and palmitoyl thioesterases that depalmitoylate proteins. However, it is not clear how fluctuations in synaptic activity can mediate the dynamic palmitoylation of neuronal proteins. Using primary hippocampal cultures, we demonstrate that synaptic activity does not impact the transcription of palmitoylating / depalmitoylating enzymes, changes in thioesterase activity, nor post-translational modification of the depalmitoylating enzymes, ABHD17 and APT2. In contrast, synaptic activity does mediate post-translational modification of the palmitoylating enzymes ZDHHC2, ZDHHC5, and ZDHHC9 (but not ZDHHC8) to influence protein-protein interaction, enzyme stability and enzyme function. Post-translational modifications of ZDHHC enzymes were also observed in the hippocampus following fear conditioning. Together, our findings demonstrate that signaling events activated by synaptic activity largely impact activity of the ZDHHC family of palmitoyl-acyl transferases with less influence on the activity of palmitoyl thioesterases.

                In mammalian cortex, feedforward excitatory connections recruit feedforward inhibition. This is often carried by parvalbumin (PV+) interneurons, which may densely connect to local pyramidal (Pyr) neurons. Whether this inhibition affects all local excitatory cells indiscriminately or is targeted to specific subnetworks is unknown. Here, we test how feedforward inhibition is recruited by using 2-channel circuit mapping to excite cortical and thalamic inputs to PV+ interneurons and Pyr neurons in female and male mouse motor cortex. Single Pyr and PV+ neurons receive input from both cortex and thalamus. Connected pairs of PV+ interneurons and excitatory Pyr neurons receive correlated cortical and thalamic inputs. While PV+ interneurons are more likely to form local connections to Pyr neurons, Pyr neurons are much more likely to form reciprocal connections with PV+ interneurons that inhibit them. This suggests that Pyr neurons are embedded in local subnetworks. Excitatory inputs to M1 can thus target inhibitory networks in a specific pattern which permits recruitment of feedforward inhibition to specific subnetworks within the cortical column.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Network controllability measures of subnetworks: implications for neurosciences</a></h4>

              
                Recent progress in network sciences has made it possible to apply key findings from control theory to the study of networks. Referred to as network control theory, this framework describes how the interactions between interconnected system elements and external energy sources, potentially constrained by different optimality criteria, result in complex network behavior. A typical example is the quantification of the functional role certain brain regions or symptoms play in shaping the temporal dynamics of brain activity or the clinical course of a disease, a property that is quantified in terms of the so-called controllability metrics. Critically though, contrary to the engineering context in which control theory was originally developed, a mathematical understanding of the network nodes and connections in neurosciences cannot be assumed. For instance, in the case of psychological systems such as those studied to understand the psychiatric disorders, a potentially large set variables are unknown. As such, while the measures offered by network control theory would be mathematically correct, in that they can be calculated with high precision, they could have little translational values with respect to their putative role suggested by controllability metrics. It is therefore critical to understand if and how the controllability metrics computer over subnetworks would deviate, if access to the complete set of variables, as in neurosciences, cannot be taken for granted. In this paper, we use a host of simulations based on synthetic as well as structural MRI data to study the potential deviation of controllability metrics in sub- compared to the full networks. Specifically, we estimate average- and modal-controllability, two of the most widely used controllability measures in neurosciences, in a large number of settings where we systematically vary network type, network size, and edge density. We find out, across all network types we test, that average and modal controllability are systematically, either over- or underestimated depending on the number of nodes in the sub- and full network and the edge density. Finally, we provide a formal theoretical proof that our observations generalize to any network type and discuss the ramifications of this systematic bias and potential solutions to alleviate the problem.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Programmable Model for Exploring the Functional Logic of the Drosophila Antennal Lobe</a></h4>

              
                Recent progress on connectomics has resulted in huge datasets of brain structures in single-synapse scale. This calls for the modeling of executable circuits to discover the functional logic of these neural circuits in different scales. To provide an approach to standardize analyses of neuropils with multiple-input-multi-output channels, we put forward a programming model focusing on the antennal lobe (AL), a circuit at the periphery of the olfactory system with nonlinear computation. We present an approach for constructing and analyzing antennal lobe circuits using models of glomeruli and local feedback loops. We establish the composability of the connectivity of glomeruli with local neuron feedback loops by combining pairs of glomeruli, and then by combining all glomeruli together to characterize the I/O of the entire AL. We thus provide a methodology for the quantitative characterization of the I/O of the AL as a function of feedback loop motifs.

                Astrocytes are key cellular regulators within the brain. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is implicated in fear memory processing, yet most research has entirely focused on neuronal mechanisms, despite a significant body of work implicating astrocytes in learning and memory. In the present study, we used in vivo fiber photometry to record from amygdalar astrocytes across fear learning, recall, and three separate periods of extinction. We found that BLA astrocytes robustly responded to foot-shocks during acquisition, that their activity remained remarkably elevated across days in comparison to unshocked control animals, and that their increased activity persisted throughout extinction. Further, we found that astrocytes responded to the initiation and termination of freezing bouts during contextual recall, and this behavior-locked pattern of activity did not persist throughout the extinction sessions. Our work presents a real-time role for amygdalar astrocytes in fear processing and provides new insight into the emerging role of these cells in cognition and behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Uncertainty revealed by delayed responses during olfactory matching</a></h4>

              
                Matching of olfactory stimuli involves both sensory and higher cognitive functioning. Different decision processes such as detection and discrimination, along with holding the perceived information are involved during the matching process. Accuracy and decision times, the interdependent readouts, can define the uncertainty involved in matching of sensory stimuli. To probe sensory and cognitive functions involving olfactory system in human subjects, we have developed a novel olfactory matching paradigm using an automated custom-built olfactory-action meter. With precise and consistent odor delivery and real-time data analysis, our system automates the entire process without any intervention by the experimenter, making it suitable as a diagnostic tool for quantifying olfactory and neurocognitive fitness. In around 400 healthy human subjects, with mean detection accuracy of 90%, we observed significantly better olfactory matching performance for simple monomolecular odors, in comparison to complex binary odor mixtures. Odor matching accuracy declined significantly with the increase in odor complexity. Olfactory matching was more rapid when subjects made correct versus incorrect decisions, indicating perceptual certainty. Subjects also took longer matching time for complex odors compared to simple odor stimuli. Thus, olfactory matching that provides a combined readout of sensory and cognitive fitness, establishes a direct link between the performance accuracy and the certainty of decisions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Membrane potential dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in mouse barrel cortex during active whisker sensing</a></h4>

              
                Neocortical neurons can increasingly be divided into well-defined classes, but their activity patterns during quantified behavior remain to be fully determined. Here, we obtained membrane potential recordings from various classes of excitatory and inhibitory neurons located across different cortical depths in the primary whisker somatosensory barrel cortex of awake head-restrained mice during quiet wakefulness, free whisking and active touch. Excitatory neurons, especially those located superficially, were hyperpolarized with low action potential firing rates relative to inhibitory neurons. Parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons on average fired at the highest rates, responding strongly and rapidly to whisker touch. Vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing inhibitory neurons were excited during whisking, but responded to active touch only after a delay. Somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons had the smallest membrane potential fluctuations and exhibited hyperpolarising responses at whisking onset for superficial, but not deep, neurons. Interestingly, rapid repetitive whisker touch evoked excitatory responses in somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons, but not when the intercontact interval was long. Our analyses suggest that distinct genetically-defined classes of neurons at different subpial depths have differential activity patterns depending upon behavioral state providing an important basis for constraining future computational models of neocortical function.

                The cerebellum is a highly conserved structure of the vertebrate central nervous system that plays a role in the timing and calibration of motor sequences. Its function is supported by the convergence of fibers from granule cells (GCs) and inferior olive neurons (IONs) onto Purkinje cells (PCs). Theories of cerebellar function postulate that IONs convey error signals to PCs that, paired with the contextual information provided by GCs, can be used as a teaching signal to guide motor learning. Here, we use the larval zebrafish to investigate (i) how sensory representations of the same stimulus vary across GCs and IONs and (ii) how PC activity reflects these two different input streams. We use population calcium imaging to measure the cell responses to flashes of diverse luminance and duration to show that IONs and GCs encode different stimulus properties. First, most GCs show tonic and graded responses, as opposed to IONs, whose activity peaks only at on and off luminance transitions, in agreement with the notion that GCs and IONs encode context and error information, respectively. Secondly, we show that GC activity is patterned over time: some neurons had sustained responses for the entire duration of the stimulus, while in others activity was ramping up with slow time constants. This suggests that, by performing temporal integration, GCs could provide a basis that PCs may use to decode time. Finally, we show how PC activity can be largely reconstructed by a linear combination of granule cells and inferior olive neurons. Together, our observations give support to the notion of an error signal coming from IONs, and provide the first experimental evidence for a temporal patterning of GC activity over many seconds.

                When we vocalize, our brain distinguishes self-generated sounds from external ones. A corollary discharge signal supports this function in animals, however, in humans its exact origin and temporal dynamics remain unknown. We report Electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings in neurosurgical patients and a novel connectivity approach revealing major neural communications. We find a reproducible source for corollary discharge across multiple speech production paradigms localized to ventral speech motor cortex before speech articulation. The uncovered discharge predicts the degree of auditory cortex suppression during speech, its well-documented consequence. These results reveal the human corollary discharge source and timing with far-reaching implication for speech motor-control as well as auditory hallucinations in human psychosis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Selective attention reduces responses to relevant sounds in human auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Selective attention enables the preferential processing of relevant stimulus aspects. Invasive animal studies have shown that attending a sound feature rapidly modifies neuronal tuning throughout the auditory cortex. Human neuroimaging studies have reported enhanced auditory cortical responses with selective attention. To date, it remains unclear how the results obtained with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans relate to the electrophysiological findings in animal models. Here we aim to close the gap between animal and human research by combining a selective attention task similar in design to those used in animal electrophysiology with high spatial resolution ultra-high field fMRI at 7 Tesla. Specifically, human participants perform a detection task, while the probability of target occurrence varies with sound frequency. Contrary to previous fMRI studies, we show that selective attention reduces responses to the attended frequencies in those neuronal populations preferring the attended frequency. Through population receptive field (pRF) mapping, we furthermore show that these response reductions are at least partially driven by frequency-induced pRF narrowing. The difference between our results to those of previous fMRI studies supports the notion that the influence of selective attention on auditory cortex is diverse and may depend on context, task, and auditory processing stage.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rhythmic Modulation of Visual Discrimination is Dependent on Individuals' Spontaneous Motor Tempo</a></h4>

              
                Rhythmic structure in our daily experience originates from various sources. It is generated endogenously and observed in spontaneous fluctuations in behaviour and performance. It can also arise exogenously from everyday stimuli, such as speech, motion and music. Here we examined how individual differences in spontaneous motor rhythms affect the tendency to use external rhythmic structure to guide perception. To measure individual differences in spontaneous rhythms of performance we utilized a spontaneous tapping task. To measure individual differences in perceptual rhythmic modulation we designed a visual discrimination task in which targets can appear either in-phase or out-of-phase with a preceding rhythmic stream of visual stimuli. We manipulated the tempo of the visual stream over different experimental blocks (0.77 Hz, 1.4 Hz, 2 Hz). We found that visual rhythmic stimulation modulates discrimination performance. The modulation was dependent on the tempo of stimulation, with maximal perceptual benefits for the slowest tempo of stimulation (0.77 Hz). Most importantly, the strength of modulation was also affected by individuals' spontaneous motor tempo. Specifically, individuals with slower spontaneous tempi showed greater rhythmic modulation compared to individuals with faster spontaneous tempi. This discovery suggests that different tempi affect the cognitive system with varying levels of efficiency, and that self-generated rhythms impact our ability to utilize rhythmic structure in the environment for guiding perception and performance.

                Antipsychotics share the common pharmacological feature of antagonizing the dopamine 2 receptor (D2R) which is abundant in the striatum and involved in both the therapeutic and side effects of this drugs class. Pharmacological blockade of striatal D2R, by disinhibiting the D2R-containing medium-size spiny neurons (MSNs), leads to a plethora of molecular, cellular and behavioral adaptations which are central in the action of antipsychotics. Here, we focused on the cell type-specific (D2R-MSNs) regulation of some striatal immediate early genes (IEGs), such as cFos, Arc and Zif268. Taking advantage of transgenic mouse models, pharmacological approaches and immunofluorescence analyses, we found that haloperidol-induced IEGs in the striatum required the synergistic activation of A2a (adenosine) and NMDA (glutamate) receptors. At the intracellular signaling level, we found that the PKA/DARPP-32 and mTOR pathways synergistically cooperate to control the induction of IEGs by haloperidol. By confirming and further expanding previous observations, our results provide novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying the molecular/cellular action of antipsychotics in the striatum.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Emergence of syntax and word prediction in an artificial neural circuit of the cerebellum</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum cooperates with the neocortex in language processing, particularly during language acquisition, but little is known about the circuit computations underlying cerebellar language functions. Here, to simulate language acquisition, we created a biologically constrained cerebellar artificial neural network (cANN) model. We found that as the cANN acquired prediction of future words, a second function--syntactic recognition, the extraction of rules from word sequences--emerged spontaneously in the middle layer of the circuit. This single-circuit computation as the common basis for two language functions can be generalized to prediction and rule-extraction functions underlying a wide range of cerebellar cognitive functions, and also suggests a concrete novel rehabilitation method for patients with language dysfunction.

                When neurophysiologists record neural activity from the brain, they often conclude that neural tuning to task variables indicates a functional role of the brain area studied in task performance. However, it remains unknown how reliably such correlations indicate a functional role. To answer this question, we chronically recorded neural activity in the prefrontal cortex of monkeys during the performance of four cognitive tasks. Previous studies had demonstrated that only one of those tasks causally depends on the recorded area; the other three tasks are not impaired by lesions of this area. We found that the prevalence and strength of single neuron and ensemble tuning were equivalently high across all four tasks. This suggests that non-necessary cognitive signals are prevalent in the cerebral cortex of primates during task performance, challenging one of the fundamental assumptions of cognitive neurophysiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cross-Modal Representation of Identity in Primate Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Faces and voices are the dominant social signals used to recognize individuals amongst human and nonhuman primates. Yet, evidence that information across these signals can be integrated into a modality-independent representation of individual identity in the primate brain has been reported only in human patients. Here we show that, like humans, single neurons in the marmoset monkey hippocampus exhibit invariant neural responses when presented with the faces or voices of specific individuals. However, we also identified a population of single neurons in hippocampus that were responsive to the cross-modal identity of multiple conspecifics, not only a single individual. An identity network model revealed population-level, cross-modal representations of individuals in hippocampus, underscoring the broader contributions of many neurons to encode identity. This pattern was further evidenced by manifold projections of population activity which likewise showed separability of individuals, as well as clustering for family members, suggesting that multiple learned social categories are encoded as related dimensions of identity in hippocampus. The constellation of findings presented here reveal a novel perspective on the neural basis of identity representations in primate hippocampus as being both invariant to modality and comprising multiple levels of acquired social knowledge.

                The gut microbiome is thought to play a critical role in the onset and development of psychiatric disorders, including depression and substance use disorder (SUD). To test the hypothesis that the microbiome affects addiction predisposing behaviors and cocaine intravenous self-administration (IVSA) and to identify specific microbes involved in the relationship, we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing on feces from 228 diversity outbred mice. Twelve open field measures, two light-dark assay measures, one hole board and novelty place preference measure significantly differed between mice that acquired cocaine IVSA (ACQ) and those that failed to acquire IVSA (FACQ). We found that ACQ mice are more active and exploratory and display decreased fear than FACQ mice. The microbial abundances that differentiated ACQ from FACQ mice were an increased abundance of Barnesiella, Ruminococcus, and Robinsoniella and decreased Clostridium IV in ACQ mice. There was a sex-specific correlation between ACQ and microbial abundance, a reduced Lactobacillus abundance in ACQ male mice, and a decreased Blautia abundance in female ACQ mice. The abundance of Robinsoniella was correlated, and Clostridium IV inversely correlated with the number of doses of cocaine self-administered during acquisition. Functional analysis of the microbiome composition of a subset of mice suggested that gut-brain modules encoding glutamate metabolism genes are associated with the propensity to self-administer cocaine. These findings establish associations between the microbiome composition and glutamate metabolic potential and the ability to acquire cocaine IVSA thus indicating the potential translational impact of targeting the gut microbiome or microbial metabolites for treatment of SUD.

	<p>Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease is one of the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorders. The main theory of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease progress is the amyloid-&amp;amp;beta; cascade hypothesis. However, the initial mechanisms of insoluble forms of amyloid-&amp;amp;beta; formation and hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons remain unclear. One of the factors, which might play a key role in senile plaques and tau fibrils generation due to Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, is inflammaging, i.e., systemic chronic low-grade age-related inflammation. The activation of the proinflammatory cell phenotype is observed during aging, which might be one of the pivotal mechanisms for the development of chronic inflammatory diseases, e.g., atherosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. This review discusses the role of the inflammatory processes in developing neurodegeneration, activated during physiological aging and due to various diseases such as atherosclerosis, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and depressive disorders.</p>

	<p>Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most frequent mental disorders. Exposure to virtual reality can be a solution complementing standard CBT (cognitive-behavioral therapy) or can be used as an independent therapeutic tool. The study&amp;amp;rsquo;s objective was to assess the safety and efficacy of using self-administered virtual reality exposure vs. CBT and CBT with virtual exposure. We assessed the efficacy of the applied intervention with the Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). We compared three groups: CBT (n = 25), CBT + VR (n = 29), and self-administered therapy without aid of a therapist (n = 19). The results indicated that all three groups showed changes on the LSAS. The simple effect analysis showed that there were no differences between experimental conditions at T0 (session 1) and T1 (session 9) and that the only significant difference occurred at T2 (session 14). The pairwise comparisons showed that the participants in the VR condition scored higher on the LSAS score during the measurement at T2 than participants in CBT condition. Our study has several limitations. The presented initial study shows that the methods of CBT for social anxiety used so far are also effective, while the VR tool for self-therapy requires further research.</p>

	<p>Each year, 275 million children worldwide are exposed to domestic violence (DV) and suffer negative mental and physical health consequences; however, only a small proportion receive assistance. Pediatricians and child psychiatrists can play a central role in identifying threatened children. We reviewed experiences of DV screening in pediatric and child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) to understand its feasibility and provide clues for its implementation. We performed bibliographic research using the Sapienza Library System, PubMed, and the following databases: MEDLINE, American Psychological Association PsycArticles, American Psychological Association PsycInfo, ScienceDirect, and Scopus. We considered a 20-year interval when selecting the articles and we included studies published in English between January 2000 and March 2021. A total of 23 out of 2335 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. We found that the prevalence of disclosed DV ranged from 4.2% o 48%, with most prevalence estimates between 10% and 20%. Disclosure increases with a detection plan, which is mostly welcomed by mothers (70&amp;amp;ndash;80% acceptance rates). Written tools were used in 55% of studies, oral interviews in 40%, and computer instruments in 20%. Mixed forms were used in three studies (15%). The most used and effective tool appeared to be the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) (30% of studies). For young children, parental reports are advisable and written instruments are the first preference; interviews can be conducted with older children. Our research pointed out that the current literature does not provide practical clinical clues on facilitating the disclosure in pediatric clinics and CAMHS. Further studies are needed on the inpatient population and in the field of children psychiatry.</p>

	<p>Almost half of the patients surveyed report impaired function of the upper limbx and handx after stroke. The effect of the passive trunk and shoulder stabilization on the recovery of coordinated hand movement is unclear. This study examined whether passive stabilization of the trunk and shoulder could improve the functional state of the hands after various types of strokes. It is an observational prospective cohort study conducted at the Rehabilitation Clinic in two parallel groups of patients with four different types of strokes (hemorrhagic and ischemic of the brain, similar to the cerebellum). A total of 120 patients were analyzed. Patients were examined in various positions: sitting without a backrest with the upper limb adjacent to the body, supine with the upper limb perpendicular to the body, and supine with the arm stabilized in relation to the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s body. Hand Tutor devices and a hand dynamometer were used for the measurements. The frequency and maximum range of motion as well as the grip strength were measured in three different positions of the trunk and upper limb. Passive stabilization of the trunk and shoulder showed more statistically significant differences in Group II. In group II, both in patients after hemorrhagic stroke (wrist Hz p = 0.019; wrist ROM p = 0.005; Hz F5 p = 0.021; Hz F4 p = 0.016; Hz F3 p = 0.019; Hz F2 p = 0.021) and ischemic stroke (p = 0.001 for wrist Hz, wrist ROM, Hz F from 5 to F2; and ROM F1; ROM F3 p = 0.009; ROM F2 p = 0.010), and hemorrhagic cerebellum, improvement of parameters was observed. Stabilization of the upper limb and passive stabilization of the trunk improved the frequency and range of movements in the radiocarpal joint and in the fingers of patients after stroke, regardless of the type of stroke.</p>

	<p>In recent years, deep-learning-based motor imagery (MI) electroencephalography (EEG) decoding methods have shown great potential in the field of the brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interface (BCI). The existing literature is relatively mature in decoding methods for two classes of MI tasks. However, with the increase in MI task classes, decoding studies for four classes of MI tasks need to be further explored. In addition, it is difficult to obtain large-scale EEG datasets. When the training data are limited, deep-learning-based decoding models are prone to problems such as overfitting and poor robustness. In this study, we design a data augmentation method for MI-EEG. The original EEG is slid along the time axis and reconstructed to expand the size of the dataset. Second, we combine the gated recurrent unit (GRU) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to construct a parallel-structured feature fusion network to decode four classes of MI tasks. The parallel structure can avoid temporal, frequency and spatial features interfering with each other. Experimenting on the well-known four-class MI dataset BCI Competition IV 2a shows a global average classification accuracy of 80.7% and a kappa value of 0.74. The proposed method improves the robustness of deep learning to decode small-scale EEG datasets and alleviates the overfitting phenomenon caused by insufficient data. The method can be applied to BCI systems with a small amount of daily recorded data.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">341 Repeats Is Not Enough for Methylation in a New Fragile X Mouse Model</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a leading monogenic cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders, spurring decades of intense research and a multitude of mouse models. So far, these models do not recapitulate the genetic underpinning of classical FXS&mdash;CGG repeat-induced methylation of the <I>Fmr1</I> locus&mdash;and their findings have failed to translate into the clinic. We sought to answer whether this disparity was because of low repeat length and generated a novel mouse line with 341 repeats, <I>Fmr1<sup>hs341</sup></I>, which is the largest allele in mice reported to date. This repeat length is significantly longer than the 200 repeats generally required for methylation of the repeat tract and promoter region in FXS patients, which leads to silencing of the <I>FMR1</I> gene. Bisulfite sequencing fails to detect the robust methylation expected of FXS in <I>Fmr1<sup>hs341</sup></I> mice. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting results also do not resemble FXS and instead produce a biochemical profile consistent with the fragile X-associated premutation disorders. These findings suggest that repeat length is unlikely to be the core determinant preventing methylation in mice, and other organisms phylogenetically closer to humans may be required to effectively model FXS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Humans Can Track But Fail to Predict Accelerating Objects</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Objects in our visual environment often move unpredictably and can suddenly speed up or slow down. The ability to account for acceleration when interacting with moving objects can be critical for survival. Here, we investigate how human observers track an accelerating target with their eyes and predict its time of reappearance after a temporal occlusion by making an interceptive hand movement. Before occlusion, observers smoothly tracked the accelerating target with their eyes. At the time of occlusion, observers made a predictive saccade to the location where they subsequently intercepted the target with a quick pointing movement. We tested how observers integrated target motion information by comparing three alternative models that describe time-to-contact (TTC) based on the (1) final target velocity sample before occlusion, (2) average target velocity before occlusion, or (3) final target velocity and the rate of target acceleration. We show that observers were able to accurately track the accelerating target with visually-guided smooth pursuit eye movements. However, the timing of the predictive saccade and manual interception revealed inability to act on target acceleration when predicting TTC. Instead, interception timing was best described by the final velocity model that relies on extrapolating the last available target velocity sample before occlusion. Moreover, predictive saccades and manual interception showed similar insensitivity to target acceleration and were correlated on a trial-by-trial basis. These findings provide compelling evidence for the failure of integrating target acceleration into predictive models of target motion that drive both interceptive eye and hand movements.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Students' Digital Competence and Perceived Learning: The mediating role of Learner Agility [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background:  The ravages of COVID-19 escalated the penetration of online education and usage of digital technologies. While educational institutions across the globe adopted different forms of computer-mediated communication, the institutes in India have gradually attuned to the new normal, notwithstanding the initial glitches of adopting new technology and shifting to blended. It became increasingly significant to gain a better understanding of students’ perspectives of newly emerged learning environment. This motivated the researchers to study the digital competencies (DC) and their impact on students’ learning agility (LA) and perceived learning (PL) in professional/technical education.  Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a DigiComp 2.1 framework was attempted to investigate the relationship between DC and PL among higher education students in India. The data from 359 graduate and post-graduate students were analyzed using Structural equation modelling and Process Macro 4.0. Results: The findings of this study revealed that DC has a significant positive impact on PL (b = 0.33; p < 0.001), indicating that higher learners' DC leads to higher learning outcomes. Similarly, DC also had a significant positive impact on LA (b = 0.59; p < 0.001), suggesting that the higher DC of learners leads to higher learning agility. Further, a positive significant relationship was also found between LA and PL (b = 0.21; p < 0.001). This significant positive path reveals that higher learners' agility leads to higher student learning outcomes. Discussion: Post-COVID, DC, a technology-related skill set is linked to the academic performance of teachers and students.  Our findings reveal that DC significantly positively impacts PL and LA.  Therefore, we recommend that the higher educational institutes in India consider the inclusion of DC in their curriculum as a fundamental competence for a better learning outcome for learners.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Job characteristics of a Malaysian bank’s anti-money laundering system and its employees’ job satisfaction [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Banks and financial institutions are vulnerable to money laundering (ML) as a result of crime proceeds infiltrating banks in the form of significant cash deposits. Improved financial crime compliance processes and systems enable anti-ML (AML) analysts to devote considerable time and effort to case investigation and process quality work, thereby lowering financial risks by reporting suspicious activity in a timely and effective manner. This study uses Job Characteristics Theory (JCT) to evaluate the AML system through the job satisfaction and motivation of its users. The purpose of this study is to determine how satisfied AML personnel are with their jobs and how motivated they are to work with the system. Methods: This cross-sectional study used JCT to investigate the important elements impacting employee satisfaction with the AML system. The five core dimensions of the job characteristics were measured using a job diagnostic survey. The respondents were employees working in the AML department of a Malaysian bank, and the sample group was chosen using a purposive sampling approach. A total of 100 acceptable replies were gathered and analysed using various statistical approaches. A motivating potential score was generated for each employee based on five main job characteristics. Results: Findings revealed that five core job characteristics, namely, skill diversity, task identity, task importance, autonomy and feedback, positively influence the AML system employees’ job satisfaction. However, skill variety and autonomy are found to be low, which are reflected in the poor motivating potential score. Conclusion: This study examined the characteristics of the AML system and its users’ job satisfaction. Findings revealed that task significance is the most widely recognised characteristic, followed by feedback and task identity. However, there is a lack of skill variety and autonomy, which must be addressed to improve employee satisfaction with the AML system.

                Gender imbalance has persisted over time and is well documented in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and singularly in artificial intelligence (AI). In this article we emphasize the importance of increasing the visibility and recognition of women researchers to attract and retain women in the AI field. We review the ratio of women in STEM and AI, its evolution through time, and the differences among disciplines. Then, we discuss the main sources of this gender imbalance highlighting the lack of female role models and the problems which may arise; such as the so called Marie Curie complex, suvivorship bias, and impostor syndrome. We also emphasize the importance of active participation of women researchers in conferences, providing statistics corresponding with the leading conferences. Finally, to support these views, we give examples of several prestigious female researchers in the field and we review their research work related to COVID-19 displayed in the workshop “Artificial Intelligence for the Fight Against COVID-19” (AI4FA COVID-19), which is an example of a more balanced participation between genders.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of modified twin block appliance in growing Class II high angle cases: A cephalometric study [version 2; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Class II malocclusions represent anteroposterior dysplasia usually resulting from mandibular retrusion. Along with a retropositioned mandible, it can be associated with either upward or backward jaw rotation. High angle cases are often associated with a short ramal height, steeper mandibular plane, and large gonial angle. Twin block is a commonly used myofunctional appliance that incorporates bite planes that direct the occlusal forces in a more favorable direction for correction of the retrognathic mandible. We aimed to evaluate skeletal, dental, and soft tissue changes following modified twin block appliance therapy in high-angle cases. Methods: A cephalometric study was performed on 15 growing (10-14 years) high angle (Frankfort mandibular angle 28-35°) Class II Division I malocclusion patients undergoing twin block therapy. Skeletal, dental, and soft tissue changes were evaluated by cephalometric analysis using Dolphin software. Results: Pre- and post-treatment changes in cephalograms were assessed by analysis of variance and paired t-test. Significant changes in the position of the mandible (angle between Sella-Nasion-Point B [SNB] increased by 3.9 degrees, P=0.02), Wits appraisal (decreased by 1.54in  mm, P=0.04), maxillo-mandibular relationship (angle between Point A-Nasion-Point B [ANB] decreased by 3.73 degrees, P=0.02) were observed. Soft tissue changes like the nasolabial angle were also significant, increasing by 3.8 degrees (P=0.04) and lower lip relation to E-line (reduction in lower lip protrusion) by 2 mm (P=0.04). Vertical parameters showed non-significant changes, like the Frankfort mandibular angle (FMA) increased by 0.07 degrees, (P=0.67), the angle between Sella-Nasion and Gonion-Gnathion (SN-Go-Gn) increased by 0.33 degrees, (P=0.67), Y-axis increased by 0.2 degrees, (P=0.32). The upper incisor inclination decreased non-significantly from 5.60±1.24 to 4.20±0.86 degrees, (P=0.31) and lower incisor increased non-significantly from 100.13±2.23 to 101.80 ±1.37 degrees, (P=0.08). Conclusions: Modified twin block appliance can be used to successfully treat Class II Division I high angle cases with good vertical control.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">(Semi)automated approaches to data extraction for systematic reviews and meta-analyses in social sciences: A living review protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: An abundance of rapidly accumulating scientific evidence presents novel opportunities for researchers and practitioners alike, yet such advantages are often overshadowed by resource demands associated with finding and aggregating a continually expanding body of scientific information. Across social science disciplines, the use of automation technologies for timely and accurate knowledge synthesis can enhance research translation value, better inform key policy development, and expand the current understanding of human interactions, organizations, and systems. Ongoing developments surrounding automation are highly concentrated in research for evidence-based medicine with limited evidence surrounding tools and techniques applied outside of the clinical research community. Our objective is to conduct a living systematic review of automated data extraction techniques supporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses in the social sciences. The aim of this study is to extend the automation knowledge base by synthesizing current trends in the application of extraction technologies of key data elements of interest for social scientists. Methods: The proposed study is a living systematic review employing a partial replication framework based on extant literature surrounding automation of data extraction for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Protocol development, base review, and updates follow PRISMA standards for reporting systematic reviews. This protocol is preregistered in OSF: (Semi)Automated Approaches to Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses in Social Sciences: A Living Review Protocol on August 14, 2022. Conclusions: Anticipated outcomes of this study include: (a) generate insights supporting advancement in transferring existing reliable methods to social science research; (b) provide a foundation for protocol development leading to enhancement of comparability and benchmarking standards across disciplines; and (c) uncover exigencies that spur continued value-adding innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration for the benefit of the collective systematic review community.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Easing batch image processing from OMERO: a new toolbox for ImageJ [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                The Open Microscopy Environment Remote Objects (OMERO) is an open-source image manager used by many biologists to store, organize, view, and share microscopy images, while the open-source software ImageJ/Fiji is a very popular program used to analyse them. However, there is a lack of an easy-to-use generic tool to run a workflow on a batch of images without having to download them to local computers, and to automatically organize the results in OMERO. To offer this functionality, we have built (i) a library in Java: “Simple OMERO Client”, to communicate with an OMERO database from Java software, (ii) an ImageJ/Fiji plugin to run a macro-program on a batch of images from OMERO and (iii) a new set of Macro Functions, “OMERO Macro extensions“, dedicated to interact with OMERO in macro-programming. The latter is intended for developers, with additional possibilities using tag criteria, while the “Batch OMERO plugin” is more geared towards non-IT scientists and has a very easy to use interface. Each tool is illustrated with a use case.

                Background: Serum levels of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) have a significant association with ovarian response in the event of assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment cycles. The present study was performed to evaluate the ovarian stimulation protocols selection with respect to serum AMH levels in patients and its impact on ART outcome. Methods: Based on the serum AMH, 191 women were classified as low, normal and high responders. Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Human Menopausal Gonadotropin (HMG) dosages in controlled ovarian stimulation were determined. Retrieval, maturation, fertilization and utilization rates were measured. Subgroup analysis was done using one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc analysis. The relationship between AMH levels and fertilization was determined using Pearson’s correlation analysis. A p-value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: According to AMH levels, the majority of the patients were normal responders (52.4%) followed by high responders (29.8%) and low responders (17.8%). The average FSH, HMG per day and number of days HMG required was found to be significant among the different responders. Further, retrieval rate and blastulation rate was found to be significant among the different responders. A positive correlation was found between AMH and the number of oocytes retrieved and number of oocytes successfully fertilized, which was found to be significant. In addition, there was a significant inverse relationship between AMH levels and age. Conclusions: The study outcomes revealed that the rates of retrieval, maturation, fertilization, embryo utilization and blastulation were higher among the high responders compared with the low responders. Thus, proper increase in dosages of ovarian stimulation protocol is required among the low responders to achieve quality embryos.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Detection of mecA gene and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated from milk and risk factors from farms in Probolinggo, Indonesia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Staphylococcus aureus is commonly found in dairy cows and is a source of contamination in milk. S. aureus that are resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics (especially cefoxitin) are referred to as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).  The spread of MRSA cannot be separated from sanitation management during milking; it can originate from milk collected from the udder or from the hands of farmers during the milking process. The purpose of this study was to examine the level of MRSA contamination in dairy cow's milk and farmer's hand. Methods: A total of 109 samples of dairy cow’s milk and 41 samples of farmer’s hand swabs were collected at a dairy farm in Probolinggo, East Java, Indonesia. Samples were cultured and purified using mannitol salt agar (MSA). The profile of S. aureus resistance was established by disk diffusion test using a disk of beta-lactam antibiotics, namely oxacillin and cefoxitin. Results: The S. aureus isolates that were resistant to oxacillin and cefoxitin antibiotics were then tested for oxacillin resistance screening agar base (ORSAB) as a confirmation test for MRSA identity. S. aureus isolates suspected to be MRSA were then tested genotypically by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to detect the presence of the mecA gene. The results of the isolation and identification found 80 isolates (53.33%) of S. aureus. The results of the resistance test found that 42 isolates (15%) of S. aureus were resistant to oxacillin and 10 isolates (12.5%) were resistant to cefoxitin. The ORSAB test found as many as 20 isolates (47.62%) were positive for MRSA. In PCR testing to detect the presence of the mecA gene, three isolates (30%) were positive for the mecA gene. Conclusions: This study shows that several S. aureus isolates were MRSA and had the gene encoding mecA in dairy farms.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Spatial transcriptomics dimensionality reduction using wavelet bases [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Spatially resolved transcriptomics (ST) measures gene expression along with the spatial coordinates of the measurements. The analysis of ST data involves significant computation complexity. In this work, we propose a gene expression dimensionality reduction algorithm that retains spatial structure. Methods: We combine the wavelet transformation with matrix factorization to select spatially-varying genes. We extract a low-dimensional representation of these genes. We adopt an Empirical Bayes perspective, imposing regularization through the prior distribution of factor genes. Additionally, we visualize the extracted representations, providing an overview of global spatial patterns. We illustrate the performance of our methods through spatial structure recovery and gene expression reconstruction using a simulation and real data analysis. Results: In real data experiments, our method identifies spatial structure of gene factors and outperforms regular decomposition regarding reconstruction error. We find a connection between the fluctuation of gene patterns and wavelet estimates, and this allows us to provide smoother visualizations. We develop the package and share the workflow generating reproducible quantitative results and gene visualization. The package is available at https://github.com/OliverXUZY/waveST. Conclusions: We have proposed a pipeline for dimensionality reduction that respects spatial structure. Both simulations and real data experiments demonstrate that wavelet and shrinkage techniques show positive results in spatially resolved transcriptomics data. We highlight the idea of combining image processing techniques and statistical methods for application in a spatial genomics context

                To gain a better understanding of user knowledge and perspectives of search engines, a fruitful approach are representative online surveys. In 2020, we conducted an online survey with a sample representative of the German online population aged 16 through 69 (N = 2,012). The online survey included 12 search engine-related sections. The questions cover topics such as usage behavior, self-assessed search engine literacy, trust in search engines, knowledge of ads and search engine optimization (SEO), ability to distinguish ads from organic results, assessments and opinions regarding SEO, and personalization of search results. SEO is the specific focus of the survey, as it was conducted as part of the SEO Effect project, dealing with issues such as the role of SEO from the user perspective. This data set contains complete data from the online survey. On the one hand, the data set will allow further analyses, and, on the other hand, comparisons with follow-up studies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Smart city perspectives in post-pandemic governance: Externalities reduction policy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The ongoing COVID-19 quarantine restrictions have caused multiple sharp decreases in activities associated with the movement of large masses of people. The economies of regions and cities that are critically dependent on tourist flows related to various segments have suffered. This research aims to provide an economic-mathematical model of smart cities externalities’ impact from the point of view of achieving social and environmental goals Methods: The objective of this study was to develop an algorithm for supporting decision-makers. Methods of mathematical modeling, statistical processing of data received in real-time, as well as methods for finding solutions by expansion into dynamic series are used, and the theory of mathematical games is applied. The theoretical mathematical model presented considers the statistical processing of data provided in real time referring to the performance indicators of megacities. Results: The activities of administrations and governments aimed at maintaining stability over the past two years have been aimed at reducing the negative impact of the pandemic. The prospect of returning to normal conditions is complicated by a number of factors. The proposed approach allows the development of the fundamental basis for making administrative decisions within individual megapolises and in environmental policy on a territory of any scale. The developed mathematical model is abstract by definition and is applied by taking into account specific tasks and criteria. Since the tasks of the administration differ depending on the region and country, the choice of criteria is set individually. Conclusions: During the period of isolation, the volume of services in the Hotel - Restaurant- Catering/Café (HORECA) segment has decreased, and personnel has also been lost. The reduced pressure on public infrastructure and the departure of migrants means that, in the long term, this work cannot be restored within a short period of time.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors associated with inadequate urinary iodine concentration among pregnant women in Mbeya region Tanzania. [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Insufficient and excessive iodine intake during pregnancy can lead to serious health problems. In Tanzania, information available on iodine status during pregnancy is minimal. The aim of this study was to assess the iodine status and its association with socio-demographic factors in pregnant women in the Mbeya region, Tanzania. Method: A cross sectional survey involving 420 pregnant women (n=420) registered in Reproductive and Child Health Clinics was conducted. Data were collected via interviews and laboratory analysis of urinary iodine concentration (UIC). Results: Median UIC was 279.4μg/L (+/-26.1) to 1915μg/L. Insufficient iodine intake (UIC below 150μg/L) was observed in 17.14% of participants, sufficient intake in 24.29% and 58.57% had intakes above the recommended level (>250μg/L). Pregnant women who consume fish had an increased risk of insufficient iodine [Adjusted OR7= 2.60 (95%CI 1.31-5.15)] while the risk was lower for those who attended primary education compared to non-formal education [Adjusted OR= 0.29 (95%CI 0.08-0.99)]. Pregnant women resident in Mbarali district aged between 35-49 years were associated with an increased risk of UIC above recommended level [Adjusted OR=4.09 (95%CI 1.85-9.010] and [Adjusted OR=2.51 (95%CI 0.99-6.330] respectively . Conclusion: This study demonstrated a significant relationship between geographical factors (residence in the Mbarali district) and excess median urine iodine concentration, in addition, this study also found an association between consumption of freshwater fish and insufficient mean urine iodine concentration as indicated by the World Health Organization recommendation. Therefore, educational programs on iodine intake are needed as attending primary education was found to be a protective factor for insufficient median urine iodine concentration.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Risk of lowering mortality from the improvement of inflammatory markers and disease progression among moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 patients using anticoagulant : a cross-sectional study from two second referral hospitals in Surabaya, Indonesia </a></h4>

              
                Background: To date, coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) has no definitive treatment. Thrombosis and hypercoagulation may occur in the advanced stage. Further study on how to use anticoagulants is still required to promote the best prognosis. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 110 moderate, 140 severe, and 81 critical patients receiving unfractioned heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), and fondaparinux was conducted. Data were collected from March 15th to August 31st 2020 at Universitas Airlangga and Husada Utama Hospital. A comparative study of white blood cell (WBC), neutrophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), c-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer, all-cause mortality rate, length of stay, and days of death among three severities of COVID-19 was done. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to determine the correlation between inflammatory state after anti-coagulant with patients’ mortality. Results: Two deaths occurred in moderate cases, 36 deaths in severe cases, and 70 deaths in critical cases on ventilators. On day 13, moderate and severe groups showed decreased WBC, neutrophils, NLR, CRP, and D-dimer (p < 0.05). NLR, CRP, and D-dimer (p<0.05) in critically ill and ventilated patients decreased. Day-13 evaluation revealed 32.73% decrease of inflammatory markers in moderate group; 32.86% in severe patients; and 16.05% in critically ill, ventilated patients. A significant correlation between day 13 inflammatory status with mortality was seen in moderate and critical cases with a ventilator (r=0.337; p< 0.05 and r=0.25; p 0.05). Inflammatory profile on day 6 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.36; p < 0.05) and day 13 ([aOR] = 4.15; p < 0.05) was associated with patients’ mortality. Conclusions: Anticoagulants in COVID-19 patients lower inflammation markers. Evaluating inflammatory status is essential to predict the mortality. Inflammatory markers on day 13, based on the severity of COVID-19 and comorbidities, were associated with mortality in moderate and critical cases.

                Respiratory tract infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and was declared as a pandemic by WHO. The interaction between the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and pulmonary hypertension (PH) in children is not widely known. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDEI), one class of drugs used to treat PH, including sildenafil, can suppress angiotensin type I (AT-1) receptor expression. Furthermore, it reduces proinflammatory cytokines and infiltrates the alveolar, inhibits endothelial and smooth muscle transition, mesenchymal cells in the pulmonary artery, and prevents clotting and thrombosis complications. Sildenafil has shown positive effects by diverting the blood flow to the lungs in such a way that ventilation is adequate and can also be anti-inflammatory.

                Incorporating eels and tempe can replace and complement the content of proteins, macronutrients, and micronutrients, which may be related to curative effects for malnutrition. In addition, converting the ingredients into a form of flour can increase their shelf life and nutrient concentration. Therefore, an in vivo approach was undertaken to explore further the nutritional status value of biomarkers in malnourished male rats (Rattus norvegicus) after Eel and Tempe Composite (ETC) flour supplementation. Data was collected from blood samples (both plasma and serum) of rats in all groups, and the appropriate biomarkers were analyzed. The final data presented in this study is openly available and can be further analyzed using statistical means to determine the dose of ETC flour as the basis of clinical trials, which other researchers can reproduce. This data may also be valuable for those interested in using different analytical methods to research the same questions or even new preclinical studies focusing solely on nutritional status biomarker analysis methods, including clinical trial prospects.

                This article provides details on the development of a statistical learning algorithm developed for constructing personalized treatment plans for psychotherapy. The algorithm takes data collected via Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) as an input. From this, it constructs an idiographic disorder model that reflects the latent dimensions of this patient’s psychopathology and their temporal interrelations. The priority of individual problems is derived from this statistical model. Based on this, treatment modules from cognitive-behavioral therapy are ranked so that the problems with the highest priority are dealt with first. A case study is used to illustrate the different analysis steps of the algorithm from data collection to the treatment plan.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">PrMFTP: Multi-functional therapeutic peptides prediction based on multi-head self-attention mechanism and class weight optimization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Wenhui Yan, Wending Tang, Lihua Wang, Yannan Bin, Junfeng Xia</p>

Prediction of therapeutic peptide is a significant step for the discovery of promising therapeutic drugs. Most of the existing studies have focused on the mono-functional therapeutic peptide prediction. However, the number of multi-functional therapeutic peptides (MFTP) is growing rapidly, which requires new computational schemes to be proposed to facilitate MFTP discovery. In this study, based on multi-head self-attention mechanism and class weight optimization algorithm, we propose a novel model called PrMFTP for MFTP prediction. PrMFTP exploits multi-scale convolutional neural network, bi-directional long short-term memory, and multi-head self-attention mechanisms to fully extract and learn informative features of peptide sequence to predict MFTP. In addition, we design a class weight optimization scheme to address the problem of label imbalanced data. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrate that PrMFTP is superior to other state-of-the-art computational methods for predicting MFTP. We provide a user-friendly web server of PrMFTP, which is available at http://bioinfo.ahu.edu.cn/PrMFTP.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Thalamic regulation of frontal interactions in human cognitive flexibility</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ali Hummos, Bin A. Wang, Sabrina Drammis, Michael M. Halassa, Burkhard Pleger</p>

Interactions across frontal cortex are critical for cognition. Animal studies suggest a role for mediodorsal thalamus (MD) in these interactions, but the computations performed and direct relevance to human decision making are unclear. Here, inspired by animal work, we extended a neural model of an executive frontal-MD network and trained it on a human decision-making task for which neuroimaging data were collected. Using a biologically-plausible learning rule, we found that the model MD thalamus compressed its cortical inputs (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dlPFC) underlying stimulus-response representations. Through direct feedback to dlPFC, this thalamic operation efficiently partitioned cortical activity patterns and enhanced task switching across different contingencies. To account for interactions with other frontal regions, we expanded the model to compute higher-order strategy signals outside dlPFC, and found that the MD offered a more efficient route for such signals to switch dlPFC activity patterns. Human fMRI data provided evidence that the MD engaged in feedback to dlPFC, and had a role in routing orbitofrontal cortex inputs when subjects switched behavioral strategy. Collectively, our findings contribute to the emerging evidence for thalamic regulation of frontal interactions in the human brain.

We perform a thorough analysis of RNA velocity methods, with a view towards understanding the suitability of the various assumptions underlying popular implementations. In addition to providing a self-contained exposition of the underlying mathematics, we undertake simulations and perform controlled experiments on biological datasets to assess workflow sensitivity to parameter choices and underlying biology. Finally, we argue for a more rigorous approach to RNA velocity, and present a framework for Markovian analysis that points to directions for improvement and mitigation of current problems.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A quantitative modelling approach for DNA repair on a population scale</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Leo Zeitler, Cyril Denby Wilkes, Arach Goldar, Julie Soutourina</p>

The great advances of sequencing technologies allow the <i>in vivo</i> measurement of nuclear processes—such as DNA repair after UV exposure—over entire cell populations. However, data sets usually contain only a few samples over several hours, missing possibly important information in between time points. We developed a data-driven approach to analyse CPD repair kinetics over time in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. In contrast to other studies that consider sequencing signals as an average behaviour, we understand them as the superposition of signals from independent cells. By motivating repair as a stochastic process, we derive a minimal model for which the parameters can be conveniently estimated. We correlate repair parameters to a variety of genomic features that are assumed to influence repair, including transcription rate and nucleosome density. The clearest link was found for the transcription unit length, which has been unreported for budding yeast to our knowledge. The framework hence allows a comprehensive analysis of nuclear processes on a population scale.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Digital twin predicting diet response before and after long-term fasting</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Oscar Silfvergren, Christian Simonsson, Mattias Ekstedt, Peter Lundberg, Peter Gennemark, Gunnar Cedersund</p>

Today, there is great interest in diets proposing new combinations of macronutrient compositions and fasting schedules. Unfortunately, there is little consensus regarding the impact of these different diets, since available studies measure different sets of variables in different populations, thus only providing partial, non-connected insights. We lack an approach for integrating all such partial insights into a useful and interconnected big picture. Herein, we present such an integrating tool. The tool uses a novel mathematical model that describes mechanisms regulating diet response and fasting metabolic fluxes, both for organ-organ crosstalk, and inside the liver. The tool can mechanistically explain and integrate data from several clinical studies, and correctly predict new independent data, including data from a new study. Using this model, we can predict non-measured variables, <i>e</i>.<i>g</i>. hepatic glycogen and gluconeogenesis, in response to fasting and different diets. Furthermore, we exemplify how such metabolic responses can be successfully adapted to a specific individual’s sex, weight, height, as well as to the individual’s historical data on metabolite dynamics. This tool enables an offline digital twin technology.

Studies comparing single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data between conditions mainly focus on differences in the proportion of cell types or on differentially expressed genes. In many cases these differences are driven by changes in cell interactions which are challenging to infer without spatial information. To determine cell-cell interactions that differ between conditions we developed the Cell Interaction Network Inference (CINS) pipeline. CINS combines Bayesian network analysis with regression-based modeling to identify differential cell type interactions and the proteins that underlie them. We tested CINS on a disease case control and on an aging mouse dataset. In both cases CINS correctly identifies cell type interactions and the ligands involved in these interactions improving on prior methods suggested for cell interaction predictions. We performed additional mouse aging scRNA-Seq experiments which further support the interactions identified by CINS.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Rhythmicity is linked to expression cost at the protein level but to expression precision at the mRNA level</a></h4>

              
                <p>by David Laloum, Marc Robinson-Rechavi</p>

Many genes have nycthemeral rhythms of expression, <i>i.e</i>. a 24-hours periodic variation, at either mRNA or protein level or both, and most rhythmic genes are tissue-specific. Here, we investigate and discuss the evolutionary origins of rhythms in gene expression. Our results suggest that rhythmicity of protein expression could have been favored by selection to minimize costs. Trends are consistent in bacteria, plants and animals, and are also supported by tissue-specific patterns in mouse. Unlike for protein level, cost cannot explain rhythm at the RNA level. We suggest that instead it allows to periodically reduce expression noise. Noise control had the strongest support in mouse, with limited evidence in other species. We have also found that genes under stronger purifying selection are rhythmically expressed at the mRNA level, and we propose that this is because they are noise sensitive genes. Finally, the adaptive role of rhythmic expression is supported by rhythmic genes being highly expressed yet tissue-specific. This provides a good evolutionary explanation for the observation that nycthemeral rhythms are often tissue-specific.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">TAMC: A deep-learning approach to predict motif-centric transcriptional factor binding activity based on ATAC-seq profile</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tianqi Yang, Ricardo Henao</p>

Determining transcriptional factor binding sites (TFBSs) is critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating gene expression in different biological conditions. Biological assays designed to directly mapping TFBSs require large sample size and intensive resources. As an alternative, ATAC-seq assay is simple to conduct and provides genomic cleavage profiles that contain rich information for imputing TFBSs indirectly. Previous footprint-based tools are inheritably limited by the accuracy of their bias correction algorithms and the efficiency of their feature extraction models. Here we introduce TAMC (Transcriptional factor binding prediction from ATAC-seq profile at Motif-predicted binding sites using Convolutional neural networks), a deep-learning approach for predicting motif-centric TF binding activity from paired-end ATAC-seq data. TAMC does not require bias correction during signal processing. By leveraging a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) model, TAMC make predictions based on both footprint and non-footprint features at binding sites for each TF and outperforms existing footprinting tools in TFBS prediction particularly for ATAC-seq data with limited sequencing depth.

Western blotting is a standard laboratory method used to detect proteins and assess their expression levels. Unfortunately, poor western blot image display practices and a lack of detailed methods reporting can limit a reader’s ability to evaluate or reproduce western blot results. While several groups have studied the prevalence of image manipulation or provided recommendations for improving western blotting, data on the prevalence of common publication practices are scarce. We systematically examined 551 articles published in the top 25% of journals in neurosciences (<i>n</i> = 151) and cell biology (<i>n</i> = 400) that contained western blot images, focusing on practices that may omit important information. Our data show that most published western blots are cropped and blot source data are not made available to readers in the supplement. Publishing blots with visible molecular weight markers is rare, and many blots additionally lack molecular weight labels. Western blot methods sections often lack information on the amount of protein loaded on the gel, blocking steps, and antibody labeling protocol. Important antibody identifiers like company or supplier, catalog number, or RRID were omitted frequently for primary antibodies and regularly for secondary antibodies. We present detailed descriptions and visual examples to help scientists, peer reviewers, and editors to publish more informative western blot figures and methods. Additional resources include a toolbox to help scientists produce more reproducible western blot data, teaching slides in English and Spanish, and an antibody reporting template.

                <p>by Nina H. Fefferman, Charles A. Price, Oliver C. Stringham</p>

The realization that ecological principles play an important role in infectious disease dynamics has led to a renaissance in epidemiological theory. Ideas from ecological succession theory have begun to inform an understanding of the relationship between the individual microbiome and health but have not yet been applied to investigate broader, population-level epidemiological dynamics. We consider human hosts as habitat and apply ideas from succession to immune memory and multi-pathogen dynamics in populations. We demonstrate that ecologically meaningful life history characteristics of pathogens and parasites, rather than epidemiological features alone, are likely to play a meaningful role in determining the age at which people have the greatest probability of being infected. Our results indicate the potential importance of microbiome succession in determining disease incidence and highlight the need to explore how pathogen life history traits and host ecology influence successional dynamics. We conclude by exploring some of the implications that inclusion of successional theory might have for understanding the ecology of diseases and their hosts.

The antituberculosis vaccine Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) induces nonspecific protection against heterologous infections, at least partly through induction of innate immune memory (trained immunity). The amplitude of the response to BCG is variable, but the factors that influence this response are poorly understood. Metabolites, either released by cells or absorbed from the gut, are known to influence immune responses, but whether they impact BCG responses is not known. We vaccinated 325 healthy individuals with BCG, and collected blood before, 2 weeks and 3 months after vaccination, to assess the influence of circulating metabolites on the immune responses induced by BCG. Circulating metabolite concentrations after BCG vaccination were found to have a more pronounced impact on trained immunity responses, such as the increase in IL-1β and TNF-α production upon <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> stimulation, than on specific adaptive immune memory, assessed as IFN-γ production in response to <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. Circulating metabolites at baseline were able to predict trained immunity responses at 3 months after vaccination and enrichment analysis based on the metabolites positively associated with trained immunity revealed enrichment of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and glutamine metabolism, both of which were previously found to be important for trained immunity. Several new metabolic pathways that influence trained immunity were identified, among which taurine metabolism associated with BCG-induced trained immunity, a finding validated in functional experiments. In conclusion, circulating metabolites are important factors influencing BCG-induced trained immunity in humans. Modulation of metabolic pathways may be a novel strategy to improve vaccine and trained immunity responses.

In this observational study, we collected saliva from patients with COVID-19 and evaluated the relationship between ACE2 expression and Candida albicans as well as with selected gram-negative bacteria (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Veillonella parvula). We investigated how this may be directly or indirectly involved in oral dysbiosis in patients with COVID-19. Methods: We included 23 hospitalized patients admitted to Universitas Indonesia Hospital with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, with six healthy participants serving as controls. Saliva and tongue surface swabs were collected from patients with diabetes (DG) and without diabetes (NDG) and subject controls. Using quantitative PCR (qPCR) we assessed the mRNA expression of ACE2, the abundance of C. albicans, and the transcription levels of its biofilm-associated genes, agglutinin-like protein 3 (ALS3), hyphal wall protein 1 (HWP1), and yeast-form wall protein 1 (YWP1). We also counted the relative proportion of the three selected gram-negative oral bacteria in saliva. All analyses were performed to determine the relationship between ACE2 expression and C. albicans and gram-negative bacteria. Results: ACE2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in tongue swab samples than in saliva. However, no significant difference was observed between the patient groups. Conversely, DG patients had a significantly higher abundance of C. albicans in saliva compared to NDG patients and control group patients. The correlation and sensitivity/specificity relationship between ACE2 expression and C. albicans or the selected oral bacteria were also observed. Conclusions: The data show that ACE2 expression can be detected in saliva of patients with COVID-19 and its association with C. albicans and gram-negative oral bacteria might contribute toward developing an oral dysbiosis based predictor for prognosis of COVID-19 severity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">From pedagogical toward technological pedagogical content knowledge frameworks and their effectiveness in teaching mathematics: A mapping review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A study to reveal existing pedagogical or technological pedagogical content knowledge frameworks is crucial to inform and their effectiveness in teaching mathematics. This review study intended to explore the trends of the pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) framework, how it has changed over time until the most recent version of technological and pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) was developed, and its effectiveness in teaching mathematics. Methods: We initially downloaded 273 articles from the first 30 Google Scholar pages and analyzed 229 journal articles. We got 24 frameworks from 64 journal articles since Shulman’s first model in 1986. About 52 out of 229 were mathematics studies. Among these studies, we found that 18 studies have extensively investigated the use of identified frameworks. Results: The frameworks were presented and descriptively discussed in chronological order. The empirical studies that compared the role of pedagogical and technological pedagogical content knowledge models among classrooms with teachers who possess and do not possess such skills were demonstrated. Conclusions: The gap in empirical studies was identified, and further studies about the intervention of PCK and TPACK models were suggested to gain more insight into the mathematics classroom.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence and characteristics of referred pain in patients diagnosed with temporomandibular disorders according to the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD) in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 ap</a></h4>

              
                Background: Referred pain often complicates and delays the diagnosis of temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Elaborating the prevalence and characteristics of TMD-associated referred pain as well as the distribution of referred pain in different TMD classes will significantly improve the diagnostic process. The objectives of the present study were to assess the prevalence and to evaluate the characteristics of referred pain associated with TMD diagnosed according to the DC/TMD. Methods: A total of 252 patients were evaluated using the DC/TMD Axes-I and –II assessment tools. Different modalities were used to treat the diagnosed TMD. Referred pain was diagnosed when the location of the perceived pain in response to palpation extended beyond the boundary of the structure that was examined. For pain locations that were perceived as deep, patients were asked to locate the surface of the area of pain. The result of the assessment was identified as positive if the patient described his perceived pain during the clinical examination as being familiar pain that was experienced in the same location in the last 30 days.  Results: TMD-associated referred pain was recorded in 153 patients (60.7%). The most common referred pain location was the temporal area (45.2%), followed by the ear (42.1%). The referred pain was recorded in disc displacement with reduction with intermittent locking and myofascial pain with referral in all patients (100%). The proportion of patients with referred pain was significantly different between the different TMD diagnostic subgroups (P < 0.001).  The recorded percentage of improvement in the referred pain following the treatment was 50.41% after 3 months and 56.65% after 6 months. Conclusions: Referred pain is a prominent feature of TMD. The prevalence of referred pain associated with TMD was 60.7%.  A strong strength association between the different diagnostic subgroups and the presence of referred pain existed.

                <p>Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease in which pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies (Abs) bind to acetylcholine receptors (AChR) or to functionally related molecules at the neuromuscular junction. B cell expression of the inhibitory IgG receptor, FcγRIIB, maintains peripheral immune tolerance and its absence renders B cells hyperresponsive to autoantigen. Here, we report that FcγRIIB expression levels are substantially reduced in B lineage cells derived from immunotherapy-naïve patients with AChR-Ab<sup>+</sup> early-onset MG (EOMG). In contrast, genetic variants associated with impaired FcγRIIB expression are not enriched in MG, indicating post-transcriptional dysregulation. FcγR-targeted therapies could have therapeutic benefits in MG.</p>

     alt="Quantitative spatial analysis reveals that the local axons of lamina I projection neurons and interneurons exhibit distributions that predict distinct roles in spinal sensory processing"/>
<p>Quantitative analyses of spinal lamina I projection neurons (PNs) and interneurons (INs) revealed almost identical dendritic patterns but local axon collateral distribution patterns that are distinct. INs mostly establish connections within the superficial dorsal horn and may bridge its medial and lateral halves. PNs also relay their input locally, to deeper laminae of the spinal gray matter and may link other ascending systems and participate directly in the nociceptive withdrawal reflex.

</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Our knowledge about the detailed wiring of neuronal circuits in the spinal dorsal horn (DH), where initial sensory processing takes place, is still very sparse. While a substantial amount of data is available on the somatodendritic morphology of DH neurons, the laminar and segmental distribution patterns and consequential function of individual axons are much less characterized. In the present study, we fully reconstructed the axonal and dendritic processes of 10 projection neurons (PNs) and 15 interneurons (INs) in lamina I of the rat, to reveal quantitative differences in their distribution. We also performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to test the predicted function of certain axon collaterals. In line with our earlier qualitative description, we found that lamina I INs in the lateral aspect of the superficial DH send axon collaterals toward the medial part and occupy mostly laminae I–III, providing anatomical basis for a lateromedial flow of information within the DH. Local axon collaterals of PNs were more extensively distributed including dorsal commissural axon collaterals that might refer to those reported earlier linking the lateral aspect of the left and right DHs. PN collaterals dominated the dorsolateral funiculus and laminae IV–VI, suggesting propriospinal and ventral connections. Indeed, patch-clamp recordings confirmed the existence of a dorsoventral excitatory drive upon activation of neurokinin-1 receptors that, although being expressed in various lamina I neurons, are specifically enriched in PNs. In summary, lamina I PNs and INs have almost identical dendritic input fields, while their segmental axon collateral distribution patterns are distinct. INs, whose somata reside in lamina I, establish local connections, may show asymmetry, and contribute to bridging the medial and lateral halves of the DH. PNs, on the other hand, preferably relay their integrated dendritic input to deeper laminae of the spinal gray matter where it might be linked to other ascending pathways or the premotor network, resulting in a putative direct contribution to the nociceptive withdrawal reflex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Phase 1 Evaluation of Elezanumab (anti‐RGMa mAb) in Healthy and MS Participants</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To describe the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of elezanumab (ABT-555), a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against Repulsive Guidance Molecule A (RGMa), in healthy and multiple sclerosis (MS) study participants.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The single-center, first-in-human, single ascending dose (SAD) study evaluated elezanumab (50mg-1600mg IV and 150mg SC) in 47 healthy men and women. The multi-center multiple ascending dose (MAD; NCT02601885) study evaluated elezanumab (150mg, 600mg, and 1800mg) in 20 adult men and women with MS, receiving either maintenance or no immunomodulatory treatment.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>No pattern of study drug-related adverse events were identified for either the SAD or MAD elezanumab regimens. Across both studies, the T<sub>max</sub> occurred within 4 hours of elezanumab IV infusion, and the harmonic mean of t<sub>1/2</sub> ranged between 18.6-67.7 days. Following multiple dosings, elezanumab C<sub>max</sub>, AUC, and C<sub>trough</sub> increased dose-proportionally and resulted in dose-dependent increases in elezanumab CSF concentrations. Elezanumab CSF penetration was 0.1-0.4% across both studies with CSF levels of free RGMa decreased by over 40%. Changes in CSF IL-10 and free RGMa demonstrated dose/exposure-dependence.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The elezanumab pharmacokinetic profile supports monthly, or bi-monthly, administration of up to 1800mg with the option of a loading dose of 3600mg. Elezanumab partitioning into CSF is within the range expected for mAbs. Reduced CSF levels of free RGMa levels demonstrate central nervous system target binding of elezanumab with an apparent maximal effect at 1800mg IV. Exposure-associated increases in CSF IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine with neuroprotective/neurorestorative properties, support potential pathway modulation in MS participants.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Allergic diseases and risk of incident dementia and Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine the associations between the allergic triad (asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis) and risk of dementia.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants comprised 6,785,948 adults aged ≥40 years who participated in a national health examination in 2009 without any history of dementia before baseline. From 2009 to 2017, we prospectively investigated the associations between physician-diagnosed allergic diseases and risk of incident dementia (all-cause, Alzheimer's disease [AD], vascular dementia [VaD]) ascertained using national health insurance claims data.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>During 8.1 years of follow-up, 260,705 dementia cases (195,739 AD, 32,789 VaD) were identified. Allergic diseases were positively associated with dementia risk. Compared with individuals without allergic diseases, multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause dementia were 1.20 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19–1.22) in those with asthma, 1.10 (95% CI, 1.09–1.12) with allergic rhinitis, 1.16 (95% CI, 1.11–1.21) with atopic dermatitis, and 1.13 (95% CI, 1.12–1.14) with any of these allergies. Similarly, individuals with any of the allergic triad had higher risk of AD (HR=1.16; 95% CI, 1.14–1.17) and VaD (HR=1.04; 95% CI, 1.01–1.06) than those without any allergic disease. As the number of comorbid allergic diseases increased, risk of dementia increased linearly (<i>P</i>
<sub>trend</sub> ≤.002). Compared with individuals without allergies, those with all three allergic diseases had substantially increased risk of all-cause dementia (HR=1.54; 95% CI, 1.35–1.75), AD (HR=1.46; 95% CI, 1.25–1.70), and VaD (HR=1.99; 95% CI, 1.44–2.75).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis were significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause dementia and subtypes, with dose-effect relationships with the severity of allergic diseases.</p>

<p>IL-12p40 is acutely upregulated, specifically on astrocytes in the ventro- and dorsomedial regions of the injured cords. IL-12RB1 and IL-12RB2 are expressed early and chronically after SCI expanding from the ventromedial regions throughout the rest of the injured cord. <i>IL-12p40</i>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Secondary damage obstructs functional recovery for individuals who have sustained a spinal cord injury (SCI). Two processes significantly contributing to tissue damage after trauma are spinal cord hemorrhage and inflammation: more specifically, the recruitment and activation of immune cells, frequently driven by pro-inflammatory factors. Cytokines are inflammatory mediators capable of modulating the immune response. While cytokines are necessary to elicit inflammation for proper healing, excessive inflammation can result in destructive processes. The pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 are pathogenic in multiple autoimmune diseases. The cytokine subunit IL-12p40 is necessary to form bioactive IL-12 and IL-23. In this study, we examined the relationship between spinal cord hemorrhage and IL-12-related factors, as well as the impact of IL-12p40 (IL-12/IL-23) on secondary damage and functional recovery after SCI. Using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging and protein tissue analyses, we demonstrated a positive correlation between IL-12 and tissue hemorrhage. Receptor and ligand subunits of IL-12 were significantly upregulated after injury and colocalized with astrocytes, demonstrating a myriad of opportunities for IL-12 to induce an inflammatory response. <i>IL-12p40</i>
<sup>
   <i>−/−</i>
</sup> mice demonstrated significantly improved functional recovery and reduced lesion sizes compared to wild-type mice. Targeted gene array analysis in wild-type and <i>IL-12p40</i>
<sup>
   <i>−/−</i>
</sup> female mice after SCI revealed an upregulation of genes associated with worsened recovery after SCI. Taken together, our data reveal a pathogenic role of IL-12p40 in the secondary damage after SCI, hindering functional recovery. IL-12p40 (IL-12/IL-23) is thus an enticing neuroinflammatory target for further study as a potential therapeutic target to benefit recovery in acute SCI.</p>

                Utilizing in vivo two-photon imaging in behaving mice, Yang et al. reveal that motor learning triggers an emergence of an NPAS4-expressing SST-IN ensemble that regulates the spine remodeling of downstream PNs through disinhibition. Moreover, NPAS4 re-expression is critical in maintaining the functionally distinct SST-IN ensemble throughout the course of learning.

                The <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> adult hermaphrodite germline is surrounded by a thin tube formed by somatic sheath cells that support germ cells as they mature from the stem-like mitotic state through meiosis, gametogenesis, and ovulation. Recently, we discovered that the distal Sh1 sheath cells associate with mitotic germ cells as they exit the niche Gordon et al., 2020. Here, we report that these sheath-associated germ cells differentiate first in animals with temperature-sensitive mutations affecting germ cell state, and stem-like germ cells are maintained distal to the Sh1 boundary. We analyze several markers of the distal sheath, which is best visualized with endogenously tagged membrane proteins, as overexpressed fluorescent proteins fail to localize to distal membrane processes and can cause gonad morphology defects. However, such reagents with highly variable expression can be used to determine the relative positions of the two Sh1 cells, one of which often extends further distal than the other.

                Acid ceramidase (Ac) is part of the sphingolipid metabolism and responsible for the degradation of ceramide. As bioactive molecule, ceramide is involved in the regulation of many cellular processes. However, the impact of cell-intrinsic Ac activity and ceramide on the course of <i>Plasmodium</i> infection remains elusive. Here, we use Ac-deficient mice with ubiquitously increased ceramide levels to elucidate the role of endogenous Ac activity in a murine malaria model. Interestingly, ablation of Ac leads to alleviated parasitemia associated with decreased T cell responses in the early phase of <i>Plasmodium yoelii</i> (<i>P. yoelii</i>) infection. Mechanistically, we identified dysregulated erythropoiesis with reduced numbers of reticulocytes, the preferred host cells of <i>P. yoelii</i>, in Ac-deficient mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that administration of the Ac inhibitor carmofur to wild type mice has similar effects on <i>P. yoelii</i> infection and erythropoiesis. Notably, therapeutic carmofur treatment after manifestation of <i>P. yoelii</i> infection is efficient in reducing parasitemia. Hence, our results provide evidence for the involvement of Ac and ceramide in controlling <i>P. yoelii</i> infection by regulating red blood cell development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Unfolding and identification of membrane proteins in situ</a></h4>

              
                Single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) uses the cantilever tip of an AFM to apply a force able to unfold a single protein. The obtained force-distance curve encodes the unfolding pathway, and from its analysis it is possible to characterize the folded domains. SMFS has been mostly used to study the unfolding of purified proteins, in solution or reconstituted in a lipid bilayer. Here, we describe a pipeline for analyzing membrane proteins based on SMFS, that involves the isolation of the plasma membrane of single cells and the harvesting of force-distance curves directly from it. We characterized and identified the embedded membrane proteins combining, within a Bayesian framework, the information of the shape of the obtained curves, with the information from Mass Spectrometry and proteomic databases. The pipeline was tested with purified/reconstituted proteins and applied to five cell types where we classified the unfolding of their most abundant membrane proteins. We validated our pipeline by overexpressing 4 constructs, and this allowed us to gather structural insights of the identified proteins, revealing variable elements in the loop regions. Our results set the basis for the investigation of the unfolding of membrane proteins <i>in situ</i>, and for performing proteomics from a membrane fragment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Live-cell imaging in human colonic monolayers reveals ERK waves limit the stem cell compartment to maintain epithelial homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                The establishment and maintenance of different cellular compartments in tissues is a universal requirement across all metazoans. Maintaining the correct ratio of cell types in time and space allows tissues to form patterned compartments and perform complex functions. Patterning is especially evident in the human colon, where tissue homeostasis is maintained by stem cells in crypt structures that balance proliferation and differentiation. Here, we developed a human 2D patient derived organoid (PDO) screening platform to study tissue patterning and kinase pathway dynamics in single cells. Using this system, we discovered that waves of ERK signaling induced by apoptotic cells play a critical role in maintaining tissue patterning and homeostasis. If ERK is activated acutely across all cells instead of in wavelike patterns, then tissue patterning and stem cells are lost. Conversely, if ERK activity is inhibited, then stem cells become unrestricted and expand dramatically. This work demonstrates that the colonic epithelium requires coordinated ERK signaling dynamics to maintain patterning and tissue homeostasis. Our work reveals how ERK can antagonize stem cells while supporting cell replacement and the function of the gut.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Time-resolved parameterization of aperiodic and periodic brain activity</a></h4>

              
                Macroscopic neural dynamics comprise both aperiodic and periodic signal components. Recent advances in parameterizing neural power spectra offer practical tools for evaluating these features separately. Although neural signals vary dynamically and express non-stationarity in relation to ongoing behaviour and perception, current methods yield static spectral decompositions. Here, we introduce Spectral Parameterization Resolved in Time (SPRiNT) as a novel method for decomposing complex neural dynamics into periodic and aperiodic spectral elements in a time-resolved manner. First, we demonstrate, with naturalistic synthetic data, SPRiNT’s capacity to reliably recover time-varying spectral features. We emphasize SPRiNT’s specific strengths compared to other time-frequency parameterization approaches based on wavelets. Second, we use SPRiNT to illustrate how aperiodic spectral features fluctuate across time in empirical resting-state EEG data (n=178) and relate the observed changes in aperiodic parameters over time to participants’ demographics and behaviour. Lastly, we use SPRiNT to demonstrate how aperiodic dynamics relate to movement behaviour in intracranial recordings in rodents. We foresee SPRiNT responding to growing neuroscientific interests in the parameterization of time-varying neural power spectra and advancing the quantitation of complex neural dynamics at the natural time scales of behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neural synchronization is strongest to the spectral flux of slow music and depends on familiarity and beat salience</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity in the auditory system synchronizes to sound rhythms, and brain–environment synchronization is thought to be fundamental to successful auditory perception. Sound rhythms are often operationalized in terms of the sound’s amplitude envelope. We hypothesized that – especially for music – the envelope might not best capture the complex spectro-temporal fluctuations that give rise to beat perception and synchronized neural activity. This study investigated (1) neural synchronization to different musical features, (2) tempo-dependence of neural synchronization, and (3) dependence of synchronization on familiarity, enjoyment, and ease of beat perception. In this electroencephalography study, 37 human participants listened to tempo-modulated music (1–4 Hz). Independent of whether the analysis approach was based on temporal response functions (TRFs) or reliable components analysis (RCA), the spectral flux of music – as opposed to the amplitude envelope – evoked strongest neural synchronization. Moreover, music with slower beat rates, high familiarity, and easy-to-perceive beats elicited the strongest neural response. Our results demonstrate the importance of spectro-temporal fluctuations in music for driving neural synchronization, and highlight its sensitivity to musical tempo, familiarity, and beat salience.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">DNA passes through cohesin’s hinge as well as its Smc3–kleisin interface</a></h4>

              
                The ring model proposes that sister chromatid cohesion is mediated by co-entrapment of sister DNAs inside a single tripartite cohesin ring. The model explains how Scc1 cleavage triggers anaphase but has hitherto only been rigorously tested using small circular mini-chromosomes in yeast, where covalently circularizing the ring by crosslinking its three interfaces induces catenation of individual and sister DNAs. If the model applies to real chromatids, then the ring must have a DNA entry gate essential for mitosis. Whether this is situated at the Smc3/Scc1 or Smc1/Smc3 hinge interface is an open question. We have previously demonstrated DNA entrapment by cohesin in vitro (Collier et al., 2020). Here we show that cohesin in fact possesses two DNA gates, one at the Smc3/Scc1 interface and a second at the Smc1/3 hinge. Unlike the Smc3/Scc1 interface, passage of DNAs through SMC hinges depends on both Scc2 and Scc3, a pair of regulatory subunits necessary for entrapment in vivo. This property together with the lethality caused by locking this interface but not that between Smc3 and Scc1 in vivo suggests that passage of DNAs through the hinge is essential for building sister chromatid cohesion. Passage of DNAs through the Smc3/Scc1 interface is necessary for cohesin’s separase-independent release from chromosomes and may therefore largely serve as an exit gate.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The number of cytokinesis nodes in mitotic fission yeast scales with cell size</a></h4>

              
                Cytokinesis nodes are assemblies of stoichiometric ratios of proteins associated with the plasma membrane, which serve as precursors for the contractile ring during cytokinesis by fission yeast. The total number of nodes is uncertain, because of the limitations of the methods used previously. Here, we used the ~140 nm resolution of Airyscan super-resolution microscopy to measure the fluorescence intensity of small, single cytokinesis nodes marked with Blt1-mEGFP in live fission yeast cells early in mitosis. The ratio of the total Blt1-mEGFP fluorescence in the broad band of cytokinesis nodes to the average fluorescence of a single node gives about 190 single cytokinesis nodes in wild-type fission yeast cells early in mitosis. Most, but not all of these nodes condense into a contractile ring. The number of cytokinesis nodes scales with cell size in four strains tested, although large diameter <i>rga4Δ</i> mutant cells form somewhat fewer cytokinesis nodes than expected from the overall trend. The Pom1 kinase restricts cytokinesis nodes from the ends of cells, but the surface density of Pom1 on the plasma membrane around the equators of cells is similar with a wide range of node numbers, so Pom1 does not control cytokinesis node number. However, when the concentrations of either kinase Pom1 or kinase Cdr2 were varied with the <i>nmt1</i> promoter, the numbers of cytokinesis nodes increased above a baseline of about ~190 with the total cellular concentration of either kinase.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Differentiation signals from glia are fine-tuned to set neuronal numbers during development</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuit formation and function require that diverse neurons are specified in appropriate numbers. Known strategies for controlling neuronal numbers involve regulating either cell proliferation or survival. We used the <i>Drosophila</i> visual system to probe how neuronal numbers are set. Photoreceptors from the eye-disc induce their target field, the lamina, such that for every unit eye there is a corresponding lamina unit (column). Although each column initially contains ~6 post-mitotic lamina precursors, only 5 differentiate into neurons, called L1-L5; the 'extra' precursor, which is invariantly positioned above the L5 neuron in each column, undergoes apoptosis. Here, we showed that a glial population called the outer chiasm giant glia (xg<sup>O</sup>), which resides below the lamina, secretes multiple ligands to induce L5 differentiation in response to EGF from photoreceptors. By forcing neuronal differentiation in the lamina, we uncovered that though fated to die, the 'extra' precursor is specified as an L5. Therefore, two precursors are specified as L5s but only one differentiates during normal development. We found that the row of precursors nearest to xg<sup>O</sup> differentiate into L5s and, in turn, antagonise differentiation signalling to prevent the 'extra' precursors from differentiating, resulting in their death. Thus, an intricate interplay of glial signals and feedback from differentiating neurons defines an invariant and stereotyped pattern of neuronal differentiation and programmed cell death to ensure that lamina columns each contain exactly one L5 neuron

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Perceptual learning improves discrimination while distorting appearance</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual learning, a form of adult brain plasticity that produces improved discrimination, has been studied in various tasks and senses. However, it is unknown whether and how this improved discrimination alters stimulus appearance. Here, in addition to a discrimination task, we used an estimation task to investigate how training affects stimulus appearance in human adults. Before and after training, observers were shown stimuli composed of dots moving slightly clockwise or counter-clockwise horizontal, whose appearance has been shown to be biased away from horizontal. Observers were subdivided into three groups: Those who (1) trained in a discrimination task; (2) trained in an estimation task; (3) did not train. Training improved discrimination accuracy and decreased coherence thresholds. Counterintuitively, training also distorted appearance, substantially exacerbating estimation biases. These changes occurred in both training groups (but not in the no-training control group), suggesting a common learning mechanism. We developed a computational observer model that simulates performance on both discrimination and estimation tasks. The model incorporates three components: (1) the internal representation favors cardinal motion directions, which are most common in the natural environment; (2) in the estimation task, observers implicitly categorize motion, conditioning their estimates on this; and (3) both types of training induce an increase in the precision of representation of trained motions. We find that the simulations of the model, fit to individual observer data, can account for their improved discrimination and increased estimation bias. We conclude that perceptual learning improves discrimination while simultaneously distorting appearance.

                Advances in theoretical understanding are frequently unlocked by access to large, diverse experimental datasets. Olfactory neuroscience and psychophysics remain years behind the other senses in part because rich datasets linking olfactory stimuli with their corresponding percepts, behaviors, and neural pathways underlying this transformation, remain scarce. Here we present a concerted effort to unlock and unify dozens of stimulus-linked olfactory datasets across species and modalities under a unified framework called Pyrfume. We present examples of how researchers might use Pyrfume to conduct novel analyses uncovering new principles, introduce trainees to the field, or construct benchmarks for machine olfaction.
