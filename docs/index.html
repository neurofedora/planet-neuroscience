	<p>Accelerated brain aging is a possible mechanism of pathology in schizophrenia. Advances in MRI-based brain development algorithms allow for the calculation of predicted brain age (PBA) for individuals. Here, we assessed PBA in 70 first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum individuals (FESz) and 76 matched healthy neurotypical comparison individuals (HC) to determine if FESz showed advanced aging proximal to psychosis onset and whether PBA was associated with neurocognitive, social functioning, or symptom severity measures. PBA was calculated with BrainAgeR (v2.1) from T1-weighted MR scans. There were no differences in the PBAs between groups. After controlling for actual age, a &amp;amp;ldquo;younger&amp;amp;rdquo; PBA was associated with higher vocabulary scores among all individuals, while an &amp;amp;ldquo;older&amp;amp;rdquo; PBA was associated with more severe negative symptom &amp;amp;ldquo;Inexpressivity&amp;amp;rdquo; component scores among FESz. Female participants in both groups had an elevated PBA relative to male participants. These results suggest that a relatively younger brain age is associated with a better semantic memory performance. There is no evidence for accelerated aging in FESz with a late adolescent/early adult onset. Despite a normative PBA, FESz with a greater residual PBA showed impairments in a cluster of negative symptoms, which may indicate some underlying age-related pathology proximal to psychosis onset. Although a period of accelerated aging cannot be ruled out with disease course, it does not occur at the time of the first episode.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/5/ENEURO.0151-24.2024?rss=1">Comparative Anatomy of the Dentate Mossy Cells in Nonhuman Primates: Their Spatial Distributions and Axonal Projections Compared With Mouse Mossy Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>Glutamatergic mossy cells (MCs) mediate associational and commissural connectivity, exhibiting significant heterogeneity along the septotemporal axis of the mouse dentate gyrus (DG). However, it remains unclear whether the neuronal features of MCs are conserved across mammals. This study compares the neuroanatomy of MCs in the DG of mice and monkeys. The MC marker, calretinin, distinguishes two subpopulations: septal and temporal. Dual-colored fluorescence labeling is utilized to compare the axonal projection patterns of these subpopulations. In both mice and monkeys, septal and temporal MCs project axons across the longitudinal axis of the ipsilateral DG, indicating conserved associational projections. However, unlike in mice, no MC subpopulations in monkeys make commissural projections to the contralateral DG. In monkeys, temporal MCs send associational fibers exclusively to the inner molecular layer, while septal MCs give rise to wide axonal projections spanning multiple molecular layers, akin to equivalent MC subpopulations in mice. Despite conserved septotemporal heterogeneity, interspecies differences are observed in the topological organization of septal MCs, particularly in the relative axonal density in each molecular layer along the septotemporal axis of the DG. In summary, this comparative analysis sheds light on both conserved and divergent features of MCs in the DG of mice and monkeys. These findings have implications for understanding functional differentiation along the septotemporal axis of the DG and contribute to our knowledge of the anatomical evolution of the DG circuit in mammals.</p>

                Background Researchers are focusing their emphasis on quick and real-time healthcare and monitoring systems because of the contemporary modern world’s rapid technological improvements. One of the best options is smart healthcare, which uses a variety of on-body and off-body sensors and gadgets to monitor patients’ health and exchange data with hospitals and healthcare professionals in real time. Utilizing the primary user (PU) spectrum, cognitive radio (CR) can be highly useful for efficient and intelligent healthcare systems to send and receive patient health data. Methods In this work, we propose a method that combines energy detection (ED) and cyclostationary (CS) spectrum sensing (SS) algorithms. This method was used to test spectrum sensing in CR-based smart healthcare systems. The proposed ED-CS in cognitive radio systems improves the precision of the spectrum sensing. Owing to its straightforward implementation, ED is initially used to identify the idle spectrum. If the ED cannot find the idle spectrum, the signals are found using CS-SS, which uses the cyclic statistical properties of the signals to separate the main users from the interference. Results In the simulation analysis, the probability of detection (Pd), probability of a false alarm (Pfa), power spectral density (PSD), and bit error rate (BER) of the proposed ED-CS is compared to those of the traditional Matched Filter (MF), ED, and CS. Conclusions The results indicate that the suggested strategy improves the performance of the framework, making it more appropriate for smart healthcare applications.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012144">Transferable deep generative modeling of intrinsically disordered protein conformations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Giacomo Janson, Michael Feig</p>

Intrinsically disordered proteins have dynamic structures through which they play key biological roles. The elucidation of their conformational ensembles is a challenging problem requiring an integrated use of computational and experimental methods. Molecular simulations are a valuable computational strategy for constructing structural ensembles of disordered proteins but are highly resource-intensive. Recently, machine learning approaches based on deep generative models that learn from simulation data have emerged as an efficient alternative for generating structural ensembles. However, such methods currently suffer from limited transferability when modeling sequences and conformations absent in the training data. Here, we develop a novel generative model that achieves high levels of transferability for intrinsically disordered protein ensembles. The approach, named idpSAM, is a latent diffusion model based on transformer neural networks. It combines an autoencoder to learn a representation of protein geometry and a diffusion model to sample novel conformations in the encoded space. IdpSAM was trained on a large dataset of simulations of disordered protein regions performed with the ABSINTH implicit solvent model. Thanks to the expressiveness of its neural networks and its training stability, idpSAM faithfully captures 3D structural ensembles of test sequences with no similarity in the training set. Our study also demonstrates the potential for generating full conformational ensembles from datasets with limited sampling and underscores the importance of training set size for generalization. We believe that idpSAM represents a significant progress in transferable protein ensemble modeling through machine learning.

                <p>by Tianqi Wei, Qinghai Guo, Barbara Webb</p>

Animals can learn in real-life scenarios where rewards are often only available when a goal is achieved. This ‘distal’ or ‘sparse’ reward problem remains a challenge for conventional reinforcement learning algorithms. Here we investigate an algorithm for learning in such scenarios, inspired by the possibility that axo-axonal gap junction connections, observed in neural circuits with parallel fibres such as the insect mushroom body, could form a resistive network. In such a network, an active node represents the task state, connections between nodes represent state transitions and their connection to actions, and current flow to a target state can guide decision making. Building on evidence that gap junction weights are adaptive, we propose that experience of a task can modulate the connections to form a graph encoding the task structure. We demonstrate that the approach can be used for efficient reinforcement learning under sparse rewards, and discuss whether it is plausible as an account of the insect mushroom body.

                <p>by Santiago A. Cadena, Konstantin F. Willeke, Kelli Restivo, George Denfield, Fabian H. Sinz, Matthias Bethge, Andreas S. Tolias, Alexander S. Ecker</p>

Responses to natural stimuli in area V4—a mid-level area of the visual ventral stream—are well predicted by features from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on image classification. This result has been taken as evidence for the functional role of V4 in object classification. However, we currently do not know if and to what extent V4 plays a role in solving <i>other</i> computational objectives. Here, we investigated normative accounts of V4 (and V1 for comparison) by predicting macaque single-neuron responses to natural images from the representations extracted by 23 CNNs trained on different computer vision tasks including semantic, geometric, 2D, and 3D types of tasks. We found that V4 was best predicted by semantic classification features and exhibited high task selectivity, while the choice of task was less consequential to V1 performance. Consistent with traditional characterizations of V4 function that show its high-dimensional tuning to various 2D and 3D stimulus directions, we found that diverse non-semantic tasks explained aspects of V4 function that are not captured by individual semantic tasks. Nevertheless, jointly considering the features of a pair of semantic classification tasks was sufficient to yield one of our top V4 models, solidifying V4’s main functional role in semantic processing and suggesting that V4’s selectivity to 2D or 3D stimulus properties found by electrophysiologists can result from semantic functional goals.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011973">Modeling oxygen transport in the brain: An efficient coarse-grid approach to capture perivascular gradients in the parenchyma</a></h4>

              
                <p>by David Pastor-Alonso, Maxime Berg, Franck Boyer, Natalie Fomin-Thunemann, Michel Quintard, Yohan Davit, Sylvie Lorthois</p>

Recent progresses in intravital imaging have enabled highly-resolved measurements of periarteriolar oxygen gradients (POGs) within the brain parenchyma. POGs are increasingly used as proxies to estimate the local baseline oxygen consumption, which is a hallmark of cell activity. However, the oxygen profile around a given arteriole arises from an interplay between oxygen consumption and delivery, not only by this arteriole but also by distant capillaries. Integrating such interactions across scales while accounting for the complex architecture of the microvascular network remains a challenge from a modelling perspective. This limits our ability to interpret the experimental oxygen maps and constitutes a key bottleneck toward the inverse determination of metabolic rates of oxygen.
We revisit the problem of parenchymal oxygen transport and metabolism and introduce a simple, conservative, accurate and scalable direct numerical method going beyond canonical Krogh-type models and their associated geometrical simplifications. We focus on a two-dimensional formulation, and introduce the concepts needed to combine an operator-splitting and a Green’s function approach. Oxygen concentration is decomposed into a slowly-varying contribution, discretized by Finite Volumes over a coarse cartesian grid, and a rapidly-varying contribution, approximated analytically in grid-cells surrounding each vessel.
Starting with simple test cases, we thoroughly analyze the resulting errors by comparison with highly-resolved simulations of the original transport problem, showing considerable improvement of the computational-cost/accuracy balance compared to previous work. We then demonstrate the model ability to flexibly generate synthetic data reproducing the spatial dynamics of oxygen in the brain parenchyma, with sub-grid resolution. Based on these synthetic data, we show that capillaries distant from the arteriole cannot be overlooked when interpreting POGs, thus reconciling recent measurements of POGs across cortical layers with the fundamental idea that variations of vascular density within the depth of the cortex may reveal underlying differences in neuronal organization and metabolic load.

                <p>by Shin-Han Shiu, Melissa D. Lehti-Shiu</p>

Scientific advances due to conceptual or technological innovations can be revealed by examining how research topics have evolved. But such topical evolution is difficult to uncover and quantify because of the large body of literature and the need for expert knowledge in a wide range of areas in a field. Using plant biology as an example, we used machine learning and language models to classify plant science citations into topics representing interconnected, evolving subfields. The changes in prevalence of topical records over the last 50 years reflect shifts in major research trends and recent radiation of new topics, as well as turnover of model species and vastly different plant science research trajectories among countries. Our approaches readily summarize the topical diversity and evolution of a scientific field with hundreds of thousands of relevant papers, and they can be applied broadly to other fields.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although the phenomenon of memory formation and recall associated with the use of psychotropic drugs has been extensively studied, mechanisms underlying memories for natural reward have not been clarified. Herein, we test the hypothesis that glutamatergic receptors in the dentate gyrus play a role in memories associated with sucrose. We used pellet self-administration protocol to generate memories in two-port nose-poke discrimination task using male Wistar rats. During non-rewarded probe trial, the conditioned animals readily discriminated the active port versus inactive port and showed massive increase in mRNA expression of AMPA receptor subunit genes (gria2, gria3) as well as c-Fos protein in the DG. Access to sweet pellet further enhanced c-Fos expression in the DG. However, animals pre-treated with AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX (intra-DG), on exposure to operant chamber (no pellet), showed decreased discrimination as well as c-Fos expression. We suggest that AMPA receptors in DG mediate recall and consolidation of memories associated with sucrose consumption. CNQX pre-treated animals, if presented with sweet pellet on nose poke, exhibited high discrimination index coupled with increased c-Fos expression. In these CNQX treated rats, the DI was again decreased following administration of NMDA receptor antagonist AP5. We suggest that, although AMPA receptors are blocked, the access to sweet pellet may induce surge of glutamate in the DG, which in turn may reinstate memories via activation of erstwhile silent synapses in NMDA dependant manner.</p>

                Giez et al. demonstrate that satiety in the ancestral metazoan Hydra is controlled by two distinct neuronal subpopulations and affects behavioral patterns. Both subpopulations show either pre-enteric- or central nervous system-like functions. The study contributes to our understanding of the evolution of the nervous system.

                Ye et al. demonstrate that both the bivalent and tetravalent MPXV mRNA vaccines encoding at least one of EEV and IMV antigens induce robust antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. Furthermore, the two tetravalent vaccines LBAAM and LBA&LAM provide superior protective efficacy against VACV challenge.

">Altered striosome-matrix distribution and activity of striatal cholinergic interneurons in a model of autism-linked repetitive behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Repetitive behaviors are cardinal features of many brain disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We previously associated dysfunction of striatal cholinergic interneurons (SCINs) with repetitive behaviors in a mouse model based on conditional deletion of the ASD-related gene Tshz3 in cholinergic neurons (Chat-cKO). Here, we provide evidence linking SCIN abnormalities to the unique organization of the striatum into striosome and matrix compartments, whose imbalances are implicated in several pathological conditions. Chat-cKO mice exhibit altered relationship between the embryonic birthdate of SCINs and their adult striosome-matrix distribution, leading to an increased proportion of striosomal SCINs. In addition, the ratio of striosomal SCINs with slow-irregular vs. sustained-regular firing is increased, which translates into decreased activity, further stressing the striosome-matrix imbalance. These findings provide novel insights onto the pathogenesis of ASD-related stereotyped behaviors by pointing to abnormal developmental compartmentalization and activity of SCINs as a substrate.

">Decreased cellular excitability of pyramidal tract neurons in primary motor cortex leads to paradoxically increased network activity in simulated parkinsonian motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Decreased excitability of pyramidal tract neurons in layer 5B (PT5B) of primary motor cortex (M1) has recently been shown in a dopamine-depleted mouse model of parkinsonism. We hypothesized that decreased PT5B neuron excitability would substantially disrupt oscillatory and non-oscillatory firing patterns of neurons in layer 5 (L5) of primary motor cortex (M1). To test this hypothesis, we performed computer simulations using a previously validated computer model of mouse M1. Inclusion of the experimentally identified parkinsonism-associated decrease of PT5B excitability into our computational model produced a paradoxical increase in rest-state PT5B firing rate, as well as an increase in beta-band oscillatory power in local field potential (LFP). In the movement-state, PT5B population firing and LFP showed reduced beta and increased high-beta, low-gamma activity of 20-35 Hz in the parkinsonian, but not in control condition. The appearance of beta-band oscillations in parkinsonism would be expected to disrupt normal M1 motor output and contribute to motor activity deficits seen in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

">NMDA receptor activation drives early synapse formation in vivo</a></h4>

              
                The rules governing neural circuit formation in mammalian central nervous systems are poorly understood. NMDA receptors are involved in synaptic plasticity mechanisms in mature neurons, but their contribution to circuit formation and dendritic maturation remains controversial. Using pharmacological and genetic interventions to disrupt NMDA receptor signaling in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in vitro and in vivo, we identify an early critical window for a synapse-specific function in wiring Schaffer collateral connections and dendritic arborization. Through in vivo imaging, we show that NMDA receptors are frequently activated during early development and elicit minute-long calcium transients, which immediately precede the emergence of filopodia. These results demonstrate that NMDA receptors drive synapto- and dendritogenesis during development, challenging the view that these processes are primarily mediated by molecular cues.

">Representation of grasping type and force in the primate motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                The primary motor cortex (M1) is strongly engaged by movement planning and movement execution. However, the role of M1 activity in voluntary grasping is still not completely understood. Here we analyze recordings of M1 neurons during the execution of a delayed reach-to-grasp task, where monkeys had to actively grasp an object with either a side or a precision grip, and then pull it with a low or high amount of force. Single cell and neural populations analyses showed that grip type was robustly and specifically encoded by a large population of neurons, while force level was weakly encoded within mixed-selective neurons that also provided grip type information. Notably, the grip type was stably decoded from motor cortical populations during the preparation and execution epochs of the task. Our results are consistent with the idea that planning and performing specific grasping movements are high-level skills that strongly engage M1 neurons, while the execution of grasping-pulling force might be prominently encoded at lower stages of the motor system.

">Potassium homeostasis during disease progression of Alzheimers Disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers disease (AD) is an age-dependent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuronal loss leading to dementia and ultimately death. Whilst the loss of neurons is central to the disease, it is becoming clear that glia, specifically astrocytes, contribute to the onset and progression of neurodegeneration. Astrocytic role in retaining ion homeostasis in the extracellular milieu is fundamental for multiple brain functions, including synaptic plasticity and neuronal excitability, which are compromised during AD and affect neuronal signalling. In this study, we have measured the astrocytic K+ clearance rate in the hippocampus and somatosensory cortex of a mouse model for AD during disease progression. Our results establish that astrocytic [K+]o clearance in the hippocampus is reduced in symptomatic 5xFAD mice, and this decrease is region-specific. The decrease in the [K+]o clearance rate correlated with a significant reduction in the expression and conductivity of Kir4.1 channels and a decline in the number of primary connected astrocytes. Moreover, astrocytes in the hippocampus of symptomatic 5xFAD mice demonstrated increased reactivity which was accompanied by an increased excitability and altered spiking profile of nearby neurons. These findings indicate that the supportive function astrocytes typically provide to nearby neurons is diminished during disease progression, which affects the neuronal circuit signalling in this area and provides a potential explanation for the increased vulnerability of neurons in AD.

">SH3BP2 regulates the organization of the neuromuscular synapses through protein-driven phase separation</a></h4>

              
                The molecular mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of the neuromuscular junction are poorly understood, even though the malfunction of these specialized synapses is associated with severe genetic and autoimmune disorders. The identity of factors controlling the maintenance mechanisms of postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors (AChR) in high-density has been elusive and is of great interest to the pharma industry, searching for possible new targets for disease interventions. Here, we report the identification of a scaffold protein SH3BP2, which exhibits polyvalent interaction with the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and AChR pentamers, promoting AChR clustering through phase separation. Muscle-specific SH3BP2 deletion in mice leads to impaired organization of the neuromuscular synapses, defects in synaptic transmission, and reduced muscle strength. Our studies identified a novel regulator of the postsynaptic machinery involved in clustering AChR and linking it to the DGC.

">Regulation of dopamine release by tonic activity patterns in the striatal brain slice</a></h4>

              
                Voluntary movement, motivation, and reinforcement learning depend on the activity of ventral midbrain neurons that extend axons to release dopamine (DA) in the striatum. These neurons exhibit two patterns of action potential activity: a low-frequency tonic activity that is intrinsically generated, and superimposed high-frequency phasic bursts that are driven by synaptic inputs. Ex vivo acute striatal brain preparations are widely employed to study the regulation of evoked DA release but exhibit very different DA release kinetics than in vivo recordings. To investigate the relationship between phasic and tonic neuronal activity, we stimulated the slice in patterns intended to mimic tonic activity, which were interrupted by a series of burst stimuli. Conditioning the striatal slice with low-frequency activity altered DA release triggered by high-frequency bursts, and produced kinetic parameters that resemble those in vivo. In the absence of applied tonic activity, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and D2 dopamine receptor antagonists had no significant effect on neurotransmitter release driven by repeated burst activity in the striatal brain slice. In contrast, in tonically stimulated slices, D2 receptor blockade decreased the amount of DA released during a single burst and facilitated DA release in subsequent bursts. This experimental system provides a means to reconcile the difference in the kinetics of DA release ex vivo and in vivo and provides a novel approach to more accurately emulate pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms that control axonal DA release in the acute striatal brain slice.

">A novel mouse home cage lickometer system reveals sex- and housing-based influences on alcohol drinking</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a significant global health issue. Despite historically higher rates among men, AUD prevalence and negative alcohol-related outcomes in women are rising. Loneliness in humans has been associated with increased alcohol use, and traditional rodent drinking models involve single housing, presenting challenges for studying social enrichment. We developed LIQ PARTI (Lick Instance Quantifier with Poly-Animal RFID Tracking Integration), an open-source tool to examine home cage continuous access two-bottle choice drinking behavior in a group-housed setting, investigating the influence of sex and social isolation on ethanol consumption and bout microstructure in C57Bl/6J mice. LIQ PARTI, based on our previously developed single-housed LIQ HD system, accurately tracks drinking behavior using capacitive-based sensors and RFID technology. Group-housed female mice exhibited higher ethanol preference than males, while males displayed a unique undulating pattern of ethanol preference linked to cage changes, suggesting a potential stress-related response. Chronic ethanol intake distinctly altered bout microstructure between male and female mice, highlighting sex and social environmental influences on drinking behavior. Social isolation with the LIQ HD system amplified fluid intake and ethanol preference in both sexes, accompanied by sex- and fluid-dependent changes in bout microstructure. However, these effects largely reversed upon resocialization, indicating the plasticity of these behaviors in response to social context. Utilizing a novel group-housed home cage lickometer device, our findings illustrate the critical interplay of sex and housing conditions in voluntary alcohol drinking behaviors in C57Bl/6J mice, facilitating nuanced insights into the potential contributions to AUD etiology.

">A new GRAB sensor reveals differences in the dynamics and molecular regulation between neuropeptide and neurotransmitter release</a></h4>

              
                The co-existence and co-transmission of neuropeptides and small molecule neurotransmitters in the same neuron is a fundamental aspect of almost all neurons across various species. However, the differences regarding their in vivo spatiotemporal dynamics and underlying molecular regulation remain poorly understood. Here, we developed a GPCR-activation-based (GRAB) sensor for detecting short neuropeptide F (sNPF) with high sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution. Furthermore, we explore the differences of in vivo dynamics and molecular regulation between sNPF and acetylcholine (ACh) from the same neurons. Interestingly, the release of sNPF and ACh shows different spatiotemporal dynamics. Notably, we found that distinct synaptotagmins (Syt) are involved in these two processes, as Syt7 and Sytalpha for sNPF release, while Syt1 for ACh release. Thus, this new GRAB sensor provides a powerful tool for studying neuropeptide release and providing new insights into the distinct release dynamics and molecular regulation between neuropeptides and small molecule neurotransmitters.

">Potential Benefits of Ketone Therapy as a Novel Immunometabolic Treatment for Schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Rationale: Current treatment options for patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSD) remain unsatisfactory, leaving patients with persistent negative and cognitive symptoms and metabolic side effects. Therapeutic ketosis was recently hypothesized to target the bio-energetic pathophysiology of SSD. However, neuro-inflammation plays an important role in the pathobiology of SSD as well. Ideally, novel treatments would target both the bio-energetic, and the inflammatory aspects of SSD. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of ketone bodies on neuro-inflammation in an acute inflammation mouse model. Methods: 8-week-old male C57BL/6 N mice (n=11) were treated with either ketone ester (KE) or vehicle for 3 days. On day 3, a single intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was administered. Mice were euthanized 24 h after LPS/PBS injection. Whole brain gene expression analysis using RT-PCR was done for Tnf-a, Il-6 and Il-1b. Results: LPS caused a potent transcriptional upregulation of Tnf-a, Il-6 and Il-1b in the vehicle-treated mouse brain compared to PBS-injected controls. KE strongly and significantly attenuated the increased transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tnf-a, Il-6 and Il-1b) in the brain upon LPS injection compared to vehicle. Conclusions: KE potently dampened neuro-inflammation in this acute inflammation mouse model. Ketone therapy holds great promise as a treatment for SSD patients by simultaneously targeting two main pathophysiological disease pathways. We encourage more research into the immunometabolic potential of therapeutic ketosis in SSD.

">Contribute to balance, wire in accordance: Emergence of backpropagation from a simple, bio-plausible neuroplasticity rule</a></h4>

              
                Over the past several decades, backpropagation (BP) has played a critical role in the advancement of machine learning and remains a core method in numerous computational applications. It is also utilized extensively in comparative studies of biological and artificial neural network representations. Despite its widespread use, the implementation of BP in the brain remains elusive, and its biological plausibility is often questioned due to inherent issues such as the need for symmetry of weights between forward and backward connections, and the requirement of distinct forward and backward phases of computation. Here, we introduce a novel neuroplasticity rule that offers a potential mechanism for implementing BP in the brain. Similar in general form to the classical Hebbian rule, this rule is based on the core principles of maintaining the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs as well as on retrograde signaling, and operates over three progressively slower timescales: neural firing, retrograde signaling, and neural plasticity. We hypothesize that each neuron possesses an internal state, termed credit, in addition to its firing rate. After achieving equilibrium in firing rates, neurons receive credits based on their contribution to the E-I balance of postsynaptic neurons through retrograde signaling. As the network's credit distribution stabilizes, connections from those presynaptic neurons are strengthened that significantly contribute to the balance of postsynaptic neurons. We demonstrate mathematically that our learning rule precisely replicates BP in layered neural networks without any approximations. Simulations on artificial neural networks reveal that this rule induces varying community structures in networks, depending on the learning rate. This simple theoretical framework presents a biologically plausible implementation of BP, with testable assumptions and predictions that may be evaluated through biological experiments.

">Spatiotemporal transcriptomic maps of mouse intracerebral hemorrhage at single-cell resolution</a></h4>

              
                Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a severe and widespread disease that results in high mortality and morbidity. Despite significant advances made in clinical and preclinical research, the prognosis of ICH remains poor due to an incomplete understanding of the complex pathological responses. To address this challenge, we generated single-cell resolution spatiotemporal transcriptomic maps of mouse brain 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days after ICH. Our analysis revealed the cellular constituents and their dynamic responses following ICH. We found changes in gene expression that are indicative of active phagocytosis and lipid processing in the lesion core and identified genes associated with brain repair at the lesion border. Persistent lipid accumulation culminated in the phenotypic transition of macrophages into foam cells. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that ICH could stimulate neural stem cells in the subventricular zone, thereby enhancing neurogenesis in this niche. This study provides a spatiotemporal molecular atlas of mouse ICH that advances the understanding of both local and global responses of brain cells to ICH and offers a valuable resource that can aid the development of novel therapies for this devastating condition.

">Mapping Large-scale Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Synaptic Plasticity and LTP for Memory Encoding in the Hippocampal Network</a></h4>

              
                Understanding memory formation requires elucidating the intricate dynamics of neuronal networks in the hippocampus, where information is encoded and processed through specific activity patterns and synaptic plasticity. Here, we introduce "EVOX," an advanced network electrophysiology platform equipped with high-density microelectrode arrays to capture critical network-level synaptic dynamics integral to learning and memory. This platform surpasses traditional methods by enabling label-free, high-order mapping of neural interactions, providing unprecedented insights into network Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) and evoked synaptic transmission within the hippocampal network. Utilizing EVOX, we demonstrate that high-frequency stimulation induces network-wide LTP, revealing enhanced synaptic efficacy in previously inactive cell assemblies in hippocampal layers. Our platform enables the real-time observation of network synaptic transmission, capturing the intricate patterns of connectivity and plasticity that underpin memory encoding. Advanced computational techniques further elucidate the mesoscale transmembrane generators and the dynamic processes that govern network-level memory encoding mechanisms. These findings uncover the complex dynamics that underlie learning and memory, showcasing EVOX's potential to explore synaptic and cellular phenomena in aging circuits. EVOX not only advances our understanding of hippocampal memory mechanisms but also serves as a powerful tool to investigate the broader scope of neural plasticity and network interactions in healthy and diseased states.

">Automated inference of disease mechanisms in patient-hiPSC-derived neuronal networks</a></h4>

              
                Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)-derived neurons offer a valuable platform for studying neurological disorders in a patient-specific manner. These neurons can be rapidly differentiated into excitatory neuronal networks, whose activity is measurable using multi-electrode arrays (MEAs). Neuronal networks derived from patients exhibit distinct characteristics, reflecting underlying pathological molecular mechanisms. However, elucidating these mechanisms traditionally requires extensive and hypothesis-driven additional experiments. Computational models can link observable network activity to underlying molecular mechanisms by identifying biophysical model parameters that simulate the activity, but this identification process is challenging. Here, we address this challenge by using simulation-based inference (SBI), a machine-learning approach, to automatically identify the full range of model parameters able to explain the patient-derived MEA activity. Our study demonstrates that SBI can accurately identify ground-truth parameters in simulated data, and successfully estimate the parameters that replicate the network activity of healthy hiPSC-derived neuronal networks. Furthermore, we show that SBI can pinpoint molecular mechanisms affected by pharmacological agents and identify key disease mechanisms in neuronal networks derived from patients. These findings underscore the potential of SBI to automate and enhance the identification of disease mechanisms from MEA measurements, offering a robust and scalable method for advancing research with hiPSC-derived neuronal networks.

">Functional Activity, Functional Connectivity and Complex Network Biomarkers of Progressive Hyposmia Parkinson's Disease with No Cognitive Impairment: Evidences from Resting-state fMRI Study</a></h4>

              
                Background: Olfactory dysfunction stands as one of the most prevalent non-motor symptoms in the initial stage of Parkinson's disease (PD). Nevertheless, the intricate mechanisms underlying olfactory deficits in Parkinson's disease still remain elusive. Methods: This study collected rs-fMRI data from 30 PD patients (15 with severe hyposmia (PD-SH) and 15 with no/mild hyposmia (PD-N/MH)) and 15 healthy controls (HC). To investigate functional segregation, the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) were utilized. Functional connectivity (FC) analysis was performed to explore the functional integration across diverse brain regions. Additionally, the graph theory-based network analysis was employed to assess functional networks in PD patients. Furthermore, Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to delve deeper into the relationship between the severity of olfactory dysfunction and various functional metrics. Results: Firstly, PD patients showed significantly higher ALFF values in the superior temporal gyrus compared to HC, especially in the PD-SH group versus PD-N/MH. Meanwhile, ALFF values in this region negatively correlated with olfactory testing scores. Secondly, PD patients had higher ReHo in middle temporal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus than HC, especially PD-SH. Meanwhile, olfactory scores negatively correlated with these ReHo values. Thirdly, we observed a negative correlation between superior cerebellar-insula connectivity and olfactory scores, suggesting a neural circuit link to olfactory dysfunction. Lastly, the PD patients' brain networks consistently showed small-world attributes, with the PD-N/MH group having significantly higher nodal betweenness in the superior cerebellum than the PD-SH group. There's also a positive link between superior cerebellum's betweenness and olfactory scores. Additionally, there is a notable difference in the node degree of the superior temporal gyrus when comparing the PD-SH group to the PD-N/MH group. Conclusion: Using fMRI, our study analyzed brain function in PD-SH, PD-N/MH, and HC groups, revealing impaired segregation and integration in PD-SH and PD-N/MH. We hypothesize that changes in temporal, frontal, occipital, and cerebellar activities, along with aberrant cerebellum-insula connectivity and node degree and betweenness disparities, may be linked to olfactory dysfunction in PD patients.

">TRIM46 is not required for axon specification or axon initial segment formation in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Vertebrate nervous systems use the axon initial segment (AIS) to initiate action potentials and maintain neuronal polarity. The microtubule-associated protein tripartite motif containing 46 (TRIM46) was reported to regulate axon specification, AIS assembly, and neuronal polarity through the bundling of microtubules in the proximal axon. However, these claims are based on TRIM46 knockdown in cultured neurons. To investigate TRIM46 function in vivo, we examined TRIM46 knockout mice. Contrary to previous reports, we find that TRIM46 is dispensable for AIS formation and maintenance, and axon specification. TRIM46 knockout mice are viable, have normal behavior, and have normal brain structure. Thus, TRIM46 is not required for AIS formation, axon specification, or nervous system function. We also show TRIM46 enrichment in the first ~100 m of axon occurs independently of ankyrinG (AnkG), although AnkG is required to restrict TRIM46 only to the AIS. Our results suggest an unidentified protein may compensate for loss of TRIM46 in vivo and highlight the need for further investigation of the mechanisms by which the AIS and microtubules interact to shape neuronal structure and function.

">The individual determinants of morning dream recall</a></h4>

              
                Evidence suggests that (almost) everyone dreams during their sleep and may actually do so for a large part of the night. Yet, dream recall shows large interindividual variability. Understanding the factors that influence dream recall is crucial for advancing our knowledge regarding dreams' origin, significance, and functions. Here, we tackled this issue by prospectively collecting dream reports along with demographic information and psychometric, cognitive, actigraphic, and electroencephalographic measures in 204 healthy adults (18-70 y, 113 females). We found that attitude towards dreaming, proneness to mind wandering, and sleep patterns are associated with the probability of reporting a dream upon morning awakening. The likelihood of recalling dream content was predicted by age and vulnerability to interference. Moreover, dream recall appeared to be influenced by night-by-night changes in sleep patterns and showed seasonal fluctuations. Our results provide an account for previous observations regarding inter- and intra-individual variability in morning dream recall.

">A dorsal versus ventral network for understanding others in the developing brain</a></h4>

              
                Young children strongly depend on others, and learning to understand their mental states (referred to as Theory of Mind, ToM) is a key challenge of early cognitive development. Traditionally, ToM is thought to emerge around the age of 4 years. Yet, in non-verbal tasks, preverbal infants already seem to consider others' mental states when predicting their actions. These early non-verbal capacities, however, seem fragile and distinct from later-developing verbal ToM. So far, little is known about the nature of these early capacities and the neural networks supporting them. To identify these networks, we investigated the maturation of nerve fiber connections associated with children's correct non-verbal action prediction and compared them with connections supporting verbal ToM reasoning in 3- to 4-year-old children, that is, before and after their breakthrough in verbal ToM. This revealed a ventral network for non-verbal action prediction versus a dorsal network for verbal ToM. Non-verbal capacities were associated with maturational indices in ventral fiber tracts connecting regions of the salience network, involved in bottom-up social attention processes. In contrast, verbal ToM performance correlated with maturational indices of the arcuate fascicle and cingulum, which dorsally connect regions of the default network, involved in higher-order social cognitive processes including ToM in adults. As non-verbal tasks were linked to connections of the salience network, young children may make use of salient perceptual social cues to predict others' actions, questioning theories of mature ToM before 4 years.

">The fingerprints of pupillary dynamics</a></h4>

              
                The size of the pupils reflects directly the balance of different branches of the autonomic nervous system. This measure is inexpensive, non-invasive, and has provided invaluable insights on a wide range of mental processes, from attention to emotion and executive functions. Two outstanding limitations of current pupillometry research are the lack of consensus in the analytical approaches, which vary wildly across research groups, and the fact that, unlike other neuroimaging techniques, pupillometry lacks the dimensionality to shed light on the different sources of the observed effects. In other words, pupillometry provides an integrated readout of several distinct networks (Strauch et al., 2022), but it is unclear whether each has a specific fingerprint, stemming from its function or physiological substrate. Here we show that phasic changes in pupil size are inherently low-dimensional, with modes that are highly consistent across behavioral tasks of very different nature, suggesting that these changes occur along a pupillary manifold that is highly constrained by the underlying physiological structures. These results provide not only a unified approach to analyze pupillary data, for which we offer a toolbox, but also the opportunity to delve deeper into the sources of the reported changes in pupil size.

">Human neural dynamics of real-world and imagined navigation</a></h4>

              
                The ability to form episodic memories and later imagine them is integral to the human experience, influencing our recollection of the past and our ability to envision the future. While research on spatial navigation in rodents suggests the involvement of the medial temporal lobe (MTL), especially the hippocampus, in these cognitive functions, it is uncertain if these insights apply to the human MTL, especially regarding imagination and the reliving of events. Importantly, by involving human participants, imaginations can be explicitly instructed and their mental experiences verbally reported. In this study, we investigated the role of hippocampal theta oscillations in both real-world and imagined navigation, leveraging motion capture and intracranial electroencephalographic recordings from individuals with chronically implanted MTL electrodes who could move freely. Our results revealed intermittent theta dynamics, particularly within the hippocampus, which encoded spatial geometry and partitioned navigational routes into linear segments during real-world navigation. During imagined navigation, theta dynamics exhibited similar, repetitive patterns despite the absence of external environmental cues. Furthermore, a computational model, generalizing from real-world to imagined navigation, successfully reconstructed participants' imagined positions using neural data. These findings offer unique insights into the neural mechanisms underlying human navigation and imagination, with implications for understanding episodic memory formation and retrieval in real-world settings.

">Meta-Control Demands Deactivate Cognitive-Control Regions</a></h4>

              
                Control interventions (e.g., attention, inhibition) are well-known to activate frontoparietal regions and increase pupil size. Here, we characterize a different facet of cognitive-control that deactivates these very same regions and decreases pupil size. Control interventions always occur in the context of extended task episodes (e.g., block of trials). Since these extended episodes are controlled and executed as one entity, the various control interventions made across their duration are brought about via common goal-directed programs. These programs are instantiated at the beginning of the episode and are the means of organizing and controlling the numerous control interventions to be made across the task duration. These programs, therefore, are meta-control in function in that they control and organize the control interventions to be made across the task episode. Difficult episodes begin with the instantiation of more complex programs that will go on to bring about a more complex set of control interventions. Across four experiments, we show that while the instantiation of more complex control interventions during difficult task episodes expectedly activated control-related frontoparietal regions and increased pupil size, instantiation of more complex programs at the beginning of these episodes deactivated these very regions and decreased pupil size. Neural and psychophysiological signatures of the meta-control programs are thus categorically different from those of control interventions made through these programs.

">Multifaceted confidence in exploratory choice</a></h4>

              
                Our choices are typically accompanied by a feeling of confidence - an internal estimate that they are correct. Correctness, however, depends on our goals. For example, exploration-exploitation problems entail a tension between short- and long-term goals: finding out about the value of one option could mean foregoing another option that is apparently more rewarding. Here, we hypothesised that after making an exploratory choice that involves sacrificing an immediate gain, subjects will be confident that they chose a better option for long-term rewards, but not confident that it was a better option for immediate reward. We asked 250 subjects across 2 experiments to perform a varying-horizon two-arm bandits task, in which we asked them to rate their confidence that their choice would lead to more immediate, or more total reward. Confirming previous studies, we found a significant increase in exploration with increasing trial horizon, but, contrary to our predictions, we found no difference between confidence in immediate or total reward. This dissociation is further evidence for a separation in the mechanisms involved in choices and confidence judgements.

">The Effects of Locus Coeruleus Optogenetic Stimulation on Global Spatiotemporal Patterns in Rats</a></h4>

              
                Whole-brain intrinsic activity as detected by resting-state fMRI can be summarized by three primary spatiotemporal patterns. These patterns have been shown to change with different brain states, especially arousal. The noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) is a key node in arousal circuits and has extensive projections throughout the brain, giving it neuromodulatory influence over the coordinated activity of structurally separated regions. In this study, we used optogenetic-fMRI in rats to investigate the impact of LC stimulation on the global signal and three primary spatiotemporal patterns. We report small, spatially specific changes in global signal distribution as a result of tonic LC stimulation, as well as regional changes in spatiotemporal patterns of activity at 5 Hz tonic and 15 Hz phasic stimulation. We also found that LC stimulation had little to no effect on the spatiotemporal patterns detected by complex principal component analysis. These results show that the effects of LC activity on the BOLD signal in rats may be small and regionally concentrated, as opposed to widespread and globally acting.

">Selective Functional Connectivity between Ocular Dominance Columns in the Primary Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The primary visual cortex (V1) in humans and many animals is comprised of fine-scale neuronal ensembles that respond preferentially to the stimulation of one eye over the other, also known as the ocular dominance columns (ODCs). Despite its importance in shaping our perception, to date, the nature of the functional interactions between ODCs has remained poorly understood. In this work, we aimed to improve our understanding of the interaction mechanisms between fine-scale neuronal structures distributed within V1. To that end, we applied high-resolution functional MRI to study mechanisms of functional connectivity between ODCs. Using this technique, we quantified the level of functional connectivity between ODCs as a function of the ocular preference of ODCs, showing that alike ODCs are functionally more connected compared to unalike ones. Through these experiments, we aspired to contribute to filling the gap in our knowledge of the functional connectivity of ODCs in humans as compared to animals.

">Cortical tracking of speakers' formant changes predicts selective listening</a></h4>

              
                A social scene is particularly informative when people are distinguishable. To understand somebody amid a 'cocktail party' chatter, we automatically index their voice. This ability is underpinned by parallel processing of vocal spectral contours from speech sounds, but it has not yet been established how this occurs in the brain's cortex. We investigate single-trial neural tracking of slow modulations in speech formants using electroencephalography. Participants briefly listened to unfamiliar single speakers, and in addition, they performed a cocktail party comprehension task. Quantified through stimulus reconstruction methods, robust tracking was found in neural responses to slow (delta-theta range) modulations of the fourth and fifth formant band contours equivalent to the 3.5-5 KHz audible range. Instantaneous inter-formant spacing (Delta-F), which also yields indexical information from the vocal tract, was similarly decodable. Moreover, EEG evidence of listeners' spectral tracking abilities predicted their chances of succeeding at selective listening when faced with two-speaker speech mixtures. In summary, the results indicate that the communicating brain can rely on locking of cortical rhythms to major changes led by upper resonances of the vocal tract. Their corresponding articulatory mechanics hence continuously issue a fundamental credential for listeners to target in real time.

">Sex and the facilitation of cued fear by prior contextual fear conditioning in rats</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have shown that the formation of new memories can be influenced by prior experience. This includes work using pavlovian fear conditioning in rodents that have shown that an initial fear conditioning experience can become associated with and facilitate the acquisition of new fear memories, especially when they occur close together in time. However, most of the prior studies used only males as subjects resulting in questions about the generalizability of the findings from this work. Here we tested whether prior contextual fear conditioning would facilitate later learning of cued fear conditioning in both male and female rats, and if there were differences based on the interval between the two conditioning episodes. Our results showed that levels of cued fear were not influenced by prior contextual fear conditioning or by the interval between training, however, females showed lower levels of cued fear. Freezing behavior in the initial training context differed by sex, with females showing lower levels of contextual fear, and by the type of initial training, with rats given delayed shock showing higher levels of fear than rats given immediate shock during contextual fear conditioning. These results indicate that contextual fear conditioning does not prime subsequent cued fear conditioning and that female rats express lower levels of cued and contextual fear conditioning than males.

">Continuous and discrete decoding of overt speech with electroencephalography</a></h4>

              
                Neurological disorders affecting speech production adversely impact quality of life for over 7 million individuals in the US. Traditional speech interfaces like eyetracking devices and P300 spellers are slow and unnatural for these patients. An alternative solution, speech Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), directly decodes speech characteristics, offering a more natural communication mechanism. This research explores the feasibility of decoding speech features using non-invasive EEG. Nine neurologically intact participants were equipped with a 63-channel EEG system with additional sensors to eliminate eye artifacts. Participants read aloud sentences displayed on a screen selected for phonetic similarity to the English language. Deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks with/without attention modules, were optimized with a focus on minimizing trainable parameters and utilizing small input window sizes. These models were employed for discrete and continuous speech decoding tasks, achieving above-chance participant-independent decoding performance for discrete classes and continuous characteristics of the produced audio signal. A frequency sub-band analysis highlighted the significance of certain frequency bands (delta, theta, and gamma) for decoding performance, and a perturbation analysis identified crucial channels. Assessed channel selection methods did not significantly improve performance, but they still outperformed chance levels, suggesting a distributed representation of speech information encoded in the EEG signals. Leave-One-Out training demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing common speech neural correlates, reducing data collection requirements from individual participants.

">Top-down and bottom-up interactions rely on nested brain oscillations.</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive visual processing is enabled through the dynamic interplay between top-down and bottom-up (feedback/feedforward) information exchange, presumably propagated through brain oscillations. Here we causally tested for the oscillatory mechanisms governing this interaction in the visual system. Using concurrent TMS-EEG, we emulated top-down signals by a single TMS-pulse over the Frontal Eye Field (right-FEF), while manipulating the strength of sensory input through the presentation of moving concentric gratings (compared to a control-TMS site). FEF-TMS without sensory input led to a top-down controlled occipital phase-realignment, alongside higher fronto-occipital phase-connectivity, in the alpha/beta-band. Sensory input in the absence of FEF-TMS increased occipital gamma activity. Crucially, testing the interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes (FEF-TMS during sensory input) revealed an increased nesting of the bottom-up gamma activity in the alpha/beta-band cycles. This establishes a causal link between phase-to-power coupling and top-down modulation of feedforward signals, providing novel mechanistic insights into how attention interacts with sensory input at the neural level, shaping rhythmic sampling.

">Quantifying Population-level Neural Tuning Functions Using Ricker Wavelets and the Bayesian Bootstrap</a></h4>

              
                Experience changes the tuning of sensory neurons, including neurons in retinotopic visual cortex, as evident from work in humans and non-human animals. In human observers, visuo-cortical re-tuning has been studied during aversive generalization learning paradigms, in which the similarity of generalization stimuli (GSs) with a conditioned threat cue (CS+) is used to quantify tuning functions. This work utilized pre-defined tuning shapes reflecting prototypical generalization (Gaussian) and sharpening (Difference-of-Gaussians) patterns. This approach may constrain the ways in which re-tuning can be characterized, for example if tuning patterns do not match the prototypical functions or represent a mixture of functions. The present study proposes a flexible and data-driven method for precisely quantifying changes in neural tuning based on the Ricker wavelet function and the Bayesian bootstrap. The method is illustrated using data from a study in which university students (n = 31) performed an aversive generalization learning task. Oriented gray-scale gratings served as CS+ and GSs and a white noise served as the unconditioned stimulus (US). Acquisition and extinction of the aversive contingencies were examined, while steady-state visual event potentials (ssVEP) and alpha-band (8-13 Hz) power were measured from scalp EEG. Results showed that the Ricker wavelet model fitted the ssVEP and alpha-band data well. The pattern of re-tuning in ssVEP amplitude across the stimulus gradient resembled a generalization (Gaussian) shape in acquisition and a sharpening (Difference-of-Gaussian) shape in an extinction phase. As expected, the pattern of re-tuning in alpha-power took the form of a generalization shape in both phases. The Ricker-based approach led to greater Bayes factors and more interpretable results compared to prototypical tuning models. The results highlight the promise of the current method for capturing the precise nature of visuo-cortical tuning functions, unconstrained by the exact implementation of prototypical a-priori models.

">Norepinephrine changes behavioral state via astroglial purinergic signaling</a></h4>

              
                Both neurons and glia communicate via diffusible neuromodulatory substances, but the substrates of computation in such neuromodulatory networks are unclear. During behavioral transitions in the larval zebrafish, the neuromodulator norepinephrine drives fast excitation and delayed inhibition of behavior and circuit activity. We find that the inhibitory arm of this feedforward motif is implemented by astroglial purinergic signaling. Neuromodulator imaging, behavioral pharmacology, and perturbations of neurons and astroglia reveal that norepinephrine triggers astroglial release of adenosine triphosphate, extracellular conversion into adenosine, and behavioral suppression through activation of hindbrain neuronal adenosine receptors. This work, along with a companion piece by Lefton and colleagues demonstrating an analogous pathway mediating the effect of norepinephrine on synaptic connectivity in mice, identifies a computational and behavioral role for an evolutionarily conserved astroglial purinergic signaling axis in norepinephrine-mediated behavioral and brain state transitions.

	<p>Reproducing instructed movements is crucial for practice in motor learning. In this study, we compared the short-term reproduction of active pelvis movements with visual feedback and passive movement with the therapist&amp;amp;rsquo;s hands in an upright stance. Sixteen healthy males (M age = 34.1; SD = 10.2 years) participated in this study. In one condition, healthy males maintained an upright stance while a physical therapist moved the participant&amp;amp;rsquo;s pelvis (passive movement instruction), and in a second condition, the participant actively moved their pelvis with visual feedback of the target and the online trajectory of the center of pressure (active movement instruction). Reproduction errors (displacement of the center of pressure in the medial&amp;amp;ndash;lateral axis) 10 s after the passive movement instruction were significantly greater than after the active movement instruction (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), but this difference disappeared 30 s after the instruction (p = 0.118). Error of movement reproduction in the anterior&amp;amp;ndash;posterior axis after the passive movement instruction was significantly greater than after the active movement instruction, no matter how long the retention interval was between the instruction and reproduction phases (p = 0.025). Taken together, active pelvis movements with visual feedback, rather than passive movement with the therapist&amp;amp;rsquo;s hand, is better to be used for instructing pelvis movements.</p>

	<p>Background: Conservative therapy is currently the elective treatment for peripheric facial palsy according to scientific literature. The success of conservative therapy is due to physiotherapy and the application of its methods. The aim of this systematic review was to assess mirror therapy, a physiotherapeutic method. Objectives: The aim of the following systematic review is to evaluate the effectiveness of using mirror therapy in patients with peripheral paralysis of the seventh cranial nerve. Methods: This systematic review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The screening of literature was carried out on Cochrane, PEDro, PubMed/Medline, Scopus and Web of Science databases up until August 2022. All studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 5 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. The risk of bias was evaluated with PEDro and Jadad scales. Discussion: In the present study, we reviewed 5 RCTs that compared mirror therapy with other physiotherapy treatments or placebo to reduce pain, depression and improve range of motion in patients with peripheric facial nerve palsy. Conclusions: Further studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of this type of treatment, but nevertheless the data obtained are very encouraging.</p>

                <p>From deciding which meal to prepare for our guests to trading off the proenvironmental effects of climate protection measures against their economic costs, we often must consider the consequences of our actions for the well-being of others (welfare). Vexingly, the tastes and views of others can vary widely. To maximize welfare according to the utilitarian philosophical tradition, decision-makers facing conflicting preferences of others should choose the option that maximizes the sum of the subjective value (utility) of the entire group. This notion requires comparing the intensities of preferences across individuals. However, it remains unclear whether such comparisons are possible at all and (if they are possible) how they might be implemented in the brain. Here, we show that female and male participants can both learn the preferences of others by observing their choices and represent these preferences on a common scale to make utilitarian welfare decisions. On the neural level, multivariate support vector regressions revealed that a distributed activity pattern in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), a brain region previously associated with reward processing, represented the preference strength of others. Strikingly, also the utilitarian welfare of others was represented in the VMPFC and relied on the same neural code as the estimated preferences of others. Together, our findings reveal that humans can behave as if they maximized utilitarian welfare using a specific utility representation and that the brain enables such choices by repurposing neural machinery processing the reward others receive.</p>

                <p>Information seeking, such as standing on tiptoes to look around in humans, is observed across animals and helps survival. Its rodent analog&mdash;unsupported rearing on hind legs&mdash;was a classic model in deciphering neural signals of cognition and is of intense renewed interest in preclinical modeling of neuropsychiatric states. Neural signals and circuits controlling this dedicated decision to seek information remain largely unknown. While studying subsecond timing of spontaneous behavioral acts and activity of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons (MNs) in behaving male and female mice, we observed large MN activity spikes that aligned to unsupported rears. Complementary causal, loss and gain of function, analyses revealed specific control of rear frequency and duration by MNs and MCHR1 receptors. Activity in a key stress center of the brain&mdash;the locus ceruleus noradrenaline cells&mdash;rapidly inhibited MNs and required functional MCH receptors for its endogenous modulation of rearing. By defining a neural module that both tracks and controls rearing, these findings may facilitate further insights into biology of information seeking.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/21/e0136242024?rss=1">Calcium-Dependent Regulation of Neuronal Excitability Is Rescued in Fragile X Syndrome by a Tat-Conjugated N-Terminal Fragment of FMRP</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) arises from the loss of fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) needed for normal neuronal excitability and circuit functions. Recent work revealed that FMRP contributes to mossy fiber long-term potentiation by adjusting the Kv4 A-type current availability through interactions with a Cav3-Kv4 ion channel complex, yet the mechanism has not yet been defined. In this study using wild-type and <I>Fmr1</I> knock-out (KO) tsA-201 cells and cerebellar sections from male <I>Fmr1</I> KO mice, we show that FMRP associates with all subunits of the Cav3.1-Kv4.3-KChIP3 complex and is critical to enabling calcium-dependent shifts in Kv4.3 inactivation to modulate the A-type current. Specifically, upon depolarization Cav3 calcium influx activates dual-specific phosphatase 1/6 (DUSP1/6) to deactivate ERK1/2 (ERK) and lower phosphorylation of Kv4.3, a signaling pathway that does not function in <I>Fmr1</I> KO cells. In <I>Fmr1</I> KO mouse tissue slices, cerebellar granule cells exhibit a hyperexcitable response to membrane depolarizations. Either incubating <I>Fmr1</I> KO cells or in vivo administration of a tat-conjugated FMRP N-terminus fragment (FMRP-N-tat) rescued Cav3-Kv4 function and granule cell excitability, with a decrease in the level of DUSP6. Together these data reveal a Cav3-activated DUSP signaling pathway critical to the function of a FMRP-Cav3-Kv4 complex that is misregulated in <I>Fmr1</I> KO conditions. Moreover, FMRP-N-tat restores function of this complex to rescue calcium-dependent control of neuronal excitability as a potential therapeutic approach to alleviating the symptoms of FXS.</p>

                <p>Memories are thought to be stored in neural ensembles known as engrams that are specifically reactivated during memory recall. Recent studies have found that memory engrams of two events that happened close in time tend to overlap in the hippocampus and the amygdala, and these overlaps have been shown to support memory linking. It has been hypothesized that engram overlaps arise from the mechanisms that regulate memory allocation itself, involving neural excitability, but the exact process remains unclear. Indeed, most theoretical studies focus on synaptic plasticity and little is known about the role of intrinsic plasticity, which could be mediated by neural excitability and serve as a complementary mechanism for forming memory engrams. Here, we developed a rate-based recurrent neural network that includes both synaptic plasticity and neural excitability. We obtained structural and functional overlap of memory engrams for contexts that are presented close in time, consistent with experimental and computational studies. We then investigated the role of excitability in memory allocation at the network level and unveiled competitive mechanisms driven by inhibition. This work suggests mechanisms underlying the role of intrinsic excitability in memory allocation and linking, and yields predictions regarding the formation and the overlap of memory engrams.</p>

                <p>Hand movements are associated with modulations of neuronal activity across several interconnected cortical areas, including the primary motor cortex (M1) and the dorsal and ventral premotor cortices (PMd and PMv). Local field potentials (LFPs) provide a link between neuronal discharges and synaptic inputs. Our current understanding of how LFPs vary in M1, PMd, and PMv during contralateral and ipsilateral movements is incomplete. To help reveal unique features in the pattern of modulations, we simultaneously recorded LFPs in these areas in two macaque monkeys performing reach and grasp movements with either the right or left hand. The greatest effector-dependent differences were seen in M1, at low (&le;13&nbsp;Hz) and  frequencies. In premotor areas, differences related to hand use were only present in low frequencies. PMv exhibited the greatest increase in low frequencies during instruction cues and the smallest effector-dependent modulation during movement execution. In PMd,  oscillations were greater during contralateral reach and grasp, and &beta; activity increased during contralateral grasp. In contrast, &beta; oscillations decreased in M1 and PMv. These results suggest that while M1 primarily exhibits effector-specific LFP activity, premotor areas compute more effector-independent aspects of the task requirements, particularly during movement preparation for PMv and production for PMd. The generation of precise hand movements likely relies on the combination of complementary information contained in the unique pattern of neural modulations contained in each cortical area. Accordingly, integrating LFPs from premotor areas and M1 could enhance the performance and robustness of brain-machine interfaces.</p>

                <p>Left-sided spatial neglect is a very common and challenging issue after right-hemispheric stroke, which strongly and negatively affects daily living behavior and recovery of stroke survivors. The mechanisms underlying recovery of spatial neglect remain controversial, particularly regarding the involvement of the intact, contralesional hemisphere, with potential contributions ranging from maladaptive to compensatory. In the present prospective, observational study, we assessed neglect severity in 54 right-hemispheric stroke patients (32 male; 22 female) at admission to and discharge from inpatient neurorehabilitation. We demonstrate that the interaction of initial neglect severity and spared white matter (dis)connectivity resulting from individual lesions (as assessed by diffusion tensor imaging, DTI) explains a significant portion of the variability of poststroke neglect recovery. In mildly impaired patients, spared structural connectivity within the lesioned hemisphere is sufficient to attain good recovery. Conversely, in patients with severe impairment, successful recovery critically depends on structural connectivity within the intact hemisphere and between hemispheres. These distinct patterns, mediated by their respective white matter connections, may help to reconcile the dichotomous perspectives regarding the role of the contralesional hemisphere as exclusively compensatory or not. Instead, they suggest a unified viewpoint wherein the contralesional hemisphere can &ndash; but must not necessarily &ndash; assume a compensatory role. This would depend on initial impairment severity and on the available, spared structural connectivity. In the future, our findings could serve as a prognostic biomarker for neglect recovery and guide patient-tailored therapeutic approaches.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/21/e1337232024?rss=1">Risk-Taking Is Associated with Decreased Subjective Value Signals and Increased Prediction Error Signals in the Hot Columbia Card Task</a></h4>

              
                <p>It remains a pressing concern to understand how neural computations relate to risky decisions. However, most observations of brain&ndash;behavior relationships in the risk-taking domain lack a rigorous computational basis or fail to emulate of the dynamic, sequential nature of real-life risky decision-making. Recent advances emphasize the role of neural prediction error (PE) signals. We modeled, according to prospect theory, the choices of <I>n</I> = 43 human participants (33 females, 10 males) performing an EEG version of the hot Columbia Card Task, featuring rounds of sequential decisions between stopping (safe option) and continuing with increasing odds of a high loss (risky option). Single-trial regression EEG analyses yielded a subjective value signal at centroparietal (300&ndash;700&nbsp;ms) and frontocentral (&gt;800&nbsp;ms) electrodes and in the delta band, as well as PE signals tied to the feedback-related negativity, P3a, and P3b, and in the theta band. Higher risk preference (total number of risky choices) was linked to attenuated subjective value signals but increased PE signals. Higher P3-like activity associated with the most positive PE in each round predicted stopping in the present round but not risk-taking in the subsequent round. Our findings indicate that decreased representation of decision values and increased sensitivity to winning despite low odds (positive PE) facilitate risky choices at the subject level. Strong neural responses when gains are least expected (the most positive PE on each round) adaptively contribute to safer choices at the trial-by-trial level but do not affect risky choice at the round-by-round level.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/21/e1395232024?rss=1">Temporal Sensitivity for Achromatic and Chromatic Flicker across the Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>The retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) receive different combinations of L, M, and S cone inputs and give rise to one achromatic and two chromatic postreceptoral channels. The goal of the current study was to determine temporal sensitivity across the three postreceptoral channels in subcortical and cortical regions involved in human vision. We measured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses at 7 T from three participants (two males, one female) viewing a high-contrast, flickering, spatially uniform wide field (~140&deg;). Stimulus flicker frequency varied logarithmically between 2 and 64 Hz and targeted the L + M + S, L &ndash; M, and S &ndash; (L + M) cone combinations. These measurements were used to create temporal sensitivity functions of the primary visual cortex (V1) across eccentricity and spatially averaged responses from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and the V2/V3, hV4, and V3A/B regions. fMRI responses reflected the known properties of the visual system, including higher peak temporal sensitivity to achromatic versus chromatic stimuli and low-pass filtering between the LGN and V1. Peak temporal sensitivity increased across levels of the cortical visual hierarchy. Unexpectedly, peak temporal sensitivity varied little across eccentricity within area V1. Measures of adaptation and distributed pattern activity revealed a subtle influence of 64 Hz achromatic flicker in area V1, despite this stimulus evoking only a minimal overall response. The comparison of measured cortical responses to a model of the integrated retinal output to our stimuli demonstrates that extensive filtering and amplification are applied to postretinal signals.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/21/e1479232024?rss=1">Visual Recognition Memory of Scenes Is Driven by Categorical, Not Sensory, Visual Representations</a></h4>

              
                <p>When we perceive a scene, our brain processes various types of visual information simultaneously, ranging from sensory features, such as line orientations and colors, to categorical features, such as objects and their arrangements. Whereas the role of sensory and categorical visual representations in predicting subsequent memory has been studied using isolated objects, their impact on memory for complex scenes remains largely unknown. To address this gap, we conducted an fMRI study in which female and male participants encoded pictures of familiar scenes (e.g., an airport picture) and later recalled them, while rating the vividness of their visual recall. Outside the scanner, participants had to distinguish each seen scene from three similar lures (e.g., three airport pictures). We modeled the sensory and categorical visual features of multiple scenes using both early and late layers of a deep convolutional neural network. Then, we applied representational similarity analysis to determine which brain regions represented stimuli in accordance with the sensory and categorical models. We found that categorical, but not sensory, representations predicted subsequent memory. In line with the previous result, only for the categorical model, the average recognition performance of each scene exhibited a positive correlation with the average visual dissimilarity between the item in question and its respective lures. These results strongly suggest that even in memory tests that ostensibly rely solely on visual cues (such as forced-choice visual recognition with similar distractors), memory decisions for scenes may be primarily influenced by categorical rather than sensory representations.</p>

                <p>The lateral intraparietal area (LIP) plays a crucial role in target selection and attention in primates, but the laminar microcircuitry of this region is largely unknown. To address this, we used ultra-high density laminar electrophysiology with Neuropixels probes to record neural activity in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of two adult marmosets while they performed a simple visual target selection task. Our results reveal neural correlates of visual target selection in the marmoset, similar to those observed in macaques and humans, with distinct timing and profiles of activity across cell types and cortical layers. Notably, a greater proportion of neurons exhibited stimulus-related activity in superficial layers whereas a greater proportion of infragranular neurons exhibited significant postsaccadic activity. Stimulus-related activity was first observed in granular layer putative interneurons, whereas target discrimination activity emerged first in supragranular layers putative pyramidal neurons, supporting a canonical laminar circuit underlying visual target selection in marmoset PPC. These findings provide novel insights into the neural basis of visual attention and target selection in primates.</p>

                <p>Methods of cognitive enhancement for humans are most impactful when they generalize across tasks. However, the extent to which such "transfer" is possible via interventions is widely debated. In addition, the contribution of excitatory and inhibitory processes to such transfer is unknown. Here, in a large-scale neuroimaging individual differences study with humans (both sexes), we paired multitasking training and noninvasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation, tDCS) over multiple days and assessed performance across a range of paradigms. In addition, we varied tDCS dosage (1.0 and 2.0&nbsp;mA), electrode montage (left or right prefrontal regions), and training task (multitasking vs a control task) and assessed GABA and glutamate concentrations via ultrahigh field 7T magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Generalized benefits were observed in spatial attention, indexed by visual search performance, when multitasking training was combined with 1.0&nbsp;mA stimulation targeting either the left or right prefrontal cortex (PFC). This transfer effect persisted for ~30&nbsp;d post intervention. Critically, the transferred benefits associated with right prefrontal tDCS were predicted by pretraining concentrations of glutamate in the PFC. Thus, the effects of this combined stimulation and training protocol appear to be linked predominantly to excitatory brain processes.</p>

                <p>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and its analogs are widely used for diabetes treatment. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is crucial for regulating cardiovascular activity. This study aims to determine the roles of GLP-1 and its receptors (GLP-1R) in the PVN in regulating sympathetic outflow and blood pressure. Experiments were carried out in male normotensive rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded. GLP-1 and GLP-1R expressions were present in the PVN. PVN microinjection of GLP-1R agonist recombinant human GLP-1 (rhGLP-1) or EX-4 increased RSNA and MAP, which were prevented by GLP-1R antagonist exendin 9-39 (EX9-39) or GLP-1R antagonist 1, superoxide scavenger tempol, antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, NADPH oxidase (NOX) inhibitor apocynin, adenylyl cyclase (AC) inhibitor SQ22536 or protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89. PVN microinjection of rhGLP-1 increased superoxide production, NADPH oxidase activity, cAMP level, AC, and PKA activity, which were prevented by SQ22536 or H89. GLP-1 and GLP-1R were upregulated in the PVN of SHR. PVN microinjection of GLP-1 agonist increased RSNA and MAP in both WKY and SHR, but GLP-1 antagonists caused greater effects in reducing RSNA and MAP in SHR than in WKY. The increased superoxide production and NADPH oxidase activity in the PVN of SHR were augmented by GLP-1R agonists but attenuated by GLP-1R antagonists. These results indicate that activation of GLP-1R in the PVN increased sympathetic outflow and blood pressure via cAMP-PKA&ndash;mediated NADPH oxidase activation and subsequent superoxide production. GLP-1 and GLP-1R upregulation in the PVN partially contributes to sympathetic overactivity and hypertension.</p>

                <p>The natural environment challenges the brain to prioritize the processing of salient stimuli. The barn owl, a sound localization specialist, exhibits a circuit called the midbrain stimulus selection network, dedicated to representing locations of the most salient stimulus in circumstances of concurrent stimuli. Previous competition studies using unimodal (visual) and bimodal (visual and auditory) stimuli have shown that relative strength is encoded in spike response rates. However, open questions remain concerning auditory&ndash;auditory competition on coding. To this end, we present diverse auditory competitors (concurrent flat noise and amplitude-modulated noise) and record neural responses of awake barn owls of both sexes in subsequent midbrain space maps, the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICx) and optic tectum (OT). While both ICx and OT exhibit a topographic map of auditory space, OT also integrates visual input and is part of the global-inhibitory midbrain stimulus selection network. Through comparative investigation of these regions, we show that while increasing strength of a competitor sound decreases spike response rates of spatially distant neurons in both regions, relative strength determines spike train synchrony of nearby units only in the OT. Furthermore, changes in synchrony by sound competition in the OT are correlated to gamma range oscillations of local field potentials associated with input from the midbrain stimulus selection network. The results of this investigation suggest that modulations in spiking synchrony between units by gamma oscillations are an emergent coding scheme representing relative strength of concurrent stimuli, which may have relevant implications for downstream readout.</p>

                <p>Proteoglycans containing link domains modify the extracellular matrix (ECM) to regulate cellular homeostasis and can also sensitize tissues/organs to injury and stress. Hypoxic&ndash;ischemic (H&ndash;I) injury disrupts cellular homeostasis by activating inflammation and attenuating regeneration and repair pathways. In the brain, the main component of the ECM is the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronic acid (HA), but whether HA modifications of the ECM regulate cellular homeostasis and response to H&ndash;I injury is not known. In this report, employing both male and female mice, we demonstrate that link-domain&ndash;containing proteoglycan, TNF&alpha;-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6), is active in the brain from birth onward and differentially modifies ECM HA during discrete neurodevelopmental windows. ECM HA modification by TSG-6 enables it to serve as a developmental switch to regulate the activity of the Hippo pathway effector protein, yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), in the maturing brain and in response to H&ndash;I injury. Mice that lack TSG-6 expression display dysregulated expression of YAP1 targets, excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1; glutamate&ndash;aspartate transporter) and 2 (EAAT2; glutamate transporter-1). Dysregulation of YAP1 activation in TSG-6<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice coincides with age- and sex-dependent sensitization of the brain to H&ndash;I injury such that 1-week-old neonates display an anti-inflammatory response in contrast to an enhanced proinflammatory injury reaction in 3-month-old adult males but not females. Our findings thus support that a key regulator of age- and sex-dependent H&ndash;I injury response in the mouse brain is modulation of the Hippo-YAP1 pathway by TSG-6&ndash;dependent ECM modifications.</p>

                Background In the issue of biodiversity, the domestication of birds as pets and trade animals requires special attention as a conservation effort. Lovebirds (Agapornis fischeri) are popular birds worldwide, due to their varied ornamentation and melodic chirping sound. Syrinx structure is suspected to be the main source of sound production during the chirping period. This study aimed to investigate syrinx morphometry and its correlation with sound frequency produced in lovebirds. Methods A total of 24 lovebirds of different ages and gender were investigated. Polymerase chain reaction method was performed to determine lovebird gender, meanwhile bird age was identified based on post-hatch recordings at the breeding farm. Thus, we enrolled male (n=12) and female (n=12) lovebirds aged 2 (n=4), 3 (n=4), and 4 (n=4) months in the investigation group, respectively. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was performed to evaluate sound frequency during chirping period. Then, syrinx morphometry was identified using a topographic approach and methylene blue staining. Each variable was evaluated with Image J software and vernier caliper. Results Based on a topographical approach, we reported the general cartilage structure of the tracheosyringeal, bronchosyringeal, paired protrusions, tracheolateral muscles, sternotracheal muscles, and syringeal muscles in lovebird syrinx. In particular, the tympaniform membranes lateral lead a crucial role in modulating the frequency of male lovebirds more significantly (p=0,009) compared to female. On the other hand, the tympaniform membranes lateral dexter (p=0,02) and sinister (p=0,05) in females showed wider compared to male. We also reported a negative correlation between sound frequency compared to tympaniform membranes lateral dexter (y = -913,56x + 6770,8) and sinister (y = -706,16x + 5736). Conclusions It can be concluded that the tympaniform membranes lateral produced the lovebirds’ primary sound. The sound frequency of male lovebirds was higher compared to female, however negatively correlated with the area of tympaniform membranes lateral.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-23/v3?src=rss">Interactions between special education teachers and children with chronic complex conditions: A qualitative study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The number of children with complex medical conditions has increased in recent decades. In this context, a complex chronic condition is characterized by multiple morbidities that require intensive or continuous health care according to the level of severity. Given their various health conditions, it is challenging to provide special education to these children, but there is still insufficient evidence regarding the practical experiences of educators. The aim of this study was to investigate special education teacher’s perceptions, experiences, and challenges while developing interpersonal relationships and communicating with children who have complex chronic conditions. Methods We recruited and interviewed 21 special education school teachers in Japan. The transcripts of the interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results Our analysis revealed four themes, including “searching for the meaning,” “complex chronic conditions as a difficult reality,” “widening experience for the future,” and “priority for interacting with children.” These themes reflect the perceptions, experiences, and challenges of the special education teachers. Conclusions In cases where children have severe functional limitations, it is more challenging to understand child-teacher interactions. This highlights the importance of searching for meaning in educational practices used among children with complex chronic conditions. Our findings may provide helpful insight into the experiences and challenges faced by special educators who engage with these children.

                Biodiversity loss is now recognised as one of the major challenges for humankind to address over the next few decades. Unless major actions are taken, the sixth mass extinction will lead to catastrophic effects on the Earth’s biosphere and human health and well-being. ELIXIR can help address the technical challenges of biodiversity science, through leveraging its suite of services and expertise to enable data management and analysis activities that enhance our understanding of life on Earth and facilitate biodiversity preservation and restoration. This white paper, prepared by the ELIXIR Biodiversity Community, summarises the current status and responses, and presents a set of plans, both technical and community-oriented, that should both enhance how ELIXIR Services are applied in the biodiversity field and how ELIXIR builds connections across the many other infrastructures active in this area. We discuss the areas of highest priority, how they can be implemented in cooperation with the ELIXIR Platforms, and their connections to existing ELIXIR Communities and international consortia. The article provides a preliminary blueprint for a Biodiversity Community in ELIXIR and is an appeal to identify and involve new stakeholders.

                Background Urinary incontinence (UI) was an intractable symptom and many efforts had been made to combat this symptom over the past decades. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was used in many diseases for its focusing on neural network regulation. However, rTMS on the cortical urination center for acting on urination process remained further study. Case report A 67-year-old female farmer suffered from UI over two weeks. She was diagnosed with major vascular neurocognitive disorder. The patient received rTMS on the bilateral paracentral lobule. Stimulation was administered at 20 Hz with 25 stimulation trains of 30 stimuli each with a 30-second intertrain interval. After a 5-day course of rTMS intervention, the patient reported full awareness of her urination, but her neurocognitive decline had not improved at all. Conclusions In this case of UI with major vascular neurocognitive disorder, rTMS on the bilateral paracentral lobule was applied and therapeutic effect on UI was obvious.

                Background The aim of this study was to compare pre-mortem histopathology findings in rats with and without traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its prospective application in forensic medicine. Methods This study involved 12 rats with 6 rats for each treatment group. This type of study is a laboratory experimental study with two independent groups design. The first group were rats that did not experience TBI. The second group was a group of rats with TBI. The subjects of this study were Rattus norvegicus rats, adult males, 4-8 weeks old, weighing 150-200 grams. On the 8th day after the rats experienced traumatic brain injury, the rats were then euthanized using the cervical dislocation method, after euthanasia the rats were given craniotomy and brain tissue was taken for histopathology examination. Results The description of histopathology changes in the brain organs in the group of rat without TBI found that neuron cells looked normal although there were also degeneration (21.16 ± 2.56/FV), necrosis (5.75 ± 0.98/FV), apoptosis (2.91 ± 0.80/FV), congestion ( 0.91 ± 0.49/FV), inflammatory cells (4.58 ± 1.15/FV) and hemorrhage (2.41 ± 1.11/FV). Changes in the rat traumatic brain injury group showed a lot of damage to neuron cells in the form of degeneration (48.41 ± 3.27/FV), necrosis (36.66 ± 2.89/FV), apoptosis (18.91 ± 1.24/FV), congestion (2.50 ±0.31/FV), inflammatory cells (11.41 ± 1.71/FV) and hemorrhage (10.08 ± 2.17/FV). Based on the results of statistical analysis, it can be seen that in all parameters there is a significant difference (p ≤ 0.001). Conclusions The premortem histopathology findings in rats with and without TBI which can be used for the benefit of forensic medicine in determining whether TBI is present or not. It is necessary to look more closely at the histopathology changes in the form of necrosis, apoptosis and hemorrhage.

                Background In the current work, co-rotating twin-screw processor (TSP) was utilized to formulate solid crystal suspension (SCS) of carvedilol (CAR) for enhancing its solubility, dissolution rate, permeation and bioavailability using mannitol as a hydrophilic carrier. Methods In-silico molecular dynamics (MD) studies were done to simulate the interaction of CAR with mannitol at different kneading zone temperatures (KZT). Based on these studies, the optimal CAR: mannitol ratios and the kneading zone temperatures for CAR solubility enhancement were assessed. The CAR-SCS was optimized utilizing Design-of-Experiments (DoE) methodology using the Box-Behnken design. Saturation solubility studies and in vitro dissolution studies were performed for all the formulations. Physicochemical characterization was performed using differential scanning calorimetry , Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction studies, and Raman spectroscopy analysis. Ex vivo permeation studies and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies for the CAR-SCS were performed. Stability studies were performed for the DoE-optimized CAR-SCS at accelerated stability conditions at 40 ºC/ 75% RH for three months. Results Experimentally, the formulation with CAR: mannitol ratio of 20:80, prepared using a KZT of 120 ºC at 100 rpm screw speed showed the highest solubility enhancement accounting for 50-fold compared to the plain CAR. Physicochemical characterization confirmed the crystalline state of DoE-optimized CAR-SCS. In-vitro dissolution studies indicated a 6.03-fold and 3.40-fold enhancement in the dissolution rate of optimized CAR-SCS in pH 1.2 HCl solution and phosphate buffer pH 6.8, respectively, as compared to the pure CAR. The enhanced efficacy of the optimized CAR-SCS was indicated in the ex vivo and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies wherein the apparent permeability was enhanced 1.84-fold and bioavailability enhanced 1.50-folds compared to the plain CAR. The stability studies showed good stability concerning the drug content. Conclusions TSP technology could be utilized to enhance the solubility, bioavailability and permeation of poor soluble CAR by preparing the SCS.

                Background Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) is the most often used polymer for denture bases because to its inexpensive cost, lightweight nature, insolubility in mouth fluid, outstanding cosmetic features, and ease of repairability. However, various limitations such as insufficient surface hardness, low strength, brittleness, weak flexural strength, poor impact strength, and low fatigue resistance have a detrimental impact on acrylic resins. Method This research examined the impact strength, transverse strength, surface hardness, surface roughness, and color stability of heat-cured acrylic denture base material after 0.5% and 1% by wt. CNFs were added. The cellulose nanofibers were combined with a PMMA monomer for 5 minutes in a probe sonicator. One group of samples was made without cellulose nanofibers in PMMA, while two groups were prepared with 0.5% and 1% CNFs by weight, and tests of the impact strength, transverse strength, surface hardness, surface roughness, and color stability of the samples were carried out. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, including the mean and standard deviation, and bar charts were used to visualize the results. Sample interactions and fiber dispersion were assessed using FTIR and FE-SEM. Results Compared to the control group, 0.5% by wt. and 1% by wt. CNF improved the impact and transverse strength substantially, while shore D surface hardness was not improved. Hue (a) and chroma (b) were substantially influenced by CNF at 0.5% by weight compared to the control group, although surface roughness and color value (L) were not. Surface roughness, color value (L), and color hue (a) were substantially impacted by 1% compared to the control group; however, color chroma (b) was not. Conclusions This research found that 0.5% and 1% by wt. CNF in PMMA resin increased the impact strength, transverse strength, surface hardness, surface roughness, color value, hue, and chroma of heat-cured polymethyl methacrylate denture base material.

                Background Fluid resuscitation is an essential component for sepsis treatment. Although several studies demonstrated that dynamic variables were more accurate than static variables for prediction of fluid responsiveness, fluid resuscitation guidance by dynamic variables is not standard for treatment. The objectives were to determine the effects of dynamic inferior vena cava (IVC)-guided versus (vs.) static central venous pressure (CVP)-guided fluid resuscitation in septic patients on mortality; and others, i.e., resuscitation targets, shock duration, fluid and vasopressor amount, invasive respiratory support, length of stay and adverse events. Methods A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted at Thammasat University Hospital between August 2016 and April 2020. Septic patients were stratified by acute physiologic and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) <25 or ≥25 and randomized by blocks of 2 and 4 to fluid resuscitation guidance by dynamic IVC or static CVP. Results Of 124 patients enrolled, 62 were randomized to each group, and one of each was excluded from mortality analysis. Baseline characteristics were comparable. The 30-day mortality rates between dynamic IVC vs. static CVP groups were not different (34.4% vs. 45.9%, p=0.196). Relative risk for 30-day mortality of dynamic IVC group was 0.8 (95%CI=0.5-1.2, p=0.201). Different outcomes were median (interquartile range) of shock duration (0.8 (0.4-1.6) vs. 1.5 (1.1-3.1) days, p=0.001) and norepinephrine (NE) dose (6.8 (3.9–17.8) vs. 16.1 (7.6–53.6) milligrams, p=0.008 and 0.1 (0.1-0.3) vs. 0.3 (0.1-0.8) milligram⋅kilogram−1, p=0.017). Others were not different. Conclusions Dynamic IVC-guided fluid resuscitation does not affect mortality of septic patients. However, this may reduce shock duration and NE dose, compared with static CVP guidance.

                Introduction Obesity is one of the most important global issues affecting children and adolescents. The most serious lifestyle effects of adolescents’ obesity and overweight are health risks that continue into adulthood, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, type 2 diabetes, behavioural issues, and cardiovascular diseases. India is among the many developing nations where childhood and adolescent obesity has become a serious public health issue. Adolescence is the most important stage in physical activity, growth and development. Adolescence is a start of personal decision-making sense and the development of a customized lifestyle, including the early onset of illness, accounting for approximately 35% of the global disease burden. Many of these behavioural choices have been linked to obesity risk factors, which are mostly controlled for, such as unhealthy eating behaviour, excessive television watching, and lack of activity. While undernutrition and deficiencies in micronutrients are serious public health problems in India, obesity and overnutrition have become major problems in several areas. Aim This study aims to assess Obesity among adolescents in rural Wardha. Methods A cross-sectional study will be conducted in the rural community area of the Wardha District. A questionnaire-based face-to-face interview will be conducted with participants in the adolescent age group (10-19 years). This study aimed to identify variables associated with demographic data, age group, genetic factors, types of family, parents’ education, occupation, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and various types of food intake. Implication of study The findings of this study could be significant in the implementation of laws, programs, and initiatives to promote awareness of the associations between adolescent obesity and risk factors for lifestyle diseases. This message focuses on having a balanced diet while exercising in regular physical activity. The prevalence of obesity is reduced by this lifestyle disease.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-526/v1?src=rss">Exploring the Potential for Tuition-Free Higher Education in South Africa: A Scoping Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The debate on tuition-free higher education has raged in South Africa since the #FeesMustFall protests at South African universities in 2015 and 2016. The government responded with a tuition-free education policy targeting students from households earning less than R350 000. However, the question remains can South Africa sustain a tuition-free education policy given its developing nation status and the levels of its GDP? This article sought to assess the feasibility of tuition-free higher education for all in South Africa. A scoping review was used, and fifteen articles about tuition-free higher education feasibility in South Africa were reviewed. The choice of the scoping review was due to the need for an understanding of the current state of play in research on the feasibility of tuition-free higher education in South Africa. The results suggest that tuition-free higher education for all is not feasible in South Africa. There seems to be a consensus that South Africa lacks the resources to finance tuition-free higher education for all. Tuition-free higher education is also viewed as a regressive tax on the poor given that the majority of students in higher education institutions come from middle and upper-income households. However, it is important to note that a distinction is drawn between tuition-free higher education for all and tuition-free higher education for the poor and academically deserving. The latter seems to receive support with some viewing it as a moral imperative in an unequal society such as South Africa’s. It is recommended that future studies approach the issue from an empirical standpoint whereby the GDP levels are assessed against higher education funding.

                Background Blastoid mantle cell lymphoma (B-MCL) is a rare aggressive lymphoma. It is characterized by blastoid morphology with high proliferation and inconsistent immunohistochemistry (IHC), making it a diagnostic challenge for the pathologist. Methods This is a retrospective analytical cohort study. We reviewed biopsy confirmed cases of B-MCL diagnosed over a period of 10 years (January 2012 to December 2022). The clinical presentation, histopathological and IHC findings, treatment received, and survival outcomes were studied. Randomly selected cases of classic MCL (n=12), diagnosed during the same period served as controls. Results A total of 12 cases were studied. Four cases were transformed from previously diagnosed MCL; 8 cases arose de novo. Mean age was 61.17 years and the male: female ratio was 5:1. Half of the cases showed extra nodal extension and 81.8% had bone marrow involvement. Gastrointestinal tract was the most common site of extra nodal involvement. Histopathological examination showed diffuse involvement of the lymph node with medium sized cells. On immunohistochemistry, one of the cases showed loss of CD5 expression while the other had aberrant CD10 expression. Mean Ki-67 index was 58.09% in the cases and 16.33% in controls and was statistically significant (p=0.005). The median overall survival (OS) for cases was 2 years vs 8 years in controls. The p53 over expression (>30% nuclear positivity) was seen in 66.6% cases (4/6). Conclusion There are several factors that contribute to the aggressiveness of B-MCL, and new treatment approaches might be required to improve patient outcomes.

                Background To gauge the impact of an interventional workshop conducted to measure the observation skills of 34 postgraduates during induction into an ophthalmology fellowship. Methods A seven-hour workshop was conducted with the ophthalmology trainees. Trainees from the 2022 batch of ophthalmology fellowships (21 females and 13 males) were included in the study. The pre-workshop assessment comprised two non-clinical images to spot the difference and five clinical images from various subspecialties of ophthalmology. This was followed by workshop and Post workshop assessment. The pre- and post-observation grades of participants were then compared by masked ophthalmologists. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare scores at two time points, with a p-value < 0.05 for statistical significance. Results Statistical analysis revealed that the observation skill score was significantly higher after the workshop intervention (Md = 4.00, n = 34) compared to the pre-workshop score (Md = 1.85, n = 34), p-value = 0.000. Conclusions Workshops on specific/selected foundational skills, such as observation skills and communication skills, must be integrated into the curricula of basic medical degree and specialty medicine to equip medical professionals with attentive observation and deep learning.

                Background Depression is among the most common mental health disorders affecting social and academic progress of university students globally. However, the variations in prevalence reported by different published studies leaves the true burden of depression among medical students in Africa unknown. Objectives This study aimed at conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis to report the true estimate of prevalence of depression among medical students in Africa between 2012 and 2022. Methods Articles that reported prevalence of depression among medical students in Africa between 2012 and 2022 study period were searched for in PubMed, Google Scholar, African Journals Online, and Embase. Two investigators independently extracted the data for full review and eligible studies were considered for analysis after a consensus, quality of articles was assessed using JBI Critical Appraisal tool [1] for prevalence studies. R version 4.3.2 [2] was used to establish the pooled prevalence using a random effects model, funnel plot and Eggers test were used to check for publication bias. Results A total of twenty-six cross-sectional studies involving 11386 (Females: 6070, 53.3%) medical students, mean age 23, were included in this study. PHQ9 (n=10), DASS21 (n=7), BDI-II (n=5) were the most used screening instruments. The overall pooled prevalence of depression was 38% (p < 0.00). Sub-group analysis by instrument used i.e. DASS21, PHQ-9, BDI-II, revealed prevalence of 50% (p < 0.01), 39% (p < 0.01) and 32% (p < 0.01) respectively. Conclusion Nearly two-fifths of medical students in Africa suffer from depression. The findings emphasize the urgent need for research into the causes, alongside early diagnosis with standardized tools and targeted interventions to manage depression effectively among this demographic.

                Background The Liver is a vital organ in the human body, which plays a crucial role in various physiological processes. Oxidative stress is a critical factor in the pathogenesis and progression of various liver diseases, contributing to cellular damage and dysfunction. The Liver is particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species when the balance between their production and the body’s antioxidant defense mechanisms is disrupted. The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for liver diseases due to its pivotal role in cellular defense against oxidative stress and inflammation. Plants have always been a source of drugs which has been used to treat various pharmacological disorders and most of its activity is due to its potential as an antioxidant. However, the specific mechanisms by which they interact with the NRF2 pathway and confer protection against liver diseases remain inadequately elucidated. Therefore, this scoping review aims to identify and analyze the existing literature pertaining to the relationship between Phytomolecules, which can modulate NRF2 and protect against liver diseases. Methods The proposed scoping review will follow the steps given by “Arksey and O’Malley and Levac et al”. Electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, etc.) will be searched for recent relevant studies. A predefined criterion for the inclusion and exclusion of studies will be independently adopted by two reviewers. The review will be presented as per the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR)” guidelines. Conclusion The scoping review finding is expected to help understanding the role of Phytomolecules in preventing liver diseases by modulating the NRF2 pathway. Ultimately, this review will serve as a foundational step toward developing targeted interventions to improve liver health outcomes and reduce the global burden of liver diseases.

                A tuberculoma is a clinical sign of tuberculosis that combines tubercles into a solid mass and can resemble several forms of malignant tumors on imaging. They frequently develop in people whose original tuberculosis infection is not well controlled. When they develop intracranially, tuberculomas are symptoms of CNS tuberculosis Meningitis, radiculomyelitis, bony spinal disease, and tuberculoma/tuberculous abscess are some of the symptoms of neurological tuberculosis (TB) that can also arise intracranially or in the spinal canal. comparable to other neurological TB symptoms. The majority of the time, the diagnosis of cerebral tuberculoma is presumptive and is based on radiological findings, additional supportive TB evidence from other areas, and treatment response. However, despite adequate TB treatment and concomitant corticosteroid therapy, lesions may persist for many years, as the therapeutic response of tuberculomas is unpredictable. A 19-year-old male patient admitted to the hospital for medical treatment complained of abdominal pain, constipation, nausea and vomiting, generalized weakness, fever, and chills. According to the patient’s complaints, my patient has a history of tonic-clonic seizures dating back a month, as well as a history of typhoid fever and sickle cell disease AS pattern, both of which he had been receiving treatment at a civil hospital. At the time of admission, he had undergone a number of invasive and non-invasive investigations, including a CT brain plane and an MRI brain with contrast. Brain computed tomography (CT) revealed a persistent lacunar infarct in the left corona radiata. Acute infarct in the right corona radiata, abnormal meningeal enhancement on post-contrast with meningitis, multiple ring-enhancing lesions in the bilateral cerebral hemisphere, cerebellum, corpus callosum, and intracranial tuberculous granuloma are all revealed by MRI with contrast. left corona radiata chronic infarction.

                Urine microscopy for detecting pus cells is a common investigation ordered in hospitalized general medical patients as part of routine care. A few previous studies have shown that sterile pyuria is not uncommon in this population. We studied the prevalence of pyuria among patients hospitalized with non-urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnosis in the medical wards. We excluded patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB). Pyuria was quantified in uncentrifuged urine using the chamber counting method, and ≥ 10 pus cells per mm3 was considered significant. We also compared this method with the commonly used but less accurate method of counting pus cells/high power field using centrifuged urine (routine method). We studied 196 patients; 113 (57.7%) were males. Most (175[89.3%]) patients were hospitalized for an infection. We found that 18.4% of the study group had sterile pyuria, and it was strongly associated with the presence of concomitant microscopic hematuria (unadjusted odds ratio, 3.74 [1.65 to 8.50]; P=0.002). We found no association of pyuria with female gender, diabetes, acute kidney injury, or current antibiotic use. By routine method, 56 (28.6 %) patients had significant pyuria. In comparison to the chamber counting method, the routine method was 69.4(63—75.8) % sensitive and 80.6(75.1—86.2) % specific. The positive and negative predictive values were 44.6 (37.7— 51.6) % and 92.1 (88.4 — 95.9) %. We concluded that sterile pyuria and microscopic hematuria could be present in a proportion of hospitalized general medical patients without UTI or ASB. Clinical judgment is essential in interpreting the significance of abnormal urinalysis reports.

                Background The Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2) has emerged as a recent pandemic, increasing the need for epidemiological studies and studies on public health. Only some studies have evaluated the awareness of medical undergraduates in India and other countries, leading to a lack of literature. Methods This study is a descriptive cross-sectional questionnaire-based study conducted in Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore, India, between June to August 2020. An online survey using Google Forms was circulated among undergraduate medical students in India by a convenient sampling method for data collection. Descriptive analysis was derived based on frequencies and percentages, and the association with age, gender, and year of undergraduate training medical course was derived using the chi-square test. Results Altogether, 630 students from India responded to the survey, with a maximum response from students studying in the second year (38.7%). Nearly 63.85% of responders identified themselves as females. Knowledge regarding the human-to-human transmission of the virus, symptoms, complications, definition of “close contact, quarantine, and its indications was adequate among the students, with more than 70% correct responses. However, one-fourth of the students needed to gain more knowledge about masks. Respiratory hygiene was poor among 24.8%. Nearly 40% of students were unaware of the management of patients with COVID-19. Conclusion There is a need for regular quality training and institutional programs on infection control of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases across all Indian medical colleges to educate undergraduate medical students, who are future healthcare professionals, thus minimizing the risk of transmission and providing standardized care for patients.

                Background Darwin assumed that the peacock’s long train was maladaptive and was the indirect effect of selection by female mate choice based on the train’s beauty. While a relationship between the feathers’ elaborate features and mating success has been shown, what features of the train females are attracted to remains controversial. Methods We used museum specimens to examine the anatomical plan underlying feather development responsible for the symmetry of the train. We developed a model based on an alternate arrangement of primordial feather buds during development and locations of concentric circles of symmetric eyespot distribution using the pattern seen on the train as a template. Results We observed a zigzag pattern of feather follicles that determined both the number and the hexagonal arrangement of eyespots on the train. Our model explained not only the alternate arrangement of feathers on the train but also the arrangement of the concentric color rings of the eyespots. While the zigzag pattern explains the symmetry, complexity, and structural beauty of the peacock’s train, it also precludes variation in eyespot number except by annual addition of new rows of feathers as a function of age. Conclusions Since eyespot number and feather length are developmentally correlated and an asymptotic function of a male’s age, their effects on female choice would be confounded and inseparable, and male vigor would be a crucial factor affecting male fitness. Females may not always choose males with the largest number of eyespots, as older males may lack vigor. We propose a multimodal model of female choice where females see eyespot and train size not as separate traits but as one complex trait combining both. The new model may be able to explain conflicting results and why eyespot number alone may not be sufficient to explain female choice.

     alt="Heterogeneity of brain extracellular matrix and astrocyte activation"/>
<p>Astrocyte resting phenotype is directed by its extracellular matrix (ECM), where the composition of both ECM and astrocyte subtypes varies by brain region. Astrocyte activation is not only a result of the injury or disease stimulus, but also of its ECM which can be significantly altered in a pathological state.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>From the blood brain barrier to the synaptic space, astrocytes provide structural, metabolic, ionic, and extracellular matrix (ECM) support across the brain. Astrocytes include a vast array of subtypes, their phenotypes and functions varying both regionally and temporally. Astrocytes' metabolic and regulatory functions poise them to be quick and sensitive responders to injury and disease in the brain as revealed by single cell sequencing. Far less is known about the influence of the local healthy and aging microenvironments on these astrocyte activation states. In this forward-looking review, we describe the known relationship between astrocytes and their local microenvironment, the remodeling of the microenvironment during disease and injury, and postulate how they may drive astrocyte activation. We suggest technology development to better understand the dynamic diversity of astrocyte activation states, and how basal and activation states depend on the ECM microenvironment. A deeper understanding of astrocyte response to stimuli in ECM-specific contexts (brain region, age, and sex of individual), paves the way to revolutionize how the field considers astrocyte-ECM interactions in brain injury and disease and opens routes to return astrocytes to a healthy quiescent state.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Glucose is the primary energy source for neural stem cells (NSCs), supporting their proliferation, differentiation, and quiescence. However, the high demand for glucose during brain development often exceeds its supply, leading to the utilization of alternative energy sources including ketone bodies. Ketone bodies, including β-hydroxybutyrate, are short-chain fatty acids produced through hepatic ketogenesis and play a crucial role in providing energy and the biosynthetic components for NSCs when required. The interplay between glucose and ketone metabolism influences NSC behavior and fate decisions, and disruptions in these metabolic pathways have been linked to neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, ketone bodies exert neuroprotective effects on NSCs and modulate cellular responses to oxidative stress, energy maintenance, deacetylation, and inflammation. As such, understanding the interdependence of glucose and ketone metabolism in NSCs is crucial to understanding their roles in NSC function and their implications for neurological conditions. This article reviews the mechanisms of glucose and ketone utilization in NSCs, their impact on NSC function, and the therapeutic potential of targeting these metabolic pathways in neurological disorders.</p>

                Sensory systems experience a period of intrinsically generated neural activity before maturation is complete and sensory transduction occurs. Here we review evidence describing the mechanisms and functions of this ‘spontaneous’ activity in the auditory system. Both ex vivo and in vivo studies indicate that this correlated activity is initiated by non-sensory supporting cells within the developing cochlea, which induce depolarization and burst firing of groups of nearby hair cells in the sensory epithelium, activity that is conveyed to auditory neurons that will later process similar sound features. This stereotyped neural burst firing promotes cellular maturation, synaptic refinement, acoustic sensitivity, and establishment of sound-responsive domains in the brain. While sensitive to perturbation, the developing auditory system exhibits remarkable homeostatic mechanisms to preserve periodic burst firing in deaf mice. Preservation of this early spontaneous activity in the context of deafness may enhance the efficacy of later interventions to restore hearing.

	<p>Taxonomic studies of dreams that continue to influence the dreamer&amp;amp;rsquo;s thoughts and feelings after awakening have distinguished three types of impactful dreams: nightmares, existential dreams, and transcendent dreams. Of these, existential dreams and transcendent dreams are characterized by recurrent metacognitive appraisal of the epistemic tension between complementary (a) metaphoric (A &amp;amp;ldquo;is&amp;amp;rdquo; B) assertions and (b) literal (A &amp;amp;ldquo;is not&amp;amp;rdquo; B) assertions. Metacognitive appraisal of such complementary metaphoric and literal assertions is detectable as the felt sense of inexpressible realizations. The poesy of such inexpressible realizations depends upon the juxtaposition of a metaphoric topic and vehicle that are both &amp;amp;ldquo;semantically dense&amp;amp;rdquo; but at an abstract level &amp;amp;ldquo;distant&amp;amp;rdquo; from each other. The result is &amp;amp;ldquo;emergence&amp;amp;rdquo; of attributes of the metaphoric vehicle that are sufficiently abstract to be attributes also of the metaphoric topic. The cumulative effect of successive metaphoric/literal categorical transformations produces a higher-level form of metacognition that is consistent with a neo-Kantian account of sublime feeling. Sublime feeling occurs as either sublime disquietude (existential dreams) or as sublime enthrallment (transcendent dreams). The aftereffects of these two dream types are thematically iterative &amp;amp;ldquo;living metaphors&amp;amp;rdquo; that have abstract (but not &amp;amp;ldquo;totalizing&amp;amp;rdquo;) ontological import.</p>

	<p>Decreased attentional function causes problems in daily life. However, a quick and easy evaluation method of attentional function has not yet been developed. Therefore, we are searching for a method to evaluate attentional function easily and quickly. This study aimed to collect basic data on the features of electroencephalography (EEG) during attention tasks to develop a new method for evaluating attentional function using EEG. Twenty healthy young adults participated; we examined cerebral activity during a Clinical Assessment for Attention using portable EEG devices. The Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U test was performed to assess differences in power levels of EEG during tasks between the low- and high-attention groups. The findings revealed that the high-attention group showed significantly higher EEG power levels in the &amp;amp;delta; wave of L-temporal and bilateral parietal lobes, as well as in the &amp;amp;beta; and &amp;amp;gamma; waves of the R-occipital lobe, than did the low-attention group during digit-forward, whereas the high-attention group showed significantly higher EEG power levels in the &amp;amp;theta; wave of R-frontal and the &amp;amp;alpha; wave of bilateral frontal lobes during digit-backward. Notably, lower &amp;amp;theta;, &amp;amp;alpha;, and &amp;amp;beta; bands of the right hemisphere found in the low-attention group may be key elements to detect attentional deficit.</p>

                <p>PVD neuron of <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I> is a highly polarized cell with well-defined axonal, and dendritic compartments. PVD neuron operates in multiple sensory modalities including the control of both nociceptive touch sensation and body posture. Although both the axon and dendrites of this neuron show a regeneration response following laser-assisted injury, it is rather unclear how the behavior associated with this neuron is affected by the loss of these structures. It is also unclear whether neurite regrowth would lead to functional restoration in these neurons. Upon axotomy, using a femtosecond laser, we saw that harsh touch response was specifically affected leaving the body posture unperturbed. Subsequently, recovery in the touch response is highly correlated to the axon regrowth, which was dependent on DLK-1/MLK-1 MAP Kinase. Dendrotomy of both major and minor primary dendrites affected the wavelength and amplitude of sinusoidal movement without any apparent effect on harsh touch response. We further correlated the recovery in posture behavior to the type of dendrite regeneration events. We found that dendrite regeneration through the fusion and reconnection between the proximal and distal branches of the injured dendrite corresponded to improved recovery in posture. Our data revealed that the axons and dendrites of PVD neurons regulate the nociception and proprioception in worms, respectively. It also revealed that dendrite and axon regeneration lead to the restoration of these differential sensory modalities.</p>

                <p>by David M. Bland, Dan Long, Rebecca Rosenke, B. Joseph Hinnebusch</p>

<i>Yersinia pestis</i>, the causative agent of plague, is a highly lethal vector-borne pathogen responsible for killing large portions of Europe’s population during the Black Death of the Middle Ages. In the wild, <i>Y</i>. <i>pestis</i> cycles between fleas and rodents; occasionally spilling over into humans bitten by infectious fleas. For this reason, fleas and the rats harboring them have been considered the main epidemiological drivers of previous plague pandemics. Human ectoparasites, such as the body louse (<i>Pediculus humanus humanus</i>), have largely been discounted due to their reputation as inefficient vectors of plague bacilli. Using a membrane-feeder adapted strain of body lice, we show that the digestive tract of some body lice become chronically infected with <i>Y</i>. <i>pestis</i> at bacteremia as low as 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/ml, and these lice routinely defecate <i>Y</i>. <i>pestis</i>. At higher bacteremia (≥1 × 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/ml), a subset of the lice develop an infection within the Pawlowsky glands (PGs), a pair of putative accessory salivary glands in the louse head. Lice that developed PG infection transmitted <i>Y</i>. <i>pestis</i> more consistently than those with bacteria only in the digestive tract. These glands are thought to secrete lubricant onto the mouthparts, and we hypothesize that when infected, their secretions contaminate the mouthparts prior to feeding, resulting in bite-based transmission of <i>Y</i>. <i>pestis</i>. The body louse’s high level of susceptibility to infection by gram-negative bacteria and their potential to transmit plague bacilli by multiple mechanisms supports the hypothesis that they may have played a role in previous human plague pandemics and local outbreaks.

                <p>by John G. Robinson, Danielle LaBruna, Tim O’Brien, Peter J. Clyne, Nigel Dudley, Sandy J. Andelman, Elizabeth L. Bennett, Avecita Chicchon, Carlos Durigan, Hedley Grantham, Margaret Kinnaird, Sue Lieberman, Fiona Maisels, Adriana Moreira, Madhu Rao, Emma Stokes, Joe Walston, James EM Watson</p>

The Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), signed in 2022 by Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, recognized the importance of area-based conservation, and its goals and targets specify the characteristics of protected and conserved areas (PCAs) that disproportionately contribute to biodiversity conservation. To achieve the GBF’s target of conserving a global area of 30% by 2030, this Essay argues for recognizing these characteristics and scaling them up through the conservation of areas that are: extensive (typically larger than 5,000 km<sup>2</sup>); have interconnected PCAs (either physically or as part of a jurisdictional network, and frequently embedded in larger conservation landscapes); have high ecological integrity; and are effectively managed and equitably governed. These areas are presented as “Nature’s Strongholds,” illustrated by examples from the Congo and Amazon basins. Conserving Nature’s Strongholds offers an approach to scale up initiatives to address global threats to biodiversity.

                Fibroblasts are cells of mesenchymal origin that are found throughout the body. While these cells have several functions, their integral roles include maintaining tissue architecture through the production of key extracellular matrix components, and participation in wound healing after injury. Fibroblasts are also key mediators in disease progression during fibrosis, cancer, and other inflammatory diseases. Under these perturbed states, fibroblasts can activate into inflammatory fibroblasts or contractile myofibroblasts. Fibroblasts require various growth factors and mitogenic molecules for survival, proliferation, and differentiation. While the activity of mitogenic growth factors on fibroblasts in vitro was characterized as early as the 1970s, the proliferation and differentiation effects of growth factors on these cells in vivo are unclear. Recent work exploring the heterogeneity of fibroblasts raises questions as to whether all fibroblast cell states exhibit the same growth factor requirements. Here, we will examine and review existing studies on the influence of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs), and transforming growth factor β receptor (TGFβR) on fibroblast cell states.

                Background Paediatric neuroblastoma and brain tumours account for a third of all childhood cancer-related mortality. High-risk neuroblastoma is highly aggressive and survival is poor despite intensive multi-modal therapies with significant toxicity. Novel therapies are desperately needed. The Zika virus (ZIKV) can access the nervous system and there is growing interest in employing ZIKV as a potential therapy against paediatric nervous system tumours, including neuroblastoma. Methods Here, we perform extensive data mining, integration and re-analysis of ZIKV infection datasets to highlight molecular mechanisms that may govern the oncolytic response in neuroblastoma cells. We collate infection data of multiple neuroblastoma cell lines by different ZIKV strains from a body of published literature to inform the susceptibility of neuroblastoma to the ZIKV oncolytic response. Integrating published transcriptomics, interaction proteomics, dependency factor and compound datasets we propose the involvement of multiple host systems during ZIKV infection. Results Through data mining of published literature, we observed most paediatric neuroblastoma cell lines to be highly susceptible to ZIKV infection and propose the PRVABC59 ZIKV strain to be the most promising candidate for neuroblastoma oncolytic virotherapy. ZIKV induces TNF signalling, lipid metabolism, the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), and downregulates cell cycle and DNA replication processes. ZIKV infection is dependent on sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-regulated lipid metabolism and three protein complexes; V-ATPase, ER Membrane Protein Complex (EMC) and mammalian translocon. We propose ZIKV non-structural protein 4B (NS4B) as a likely mediator of ZIKVs interaction with IRE1-mediated UPR, lipid metabolism and mammalian translocon. Conclusions Our work provides a significant understanding of ZIKV infection in neuroblastoma cells, which will facilitate the progression of ZIKV-based oncolytic virotherapy through pre-clinical research and clinical trials.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although astrocytic pathology is a pathological hallmark of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), its pathophysiological role remains unclear. This study aimed to assess astrocyte reactivity <i>in vivo</i> in patients with PSP. Furthermore, we investigated alterations in brain lactate levels and their relationship with astrocyte reactivity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 30 patients with PSP-Richardson syndrome and 30 healthy controls; in patients, tau deposition was confirmed through <sup>18</sup>F-florzolotau positron emission tomography. Myo-inositol, an astroglial marker, and lactate were quantified in the anterior cingulate cortex through magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We measured plasma biomarkers, including glial fibrillary acidic protein as another astrocytic marker. The anterior cingulate cortex was histologically assessed in postmortem samples of another 3 patients with PSP with comparable disease durations.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The levels of myo-inositol and plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein were significantly higher in patients than those in healthy controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05); these increases were significantly associated with PSP rating scale and cognitive function scores (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The lactate level was high in patients, and correlated significantly with high myo-inositol levels. Histological analysis of the anterior cingulate cortex in patients revealed reactive astrocytes, despite mild tau deposition, and no marked synaptic loss.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We discovered high levels of astrocyte biomarkers in patients with PSP, suggesting astrocyte reactivity. The association between myo-inositol and lactate levels suggests a link between reactive astrocytes and brain energy metabolism changes. Our results indicate that astrocyte reactivity in the anterior cingulate cortex precedes pronounced tau pathology and neurodegenerative processes in that region, and affects brain function in PSP.

                Background Group B streptococcus (GBS) remains a leading cause of infant sepsis, meningitis and death despite intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. A vaccine is urgently required, and two candidates are in advanced clinical trials. For successful GBS vaccine implementation, especially if a vaccine is licensed based on an immunological threshold, there must be cross-sector engagement, effective advocacy, robust plans for phase IV studies and equitable access. Meeting A round-table discussion, held at St George’s University of London, reviewed the current position of GBS vaccines in the UK context, focusing on phase IV plans, convening a diverse group of stakeholders from across the UK, with a role in GBS vaccine licensure, advocacy, implementation or effectiveness evaluation. Presentations outlined the latest UK epidemiology, noting the rising infant invasive GBS (iGBS) infection rates from 1996 to 2021 for both early and late onset disease, with the highest disease rates in Black infants (1.1/1000 livebirths vs white infants (0.81/1000 livebirths). Potential coverage of the candidate vaccines was high (>95%). Regulatory input suggested that EU regulators would consider waiving the need for a pre-licensure efficacy study if a putative correlate of protection could be adequately justified. Phase IV study methodologies for a GBS vaccine were considered, largely based on previous UK maternal vaccine assessments, such as a nationwide cohort study design using a vaccine register and a maternal services dataset. Other strategies were also discussed such as a cluster or stepped-wedge randomised trial to evaluate implementation outcomes. Opportunities for advocacy, education and engagement with additional key partners were discussed and identified. Conclusions With an approved GBS vaccine a near possibility, planning of phase IV studies and identification of critical barriers to implementation are urgently needed. Cross-sector engagement is essential and will facilitate a successful pathway.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus (HPC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) are key components of the brain's memory and navigation systems. Lesions of either region produce profound deficits in spatial cognition and HPC neurons exhibit well-known spatial firing patterns (place fields). Recent studies have also identified an array of navigation-related firing patterns in the RSC. However, there has been little work comparing the response properties and information coding mechanisms of these two brain regions. In the present study, we examined the firing patterns of HPC and RSC neurons in two tasks which are commonly used to study spatial cognition in rodents, open field foraging with an environmental context manipulation and continuous T-maze alternation. We found striking similarities in the kinds of spatial and contextual information encoded by these two brain regions. Neurons in both regions carried information about the rat's current spatial location, trajectories and goal locations, and both regions reliably differentiated the contexts. However, we also found several key differences. For example, information about head direction was a prominent component of RSC representations but was only weakly encoded in the HPC. The two regions also used different coding schemes, even when they encoded the same kind of information. As expected, the HPC employed a sparse coding scheme characterized by compact, high contrast place fields, and information about spatial location was the dominant component of HPC representations. RSC firing patterns were more consistent with a distributed coding scheme. Instead of compact place fields, RSC neurons exhibited broad, but reliable, spatial and directional tuning, and they typically carried information about multiple navigational variables. The observed similarities highlight the closely related functions of the HPC and RSC, whereas the differences in information types and coding schemes suggest that these two regions likely make somewhat different contributions to spatial cognition.</p>

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Microglia are a specialized type of neuroimmune cells that undergo morphological and molecular changes through multiple signaling pathways in response to pathological protein aggregates, neuronal death, tissue injury, or infections. Microglia express Trem2, which serves as a receptor for a multitude of ligands enhancing their phagocytic activity. Trem2 has emerged as a critical modulator of microglial activity, especially in many neurodegenerative disorders. Human TREM2 mutations are associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. Trem2 plays dual roles in neuroinflammation and more specifically in disease-associated microglia. Most recent developments on the molecular mechanisms of Trem2, emphasizing its role in uptake and clearance of amyloid β (Aβ) aggregates and other tissue debris to help protect and preserve the brain, are encouraging. Although Trem2 normally stimulates defense mechanisms, its dysregulation can intensify inflammation, which poses major therapeutic challenges. Recent therapeutic approaches targeting Trem2 via agonistic antibodies and gene therapy methodologies present possible avenues for reducing the burden of neurodegenerative diseases. This review highlights the promise of Trem2 as a therapeutic target, especially for Aβ-associated AD, and calls for more mechanistic investigations to understand the context-specific role of microglial Trem2 in developing effective therapies against neurodegenerative diseases.

                Subramanian et al. identify a macrophage population expressing a TREM2high transcriptional program in the human adult kidney, matching a homologous population in other tissues (adipose, heart, and liver). Trem2high macrophages expand in diabetic kidney disease in both a high-fat-diet-fed mouse model and an independent cohort of patients. Trem2 deletion results in hastened kidney injury in the presence of a high-fat diet, suggesting a role of these macrophages as responders to local tissue injury in obesity- and diabetes-driven kidney injury.

	<p>In the processing of emotions, the brain prepares and reacts in distinctive manners depending upon the negative or positive nuance of the emotion elicitors. Previous investigations showed that negative elicitors generally evoke more intense neural activities than positive and neutral ones, as reflected in the augmented amplitude of all sub-components of the event-related potentials (ERP) late posterior positivity (LPP) complex, while less is known about the emotion of disgust. The present study aimed to examine whether the LPP complex during the processing of disgust stimuli showed greater amplitude than other emotion elicitors with negative or positive valences, thus confirming it as a neural marker of disgust-related negativity bias at earlier or later stages. Thus, in the present study, we leveraged the ERP technique during the execution of an affective self-administered visual stimuli task to disentangle the neural contributions associated with images of positive, negative, disgust, or neutral images. Crucially, we showed that handling with disgust elicitors prompted the greatest neural activity and the highest delay during self-administration. Overall, we demonstrated progressive neural activities associated with the unpleasantness of the emotion elicitors and peculiar processing for disgust compared with all other emotions.</p>

	<p>The utility of transcranial sonography (TCS) remains unclarified for the auxiliary diagnosis of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). We investigated iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and TCS during the examination and diagnosis of high-signal-intensity substantia nigra lesion (HSI-SNL) incidence in PD patients previously diagnosed with dopamine transporter scintigraphy (DAT). The subjects were 67 patients with definitively diagnosed PD after DAT evaluation. Patients with midbrain substantia nigra visible during TCS who previously underwent MIBG were analyzed. The SN+ group comprised patients with extensive pathological HSI-SNL of Okawa class III/IV observed during TCS. The MIBG+ group comprised patients with a heart-to-mediastinum ratio of &amp;amp;le;2.2 during MIBG. TCS was performed to divide patients into the SN+ and SN&amp;amp;minus; groups, and patient characteristics and MIBG findings were compared between the groups. PD was definitively diagnosed in 67 patients, among whom midbrain was visualized during TCS in 43 (64.1%) patients and pathological HSI-SNL was observed in 24 (35.8%). The MIBG findings were normal in six patients (27.3%) with HSI-SNL, and abnormal in seven (63.6%) without HSI-SNL. No significant differences were noted by Okawa classification in clinical characteristics based on the presence or absence of HSI-SNL. Multiple patients with normal findings during MIBG may have HSI-SNL. Thus, confirmatory imaging of HSI-SNL with TCS may be useful for diagnosis.</p>

	<p>Background: This work aimed to study the Village Test (VT) in a group of patients with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) and compare the results with those of a group of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and controls. Methods: A total of 50 patients with AD, 28 patients with MCI, and 38 controls were evaluated. All participants underwent the VT and an extensive neuropsychological evaluation. Results: The mean ages of the participants were 74.4 years for those with AD, 74 for those with MCI, and 70.2 for the controls. The AD group built smaller and essential villages with a scarce use of pieces, a poor use of dynamic pieces, and scarce use of human figures. All constructions were often concentrated in the center of the table. Conclusions: The villages built by the AD group represent a cognitive and affective coarctation and indicate a sense of existential disorientation and isolation. The VT is a useful aid for getting in touch with the inner emotional and existential states of patients with AD, and it could represent a complementary screening tool for orienting cognitive impairment diagnoses.</p>

	<p>The role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is not well understood, even though it is critical for neuronal structure and signaling. This systematic review identified the top deregulated ECM-related pathways in studies that used gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) to document transcriptomic, proteomic, or genomic alterations in PD. PubMed and Google scholar were searched for transcriptomics, proteomics, or genomics studies that employed GSEA on data from PD tissues or cells and reported ECM-related pathways among the top-10 most enriched versus controls. Twenty-seven studies were included, two of which used multiple omics analyses. Transcriptomics and proteomics studies were conducted on a variety of tissue and cell types. Of the 17 transcriptomics studies (16 data sets), 13 identified one or more adhesion pathways in the top-10 deregulated gene sets or pathways, primarily related to cell adhesion and focal adhesion. Among the 8 proteomics studies, 5 identified altered overarching ECM gene sets or pathways among the top 10. Among the 4 genomics studies, 3 identified focal adhesion pathways among the top 10. The findings summarized here suggest that ECM organization/structure and cell adhesion (particularly focal adhesion) are altered in PD and should be the focus of future studies.</p>

	<p>Background: We aimed to study anxiety, depression and quality of life in smokers after stroke by sex. Methods: A longitudinal prospective study with a 24-month follow-up of acute stroke patients who were previously active smokers. Anxiety and depression were evaluated with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, and quality of life was evaluated with the EQ-5D questionnaire. Results: One hundred and eighty patients participated (79.4% men); their mean age was 57.6 years. Anxiety was most prevalent at 3 months (18.9% in men and 40.5% in women) and depression at 12 months (17.9% in men and 27% in women). The worst perceived health occurred at 24 months (EQ-VAS 67.5 in men and 65.1 in women), which was associated with depression (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and Rankin Scale was worse in men (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and depression in women (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Continued tobacco use was associated with worse perceived health at 3 months in men (p = 0.034) and at 12 months in both sexes. Predictor variables of worse perceived health at 24 months remaining at 3 and 12 months were tobacco use in men and neurological damage in women. Conclusion: Differences by sex are observed in the prevalence of anxiety and depression and associated factors and in the predictive factors of perceived health.</p>

	<p>Excessive and prolonged alcohol use can have long-term severe neurological consequences. The mechanisms involved may be complicated; however, new evidence seems to indicate the involvement of iron accumulation and neuroinflammation. Prolonged alcohol consumption has been linked to the accumulation of iron in specific regions of the brain. Evidence suggests that excess iron in the brain can trigger microglia activation in response. This activation leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, which can cause damage to neurons and surrounding brain tissue. Additionally, iron-induced oxidative stress and inflammation can disrupt the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier, allowing immune cells from the periphery to infiltrate the brain. This infiltration can lead to further neuroinflammatory responses. Inflammation in the brain subsequently disrupts neuronal networks, impairs synaptic plasticity, and accelerates neuronal cell death. Consequently, cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and decision-making are compromised. Additionally, chronic neuroinflammation can hasten the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, further exacerbating cognitive impairment. Therefore, alcohol could act as a trigger for iron-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive decline. Overall, the mechanisms at play here seem to strongly link alcohol with cognitive decline, with neuroinflammation resulting from alcohol-induced iron accumulation playing a pivotal role.</p>

	<p>Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR) is a multisystemic, rare, inherited, progressive and adult-onset disease, affecting the sensory-motor nerves, heart, autonomic function, and other organs. There are over 130 mutations known in the TTR gene. The His90Asn mutation has been previously reported in several reports, but its pathogenetic role is still debated. We report two sporadic cases of adult women with a heterozygous His90Asn mutation in TTR gene and neurological involvement extensively investigated. A typical Congo red-positive pathologic deposition of amyloid fibrils in the salivary glands was documented in one subject. Patients were successfully treated with patisiran with a good clinical outcome. These data support a pathogenetic role of His90Asn mutation in hATTR, and suggest early treatment in symptomatic carriers of His90Asn mutation.</p>

                Background Tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes mellitus (DM) co-morbidity is one of the rising public health problems. There is growing evidence that DM is an important risk factor for TB. This study was carried out to know the prevalence of DM among newly detected sputum positive pulmonary TB patients registered in District Tuberculosis Centre and to assess the risk factors of DM among TB patients. Methods In a cross-sectional study, newly detected sputum positive pulmonary TB patients were screened for DM (those having symptoms of DM). Furthermore, they were diagnosed by detecting blood glucose levels (≥200 mg/dL). Mean, standard deviation (SD), Chi-squared and Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact tests were used to determine the significant associations. P-values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Results A total of 215 TB patients were included in this study. The prevalence of DM among TB patients was found to be 23.7% (2.8% known and 97.8% new cases). Significant associations were found between age (>46 years old), educational status, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity, presence of DM symptoms and family history of DM. Conclusions Routine screening for DM is mandatory due to its increasing prevalence, which may help in early diagnosis and to reduce complications by proper management that in turn helps in the successful outcome of TB treatment.

                Oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF), a potentially malignant disorder, is developed by progressive fibrous tissue deposition in connective tissue along with atrophy of oral mucosa. Histological sections also show the mast cell infiltration in submucosa which may indicate their possible role in this entity. Abundant availability of biochemicals in mast cells like histamine and serine proteases like chymase may be released and play specific pathways in the disease pathophysiology. Possibly, if the histamine release has some part to play, diamine oxidase may also be found to have a relationship as it metabolizes histamine. The present study is proposed to identify the presence of chymase, histamine, and diamine oxidase in both, serum as well as tissue by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) respectively. This study may provide probable insight into the mast cell-related chemicals and their association with OSMF.

                Abstract* Background Moldova strives for universal health coverage (UHC) and considers health technology assessment (HTA) an important policy instrument to inform the choice of services that should be covered to progressively realize UHC. It plays a key role in determining which technologies are coved, considering various dimensions often including cost-effectiveness, budget impact, and feasibility. This paper reports on work undertaken to develop a roadmap for HTA implementation, using evidence-informed deliberative processes (EDPs) as the guiding framework. Methods Between 2020 and 2022, we undertook several activities that informed the roadmap. We conducted a needs assessment and an assessment of European HTA best practices using a combination of desk research, interviews and surveys. We then conducted a document review of six selected HTA systems, complimented by expert interviews from three neighbouring countries. Results The roadmap provided a suggested HTA process, which included instructions on how to execute the different steps of the EDP framework to enhance the legitimacy of HTA-informed decision-making. The roadmap encompasses several aspects such as how to organize stakeholder involvement, how to identify and operationalize decision criteria, and how to make the decision process transparent. Guidance was given to the country on establishing a legal framework for HTA; a communication strategy; strengthening capacity and leveraging HTA expertise. The country was also given tailored advice on the positioning of the HTA-agency, first as an entity within the Ministry of Health or the National Agency of Public Health but with the long-term vision for it to be independent of any state institution. Conclusions Despite several challenges, including a partial disruption because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the development of the roadmap for HTA implementation was completed and agreed upon by the Ministry of Health in Moldova. This work has helped motivate and support the country in HTA institutionalization.

                Background This study aimed to determine the relationships between hematological parameters- hemoglobin, Total Leucocyte Counts (TLC), platelet counts, Absolute Neutrophil Counts (ANC), Absolute Lymphocyte Counts (ALC), Neutrophil Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Systemic Immune Inflammatory Index (SII), Neutrophil Monocyte Ratio (NMR), Platelet Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) and the severity of COVID 19 infections and their use in predicting severity of COVID-19 infections. Methods and Material This was a prospective, observational, single-center study of 573 symptomatic adult inpatients of COVID 19 admitted to our tertiary care center. Statistical analysis used The above-mentioned hematological parameter levels were noted and compared between the two categories of COVID-19 infection, namely non-severe and severe COVID-19 using logistic regression methods. Their cut-off values were detected using the ROC curve. Results The median TLC, ANC, NLR, SII, NMR, PLR were notably higher in patients with severe COVID-19 than in those with non-severe COVID-19. Logistic regression analysis showed that NMR (OR=1.029, p=0.006) and ALC (OR=0.999, p=0.002) were statistically significant independent predictors of COVID-19 severity Conclusions The hematological parameters mentioned, can be used for predicting severe COVID-19 infections at admission. ALC and NMR levels could be used as hematological markers to predict severity of COVID-19 in adult patients with their cut off values being < 1105 cells/cubic millimeter and > 10.434 respectively.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Premature newborns are susceptible to retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a vasoproliferative disease of the developing retinal vessels, which is a major cause of potentially avoidable blindness. Due to geographical variations in newborn care, geographic variations in the epidemiology of ROP have been observed internationally during the last several decades. There was a correlation between the severity of the condition and the number of prenatal, postnatal, and other risk factors. This study aimed to examine the incidence and risk factors associated with retinopathy of prematurity in preterm infants. Methods A retrospective review of preterm newborns evaluated for retinopathy of prematurity between January 2016 and December 2022 was carried out at King Fahd Hospital of the University (KFHU), Khobar, Saudi Arabia. Infants who fulfilled the screening criteria (GA < 34 or Birth Weight (WT) ≤ 1500 g) underwent the screening test, and the International Classification of Retinopathy of Prematurity was used to classify retinopathy of prematurity. Risk factors and demographic information regarding ROP were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (version 20) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results Among the 200 preterm neonates that were evaluated and admitted to neonatal critical care units, 37% exhibited premature retinopathy, with 46.7% of those cases being in stage 1. The development of ROP was linked to gestational age, length of mechanical ventilation, septicemia, intraventricular hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, respiratory distress syndrome, and septicemia, according to univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Conclusion The incidence of total retinopathy in premature infants in this population was 37%. Evaluating these risk factors during the screening of high-risk premature infants will help determine the appropriate timing of examinations and treatment.
