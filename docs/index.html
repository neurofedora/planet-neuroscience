              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">A distinct impact of repeated morphine exposure on synaptic plasticity at Schaffer collateral‐CA1, temporoammonic‐CA1, and perforant pathway‐dentate gyrus synapses along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We aimed to study how morphine affects synaptic transmission in the dentate gyrus and CA1 regions along the hippocampal long axis. For this, recording and measuring of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were utilized to test the effects of repeated morphine exposure on paired-pulse evoked responses and long-term potentiation (LTP) at Schaffer collateral-CA1 (Sch-CA1), temporoammonic-CA1 (TA-CA1) and perforant pathway-dentate gyrus (PP-DG) synapses in transverse slices from the dorsal (DH), intermediate (IH), and ventral (VH) hippocampus in adult male rats. After repeated morphine exposure, the expression of opioid receptors and the α1 and α5 GABA<sub>A</sub> subunits were also examined. We found that repeated morphine exposure blunt the difference between the DH and the VH in their basal levels of synaptic transmission at Sch-CA1 synapses that were seen in the control groups. Significant paired-pulse facilitation of excitatory synaptic transmission was observed at Sch-CA1 synapses in slices taken from all three hippocampal segments as well as at PP-DG synapses in slices taken from the VH segment in the morphine-treated groups as compared to the control groups. Interestingly, significant paired-pulse inhibition of excitatory synaptic transmission was observed at TA-CA1 synapses in the DH slices from the morphine-treated group as compared to the control group. While primed-burst stimulation (a protocol reflecting normal neuronal firing) induced a robust LTP in hippocampal subfields in all control groups, resulting in a decaying LTP at TA-CA1 synapses in the VH slices and at PP-DG synapses in both the IH and VH slices taken from the morphine-treated rats. In the DH of morphine-treated rats, we found increased levels of the mRNAs encoding the α1 and α5 GABA<sub>A</sub> subunits as compared to the control group. Taken together, these findings suggest the potential mechanisms through which repeated morphine exposure causes differential changes in circuit excitability and synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus and CA1 regions along the hippocampal long axis.</p>

	<p>The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of simple jaw opening and closing task of chewing movements on the activities of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) from the viewpoint of stress reduction. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the PFC during a block-tapping task of the jaw in healthy participants. Eleven young healthy individuals with normal dentition (7 males and 4 females, mean age 28.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.7 years) volunteered for this study. CBF was measured using a wearable, functional near-infrared spectroscopy device. Measurements were taken using the central incisors and first molars at interocclusal distances of 5 and 10 mm. The participants were asked to bite a hard/soft block. CBF in all conditions showed limited variability or decreasing trend compared to resting state before the task. The main effect was observed for interocclusal distance (p = 0.008), and there were no significant differences for measurement area of the PFC, tooth type, and material type. An interaction was found between tooth type and material type. In conclusion, these results suggest that simple and rhythmical chewing motion has an effect of reducing CBF in the PFC and resting the PFC, which is an especially notable aspect of periodontal sensory information in the molar.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Beyond tradition: using systemic functional linguistics in TED talks [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) is an internationally based open access platform where professionals from various fields are invited to give speeches, and to share ideas with like-minded people. In recent years, topics related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) or the COVID-19 pandemic have become the most popular speech topics on TED. This paper selects speech-related topics on TED during the pandemic, by using systemic functional linguistics to study how discourses are expressed on the platform. Unlike traditional textual analyses, content on TED are normally verbalized, requiring original texts to be presented in an understandable format. As a result, this paper focuses on the functional innovation of new forms of expression on TED. In other words, the functional perspective of the presentation in relation to COVID-19 based topics may rely on the explanation of the meta-meaning of the keywords, posting images and other techniques as auxiliary means for expression, to some extent. These auxiliary techniques offer traditional systemic functional linguistics new meanings in terms of ideational and interpersonal aspects.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Community-based case studies of vaccine hesitancy and the COVID-19 response in South Africa - study protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In 2021 the South African government launched a large COVID-19 immunization campaign with the goal of reaching more than 40 million individuals. Nonetheless, certain international largely internet-based surveys at the time showed a significant proportion of vaccine hesitancy in South Africa. This study aims to determine and co-create with local stakeholders a comprehensive understanding of vaccine hesitancy and opportunities to support the promotion of other COVID-19 health-promoting behaviours at community level. Methods: A mixed-methods multiple case-study design; informed by the socio-ecological model of behaviour change. Four socio-economically diverse communities across South Africa will be selected and data collection will take place concurrently through three iterative phases. Phase 1 will provide insights into community experiences of COVID-19 (response) through desktop mapping exercises, observations, in-depth interviews, and focus group discussions (FGDs) designed as expression sessions with local stakeholders. Phase 2 will explore the extent and drivers of community acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines. This phase will comprise a survey based on WHO’s Behavioural and Social Drivers of Vaccination tool as well as further FGDs with community members. Phase 3 will involve cross-case study syntheses and presentation of findings to national role-players. Discussion: This study will provide ground up, locally responsive, and timeous evidence on the factors influencing COVID-19 health-seeking behaviours to inform ongoing management and mitigation of COVID-19 in South Africa. It will also provide insights into the applicability of a novel vaccine hesitancy model in Africa.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Scoping review on population pharmacokinetics of vancomycin in non-critically ill [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Vancomycin is an effective first-line therapy in MRSA infection, however, achieving an appropriate serum concentration is challenging. Population pharmacokinetics can assist the clinician in the selection of better regimen dosing and improve effectiveness and safety outcomes. Methods: This scoping review aims to outline the evidence in population pharmacokinetic models in non-critical adults hospitalized from 1980 to 2021 and describe the principal software and covariables used in this. A total of 209 papers were fully screened. Finally, we included 17 articles conducted in different locations around the world. Results: This review identified 13 retrospective articles and 4 prospective, 5 describing the use in a general population with gram-positive bacterial infection, 11 evaluated special populations (older, obese, and cancer patients), and 1 mixed population. The main parameters in the models were renal clearance and volume of distribution. The principal covariables that affected the models were creatinine clearance and weight. All studies use internal validation methods, and three of them used an external validation group. This scoping review highlights the principal information of different population pharmacokinetic models and the heterogeneity in the parameters and methods of evaluation. Conclusions: These methods can be used to guide the dosing regimen in different subpopulations. However, it is imperative to define the best fit in every population and conduct an experiment due to the high variability in the present studies.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Cerebrospinal fluid and plasma amine profiles in interictal migraine</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Impaired amine metabolism has been associated with the etiology of migraine, i.e. why patients continue to get migraine attacks. However, evidence from CSF is lacking. Here we evaluated individual amine levels, global amine profiles and amine pathways in CSF and plasma of interictal migraine patients and healthy controls.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>CSF and plasma were sampled between 08:30 and 13:00, randomly and interchangeably over the time span to avoid any diurnal and seasonal influences, from healthy volunteers and interictal migraine patients, matched for age, sex and sampling time. The study was approved by the Local Medical Ethics Committee. Individual amines (n=31), global amine profiles, and specific amine pathways were analyzed using a validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry platform.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We analyzed n=99 participants with migraine with aura, n=98 with migraine without aura, and n=96 healthy volunteers. Univariate analysis with Bonferroni correction indicated that CSF L-Arginine was reduced in migraine with aura (10.4%; <i>p</i>&lt;0.001) and without aura (5.0%; <i>p</i>=0.03). False discovery rate corrected CSF L-Phenylalanine was also lower in migraine with aura (6.9%; <i>p</i>=0.011) and without aura (8.1%; <i>p</i>=0.001; <i>p</i>=0.088 after Bonferroni correction). Multivariate analysis revealed that CSF global amine profiles were similar for both types of migraine (<i>p</i>=0.64), but distinct from controls (<i>p</i>=0.009). Global profile analyses were similar in plasma. Strongest associated pathways with migraine were related to L-Arginine metabolism.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>L-Arginine was decreased in the CSF (but not in plasma) of interictal patients with migraine with or without aura, and associated pathways were altered. This suggests that dysfunction of nitric oxide signaling is involved in susceptibility to getting migraine attacks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Limbic connectivity underlies pain treatment response in small‐fiber neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Small-fiber neuropathy (SFN) is characterized by neuropathic pain due to degeneration of small-diameter nerves in the skin. Given that brain reorganization occurs following chronic neuropathic pain, this study investigated the structural and functional basis of pain-related brain changes after skin nerve degeneration.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Diffusion-weighted and resting-state functional MRI data were acquired from 53 pathologically confirmed SFN patients, and the structural and functional connectivity of the pain-related network was assessed using network-based statistic (NBS) analysis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared with age- and sex-matched controls, the SFN patients exhibited a robust and global reduction of functional connectivity, mainly across the limbic and somatosensory systems. Furthermore, lower functional connectivity was associated with skin nerve degeneration measured by reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density and better therapeutic response to anti-neuralgia medications, particularly for the connectivity between the insula and the limbic areas including the anterior and middle cingulate cortices. Similar to the patterns of functional connectivity changes, the structural connectivity was robustly reduced among the limbic and somatosensory areas, and the cognition-integration areas including the inferior parietal lobule. There was shared reduction of structural and functional connectivity among the limbic, somatosensory, striatal, and cognition-integration systems: (1) between the middle cingulate cortex and inferior parietal lobule and (2) between the thalamus and putamen. These observations indicate the structural basis underlying altered functional connectivity in SFN.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings provide imaging evidence linking structural and functional brain dysconnectivity to sensory deafferentation caused by peripheral nerve degeneration and therapeutic responses for neuropathic pain in SFN.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Analysis of the evolution of resistance to multiple antibiotics enables prediction of the Escherichia coli phenotype-based fitness landscape</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Junichiro Iwasawa, Tomoya Maeda, Atsushi Shibai, Hazuki Kotani, Masako Kawada, Chikara Furusawa</p>

The fitness landscape represents the complex relationship between genotype or phenotype and fitness under a given environment, the structure of which allows the explanation and prediction of evolutionary trajectories. Although previous studies have constructed fitness landscapes by comprehensively studying the mutations in specific genes, the high dimensionality of genotypic changes prevents us from developing a fitness landscape capable of predicting evolution for the whole cell. Herein, we address this problem by inferring the phenotype-based fitness landscape for antibiotic resistance evolution by quantifying the multidimensional phenotypic changes, i.e., time-series data of resistance for eight different drugs. We show that different peaks of the landscape correspond to different drug resistance mechanisms, thus supporting the validity of the inferred phenotype-fitness landscape. We further discuss how inferred phenotype-fitness landscapes could contribute to the prediction and control of evolution. This approach bridges the gap between phenotypic/genotypic changes and fitness while contributing to a better understanding of drug resistance evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">APOE alleles are associated with sex-specific structural differences in brain regions affected in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chloé Savignac, Sylvia Villeneuve, AmanPreet Badhwar, Karin Saltoun, Kimia Shafighi, Chris Zajner, Vaibhav Sharma, Sarah A. Gagliano Taliun, Sali Farhan, Judes Poirier, Danilo Bzdok</p>

Alzheimer’s disease is marked by intracellular tau aggregates in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and extracellular amyloid aggregates in the default network (DN). Here, we examined codependent structural variations between the MTL’s most vulnerable structure, the hippocampus (HC), and the DN at subregion resolution in individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD). By leveraging the power of the approximately 40,000 participants of the UK Biobank cohort, we assessed impacts from the protective <i>APOE</i> ɛ2 and the deleterious <i>APOE</i> ɛ4 Alzheimer’s disease alleles on these structural relationships. We demonstrate ɛ2 and ɛ4 genotype effects on the inter-individual expression of HC-DN co-variation structural patterns at the population level. Across these HC-DN signatures, recurrent deviations in the CA1, CA2/3, molecular layer, fornix’s fimbria, and their cortical partners related to ADRD risk. Analyses of the rich phenotypic profiles in the UK Biobank cohort further revealed male-specific HC-DN associations with air pollution and female-specific associations with cardiovascular traits. We also showed that <i>APOE</i> ɛ2/2 interacts preferentially with HC-DN co-variation patterns in estimating social lifestyle in males and physical activity in females. Our structural, genetic, and phenotypic analyses in this large epidemiological cohort reinvigorate the often-neglected interplay between <i>APOE</i> ɛ2 dosage and sex and link <i>APOE</i> alleles to inter-individual brain structural differences indicative of ADRD familial risk.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Illusory responses across the Lewy body disease spectrum</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To study pareidolias, or perceived meaningful objects in a meaningless stimulus, in patients across the Lewy body (LB) disease spectrum, where most do not report hallucinations or delusions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied illusory responses on the Noise Pareidolia Task in 300 participants [38 cognitively-impaired LB, 65 cognitively-unimpaired LB, 51 Alzheimer's disease-spectrum (AD-s), 146 Controls]. Pairwise between-group comparisons examined how diagnosis impacts the number of illusory responses. Ordinal regression analysis compared the number of illusory responses across diagnosis groups, adjusting for age, sex, and education. Analyses were repeated after removing participants with reported hallucinations or delusions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cognitively-impaired LB participants were 12.3, 4.9, and 4.6 times more likely than Control, cognitively-unimpaired LB, and AD-s participants, respectively, to endorse illusory responses. After adjusting for age, sex and education, the probability of endorsing one or more illusory response was 61% in the cognitively-impaired LB group, compared to 26% in AD-s, 25% in cognitively-unimpaired LB, and 12% in Control participants. All results were similar after repeated analysis only in participants without hallucinations or delusions. In LB without hallucinations or delusions, 52% with mild cognitive impairment and 66.7% with dementia endorsed at least one illusory response.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We found illusory responses are common in cognitively impaired LB patients, including those without any reported psychosis. Our data suggest that, prior to the onset of hallucinations and delusions, the Noise Pareidolia Task can easily be used to screen for unobtrusive pareidolias in all LB patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Clinically meaningful MR endpoints sensitive to preataxic SCA1 and SCA3</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify MR metrics that are most sensitive to early changes in the brain in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) and type 3 (SCA3) using an advanced multi-modal MRI protocol in the multi-site trial setting.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>SCA1 or SCA3 mutation carriers and controls (<i>n</i>=107) underwent MR scanning in the US-European READISCA study to obtain structural, diffusion MRI and MR spectroscopy data using an advanced protocol at 3T. Morphometric, microstructural, and neurochemical metrics were analyzed blinded to diagnosis and compared between preataxic (<i>n</i>=11 SCA1, 28 SCA3), ataxic (<i>n</i>=14 SCA1, 37 SCA3) SCA and control (<i>n</i>=17) groups using non-parametric testing accounting for multiple comparisons. MR metrics that were most sensitive to preataxic abnormalities were identified using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Atrophy and microstructural damage in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles and neurochemical abnormalities in the pons were prominent in both preataxic groups, when patients did not differ from controls clinically. MR metrics were strongly associated with ataxia symptoms, activities of daily living and estimated ataxia duration. A neurochemical measure was the most sensitive metric to preataxic changes in SCA1 (ROC area under the curve (AUC) =0.95) and a microstructural metric was the most sensitive metric to preataxic changes in SCA3 (AUC =0.92).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Changes in cerebellar afferent and efferent pathways underlie the earliest symptoms of both SCAs. MR metrics collected with a harmonized advanced protocol in the multi-site trial setting allow detecting disease effects in individuals before ataxia onset with potential clinical trial utility for subject stratification.</p>

                Background: Ludwig's angina is a potentially life-threatening disease characterized by diffuse bilateral cellulitis with an odontogenic origin. This unique infection is now rare owing to the antibiotic era. Case: This patient presented to the emergency room with trismus, jaw and neck swelling, mild respiratory distress with tachypnea, hyperthermia, and panic. Clinical examination and radiographic evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of Ludwig's angina. As it is a quickly spreading infection, the patient was taken up for immediate surgical decompression leading to pus drainage, removal of the offending tooth, bacterial culture and sensitivity, and administration of empirical antibiotics. As we had operated promptly, there was no need for emergency airway intervention, and the patient had immediate relief from airway distress. Conclusions: Early accurate diagnosis with conservative surgical decompression, thereby negating the need for airway intervention, was vital to avoiding mortality which is always possible in such an expeditious infection.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Areas of research interest: joining the dots between government and research at last? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: With the aim of making it easier for researchers to produce policy-relevant research, the UK Government now requires all departments and arms-length bodies to publish annually-updated statements of their evidence needs, called ‘Areas of Research Interest’ (ARIs).  We describe how ARIs are produced, and how they are used to support this aim. Aims and objectives: In this paper we offer a description of ARIs and their development by UK governmental departments, and an assessment of how different stakeholders, including academia and funders, have responded to or otherwise used the ARIs. Key conclusions: ARIs are a mechanism for organisations to share their research interests with external audiences in the form of a published document. In addition to this primary aim, they also have a much broader set of uses, including connecting departments with each other and helping intermediaries shape engagement plans. All groups would benefit from more robust evidence to choose effective engagement mechanisms, and more can be done to make the ARIs discoverable and useable. Overall, the ARIs are a useful tool to illuminate, and begin to connect different parts of the research-policy system.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Longitudinal effects of asymptomatic C9orf72 carriership on brain morphology</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We investigated effects of <i>C9orf72</i> repeat expansion and gene expression on longitudinal cerebral changes before symptom onset.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We enrolled 79 asymptomatic family members (AFM) from nine families with <i>C9orf72</i> repeat expansion. Twenty-eight AFM carried the mutation (C9+). Participants had up to three MRI scans, after which we compared motor cortex and -tracts between AFM C9+ and AFM C9- using mixed-effects models, incorporating kinship to correct for familial relations and lessen effects of other genetic factors. We also compared cortical, subcortical, cerebellar and connectome structural measurements in a hypothesis-free analysis. We correlated regional <i>C9orf72</i> expression in donor brains with the pattern of cortical thinning in AFM C9+ using meta-regression. For comparison, we included 42 C9+ and 439 C9- patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in this analysis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AFM C9+ motor cortex had less gyrification and was thinner than C9-, without differences in motor tracts. Whole-brain analysis revealed thinner cortex and less gyrification in parietal, occipital and temporal regions, smaller thalami and right hippocampus, and affected frontotemporal connections. Thinning of bilateral precentral, precuneus and left superior parietal cortex was faster in AFM C9+ than in C9-. Higher C9orf72 expression correlated with thinner cortex in both AFM C9+ and ALS C9+.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In asymptomatic <i>C9orf72</i> repeat expansion carriers, brain MRI reveals widespread features suggestive of impaired neurodevelopment, along with faster decline of motor and parietal cortex than found in normal aging. C9orf72 expression might play a role in cortical development, and consequently explain the specific brain abnormalities of mutation carriers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effectiveness of a sexual assault nurse examiner-grounding program (SANE-GP) on knowledge, skill and practice regarding sexual assault examination (SAE) among nurses working in a tertiary care hospital in Udupi district, India: A study protocol [versi</a></h4>

              
                The medico-legal care of victims of sexual assault is very challenging, and requires specific knowledge and skills. Professionals in the emergency departments of hospitals might not have specialised training in forensic science. Nurses have a very significant role in these settings, but they lack any formal forensic training. This study aims to develop a sexual assault nurse examiner-grounding program (SANE-GP) for Indian nurses to inculcate knowledge and skill regarding sexual assault examination. The study adopts a three-stage Delphi technique to develop the training module and uses a time-series design to evaluate the effectiveness of the program. A questionnaire on nurses’ knowledge on sexual assault examination (KQSANE-I) will be developed in phase-I and subsequently used in phase-II. The protocol of SANE-GP will help the medical community to implement the program across India. The implementation of SANE-GP can also help to start a sexual assault nurse examiner network.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Developmental phenomics suggests that H3K4 monomethylation confers multi-level phenotypic robustness</a></h4>

              
                Gandara et al. leverage phenomics to show that H3K4me1 has a pervasive function in Drosophila biology. On a mechanistic level, this histone mark supports the establishment of nuclear microenvironments and improves transcriptional robustness. Hypomethylation results in a loss of phenotypic robustness affecting metabolism, behavior, and offspring production.

                Myeong and Klyachko report an astrocyte-dependent form of synaptic facilitation triggered by a single glutamate release event and operating at subsecond timescales. Astrocyte-driven facilitation dynamically amplifies multi-vesicular release and induces release events with distinctive spatial organization. The rapid timescale of this modulation suggests that astrocytes may contribute to synaptic computations.

                Wang et al. find that hypoxia induces epigenetic inheritance of reduced lipids and fertility in worms and that this is dependent on small RNAs and repressive chromatin modifications. They show that small RNAs are sufficient to induce heritable fertility reductions and track a labeled endogenous dsRNA across generations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mir204 and Mir211 suppress synovial inflammation and proliferation in rheumatoid arthritis by targeting Ssrp1</a></h4>

              
                Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory joint disease characterized by synovial hyperplasia. <i>Mir204</i> and <i>Mir211</i> are homologous miRNAs with the same gene targeting spectrum. It is known that <i>Mir204/211</i> play an important role in protecting osteoarthritis development; however, the roles of <i>Mir204/211</i> in RA disease have not been determined. In the present study, we investigated the effects and molecular mechanisms of <i>Mir204/211</i> on synovial inflammation and hyperproliferation in RA. The effects of <i>Mir204/211</i> on the inflammation and abnormal proliferation in primary fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) were examined by <i>Mir204/211</i> gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches in vitro and in vivo. We identified the structure-specific recognition protein 1 (<i>Ssrp1</i>) as a downstream target gene of <i>Mir204/211</i> based on the bioinformatics analysis. We overexpressed <i>Ssrp1</i>and <i>Mir204/211</i> in FLS to determine the relationship between <i>Ssrp1</i> and <i>Mir204/211</i> and their effects on synovial hyperplasia. We created a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model in wild-type as well as <i>Mir204/211</i> double knockout (dKO) mice to induce RA phenotype and administered adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated <i>Ssrp1</i>-<i>shRNA</i> (AAV-<i>shSsrp1</i>) by intra-articular injection into <i>Mir204/211</i> dKO mice. We found that <i>Mir204/211</i> attenuated excessive cell proliferation and synovial inflammation in RA. <i>Ssrp1</i> was the downstream target gene of <i>Mir204/211. Mir204/211</i> affected synovial proliferation and decelerated RA progression by targeting <i>Ssrp1</i>. CIA mice with <i>Mir204/211</i> deficiency displayed enhanced synovial hyperplasia and inflammation. RA phenotypes observed in <i>Mir204/211</i> deficient mice were significantly ameliorated by intra-articular delivery of AAV-<i>shSsrp1</i>, confirming the involvement of <i>Mir204/211</i>-<i>Ssrp1</i>signaling during RA development. In this study, we demonstrated that <i>Mir204/211</i> antagonize synovial hyperplasia and inflammation in RA by regulation of <i>Ssrp1</i>. <i>Mir204/211</i> may serve as novel agents to treat RA disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Emergent color categorization in a neural network trained for object recognition</a></h4>

              
                Color is a prime example of categorical perception, yet it is unclear why and how color categories emerge. On the one hand, prelinguistic infants and several animals treat color categorically. On the other hand, recent modeling endeavors have successfully utilized communicative concepts as the driving force for color categories. Rather than modeling categories directly, we investigate the potential emergence of color categories as a result of acquiring visual skills. Specifically, we asked whether color is represented categorically in a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to recognize objects in natural images. We systematically trained new output layers to the CNN for a color classification task and, probing novel colors, found borders that are largely invariant to the training colors. The border locations were confirmed using an evolutionary algorithm that relies on the principle of categorical perception. A psychophysical experiment on human observers, analogous to our primary CNN experiment, shows that the borders agree to a large degree with human category boundaries. These results provide evidence that the development of basic visual skills can contribute to the emergence of a categorical representation of color.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tuning of motor outputs produced by spinal stimulation during voluntary control of torque directions in monkeys</a></h4>

              
                Spinal stimulation is a promising method to restore motor function after impairment of descending pathways. While paresis, a weakness of voluntary movements driven by surviving descending pathways, can benefit from spinal stimulation, the effects of descending commands on motor outputs produced by spinal stimulation are unclear. Here, we show that descending commands amplify and shape the stimulus-induced muscle responses and torque outputs. During the wrist torque tracking task, spinal stimulation, at a current intensity in the range of balanced excitation and inhibition, over the cervical enlargement facilitated and/or suppressed activities of forelimb muscles. Magnitudes of these effects were dependent on directions of voluntarily produced torque and positively correlated with levels of voluntary muscle activity. Furthermore, the directions of evoked wrist torque corresponded to the directions of voluntarily produced torque. These results suggest that spinal stimulation is beneficial in cases of partial lesion of descending pathways by compensating for reduced descending commands through activation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections to motoneurons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Spinal premotor interneurons controlling antagonistic muscles are spatially intermingled</a></h4>

              
                Elaborate behaviours are produced by tightly controlled flexor-extensor motor neuron activation patterns. Motor neurons are regulated by a network of interneurons within the spinal cord, but the computational processes involved in motor control are not fully understood. The neuroanatomical arrangement of motor and premotor neurons into topographic patterns related to their controlled muscles is thought to facilitate how information is processed by spinal circuits. Rabies retrograde monosynaptic tracing has been used to label premotor interneurons innervating specific motor neuron pools, with previous studies reporting topographic mediolateral positional biases in flexor and extensor premotor interneurons. To more precisely define how premotor interneurons contacting specific motor pools are organized, we used multiple complementary viral-tracing approaches in mice to minimize systematic biases associated with each method. Contrary to expectations, we found that premotor interneurons contacting motor pools controlling flexion and extension of the ankle are highly intermingled rather than segregated into specific domains like motor neurons. Thus, premotor spinal neurons controlling different muscles process motor instructions in the absence of clear spatial patterns among the flexor-extensor circuit components.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">T cells modulate the microglial response to brain ischemia</a></h4>

              
                Neuroinflammation after stroke is characterized by the activation of resident microglia and the invasion of circulating leukocytes into the brain. Although lymphocytes infiltrate the brain in small number, they have been consistently demonstrated to be the most potent leukocyte subpopulation contributing to secondary inflammatory brain injury. However, the exact mechanism of how this minimal number of lymphocytes can profoundly affect stroke outcome is still largely elusive. Here, using a mouse model for ischemic stroke, we demonstrated that early activation of microglia in response to stroke is differentially regulated by distinct T cell subpopulations – with T<sub>H1</sub> cells inducing a type I INF signaling in microglia and regulatory T cells (T<sub>REG</sub>) cells promoting microglial genes associated with chemotaxis. Acute treatment with engineered T cells overexpressing IL-10 administered into the cisterna magna after stroke induces a switch of microglial gene expression to a profile associated with pro-regenerative functions. Whereas microglia polarization by T cell subsets did not affect the acute development of the infarct volume, these findings substantiate the role of T cells in stroke by polarizing the microglial phenotype. Targeting T cell-microglia interactions can have direct translational relevance for further development of immune-targeted therapies for stroke and other neuroinflammatory conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Meta-Research: The need for more research into reproductive health and disease</a></h4>

              
                Reproductive diseases have a significant impact on human health, especially on women’s health: endometriosis affects 10% of all reproductive-aged women but is often undiagnosed for many years, and preeclampsia claims over 70,000 maternal and 500,000 neonatal lives every year. Infertility rates are also rising. However, relatively few new treatments or diagnostics for reproductive diseases have emerged in recent decades. Here, based on analyses of PubMed, we report that the number of research articles published on non-reproductive organs is 4.5 times higher than the number published on reproductive organs. Moreover, for the two most-researched reproductive organs (breast and prostate), the focus is on non-reproductive diseases such as cancer. Further, analyses of grant databases maintained by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the National Institutes of Health in the United States show that the number of grants for research on non-reproductive organs is 6-7 times higher than the number for reproductive organs. Our results suggest that there are too few researchers working in the field of reproductive health and disease, and that funders, educators and the research community must take action to combat this longstanding disregard for reproductive science.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Monoallelic CRMP1 gene variants cause neurodevelopmental disorder</a></h4>

              
                Collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs) are key for brain development and function. Here, we link CRMP1 to a neurodevelopmental disorder. We report heterozygous <i>de novo</i> variants in the <i>CRMP1</i> gene in three unrelated individuals with muscular hypotonia, intellectual disability and/or autism spectrum disorder. Based on <i>in silico</i> analysis these variants are predicted to affect the CRMP1 structure. We further analyzed the effect of the variants on the protein structure/levels and cellular processes. We showed that the human <i>CRMP1</i> variants impact the oligomerization of CRMP1 proteins. Moreover, overexpression of the <i>CRMP1</i> variants affect neurite outgrowth of murine cortical neurons. While altered CRMP1 levels have been reported in psychiatric diseases, genetic variants in <i>CRMP1</i> gene have never been linked to human disease. We report for the first-time variants in the <i>CRMP1</i> gene and emphasize its key role in brain development and function by linking directly to a human neurodevelopmental disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Defining cellular population dynamics at single-cell resolution during prostate cancer progression</a></h4>

              
                Advanced prostate malignancies are a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men, in large part due to our incomplete understanding of cellular drivers of disease progression. We investigate prostate cancer cell dynamics at single-cell resolution from disease onset to the development of androgen independence in an in vivo murine model. We observe an expansion of a castration-resistant intermediate luminal cell type that correlates with treatment resistance and poor prognosis in human patients. Moreover, transformed epithelial cells and associated fibroblasts create a microenvironment conducive to pro-tumorigenic immune infiltration, which is partially androgen responsive. Androgen-independent prostate cancer leads to significant diversification of intermediate luminal cell populations characterized by a range of androgen signaling activity, which is inversely correlated with proliferation and mRNA translation. Accordingly, distinct epithelial populations are exquisitely sensitive to translation inhibition, which leads to epithelial cell death, loss of pro-tumorigenic signaling, and decreased tumor heterogeneity. Our findings reveal a complex tumor environment largely dominated by castration-resistant luminal cells and immunosuppressive infiltrates.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cell cycle-specific loading of condensin I is regulated by the N-terminal tail of its kleisin subunit</a></h4>

              
                Condensin I is a pentameric protein complex that plays an essential role in mitotic chromosome assembly in eukaryotic cells. Although it has been shown that condensin I loading is mitosis-specific, it remains poorly understood how the robust cell cycle regulation of condensin I is achieved. Here we set up a panel of <i>in vitro</i> assays to demonstrate that cell cycle-specific loading of condensin I is regulated by the N-terminal tail (N-tail) of its kleisin subunit CAP-H. Deletion of the N-tail accelerates condensin I loading and chromosome assembly in <i>Xenopus</i> egg mitotic extracts. Phosphorylation-deficient and phosphorylation-mimetic mutations in the CAP-H N-tail decelerate and accelerate condensin I loading, respectively. Remarkably, deletion of the N-tail enables condensin I to assemble mitotic chromosome-like structures even in interphase extracts. Together with other extract-free functional assays <i>in vitro</i>, our results uncover one of the multilayered mechanisms that ensure cell cycle-specific loading of condensin I onto chromosomes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single amino acid residue mediates reciprocal specificity in two mosquito odorant receptors</a></h4>

              
                The southern house mosquito, <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i>, utilizes two odorant receptors, CquiOR10 and CquiOR2, narrowly tuned to oviposition attractants and well conserved among mosquito species. They detect skatole and indole, respectively, with reciprocal specificity. We swapped the transmembrane (TM) domains of CquiOR10 and CquiOR2 and identified TM2 as a specificity determinant. With additional mutations, we showed that CquiOR10A73L behaved like CquiOR2. Conversely, CquiOR2L74A recapitulated CquiOR10 specificity. Next, we generated structural models of CquiOR10 and CquiOR10A73L using RoseTTAFold and AlphaFold and docked skatole and indole using RosettaLigand. These modeling studies suggested space-filling constraints around A73. Consistent with this hypothesis, CquiOR10 mutants with a bulkier residue (Ile, Val) were insensitive to skatole and indole, whereas CquiOR10A73G retained the specificity to skatole and showed a more robust response than the wildtype receptor CquiOR10. On the other hand, Leu to Gly mutation of the indole receptor CquiOR2 reverted the specificity to skatole. Lastly, CquiOR10A73L, CquiOR2, and CquiOR2L74I were insensitive to 3-ethylindole, whereas CquiOR2L74A and CquiOR2L74G gained activity. Additionally, CquiOR10A73G gave more robust responses to 3-ethylindole than CquiOR10. Thus, we suggest the specificity of these receptors is mediated by a single amino acid substitution, leading to finely tuned volumetric space to accommodate specific oviposition attractants.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ventral Tegmental Area Glutamate Neurons establish a mu-opioid receptor gated circuit to mesolimbic dopamine neurons and regulate prescription opioid-seeking behavior</a></h4>

              
                A two-neuron model of ventral tegmental area (VTA) opioid function classically involves VTA GABA neuron regulation of VTA dopamine neurons via a mu-opioid receptor dependent inhibitory circuit. However, this model predates the discovery of a third major type of neuron in the VTA: glutamatergic neurons. We find that about one-quarter of VTA neurons expressing the mu-opioid receptor are glutamate neurons without molecular markers of GABA co-release. Glutamate-Mu opioid receptor neurons are topographically distributed in the anterior VTA. The majority of remaining VTA mu-opioid receptor neurons are GABAergic neurons that are largely within the posterior VTA and do not express molecular markers of glutamate co-release. Optogenetic stimulation of VTA glutamate neurons results in monosynaptic excitatory currents recorded from VTA dopamine neurons that are reduced by presynaptic activation of the mu-opioid receptor ex vivo, establishing a local mu-opioid receptor dependent excitatory circuit from VTA glutamate neurons to VTA dopamine neurons. This VTA glutamate to VTA dopamine pathway regulates dopamine release to the nucleus accumbens through mu-opioid receptor activity in vivo. Behaviorally, VTA glutamate calcium-related neuronal activity increased following oxycodone consumption and response-contingent oxycodone-associated cues during self-administration and abstinent reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior. Further, chemogenetic inhibition of VTA glutamate neurons reduced abstinent oxycodone-seeking behavior in male but not female mice. These results establish 1) a three-neuron model of VTA opioid function involving a mu-opioid receptor gated VTA glutamate neuron pathway to VTA dopamine neurons that controls dopamine release within the nucleus accumbens, and 2) that VTA glutamate neurons participate in prescription opioid-seeking behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Emergence of counting in the brains of 3- to 5-year-old children</a></h4>

              
                Learning to map number words onto their ordinal and quantitative meanings is a key step in the acquisition of formal mathematics. Previous neuroimaging work suggests that the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and the fronto-temporal language network may be involved in representing number words. However, the contribution of early-developing numerosity representations to the acquisition of counting has not been tested in children. If regions that support numerosity processing are important for the acquisition of counting, then there should be functional overlap between numerosity representations and number word representations in the brain, before children have mastered counting. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we identified numerosity processing regions in 3- to 5-year-old children during a numerosity comparison task. To identify neural representations of number words, we measured changes in neural amplitudes while those same children listened to number words and color words and while they listened to counting and alphabet sequences. Across multiple whole-brain analyses, we found that the bilateral IPS consistently supported representations of numerosities, number words, and counting sequences. Functional overlap between numerosities and unknown counting sequences was also evident in the left IFG, and in some cases number word representations emerged in the left hemisphere fronto-temporal language network. These results provide new evidence from children that primitive numerosity processing regions of the brain interface with the language network to ground the acquisition of verbal counting.

                Background: Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is a common condition that frequently transitions to chronic symptoms. Experimental pain models that mimic the symptoms of clinical TMD may be useful in understanding the mechanisms, and sex differences, present in this disorder. Here we aimed to comprehensively characterise the nature and time-course of pain, functional impairment and hyperalgesia induced by repeated intramuscular injection of nerve growth factor (NGF) into the masseter muscle, and to investigate sex differences in the NGF-induced pain experience. Methods: 94 healthy individuals participated in a longitudinal observational study with 30-day follow-up. NGF was injected into the right masseter muscle on Day 0 and Day 2. Participants attended laboratory sessions to assess pain (Numerical Rating Scale; NRS), functional limitation (mouth opening distance, Jaw Functional Limitation Scale; JFLS) and mechanical sensitization (pressure pain thresholds; PPTs) on Days 0, 2 and 5 and completed twice daily electronic pain dairies from Day 0 to day 30. Results: Peak pain averaged 2.0/10 (95 % CI: 1.6-2.4) at rest and 4.3/10 (95 % CI: 3.9-4.8) on chewing. Pain-free mouth opening distance reduced from 5.0 cm (95 % CI: 4.8-5.1 cm) on Day 0 to 3.7 cm (95 % CI: 3.5-3.9 cm) on Day 5. The greatest reduction in PPTs was observed over the masseter muscle. Females experienced higher pain, greater functional impairment, and greater sensitivity to mechanical stimuli than males. Conclusion: Intramuscular injection of NGF is a useful model with which to explore the mechanisms, and sex differences, present in clinical TMD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Genetic Substrates of Brain Vulnerability and Resilience in APOE2 Mice Transitioning from Midlife to Old Age</a></h4>

              
                The interplay between genotype, age, and sex may play an important role in determining successful versus pathological aging. Predicting brain networks vulnerable to age associated decline, or conversely identifying brain networks and associated molecular pathways that promote resilience will inform on treatment and prevention strategies. APOE allelic variation modulate brain vulnerability and cognitive resilience during aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The APOE4 allele confers the most risk and has been intensely studied with respect to the control APOE3 allele. The APOE2 allele has been less studied, and the mechanisms by which it confers cognitive resilience and neuroprotection remain largely unknown. Mouse models with targeted replacement of the murine APOE gene with the human major APOE2 alleles provide useful tools to address such questions. Our goals were to identify changes during a critical period of middle to old age transition, and to examine whether female sex confers specific vulnerability. Our results support that age, but not female sex was important in modulating learning and memory estimates based on Morris water maze metrics, including the total distance swam to a target, the distance in the target quadrant, and the absolute winding number characterizing the shape of the swim trajectory. Diffusion weighted MRI provided estimates for atrophy, microstructural changes through fractional anisotropy, and cellularity changes through the return to origin probability from ensemble average diffusion propagators. We detected a small but significant 3% global brain atrophy due to aging, reflected by regional atrophy in the hippocampal commissure (15%), fornix, and cingulate cortex 24 (9%). Females had larger regional volumes relative to males for the bed nucleus of stria terminalis, subbrachial nucleus, postsubiculum ({approx}10%), and claustrum (>5%), while males had larger volumes for the brachium of the superior colliculus, orbitofrontal cortex, frontal association cortex, and the longitudinal fasciculus of pons (>9%). Age promoted atrophy in both white matter (anterior commissure, corpus callosum, etc.), and gray matter, in particular in olfactory cortex, frontal association area 3, thalamus, hippocampus and cerebellum. A negative age by sex interaction was noted for the olfactory areas, piriform cortex, amygdala, ventral hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and cerebellum, suggesting faster decline in females. We used vertex screening to find associations between connectome and traits, and sparse multiple canonical correlation analysis to integrate our analyses over connectomes, traits, and RNA-seq. Brain subgraphs favored in males included the secondary motor cortex and superior cerebellar peduncle, while those for females included hippocampus and primary somatosensory cortex. Connectivity loss during transition from middle to old age affected the hippocampus and primary somatosensory cortex. We validated these subgraphs using neural networks showing increased accuracy for sex prediction from 81.9% when using the whole connectome, to 94.28% when using the subgraph estimated through vertex screening. We hypothesized that blood gene expression may help track brain and behavior changes with age and sex. The largest fold change for age related genes was for Cpt1c (log2FC = 7.1), involved in oxidation, transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria, lipid metabolic processes. Arg1, a critical regulator of innate and adaptive immune responses (log2FC = 4.9) also showed age specific changes. Amongst the sex related genes, the largest FC were observed for Maoa (log2FC = 4.9) involved in the degradation of the neurotransmitters serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine, and implicated in response to stress. Four genes were common for age and sex related vulnerability: Myo1e (log2FC = -1.5), Creld2 (log2FC = 1.4), Ptprt (log2FC = 2.9), and Pex1 (log2FC = 3.6). Genes with the highest weight after connectome filtering included Ankzfp1, Pex1, Cep250, Nat14, Arg1, and Rangrf. Connectome filtered genes pointed to pathways relate to stress response, transport, and metabolic processes. We propose modeling approaches using sparse canonical correlation analysis to relate quantitative traits to vulnerable brain networks, and blood markers for biological processes. Our study investigated the APOE2 impact on neurocognition, brain networks, and biological pathways during aging. Identifying such brain and gene networks may help reveal targets for therapies that support successful aging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A subcortical origin for rapid, target-oriented corticospinal excitability changes during visually guided reaching</a></h4>

              
                During visually guided reaching, proximal limb muscles can be activated within 80 ms of target appearance. Such 'express' visuomotor responses are temporally aligned with target appearance rather than movement onset, and invariably tuned towards the direction of the visual target regardless of the instructed reach direction. These features prompt the hypothesis that express visuomotor responses are driven by a subcortical pathway. We tested this by measuring the changes in Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) following Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) or Transcranial Electrical Stimulation (TES) of the motor cortex as participants reached either towards or away from visual targets. We found that 70-80 ms after target presentation, MEPs in primary shoulder flexor muscle (pectoralis major) were oriented towards the target direction regardless of whether the participant subsequently reached towards or away from the target. Similar target-oriented MEP modulations were seen in posterior deltoid and biceps brachii, whereas MEPs in a finger muscle were affected neither by target nor reach direction. Critically, there were no significant differences in modulation of responses to TMS and TES across all reaching conditions, which suggests that the target-oriented modulation occurs downstream of the motor cortex output neurons. Combined, our results show that rapid target-oriented corticospinal excitability changes are tuned to the location of the visual target and at least partly driven by a subcortical pathway. A prime candidate for such subcortical modulation involves the superior colliculus and reticular formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Conditional deletion of LRRC8A in the brain protects against stroke damage independently of effect on swelling-activated glutamate release</a></h4>

              
                The ubiquitous volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs), which are composed of LRRC8 proteins, facilitate cell volume homeostasis, and contribute to many other physiological processes. Prior studies demonstrated that treatment with non-specific VRAC blockers, or brain-specific deletion of the essential VRAC subunit LRRC8A, are highly protective in rodent stroke. In this work, we tested the widely accepted idea that harmful effects of VRACs in the brain are mediated by pathological release of the excitatory transmitter glutamate. We used two molecular genetic strategies to ablate LRRC8A expression in either brain astrocytes only (inducible deletion of Lrrc8a(flox/flox) with Aldh1l1-CreERT2) or the majority of brain cells (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes with Nestin-Cre). To produce stroke, genetically modified mice were subjected to a 40-minute occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. The inducible deletion of astrocytic LRRC8A yielded no histological or behavioral protection. In contrast, the brain-wide LRRC8A knockout reduced ischemic infarction by ~50% in both heterozygotes (Het) and the full Lrrc8a knockout (KO) as compared to the control Lrrc8a(flox/+) genotype. However, despite identical brain damage, Het and KO mice dramatically differed in their VRAC activities. Het mice had full swelling-activated glutamate release, while KO animals showed its virtual absence. These new findings refute the notion that VRAC-mediated glutamate release plays significant role in ischemic brain injury.

                Predictive coding as a theoretical framework that has received much attention in recent years is often used to explain the mechanisms underlying various cognitive functions, especially during motor observation when prediction of others' behavior is crucial for successful social interactions. The action observation network(AON) has been extensively studied and confirmed, but the interactions between the main regions of AON are still not well understood. Here we made use of the high spatial and temporal resolution of intracranial Electrocorticography (ECoG), to test the functions and interactions of the key nodes of AON including precentral, supramarginal and visual areas. We found more top-down beta oscillation from precentral to supramarginal during the observation of predictable actions while more bottom-up gamma oscillation from visual to supramarginal for unpredictable action s.These provide strong evidence to illustrate how our brain perceive and understand other people's actions in a predictive manner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A phenotypic screening platform for chronic pain therapeutics using all-optical electrophysiology</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain associated with osteoarthritis (OA) remains an intractable problem with few effective treatment options. New approaches are needed to model the disease biology and to drive discovery of therapeutics. Here, we present an in vitro model of OA pain, where dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons were sensitized by a defined mixture of disease-relevant inflammatory mediators, here called Sensitizing PAin Reagent Composition or SPARC. OA-SPARC components showed synergistic or additive effects when applied in combination and induced pain phenotypes in vivo. To measure the effect of OA-SPARC on neural firing in a scalable format for drug discovery, we used a custom system for high throughput all-optical electrophysiology. This system enabled light-based membrane voltage recordings from hundreds of neurons in parallel with single cell resolution and a throughput of up to 500,000 neurons per day, with patch clamp-like single action potential resolution. A computational framework was developed to construct a multiparameter OA-SPARC neuronal phenotype and to quantitatively assess phenotype reversal by candidate pharmacology with different mechanisms of action. We screened ~3000 approved drugs and mechanistically focused compounds, yielding data from over 1.2 million individual neurons with detailed assessment of both functional OA-SPARC phenotype rescue and orthogonal 'off-target' effects. Analysis of confirmed hits revealed diverse potential analgesic mechanisms including well-known ion channel modulators as well as less characterized mechanisms including MEK inhibitors and tyrosine kinase modulators, providing validation of the platform for pain drug discovery.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Diverse beta burst waveform motifs characterize movement-related cortical dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Classical analyses of induced, frequency-specific neural activity typically average band-limited power over trials. More recently, it has become widely appreciated that in individual trials, beta band activity occurs as transient bursts rather than amplitude-modulated oscillations. Most studies of beta bursts treat them as unitary, and having a stereotyped waveform. However, we show there is a wide diversity of burst shapes. Using a biophysical model of burst generation, we demonstrate that waveform variability is predicted by variability in the synaptic drives that generate beta bursts. We then use a novel, adaptive burst detection algorithm to identify bursts from human MEG sensor data recorded during a joystick-based reaching task, and apply principal component analysis to burst waveforms to define a set of dimensions, or motifs, that best explain waveform variance. Finally, we show that bursts with a particular range of waveform motifs, ones not fully accounted for by the biophysical model, differentially contribute to movement-related beta dynamics. Sensorimotor beta bursts are therefore not homogeneous events and likely reflect distinct computational processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ten years of unpredictable chronic stress in zebrafish: a systematic review and meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a model animal that is being increasingly used in neuroscience research. A decade ago, the first study on unpredictable chronic stress (UCS) in zebrafish was published, inspired by protocols established for rodents in the early 1980's. Since then, several studies have been published by different groups, in some cases with conflicting results. We conducted a systematic review to identify studies evaluating the effects of UCS in zebrafish and meta-analytically synthetized the data of neurobehavioral outcomes and relevant biomarkers. Literature searches were performed in three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) and a two-step screening process based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. The included studies underwent extraction of qualitative and quantitative data, as well as risk of bias assessment. Outcomes of included studies (n = 38) were grouped into anxiety/fear-related behaviour, locomotor function, social behaviour, or cortisol level domains. UCS increased anxiety/fear-related behaviour and cortisol levels while decreased locomotor function, but a significant summary effect was not observed for social behaviour. Despite including a significant number of studies, the high heterogeneity and the methodological and reporting problems evidenced in the risk of bias analysis make it difficult to assess the internal validity of most studies and the overall validity of the model. Our review thus evidences the need to conduct well-designed experiments to better evaluate the effects of UCS on the behaviour of zebrafish.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modelling Spontaneous Firing Activity of the Motor Cortex in a Spiking Neural Network with Random and Local Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Computational models of cortical activity can provide insight into the mechanisms of higher-order processing in the human brain including planning, perception and the control of movement. Activity in the cortex is ongoing even in the absence of sensory input or discernable movements and is thought to be linked to the topology of the underlying cortical circuitry (Ringach2009). However, the connectivity and its functional role in the generation of spatio-temporal firing patterns and cortical computations are still vastly unknown. Movement of the body is a key function of the brain, with the motor cortex the main cortical area implicated in the generation of movement. We built a spiking neural network model of the motor cortex which incorporates a laminar structure and circuitry based on a previous cortical model by (Potjans2014). A local connectivity scheme was implemented to introduce more physiological plausbility to the cortex model, and the effect on the rates, distributions and irregularity of neuronal firing, was compared to the original random connectivity method and experimental data. Local connectivity increased the distribution of and overall rate of neuronal firing. It also resulted in the irregularity of firing being more similar to those observed in experimental measurements, and a reduction in the variability in power spectrum measures. The larger variability in dynamical behaviour of the local connectivity model suggests that the topological structure of the connections in neuronal population plays a significant role in firing patterns during spontaneous activity. This model aims to take steps towards replicating the macroscopic network of the motor cortex, replicating realistic firing in order to shed light on information coding in the cortex. Large scale computational models such as this one can capture how structure and function relate to observable neuronal firing behaviour, and investigates the underlying computational mechanisms of the brain.

                Neurons can produce a number of qualitatively different spiking dynamics, determined by external conditions like temperature and internal properties such as ion channel composition. The dynamical excitability type can impact the activity of the network, particularly its (de)synchronisation state. Neurons with an onset of spiking via a saddle homoclinic orbit (HOM) bifurcation tend to synchronise inhibitory networks while they organise the spiking activity of excitatory networks into a splay state, where firing phases differ across neurons such that they are regularly distributed in time. Based on mathematical neuron models with dendrites, we here demonstrate that the extent of dendritic arborisation can switch the excitability type to a HOM spiking onset and hence can induce (de)synchronised network states. Our analysis is applicable to a general class of spike-generating neuron models (from ball-and-stick models to anatomically reconstructed neuron models) and highlights the importance of neuronal morphology for the susceptibility of neural tissue to synchronisation in health and disease.

                Neurodegeneration and its concomitant loss of cognitive function is associated with inflammation and an accumulation of lipids, in particular cholesterol. In the brain, cholesterol is made in astrocytes and transported to surrounding cells by apolipoprotein E (apoE). Elevated cholesterol promotes inflammation in peripheral tissues, but whether astrocyte cholesterol can drive inflammation in the brain is unclear. Here we show that pro-inflammatory cytokines induce cholesterol synthesis in astrocytes. The astrocytes release the cholesterol and immune cells take it up, which causes clustering of proinflammatory receptors in lipid rafts, perpetuating the inflammatory signal. Knockout of cholesterol synthesis in astrocytes blocks the production of inflammatory cytokines in an AD mouse brain and reduces neuroinflammation induced by peripheral injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the mouse. We conclude that astrocyte cholesterol is a paracrine signal to microglia and tissue-resident macrophages, resulting in increased neuroinflammation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating hippocampal replay without a ground truth</a></h4>

              
                During rest and sleep, memory traces replay in the brain. The dialogue between brain regions during replay is thought to stabilize labile memory traces for long-term storage. However, because replay is an internally-driven, spontaneous phenomenon, it does not have a ground truth - an external reference that can validate whether a memory has truly been replayed. Instead, replay detection is based on the similarity between the sequential neural activity comprising the replay event and the corresponding template of neural activity generated during active locomotion. If the statistical likelihood of observing such a match by chance is sufficiently low, the candidate replay event is inferred to be replaying that specific memory. However, without the ability to evaluate whether replay detection methods are successfully detecting true events and correctly rejecting non-events, the evaluation and comparison of different replay methods is challenging. To circumvent this problem, we present a new framework for evaluating replay, tested using hippocampal neural recordings from rats exploring two novel linear tracks. Using this two-track paradigm, our framework selects replay events based on their temporal fidelity (sequence-based detection), and applies a cross-validation using each event's trajectory discriminability, where cross-track sequenceless decoding is used to quantify whether the track replaying is also the most likely track being reactivated.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Interactive auditory task reveals complex sensory-action integration in mouse primary auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Predictive coding theory postulates that the brain achieves perception by actively making predictions about the incoming sensory information and correcting them if errors signals arise. These signals are likely the most relevant when the individual is actively interacting with the environment and where the sensory outcome determines the ongoing action. In addition, the cerebral cortex is thought to play a key role in generating these signals. Thus, to study the representation of error signals in the primary sensory cortex, we trained mice to perform an interactive auditory task that coupled their actions to the generated sound and perturbed this coupling to evoke putative error responses. We imaged Layer 2/3 (L2/3) and Layer 4 (L4) neurons in the mouse primary auditory cortex, and we identified not only neurons that mainly encoded action related information but also neurons encoding the mismatch between the action and the sound. These results show that a subset of A1 neurons encode the nonlinear interactions between the sound and the action. Furthermore, more L2/3 neurons encoded action related information than L4, indicating that action-sound integration emerges hierarchically in A1 circuits. Together, our results show that complex interactions between action and sound happen in A1 and that some A1 neurons responses reflect the violation of the learnt relationship between the action and sound feedback. Thus, primary sensory cortices not only encode sensory driven activity but also represent the complex interplay between sensory inputs, expectations, and errors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterizing habit learning in the human brain at the individual and group levels: a multi-modal MRI study</a></h4>

              
                The dual-process theory of action control postulates that there are two competitive and complementary mechanisms that control our behavior: a goal-directed system that executes deliberate actions, explicitly aimed toward a particular outcome, and a habitual system that autonomously execute well-learned actions, typically following an encounter with a previously associated cue. In line with dual-process theory, animal studies have provided convincing evidence for dissociable neural mechanisms, mainly manifested in cortico-striatal regions, involved in goal-directed and habitual action control. While substantial progress has been made in characterizing the neural mechanism underlying habit learning in animals, we still lack knowledge on how habits are formed and maintained in the human brain. Thus far only one study, conducted more than a decade ago by Tricomi et al. (2009), has been able to induce habitual behavior in humans via extensive training. This study also implicated the posterior putamen in the process, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, recent attempts to replicate the behavioral results of this study were not successful. This leaves the research of human habits, and particularly the research of their formation through extensive repetition, as well as their neural basis, limited and far behind the animal research in the field. This motivated us to (1) attempt to replicate the behavioral and imaging main findings of Tricomi et al., (2) identify further functional and microstructural neural modifications associated with habit formation and manifestation, and (3) investigate the relationships between functional and structural plasticity and individual differences in habit expression. To this end, in this registered report we used Tricomi et al.'s free-operant task along with multi-modal MRI methods in a well-powered sample (n=123). In this task participants' sensitivity to outcome devaluation (an index of goal-directed/habitual action control) is tested following either short or extensive training. In contrast to our hypothesis, we were not able to demonstrate habit formation as a function of training duration nor were we able to relate any functional or microstructural plasticity in the putamen with individual habit expression. We found that a pattern of increased activations in the left head of caudate that re-occurred across each day's training is associated with goal directed behavior and that increased processing of devalued cues in low-level visual regions was indicative of goal-directed behavior (and vice versa). In a follow-up exploratory analysis comparing habitual and goal-directed subgroups within each experimental group, we found that elevated activations in frontoparietal regions during early stages of training, as well as increased reactivity towards still-valued cues in somatosensory and superior parietal regions were found in individuals that were more inclined to perform goal-directed behavior (compared with more habitual individuals). Taken together, regions commonly implicated in goal-directed behavior were most predictive of individual habit expression. Finally, we also found that differential patterns of training-related microstructural plasticity, as measured with diffusion MRI, in midbrain dopaminergic regions were associated with habit expression. This work provides new insights into the neural dynamics involved in individual habit formation/expression and encourages the development and testing of new, more sensitive, procedures for experimental habit induction in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A universal workflow for creation, validation and generalization of detailed neuronal models</a></h4>

              
                Detailed single neuron modeling is widely used to study neuronal functions. While cellular and functional diversity across the mammalian cortex is vast, most of the available computational tools are dedicated to the reproduction of a small set of specific features characteristic of a single neuron. Here, we present a generalized automated workflow for the creation of robust electrical models and illustrate its performance by building cell models for the rat somatosensory cortex (SSCx). Each model is based on a 3D morphological reconstruction and a set of ionic mechanisms specific to the cell type. We use an evolutionary algorithm to optimize passive and active ionic parameters to match the electrophysiological features extracted from whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. To shed light on which parameters are constrained by experimental data and which could be degenerate, we perform a parameter sensitivity analysis. We also validate the optimized models against additional experimental stimuli and assess their generalizability on a population of morphologies with the same morphological type. With this workflow, we generate SSCx neuronal models producing the variability of neuronal responses. Due to its versatility, our workflow can be used to build robust biophysical models of any neuronal type.

                The effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on cognitive function are not always predictable based on the direction of the current and therefore remain widely debated. Contrary to the optimism of studies using transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) over the motor cortex, cognitive domain research demonstrates great ambiguity and diversity of stimulation-related effects. Here, we investigated such a controversial impact of tDCS over the posterior medial prefrontal cortex in a monetary incentive delay (MID) task with which one can study reward-based learning or reward processing a. We found that in tMID) task where subject anticipated small or big losses in different monetary contexts, cathodal stimulation suppressed plastic changes in sensory auditory P2 event-related potential and increased feedback-related negativity (FRN) implicated in reward-prediction error processing thus revealing multidirectional effect of tDCS in the same subject group performing the same experimental task. Our finding of multidirectionality of tDCS compromise the use of tES as a ready-to-use method to test brain causality in the neurocognitive events of high complexity such as decision-making.

                Mutations within various N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits are tightly associated with severe pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders and encephalopathies (here denoted GRINopathies), for which there are no treatments. NMDARs are tetrameric receptors and can be found at the membrane of neurons in various compositions, namely in di- or tri-heteromeric forms. The GluN2B subunit appears very early in development and, therefore, prenatally this subunit is predominantly found within di-heteromeric receptors, exclusively composed of the GluN1 and GluN2B subunits. Postnatally, however, the GluN2A subunit undergoes rapid increase in expression, giving rise to the appearance of tri-heteromers containing the GluN1, GluN2A and GluN2B-subunits. The latter are emerging as the principal receptor-type postnatally. Despite more than a decade of research of numerous GRINopathies, not much is known regarding the effect of GRIN variants when these are assembled within tri-heteromers. Here, we have systematically examined how two de novo GRIN2B variants (G689C and G689S) affect the function of di- and tri-heteromers. We show that whereas a single mutated subunit readily instigates a dominant negative effect over glutamate affinity of tri-heteromers, it does not dominate other features of the receptor, notably potentiation by pregnanolone-sulfate (PS). This led us to explore PS as a potential treatment for these two severe loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in cultured neurons, in which case we indeed find that the neurosteroid rescues current amplitudes. Together, we present the first report to examine LoF GRIN2B mutations in the context of di- and tri-heteromeric receptors. We also provide the first demonstration of the positive outcome of the use of a GRIN2B-relevant potentiator in the context of tri-heteromers. Our results highlight the importance of examining how different mutations affect features in various receptor subtypes, as these could not have been deduced from observations performed on purely di-heteromers. Together, our study contributes to the ongoing efforts invested towards understanding the pathophysiology of GRINopathies as well as provides insights towards a potential treatment.

                Perceptual biases are widely regarded as a window into the computational principles underlying human perception. To understand these biases, previous work has proposed a number of conceptually different and even seemingly contradicting ingredients, including attraction to a Bayesian prior, repulsion from the prior due to efficient coding, and central tendency effects on a bounded range. We present a unifying Bayesian theory of biases in perceptual estimation. We theoretically demonstrate an additive decomposition of perceptual biases into attraction to a prior, repulsion away from regions with high encoding precision, and regression away from the boundary. The results reveal a simple and universal rule for predicting the direction of perceptual biases. Our theory accounts for, and leads to new understanding of biases in the perception of a variety of stimulus attributes, including orientation, color, and magnitude.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Internal limiting membrane disruption facilitates engraftment of transplanted human stem cell derived retinal ganglion cells</a></h4>

              
                Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death causes irreversible vision loss in patients with glaucoma and other forms of optic neuropathy because the mammalian retina and optic nerve lack endogenous regenerative capacity. RGC transplantation and optic nerve regeneration represent a potential translational approach to vision restoration in glaucoma secondary to RGC loss. Functional RGC replacement requires that 1) donor RGCs integrate into the recipient retina and receive synaptic input from afferent bipolar and amacrine cells and that 2) donor RGCs extend their axons and establish synaptic connections to appropriate neurons in the brain. Here, in an effort to address retinal integration, we demonstrate that the internal limiting membrane (ILM) acts as a physical barrier to the integration of transplanted human stem cell-derived RGCs (hRGCs) into the recipient retina following intravitreal transplantation in vivo. To circumvent the ILM barrier, we intravitreally injected the nonspecific protease pronase-E in immunosuppressed adult C57BL/6J mice prior to transplantation of hRGCs. Separately, we also transplanted hRGCs into adult Lama1nmf223 mice, which harbor a point mutation in their Lama-1 gene that causes developmental ILM dysgenesis. We assessed donor hRGC survival and engraftment using 3D reconstructions of confocal z-stacks in retinal flatmounts. Migration of surviving donor RGC somas into the recipient RGC layer significantly increased after proteolytic or developmental ILM disruption. Moreover, lamination of dendritic arbors into the recipient inner plexiform layer was observed exclusively following ILM disruption. To assess the clinical translatability of this finding, we transplanted hRGCs onto postmortem organotypic human retinal explant cultures and observed significantly increased engraftment following proteolytic ILM digestion. These findings enhance our understanding of the barriers faced by transplanted hRGCs in the adult murine and human retina and provide an avenue for clinically translatable regenerative medicine approaches to vision restoration in optic neuropathy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Speaker-induced suppression in EEG during a naturalistic reading and listening task</a></h4>

              
                Speaking elicits a suppressed neural response when compared to listening to others' speech, a phenomenon known as speaker-induced suppression (SIS). Previous research has focused on investigating SIS at constrained levels of linguistic representation, such as the individual phoneme and word level. Here we present scalp EEG data from a dual speech perception and production task where participants read sentences aloud then listened to playback of themselves reading those sentences. Playback was separated into predictable repetition of the previous trial and unpredictable, randomized repetition of a former trial to investigate the role predictive processing plays in SIS. Concurrent EMG was recorded to control for movement artifact during speech production. In line with previous research, event-related potential analyses at the sentence level demonstrated suppression of early auditory components of the EEG for production compared to perception. To evaluate whether specific neural representations contribute to SIS (in contrast with a global gain change), we fit linear encoding models that predicted scalp EEG based on phonological features, EMG activity, and task condition. We found that phonological features were encoded similarly between production and perception. However, this similarity was only observed when controlling for movement by using the EMG response as an additional regressor. Our results suggest SIS is at the representational level a global gain change between perception and production, not the suppression of specific characteristics of the neural response. We also detail some important considerations when analyzing EEG during continuous speech production.

                Background: Current clinical assessments of Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) rely solely on subjective symptoms and experiences reported by the patient, rather than objective biomarkers of the illness. Recent advances in data-driven computational approaches have been helpful in devising tools to objectively diagnose psychiatric disorders. Here we aimed to classify individuals with PTSD versus controls using heterogeneous brain datasets from the ENIGMA-PGC PTSD Working group. Methods: We analyzed brain MRI data from 3,527 structural-MRI; 2,502 resting state-fMRI; and 1,953 diffusion-MRI. First, we identified the brain features that best distinguish individuals with PTSD from controls (TEHC and HC) using traditional machine learning methods. Second, we assessed the utility of the denoising variational autoencoder (DVAE) and evaluated its classification performance. Third, we assessed the generalizability and reproducibility of both models using leave-one-site-out cross-validation procedure for each modality. Results: We found lower performance in classifying PTSD vs. controls with data from over 20 sites (60% test AUC for s-MRI, 59% for rs-fMRI and 56% for d-MRI), as compared to other studies run on single-site data. The performance increased when classifying PTSD from HC without trauma history across all three modalities (75% AUC). The classification performance remained intact when applying the DVAE framework, which reduced the number of features. Finally, we found that the DVAE framework achieved better generalization to unseen datasets compared with the traditional machine learning frameworks, albeit performance was slightly above chance. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the promise offered by machine learning methods for the diagnosis of patients with PTSD. The utility of brain biomarkers across three MRI modalities and the contribution of DVAE models for improving generalizability offers new insights into neural mechanisms involved in PTSD.

                Mutations in TDP-43 are known to cause Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). TDP-43 binds to and regulates splicing of several RNA including Zmynd11. Zmynd11 is a transcriptional repressor and a potential E3 ubiquitin ligase family member, known for its role in neuron and muscle differentiation. Mutations in Zmynd11 have been associated with autism with significant developmental motor delays, intellectual disability, and ataxia. Here, we show that Zmynd11 is aberrantly spliced in the brain and spinal cord of transgenic mice overexpressing a mutant human TDP-43 (A315T), and that these changes occur before the onset of motor symptoms.

                We aimed to identify neural computations underlying the loss of face identification ability by modelling the brain activity of brain-lesioned patient PS, a well-documented case of acquired pure prosopagnosia. We collected a large dataset of high-density electrophysiological (EEG) recordings from PS and neurotypicals while they completed a one-back task on a stream of face, object, animal and scene images. We found reduced neural decoding of face identity around the N170 window in PS, and conjointly revealed normal non-face identification in this patient. We used Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to correlate human EEG representations with those of deep neural network (DNN) models of vision and caption-level semantics, offering a window into the neural computations at play in patient PS's deficits. Brain representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) were computed for each participant at 4 ms steps using cross-validated classifiers. PS's brain RDMs showed significant reliability across sessions, indicating meaningful measurements of brain representations with RSA even in the presence of significant lesions. Crucially, computational analyses were able to reveal PS's representational deficits in high-level visual and semantic brain computations. Such multi-modal data-driven characterisations of prosopagnosia highlight the complex nature of processes contributing to face recognition in the human brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Computational mechanisms underlying thalamic regulation of prefrontal signal-to-noise ratio in decision making</a></h4>

              
                The mediodorsal (MD) thalamus is a critical partner for the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in cognitive flexibility. Animal experiments have shown that the MD enhances prefrontal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in decision making under uncertainty. However, the computational mechanisms of this cognitive process remain unclear. Here we use performance-optimized computational models to dissect these mechanisms. We find that the inclusion of an MD-like feedforward module increases robustness to sensory noise and enhances working memory maintenance in the recurrent PFC network performing a context-dependent decision-making task. Incorporating genetically identified thalamocortical pathways that regulate signal amplification and noise reduction further improves performance and replicates key neurophysiological findings of neuronal tuning. Our model reveals a key computational mechanism of context-invariant, cell-type specific regulation of sensory uncertainty in a task-phase specific manner. Additionally, it makes experimentally testable predictions that connect disrupted thalamocortical connectivity with classical theories of prefrontal excitation-inhibition (E/I) imbalance and dysfunctional inhibitory cell types.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Awake Hippocampal-Cortical Co-reactivation Is Associated with Forgetting</a></h4>

              
                Systems consolidation theories posit that consolidation occurs primarily through a coordinated communication between hippocampus and neocortex (McClelland and O'Reilly 1995; Kumaran et al., 2016; Moscovitch and Gilboa, 2022). Recent sleep studies in rodents have shown that hippocampus and visual cortex replay the same information at temporal proximity ("co-replay") (Ji & Wilson, 2007; Lansink et al., 2009; Wierzynski et al., 2009; Peyrache et al., 2009). We developed a novel TR-based co-reactivation (TRCR) analysis method to study hippocampal-cortical co-replays in humans using functional MRI. Thirty-six young adults completed an image (face or scene)-location paired associate encoding task in the scanner, which were preceded and followed by resting state scans. We identified post-encoding rest TRs (+/- 1) that showed neural reactivation of each image-location trials in both hippocampus (HPC) and category-selective cortex (fusiform face area, FFA). This allowed us to characterize temporally proximal coordinated reactivations ("co-reactivations") between HPC and FFA. Moreover, we found that increased HPC-FFA co-reactivations were associated with incorrectly recognized trials after a 1-week delay (p = 0.004). Finally, we found that these HPC-FFA co-reactivations were also associated with trials that were initially correctly recognized immediately after encoding but were later forgotten in 1-day (p = 0.043) and 1-week delay period (p = 0.031). We discuss these results from a trace transformation perspective (Winocur and Moscovitch, 2011; Sekeres et al., 2018) and speculate that HPC-FFA co-reactivations may be integrating related events, at the expense of disrupting event-specific details, hence leading to forgetting.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel histological staging of hippocampal sclerosis that is evident in grey matter loss in vivo.</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS) is defined by end-stage histological findings, strongly associated with limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). We aimed to characterize features of early HS to refine the understanding of its role within combined pathology. METHODS: We studied 159 brain donations from the multimodal Vallecas Alzheimers Center Study. A staging system (0 to IV) was developed to account for HS progression and analyzed in relation to pre-mortem cognitive and MRI data. RESULTS: Our HS staging system displayed a significant correlation with disease duration, cognitive performance and combined neuropathologies, especially with LATE. Two-level assessment along the hippocampal longitudinal axis revealed an anterior-posterior gradient of HS severity. In vivo MRI showed focally reduced hippocampal grey matter density as a function of HS staging. DISCUSSION: The association of this staging system with clinical progression and structural differences supports its utility in the characterization and potential in vivo monitoring of HS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Alpha-band lateralization and microsaccades elicited by exogenous cues do not track attentional orienting</a></h4>

              
                We explore the world by constantly shifting our focus of attention towards salient stimuli, and then disengaging from them in search of new ones. The alpha rhythm (8-13 Hz) has been suggested as a pivotal neural substrate of these attentional shifts, due to its local synchronization and desynchronization that suppresses irrelevant cortical areas and facilitates relevant areas, a phenomenon called alpha lateralization. Whether alpha lateralization tracks the focus of attention from orienting toward a salient stimulus to disengaging from it is still an open question. In this study, we addressed this question by leveraging the well-established phenomenon of Inhibition of Return (IOR), consisting of an initial facilitation in response times (RTs) for target stimuli appearing at an exogenously cued location, followed by a suppression of that location. Our behavioral data showed a typical IOR effect with both early facilitation and subsequent inhibition. By contrast, alpha was lateralized only in the cued direction, but never re-lateralized in a manner compatible with the behavioral inhibition effect. Importantly, also the initial lateralization towards the cue ocurred too late to account for the behavioral facilitation effect. Furthermore, we analyzed the interaction between alpha lateralization and microsaccades: at the same time when alpha was lateralized towards the cued location, microsaccades were mostly oriented away from the cued location. Crucially, the two phenomena showed a significant positive correlation. These results indicate that alpha lateralization reflects primarily the processing of salient stimuli, challenging the view that alpha lateralization is directly involved in exogenous attentional orienting per se. We discuss the relevance of the present findings for an oculomotor account of alpha lateralization as a modulator of cortical excitability in preparation of a saccade.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EEG Changes during Odor Perception and Discrimination</a></h4>

              
                Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are devices designed for communication between the central nervous system and a computer. The communication can occur through different sensory modalities, and most commonly visual and auditory systems are used. We suggest that BCIs can be expanded by the incorporation of olfactory modality. To probe the modulation of EEG activity by odorants, we implemented two olfactory tasks: one that required attention to perception of odors, and the second one where participants discriminated consecutively presented odors. EEG recordings were conducted in 13 healthy participants while they performed the tasks following computer-generated verbal instructions. Respiratory activity was recorded to relate EEG modulations to the breath cycle. Theta activity responses were observed over the frontal EEG leads approximately 2 s after the inhalation. This theta activity was different depending on whether or not the inhaled air contained an odorant, and cognitive load also had an effect. We conclude that the frontal theta rhythm is reflective of the neural processing of odors. As such, it could be incorporated in the olfactory-based BCIs which take odors either as inputs or outputs. These BCIs could improve olfactory training needed for conditions like anosmia and hyposmia, and mild cognitive impairment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Apolipoprotein E intersects with amyloid-β within neurons</a></h4>

              
                Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) is the most important genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among the earliest changes in AD is endosomal enlargement in neurons, which was reported as enhanced in ApoE4 carriers. ApoE is thought to be internalized into endosomes of neurons, while {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) accumulates within neuronal endosomes early in AD. However, it remains unknown whether ApoE and A{beta} intersect intracellularly. We show that internalized astrocytic ApoE localizes mostly to lysosomes in neuroblastoma cells and astrocytes, while in neurons it preferentially localizes to endosomes-autophagosomes of neurites. In AD transgenic neurons, astrocyte-derived ApoE intersects intracellularly with amyloid precursor protein (APP)/A{beta}. Moreover, ApoE4 increases the levels of endogenous and internalized A{beta}42 in neurons. Taken together, we demonstrate differential localization of ApoE in neurons, astrocytes and neuron-like cells, and show that internalized ApoE intersects with APP/A{beta} in neurons, which may be of considerable relevance to AD.

	<p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown elevations in the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal associated with, but insensitive for, seizure. Rather than evaluating absolute BOLD signal elevations, assessing rhythmic oscillations in the BOLD signal with fMRI may improve the accuracy of seizure mapping. We report a case of a patient with non-convulsive, right hemispheric seizures who underwent fMRI. Unbiased processing methods revealed a map of rhythmically oscillating BOLD signal over the cortical region affected by seizure, and synchronous BOLD signal in the contralateral cerebellum. High-resolution fMRI may help identify the spatial topography of seizure and provide insights into seizure physiology.</p>

                Background: Arising at distinct positions in the head, the cranial ganglia are crucial for integrating various sensory inputs. The largest of these ganglia is the trigeminal ganglion, which relays pain, touch and temperature information through its three primary nerve branches to the central nervous system. The trigeminal ganglion and its nerves are composed of derivatives of two critical embryonic cell types, neural crest cells and placode cells, that migrate from different anatomical locations, coalesce together, and differentiate to form trigeminal sensory neurons and supporting glia. While the dual cellular origin of the trigeminal ganglion has been known for over 60 years, molecules expressed by neural crest cells and placode cells that regulate initial ganglion assembly remain obscure. Prior studies revealed the importance of cell surface cadherin proteins during early trigeminal gangliogenesis, with Cadherin-7 and neural cadherin (N-cadherin) expressed in neural crest cells and placode cells, respectively. Although cadherins typically interact in a homophilic (i.e., like) fashion, the presence of different cadherins expressed in neural crest cells and placode cells raises the question as to whether heterophilic cadherin interactions may also be occurring. Given this, the aim of the study was to understand whether Cadherin-7 and N-cadherin were interacting during initial trigeminal ganglion formation. Methods: To assess potential interactions between Cadherin-7 and N-cadherin, we used biochemistry and innovative imaging assays conducted in vitro and in vivo, including in the forming chick trigeminal ganglion. Results: Our data revealed a physical interaction between Cadherin-7 and N-cadherin. Conclusions: These studies identify a new molecular basis by which neural crest cells and placode cells can aggregate in vivo to build the trigeminal ganglion during embryogenesis.

                Background: Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common type of cancer in children. General anaesthetics are often used on patients undergoing painful procedures during ALL treatments but their effects on ALL malignancy remain unknown. Herein, we aim to study the effect of two commonly used general anaesthetics, intravenous propofol and inhalational sevoflurane, on the migration and homing of ALL cells in vitro and in vivo. Methods: NALM-6 cells were treated with propofol (5 and 10 μg/ml) or sevoflurane (3.6%) in vitro for six hours. Then, cells were harvested for flow cytometry analysis. For in vitro migration experiments, NALM-6 cells were pre-treated with propofol and sevoflurane for six hours before being loaded onto the upper chamber of a migration chamber and cells were collected in the lower chamber after six hours of migration. For in vivo adhesion assays, NALM-6 cells were pre-treated with propofol and sevoflurane before an adhesion assay was carried out. In in vitro experiments, GFP-NALM-6 cells were pre-treated with propofol (10 μg/ml) or sevoflurane (3.6%) for six hours. Then, cells were injected intravenously to C57BL/6 female mice followed by intravital microscopy. Results: Both anaesthetics reduced in vitro migration, in vivo migration and in vivo homing as exemplified by 1) the reduction in the number of cells entering the bone marrow and 2) the disturbance in homing location in relation to the nearest endosteal surface. Our results indicated that general anaesthetics reduced the surface CXCR4 expression. In addition, the adhesion of leukaemia cells to thrombin cleaved osteopontin (OPN) was reduced by general anaesthetics. Those changes might result in the alterations in migration and homing. Conclusion: Together, our data suggest that both propofol and sevoflurane could reduce ALL migration and homing in vivo and in vitro via CXCR4 and OPN mediated mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluating the effect of digital technology on the learning of orthodontic cephalometric measurement [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of applying digital technology in cephalometric measurement teaching and students’ acceptance towards it. Methods: In total, 94 undergraduates of stomatology were recruited and randomly allocated to two groups. According to the cross-over design, both groups completed cephalometric measurements through the traditional hand-drawn method and digital technology (the Dolphin software) in different orders. By traditional hand-drawn method, students need to depict the outlines of the craniofacial anatomical structures on the sulfuric transfer paper first, then marked the measurement points and completed the measurement of line spacings and angles. By digital technology, they should mark the points in the software and adjust the automatically generated outlines of the structures and obtained the results. Besides, an online questionnaire was designed to investigate students' attitudes toward the digital technology. Two professional orthodontists were invited as instructors. They measured a lateral cranial radiograph by two methods with one week’s interval, and their intra- and inter-class correlation coefficient were measured. The means of their measurements were set as standards. Results: The inter- and intra-ICC of two instructors surpassed 90%, and there were no significant differences between their measurements, and the measurements by two methods. There were significant differences of students’ measurements (P1-SNA<0.01, P1-SNB=0.01 and P1-L1-NB (mm)<0.01; SNA: sella-nasion-subspinale angle, SNB: sella-nasion-supramental angle, L1-NB (mm): the distance from the lower central incisor tip to the nasion-supramental plane) between the traditional method and digital technology. Besides, the most results of digital technology were closer to the standards than those of traditional method, including five items with statistical significance (P2-SNB<0.05, P2-L1-NB (mm)<0.01, P2-FMA<0.05, P2-FMIA<0.05, P2-IMPA<0.01), while three items were the opposite (P2-SNA<0.05, P2-ANB (mm)<0.01, P2-NA-PA<0.01). The questionnaire showed more students preferred digital technology (33%) compared with traditional method (2%) and 72% of participants mastered 50-80% of cephalometric knowledge after the course.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Sense of personal agency towards mitigating the threat of antibiotic resistance: a focus group study with parents of children under 5 years old, conducted mid-pandemic [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Most antibiotic prescribing occurs in primary care, largely in children under 5 years old, and often inappropriately. This study investigated knowledge, attitudes and behaviours (KABs) towards common childhood infections, antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance (AMR), among parents of children under 5 years old. The concept of individual sacrifice (forgoing antibiotics—a selective pressure for AMR) to mitigate future societal risk of AMR and how the COVID-19 pandemic shaped views were explored. Methods: This qualitative study included three, one-hour, virtual focus groups with mothers from parenting networks across inner-city London and semi-rural England, held mid-pandemic (2020). All had ≥1 child <5 years old. The Framework Method of analysis was used. Parents' KABs towards antibiotic use/AMR formed the primary outcome, with emphases on their sense of personal agency towards mitigating the threat of AMR for society, plus how the pandemic influenced views on infection prevention and care. Results: Fourteen mothers (groups of six, four, four) participated, with mixed ethnicities, education and employment status. Parent perceptions of their individual child's immediate need for antibiotics outweighed concerns for any possible future threat of AMR to society. Four key themes were identified: uncertainty around symptoms; impact of socio-cultural background on KAB; poor understanding of how antibiotics/AMR work; and opportunities within the doctor–patient dialogue to shape mindset around AMR. The pandemic influenced views across themes. Conclusion: Parents prioritising their child's perceived, immediate, individual 'need' for antibiotics over any future impact of AMR on society highlights a continuing need to engage parents in how to mitigate AMR through appropriate antibiotic use, reducing threat to both their child and others. Framing point-of-care dialogue around antibiotic use/AMR in the present (versus future), drawing on pandemic insights and tailoring according to nuanced socio-cultural influences, may encourage a greater sense of personal agency towards taking action to mitigate antibiotic resistance.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Circadian stabilization loop: the regulatory hub and therapeutic target promoting circadian resilience and physiological health [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                The circadian clock is a fundamental biological mechanism that orchestrates essential cellular and physiological processes to optimize fitness and health. The basic functional unit is the cell-autonomous oscillator, consisting of intersecting negative feedback loops. Whereas the core loop is primarily responsible for rhythm generation, auxiliary loops, most notably the secondary or stabilization loop, play pivotal roles to confer temporal precision and molecular robustness. The stabilization loop contains opposing nuclear receptor subfamilies REV-ERBs and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors (RORs), competing to modulate rhythmic expression of the basic helix-loop-helix ARNT like 1 (Bmal1) genes in the core loop as well as other clock-controlled genes. Therefore, REV-ERBs and RORs are strategically located to interface the oscillator and the global transcriptomic network, promoting cellular homeostasis and physiological fitness throughout lifespan. Disruption of REV-ERB and ROR functions has been linked with diseases and aging, and pharmacological manipulation of these factors has shown promise in various mouse disease models. Nobiletin is a natural compound that directly binds to and activates RORα/γ, modulating circadian rhythms, and shows robust in vivo efficacies to combat clock-associated pathophysiologies and age-related decline. Results from several studies demonstrate an inverse relation between nobiletin efficacy and clock functional state, where nobiletin elicits little effect in young and healthy mice with growing efficacy as the clock is perturbed by environmental and genetic challenges. This mode of action is consistent with the function of the stabilization loop to promote circadian and physiological resilience. Future studies should further investigate the function and mechanism of REV-ERBs and RORs, and test strategies targeting these factors against disease and aging.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The conditional effect of family resilience on family quality of life during the Covid-19 pandemic [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: The Covid-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges, both economically and psychologically, to most families across the world. Yet, little study has been done on this topic in Indonesia, even after the second year of the pandemic. This study examines how the Covid-19 economic impact and parental stress are related to the family quality of life (FQOL) and how the relation is moderated by family resilience. Methods: To this end, we employed previously tested measures to assess the level of parental stress, family resilience and FQOL. Especially for the latter, we modified the measure, developed by Beach Center on Disability, by including only four domains (i.e., family interaction, parenting, emotional well-being, and material well-being) to adjust to our research context. Results: Based on 169 participants, our CFA displays that all employed measures in the study are valid and reliable. Our regression analysis shows that there are significant direct relations of parental stress & family resilience with family quality of life. However, we find that family resilience only positively moderates the relation between the Covid-19 economic impact and family quality of life. Discussion: This study presents a view on how the Covid-19 pandemic affects the way families live and hence, their quality of life. In addition, the findings suggest the importance of family relationship and support in times of crisis, not limited to the Covid-19 pandemic.

                Background: It is important and challenging to distinguish between acute myocardial infarction and Wellens syndrome due to its time to intervention. Difficulties in differentiating between subtypes could mean the patients are overtreated or receive undertreatment. Case report: A 57-year-old man was referred to our emergency ward with acute onset of chest pain. Electrocardiographic (ECG) changes were suggestive of Wellens syndrome type A. Nitroglycerin was administrated, the patient's chest pain disappeared, and we planned an early invasive strategy. He had a previous documented ECG before he went for catheterization and based on the second ECG changes were suggestive of an ST elevation. As the result of the invasive strategy, it was found that there was single-vessel disease, near total occlusion in the middle of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) with collateral from the right coronary artery. After two days of observation in the Intensive Cardiovascular Care Unit (ICCU), the patient improved and was transferred to the Low Care Unit. Conclusions: The case highlights Wellens syndrome in acute total occlusion with collateral artery.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Importance of social support for Indonesian stroke patients with depression [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Approximately one-third of stroke survivors experience depression at some point, which is linked to poor functional results and high mortality rate. Social support from family, friends, and the community is an intervening variable in stroke outcomes aside from the rehabilitation treatments that patients receive. This study assessed the importance of social support for stroke patients with depression and its relationship with patient rehabilitation. Methods: This quantitative study used a cross-sectional approach on stroke patients and their families based on data from the Social Security Administrator for Health (BPJS Kesehatan). One hundred and four participants were recruited using purposive sampling by including stroke patients who have used National Health Insurance (JKN) for stroke medications. Results: We found that instrumental, emotional, interactive, and information support contribute to lowering depressive symptoms. Instrumental support in the form of food availability, money, goods, and services had the highest coefficient value for reducing depression. Emotional support in the form of care and compassion had the second highest value in reducing depression. Further, interaction and informational support remain critical components of social support in reducing depression.   Conclusion: The support system plays a key role in decreasing the depression level in stroke survivors. The family and neighborhood have a significant impact on accelerating the rehabilitation process of stroke patients by providing support.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders among dental healthcare providers: A systematic review and meta-analysis [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) are common in dentistry due to the prolonged static work involved during patient care, making dental health care personnel vulnerable to musculoskeletal complaints. We aimed to pool the prevalence estimates of MSD among various dental healthcare providers, including dentists, dental students, dental hygienists, and auxiliaries. Methods: A systematic search of five databases was performed (Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, Dentistry & Oral Sciences Source). The studies that reported the prevalence of MSD among dental healthcare workers and those written in English were selected. Screening and data extraction were performed by two review authors independently. Discrepencies were resolved by another review author. Risk of bias assessment was done using a nine-item questionnaire developed by Hoy et al. Pooled estimates were calculated using meta-analysis of proportions (random effects model). Results: Among the 3090 publications screened, 234 publications were included for full-text screening. Meta-analysis was performed for 89 estimates from 88 publications. Females showed significantly higher prevalence [OR = 1.42 (95% CI = 1.09–1.84); I2 = 66.02; N = 32]. The analysis yielded a pooled estimate of 78.4% (95% CI = 74.8–82). The meta-regression showed similar prevalence over the years (Coefficient: 0.001; P-value: 0.762). Conclusions: A high prevalence of MSD was noted among dental healthcare providers, with about seven out of ten having experienced MSD in the past. This emphasizes the need for awareness and adoption of appropriate ergonomic postures by dental healthcare providers from early in their careers to minimize work-related MSD.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparison of gender, age, and body mass index for spatiotemporal parameters of bilateral gait pattern [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Studies on the gaits parameters have been identified on the patient population. Most researchers confirm that the patients walk differently than normal people and they may have a greater risk of falls. Consistent finding and description of gender, age, and body mass index differences in gait studies is rare in healthy subjects.  This research was performed to compare spatiotemporal parameters of gait between gender, as per their age and body mass index level.   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with forty-five young adults (F=20, M=25). Stadiometer and Physilog 4 inertial sensors were used for data collection. A gait analyzer 5.2 software (GaitUp, S.A. Lausanne, Switzerland) was used to determine spatiotemporal parameters.   Results:  Females were found with higher mean score of total double support and cadence than males. Cadence also increases with age. Obese people showed lower gait speed, cadence, and total double support. No statistically significant differences were found in any bilateral foot gait parameters with respect to gender, age, and body mass index. Conclusion: The findings of the study may be beneficial to those who have abnormal gait pattern due to age, body mass index differences, decreased muscle strength, spasticity, and joint mobility. This important information should be considered to rehabilitate patients with abnormal gait patterns to controlling dynamic balance and risk of falling.

                Background: Considering protein mutations in their biological context is essential for understanding their functional impact, interpretation of high-dimensional datasets and development of effective targeted therapies in personalized medicine. Methods: We combined the curated knowledge of biochemical reactions from Reactome with the analysis of interaction-mediating 3D interfaces from Mechismo. In addition, we provided a software tool for users to explore and browse the analysis results in a multi-scale perspective starting from pathways and reactions to protein-protein interactions and protein 3D structures. Results: We analyzed somatic mutations from TCGA, revealing several significantly impacted reactions and pathways in specific cancer types. We found examples of genes not yet listed as oncodrivers, whose rare mutations were predicted to affect cancer processes similarly to known oncodrivers. Some identified processes lack any known oncodrivers, which suggests potentially new cancer-related processes (e.g. complement cascade reactions). Furthermore, we found that mutations perturbing certain processes are significantly associated with distinct phenotypes (i.e. survival time) in specific cancer types (e.g. PIK3CA centered pathways in LGG and UCEC cancer types), suggesting the translational potential of our approach for patient stratification. Our analysis also uncovered several druggable processes (e.g. GPCR signalling pathways) containing enriched reactions, providing support for new off-label therapeutic options. Conclusions: In summary, we have established a multi-scale approach to study genetic variants based on protein-protein interaction 3D structures. Our approach is different from previously published studies in its focus on biochemical reactions and can be applied to other data types (e.g. post-translational modifications) collected for many types of disease.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Close-kin mark-recapture methods to estimate demographic parameters of mosquitoes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yogita Sharma, Jared B. Bennett, Gordana Rašić, John M. Marshall</p>

Close-kin mark-recapture (CKMR) methods have recently been used to infer demographic parameters such as census population size and survival for fish of interest to fisheries and conservation. These methods have advantages over traditional mark-recapture methods as the mark is genetic, removing the need for physical marking and recapturing that may interfere with parameter estimation. For mosquitoes, the spatial distribution of close-kin pairs has been used to estimate mean dispersal distance, of relevance to vector-borne disease transmission and novel biocontrol strategies. Here, we extend CKMR methods to the life history of mosquitoes and comparable insects. We derive kinship probabilities for mother-offspring, father-offspring, full-sibling and half-sibling pairs, where an individual in each pair may be a larva, pupa or adult. A pseudo-likelihood approach is used to combine the marginal probabilities of all kinship pairs. To test the effectiveness of this approach at estimating mosquito demographic parameters, we develop an individual-based model of mosquito life history incorporating egg, larva, pupa and adult life stages. The simulation labels each individual with a unique identification number, enabling close-kin relationships to be inferred for sampled individuals. Using the dengue vector <i>Aedes aegypti</i> as a case study, we find the CKMR approach provides unbiased estimates of adult census population size, adult and larval mortality rates, and larval life stage duration for logistically feasible sampling schemes. Considering a simulated population of 3,000 adult mosquitoes, estimation of adult parameters is accurate when ca. 40 adult females are sampled biweekly over a three month period. Estimation of larval parameters is accurate when adult sampling is supplemented with ca. 120 larvae sampled biweekly over the same period. The methods are also effective at detecting intervention-induced increases in adult mortality and decreases in population size. As the cost of genome sequencing declines, CKMR holds great promise for characterizing the demography of mosquitoes and comparable insects of epidemiological and agricultural significance.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mixed mechanism of conformational selection and induced fit as a molecular recognition process in the calreticulin family of proteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ashalatha Sreshty Mamidi, Avadhesha Surolia</p>

The fundamental question on the mechanism of molecular recognition during ligand binding has attracted a lot of scientific scrutiny. The two competing theories of ligand binding–“induced fit” and “conformational selection” have been proposed to explain biomolecular recognition. Since exploring a family of proteins with similar structural architectures and conserved functional roles can provide valuable insight into the significance of molecular structure and function, we performed molecular dynamics simulations on the calreticulin family of proteins, which specifically recognize monoglucosylated N-glycan during the protein folding process. Atomistic simulations of lectins in free and bound forms demonstrated that they exist in several conformations spanning from favorable to unfavorable for glycan binding. Our analysis was confined to the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of these lectins to demonstrate the degree of conservation in protein sequence and structure and relate them with their function. Furthermore, we computed the lectin-glycan binding affinity using the mmPBSA approach to identify the most favorable lectin conformation for glycan binding and compared the molecular interaction fields in terms of noncovalent bond interactions. We also demonstrated the involvement of Tyr and Trp residues in the CRD with the non-reducing end glucose and central mannose residues, which contribute to some of the specific interactions. Furthermore, we analyzed the conformational changes in the CRD through SASA, RMSFs and protein surface topography mapping of electrostatic and hydrophobic potentials. Our findings demonstrate a hybrid mechanism of molecular recognition, initially driven by conformational selection followed by glycan-induced fluctuations in the key residues to strengthen the glycan binding interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Metabolic reprogramming in Rheumatoid Arthritis Synovial Fibroblasts: A hybrid modeling approach</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sahar Aghakhani, Sylvain Soliman, Anna Niarakis</p>

Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by a highly invasive pannus formation consisting mainly of Synovial Fibroblasts (RASFs). This pannus leads to cartilage, bone, and soft tissue destruction in the affected joint. RASFs’ activation is associated with metabolic alterations resulting from dysregulation of extracellular signals’ transduction and gene regulation. Deciphering the intricate mechanisms at the origin of this metabolic reprogramming may provide sign insight into RASFs’ involvement in RA’s pathogenesis and offer new therapeutic strategies. Qualitative and quantitative dynamic modeling can address some of these features, but hybrid models represent a real asset in their ability to span multiple layers of biological machinery. This work presents the first hybrid RASF model: the combination of a cell-specific qualitative regulatory network with a global metabolic network. The automated framework for hybrid modeling exploits the regulatory network’s trap-spaces as additional constraints on the metabolic network. Subsequent flux balance analysis allows assessment of RASFs’ regulatory outcomes’ impact on their metabolic flux distribution. The hybrid RASF model reproduces the experimentally observed metabolic reprogramming induced by signaling and gene regulation in RASFs. Simulations also enable further hypotheses on the potential reverse Warburg effect in RA. RASFs may undergo metabolic reprogramming to turn into "metabolic factories", producing high levels of energy-rich fuels and nutrients for neighboring demanding cells through the crucial role of HIF1.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to examine the comparative safety of antiseizure medication (ASM) monotherapy in pregnancy with respect to risk of major congenital malformations (MCMs), overall and by MCM subtype.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a population-based cohort study using national health register data from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden (1996–2020). We compared pregnancies with first trimester exposure to lamotrigine monotherapy to ASM-unexposed, carbamazepine, valproate, oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, and topiramate to lamotrigine monotherapy, and stratified monotherapy groups by dose. The outcome was nongenetic MCM and specific subtypes. We estimated adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with log-binomial regression and propensity score weights.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There was a higher crude risk of any MCM in pregnancies exposed to lamotrigine monotherapy (n = 8,339) compared to ASM-unexposed pregnancies (n = 4,866,362), but not after confounder adjustment (aRR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.87–1.08). Compared to lamotrigine, there was an increased risk of malformations associated with valproate (n = 2,031, aRR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.70–2.46) and topiramate (n = 509, aRR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.26–2.60), which increased in a dose-dependent manner. We found no differences in malformation risk for carbamazepine (n = 2,674, aRR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.72–1.15), oxcarbazepine (n = 1,313, aRR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.83–1.44), or levetiracetam (n = 1,040, aRR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.53–1.13). Valproate was associated with several malformation subtypes, including nervous system, cardiac, oral clefts, clubfoot, and hypospadias, whereas lamotrigine and carbamazepine were not.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Topiramate is associated with an increased risk of MCM similar to that associated with valproate, but lower doses may mitigate the risks for both drugs. Conversely, we found no increased risks for lamotrigine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, or levetiracetam, which is reassuring. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Prospective studies of encephalitis are rare in regions where encephalitis is prevalent, such as low middle-income Southeast Asian countries. We compared the diagnostic yield of local and advanced tests in cases of pediatric encephalitis in Myanmar.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Children with suspected subacute or acute encephalitis at Yangon Children's Hospital, Yangon, Myanmar, were prospectively recruited from 2016–2018. Cohort 1 (n = 65) had locally available diagnostic testing, whereas cohort 2 (n = 38) had advanced tests for autoantibodies (ie, cell-based assays, tissue immunostaining, studies with cultured neurons) and infections (ie, BioFire FilmArray multiplex Meningitis/Encephalitis multiplex PCR panel, metagenomic sequencing, and pan-viral serologic testing [VirScan] of cerebrospinal fluid).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 20 cases (13 in cohort 1 and 7 in cohort 2) were found to have illnesses other than encephalitis. Of the 52 remaining cases in cohort 1, 43 (83%) had presumed infectious encephalitis, of which 2 cases (4%) had a confirmed infectious etiology. Nine cases (17%) had presumed autoimmune encephalitis. Of the 31 cases in cohort 2, 23 (74%) had presumed infectious encephalitis, of which one (3%) had confirmed infectious etiology using local tests only, whereas 8 (26%) had presumed autoimmune encephalitis. Advanced tests confirmed an additional 10 (32%) infections, 4 (13%) possible infections, and 5 (16%) cases of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibody encephalitis.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Pediatric encephalitis is prevalent in Myanmar, and advanced technologies increase identification of treatable infectious and autoimmune causes. Developing affordable advanced tests to use globally represents a high clinical and research priority to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of encephalitis. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <p>Sports concussion has recently assumed special importance because of the widely publicized entity of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Identified primarily in former contact sports athletes with repeated mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), CTE is a distinct tauopathy that can only be diagnosed postmortem and for which no specific treatment is available. While the hazards of repeated mTBI are generally acknowledged, a spirited controversy has developed because a firm link between sports concussion and CTE has been questioned. We briefly review the history of CTE, discuss areas of uncertainty, and offer suggestions to assist neurologists confronting these issues and advance understanding of this vexing problem.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Predictive modeling reveals that higher-order cooperativity drives transcriptional repression in a synthetic developmental enhancer</a></h4>

              
                A challenge in quantitative biology is to predict output patterns of gene expression from knowledge of input transcription factor patterns and from the arrangement of binding sites for these transcription factors on regulatory DNA. We tested whether widespread thermodynamic models could be used to infer parameters describing simple regulatory architectures that inform parameter-free predictions of more complex enhancers in the context of transcriptional repression by Runt in the early fruit fly embryo. By modulating the number and placement of Runt binding sites within an enhancer, and quantifying the resulting transcriptional activity using live imaging, we discovered that thermodynamic models call for higher-order cooperativity between multiple molecular players. This higher-order cooperativity capture the combinatorial complexity underlying eukaryotic transcriptional regulation and cannot be determined from simpler regulatory architectures, highlighting the challenges in reaching a predictive understanding of transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes and calling for approaches that quantitatively dissect their molecular nature.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Changes in seam number and location induce holes within microtubules assembled from porcine brain tubulin and in Xenopus egg cytoplasmic extracts</a></h4>

              
                Microtubules are tubes of about 25 nm in diameter that are critically involved in a variety of cellular functions including motility, compartmentalization, and division. They are considered as pseudo-helical polymers whose constituent ab-tubulin heterodimers share lateral homotypic interactions, except at one unique region called the seam. Here, we used a segmented sub-tomogram averaging strategy to reassess this paradigm and analyze the organization of the ab-tubulin heterodimers in microtubules assembled from purified porcine brain tubulin in the presence of GTP and GMPCPP, and in <i>Xenopus</i> egg cytoplasmic extracts. We find that in almost all conditions, microtubules incorporate variable protofilament and/or tubulin subunit helical-start numbers, as well as variable numbers of seams. Strikingly, the seam number and location vary along individual microtubules, generating holes of one to a few subunits in size within their lattices. Together, our results reveal that the formation of mixed and discontinuous microtubule lattices is an intrinsic property of tubulin that requires the formation of unique lateral interactions without longitudinal ones. They further suggest that microtubule assembly is tightly regulated in a cytoplasmic environment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Bidirectional promoter activity from expression cassettes can drive off-target repression of neighboring gene translation</a></h4>

              
                Targeted selection-based-genome-editing approaches in budding yeast have enabled many fundamental discoveries and continue to be used routinely with high precision. We found, however, that replacement of <i>DBP1</i> with a common selection cassette led to reduced expression and function for the adjacent gene, <i>MRP51</i>, despite all <i>MRP51</i> coding and regulatory sequences remaining intact. Cassette-induced repression of <i>MRP51</i> drove all phenotypes we detected in cells deleted for <i>DBP1</i>. This behavior resembled the previously observed 'neighboring gene effect' (NGE), a phenomenon of unknown mechanism whereby cassette insertion at one locus reduces the expression of a neighboring gene. Here, we leveraged strong off-target phenotypes resulting from cassette replacement of <i>DBP1</i> to provide mechanistic insight into the NGE. We found that inherent bidirectionality of promoters, including those in expression cassettes, drives a divergent transcript that represses <i>MRP51</i> through combined transcriptional interference and translational repression mediated by production of a long undecoded transcript isoform (LUTI). We demonstrate that divergent transcript production driving this off-target effect is general to yeast expression cassettes and occurs ubiquitously with insertion. Despite this, off-target effects are often naturally prevented by local sequence features, such as those that terminate divergent transcripts between the site of cassette insertion and the neighboring gene. Thus, cassette induced off-target effects can be eliminated by the insertion of transcription terminator sequences into the cassette, flanking the promoter. Because the driving features of this off-target effect are broadly conserved, our study suggests its consideration in the design and interpretation of experiments using integrated expression cassettes in other eukaryotes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tenotomy-induced muscle atrophy is sex-specific and independent of NFκB</a></h4>

              
                The nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) pathway is a major thoroughfare for skeletal muscle atrophy and is driven by diverse stimuli. Targeted inhibition of NFκB through its canonical mediator IKKβ effectively mitigates loss of muscle mass across many conditions, from denervation to unloading to cancer. In this study, we used gain- and loss-of-function mouse models to examine the role of NFκB in muscle atrophy following rotator cuff tenotomy - a model of chronic rotator cuff tear. IKKβ was knocked down or constitutively activated in muscle-specific inducible transgenic mice to elicit a 2-fold gain or loss of NFκB signaling. Surprisingly, neither knockdown of IKKβ nor overexpression of caIKKβ significantly altered the loss of muscle mass following tenotomy. This finding was consistent across measures of morphological adaptation (fiber cross-sectional area, fiber length, fiber number), tissue pathology (fibrosis and fatty infiltration) and intracellular signaling (ubiquitin-proteasome, autophagy). Intriguingly, late-stage tenotomy-induced atrophy was exacerbated in male mice compared to female mice. This sex specificity was driven by ongoing decreases in fiber cross-sectional area, which paralleled the accumulation of large autophagic vesicles in male, but not female muscle. These findings suggest that tenotomy-induced atrophy is not dependent on NFκB and instead may be regulated by autophagy in a sex-specific manner.

                Metamers, images that are perceived as equal, are a useful tool to study representations of natural images in biological and artificial vision systems. We synthesized metamers for the mouse visual system by inverting a deep encoding model to find an image that matched the observed neural activity to the original presented image. When testing the resulting images in physiological experiments we found that they most closely reproduced the neural activity of the original image when compared to other decoding methods, even when tested in a different animal whose neural activity was not used to produce the metamer. This demonstrates that deep encoding models do capture general characteristic properties of biological visual systems and can be used to define a meaningful perceptual loss for the visual system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electroencephalographic power spectrum and intersubject correlation on acoustic stimulation with modes of Indian music: a randomized controlled trial</a></h4>

              
                Background: Music not just entertains an individual but causes changes in the frequency spectrum of the brain waves and cognition that are recognizable using signals obtained through electroencephalography (EEG). EEG studies on the effect of passive listening to music have predominantly used multi-instrumental western classical music as an acoustic stimulus with very few analyzing solo instrumental Indian music, and thus in the current study Indian modes (Hindustani ragas) were used. The study aimed to investigate overall power spectral changes on EEG and specifically, those changes that show high inter-subject correlation (ISC) on passive listening to three different Indian modes as acoustic intervention, in comparison to control stimuli, heard for 10 minutes. Material & Methods: A randomized control triple-blind trial with 4 groups (three music intervention groups and a control group; n=35 each) was conducted while undergoing EEG recording. The music intervention groups listened to 10-minute audio of one of the three different modes (namely raga Miyan ki Todi, raga Malkauns, and raga Puriya), while the control group received predominant silence with few natural sounds interspersed. EEG data before, during, and after acoustic interventions were first evaluated for electrode-level power changes in standard spectral bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta1, beta2, and gamma). To understand spectral power changes more specific to music listening, a novel component-level analysis was also done, where the raw spectral data were grouped into the three most prominent components (C1, C2 & C3) based on spatiospectral consistency across subjects (correlated component analysis or CorrCA) and their ISC scores were also computed. For statistical analysis, we applied a hierarchical general linear model with cluster statistics to the electrode-level data and robust ANOVA with post hoc tests to the component-level data. Results: In electrode level analysis, the group listening to raga Malkauns showed a significant increase in gamma power in the left frontal regions during the intervention. While the group listening to raga Puriya showed a right frontoparietal decrease in delta power, raga Miyan ki Todi showed a frontal increase in beta1 power after the intervention. In component-level analysis, C1 was globally distributed low-frequency activity, C2 was posteriorly dominant alpha-beta1 activity, and C3 was peripherally dominant broad-band activity, consistent between groups. Besides agreement with electrode-level findings, the most prominent component-level finding was a decrease in C1 power and an increase in C2 power shown by raga Malkauns (strong both during and after intervention) and raga Miyan ki Todi (strong during and weak after intervention), whereas raga Puriya showed only a weak decrease in C1 (after intervention), compared to control group. ISC scores were comparable between groups, except for raga Puriya, which showed a marginal drop for C3 after the intervention. Conclusions: Reduction in globally distributed low-frequency activity and increase in posterior dominant alpha-beta1 activity may be characteristic of passive listening to relaxing Indian modes, which may persist even after the listening period. Among the modes, raga Malkauns showed this effect most prominently, followed by raga Miyan ki Todi and least by raga Puriya. As the increase in posterior alpha and low beta power is associated with default mode network (DMN) activity and a decrease in delta power with positive emotional memory, the spectral pattern we observed may indicate observing positive autobiographical memory while listening to musical scales and thereby contributing to a relaxing experience. Further studies that also include phenomenological reports are highly recommended to be taken up to support these findings, and thus build a scientific foundation for the use of Indian music in medicine.

	<p>Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a chronic neurodevelopmental psychotic disorder. The immune system and neuroinflammation seem to play a central role in the pathophysiology of SCZ. Clozapine is an effective atypical antipsychotic used for treatment-resistant SCZ. Life-threatening side effects, such as myocarditis, limit its use. We investigated the immunomodulatory effects of clozapine in an astroglial model of neuroinflammation. We thus assessed the effect of clozapine on the production of inflammatory mediators in human-derived astroglial (A172) cells, stimulated with a cytokine mix (TNF&amp;amp;alpha;, IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, IFN&amp;amp;gamma;). RT-PCR and ELISA analyses demonstrated that clozapine suppressed gene expression and production of TNF&amp;amp;alpha;, IL-1&amp;amp;beta; and IL-8 and increased COX2 mRNA 24 h after stimulation. Clozapine inhibited Akt phosphorylation induced by the cytokine mix at 10 min and 40 min, as assessed by Western blot analysis with anti-pT308Akt antibody. Pretreatment with the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 increased COX2 gene expression in cytokine-stimulated cells, suggesting that Akt inhibition may be involved in COX2 gene expression upregulation. Clozapine may possess dual beneficial effects: inhibiting astroglial production of proinflammatory cytokines, thus attenuating neuroinflammation, and upregulating COX2 expression that may be relevant to improvement of neural functioning while accounting for some of its detrimental effects. Patients with TRS and neuroinflammatory markers may benefit particularly from clozapine treatment.</p>

	<p>The vast majority of the research on acute post-traumatic incidents in athletes focuses on migraines. Physical exercise might reduce the frequency of migraines as well as trigger a migraine attack. The objectives of the study were to evaluate primary headache prevalence in professional young female soccer players and to assess whether headaches are related to physical performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has considered the relationship between primary headaches and physical performance assessment. The research was conducted in 19 females aged 12&amp;amp;ndash;17 from a professional youth soccer academy. Players completed a questionnaire about health status and then performed laboratory physical tests (e.g., cardiopulmonary tests, countermovement and squat jumps, handgrip, sit-and-reach tests). Subsequently, players were separated into a headache group and a headache-free control group. In the analysed group, eight female players (42%) suffered from primary headaches. Among the performance parameters, a significant result was found in terms of flexibility. Females from the headache group had higher results in the sit-and-reach test than females from the control group (p = 0.029). Flexibility as well as mobility in migraine patients is an area with significant potential for further investigation, as little research has been conducted to date.</p>

	<p>Background: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is a severe neurological event with limited treatment options, and little is known about its pathophysiology. There are few objective tools for predicting outcomes of aSAH patients and further aiding in directing clinical therapeutic programs. This study aimed to determine whether an elevated serum D-dimer/albumin ratio (DAR) reflects disease severity and predicts aSAH outcomes. Methods: We included 178 patients with aSAH. Data included demographics; clinical severity of aSAH (World Federation of Neurological Societies (WFNS) grade and Hunt&amp;amp;ndash;Hess grade); levels of D-dimer, albumin, and c-reactive protein (CRP); leukocyte counts on admission; and three-month outcomes. The outcomes were dichotomized into good and poor. The predictive ability of DAR for outcomes was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: Serum DAR showed a positive correlation with disease severity. Univariate analysis revealed that DAR, WFNS grade, Hunt&amp;amp;ndash;Hess grade, delayed cerebral infarction (DCI), age, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and CRP/albumin ratio (CAR) were associated with unfavorable outcomes. Multivariate regression analysis further revealed that elevated DAR predicted poor outcomes after adjusting for WFNS grade, Hunt&amp;amp;ndash;Hess grade, DCI, age, NLR, and CRP/albumin ratio. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that DAR predicted outcomes at a level comparable with NLR and CAR and had superior predictivity than D-dimer alone. Conclusion: DAR is a promising objective tool for aSAH outcome prediction. A high content DAR was associated with disease severity and unfavorable short-term outcomes.</p>

	<p>Hereditary transthyretin (ATTRv) amyloidosis is a severe, progressive, and heterogeneous multisystemic condition due to mutations in the TTR gene. Although multiple aspects of its molecular pathophysiological mechanisms have been elucidated over the years, it is possible to hypothesize different pathogenetic pathways. Indeed, we extensively investigated the serum levels of several molecules involved in the immune response, in a cohort of ATTRv patients and healthy controls (HCs). Sixteen ATTRv patients and twenty-five HCs were included in the study. IFN-alpha levels were higher in ATTRv patients than in HCs, as well as IFN-gamma levels. By contrast, IL-7 levels were lower in ATTRv patients than in HCs. No significant difference between groups was found regarding IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-33 levels. Correlation analysis did not reveal any significant correlation between IFN-&amp;amp;alpha;, IFN-&amp;amp;gamma;, IL-7, and demographic and clinical data. Larger and longitudinal studies using ultrasensitive methods to perform a full cytokine profiling are needed to better elucidate the role of inflammation in ATTRv pathogenesis and to test the reliability of these molecules as possible biomarkers in monitoring patients&amp;amp;rsquo; progression.</p>

	<p>How language mediates emotional perception and experience is poorly understood. The present event-related potential (ERP) study examined the explicit and implicit processing of emotional speech to differentiate the relative influences of communication channel, emotion category and task type in the prosodic salience effect. Thirty participants (15 women) were presented with spoken words denoting happiness, sadness and neutrality in either the prosodic or semantic channel. They were asked to judge the emotional content (explicit task) and speakers&amp;amp;rsquo; gender (implicit task) of the stimuli. Results indicated that emotional prosody (relative to semantics) triggered larger N100, P200 and N400 amplitudes with greater delta, theta and alpha inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) values in the corresponding early time windows, and continued to produce larger LPC amplitudes and faster responses during late stages of higher-order cognitive processing. The relative salience of prosodic and semantics was modulated by emotion and task, though such modulatory effects varied across different processing stages. The prosodic salience effect was reduced for sadness processing and in the implicit task during early auditory processing and decision-making but reduced for happiness processing in the explicit task during conscious emotion processing. Additionally, across-trial synchronization of delta, theta and alpha bands predicted the ERP components with higher ITPC and ERSP values significantly associated with stronger N100, P200, N400 and LPC enhancement. These findings reveal the neurocognitive dynamics of emotional speech processing with prosodic salience tied to stage-dependent emotion- and task-specific effects, which can reveal insights into understanding language and emotion processing from cross-linguistic/cultural and clinical perspectives.</p>

	<p> As the understanding of the role of palliative care in neurology increases, there is the need to ensure that these developments include not only care at home and in hospitals but also in clinics. There are no reports on palliative care from neurology clinics in Japan, and this paper considers the problems and proposed solutions for improving palliative care provided at neurology clinics in Japan. In Japan, physicians in neurology clinics are extremely busy both during and after office hours with medical treatment and the preparation of various documents and are unable to conduct case conferences. Moreover, the education system for palliative care, especially for lifelong education, is not sufficient, and multidisciplinary cooperation is difficult due to the lack of specialists and their scattered locations. To improve the care provided for patients and their families, general palliative care should be included in the health insurance system with incentives and recognition, and mandatory lifelong education should be established so that all neurologists can provide palliative care. These proposals may be appropriate for other countries as palliative care in neurology is established.</p>

	<p>The aim of this study was to characterize the oral discourse of CBS patients and to verify whether measures obtained during a semi-spontaneous speech production could differentiate CBS patients from controls. A second goal was to compare the performance of patients with CBS probably due to Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (CBS-AD) pathology and CBS not related to AD (CBS-non-AD) in the same measures, based on the brain metabolic status (FDG-PET) and in the presence of amyloid deposition (amyloid-PET). Results showed that CBS patients were significantly different from controls in speech rate, lexical level, informativeness, and syntactic complexity. Discursive measures did not differentiate CBS-AD from CBS-non-AD. However, CBS-AD displayed more lexical-semantic impairments than controls, a profile that is frequently reported in patients with clinical AD and the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA). CBS-non-AD presented mainly with impairments related to motor speech disorders and syntactic complexity, as seen in the non-fluent variant of PPA.</p>

	<p>Background: The relationship between serum uric acid (SUA) level and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) remains controversial. We aimed to investigate the association between SUA level and DPN and evaluate the effects of SUA level on nerve conduction function via electromyography in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), stratified by gender and age. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 647 inpatients with T2DM from the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University between February 2017 and October 2020. The diagnosis of DPN was confirmed according to the Toronto Expert Consensus. Clinical data, SUA level, and nerve conduction parameters were obtained from electronic medical records. Results: A total of 647 patients with T2DM were included, and 471 patients were diagnosed with DPN. The level of SUA was higher in the DPN group than in the Non-DPN group (330.58 &amp;amp;plusmn; 99.67 vs. 309.16 &amp;amp;plusmn; 87.04, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). After adjustment, a higher SUA level was associated with the presence of DPN [odds ratio (OR) 1.003, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.001&amp;amp;ndash;1.005; p = 0.017]. The area under the curve for the prediction of DPN was 0.558 (95% CI, 0.509&amp;amp;ndash;0.608; p = 0.022), and the optimized cut-off of SUA level was 297.5 &amp;amp;micro;mol/L. The SUA &amp;amp;gt; 297.5 &amp;amp;micro;mol/L level was independently associated with DPN in the male subgroup (OR 2.507, 95% CI, 1.405&amp;amp;ndash;4.473; p = 0.002) rather than in the female subgroup. Besides, SUA &amp;amp;gt; 297.5 &amp;amp;micro;mol/L was independently associated with DPN in the younger subgroup (age &amp;amp;lt; 65 years) (OR 2.070, 95% CI, 1.278&amp;amp;ndash;3.352; p = 0.003) rather than in the older subgroup. In multiple linear regression analysis, SUA was significantly correlated with certain nerve conduction study parameters in the all patients group, and was also observed in the male and younger subgroups. Conclusions: Elevated SUA was independently associated with poorer nerve conduction functions, and hyperuricemia was also significantly associated with a higher risk of developing DPN in T2DM patients, especially in male and younger patients.</p>

                Natural killer cells are designed to kill virally infected cells. Lee et al. demonstrate that healthy NK cells are unable to efficiently lyse SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, likely due to their loss of the ligands for the activating receptor NKG2D. These effects are mediated by the viral protein Nsp1.

                The superior colliculus is often studied for its role in visually guided behaviors, but research in non-human animals indicates it is a midbrain hub for processing sensory information from multiple domains, including interoception (which is associated with affect). We used ultra-high field 7-Tesla fMRI to extend this work to humans, modeling superior colliculus BOLD signal intensity during visual or somatosensory stimulation (N = 40 in each sensory modality), both under aversive and neutral affective intensity. As hypothesized, the superior colliculus showed increased BOLD signal intensity in the dorsal and ventral subregions during visual and somatosensory stimulation, respectively. The entire superior colliculus also showed increased BOLD signal intensity during aversive compared to neural conditions. The superior colliculus BOLD signal intensity also correlated with a preregistered set of brain regions involved in visual, somatosensory, and interoceptive processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Daily and cell type-specific membrane capacitance changes in mouse cortical neurons</a></h4>

              
                Capacitance is a property of biological membranes determined by the properties of the lipid portion of the membrane, as well as morphological features of a cell. In neurons, membrane capacitance is a determining factor of synaptic integration, action potential propagation speed and firing frequency. Besides slow changes associated with increased morphological complexity during postnatal maturation, neuron membrane capacity is largely considered a stable, non-regulated constant magnitude. Here we report that in pyramidal cells of mouse primary visual cortex the membrane capacitance changes nearly two-fold between the start and the end of a daily light cycle. The changes are large, nearly two-fold in magnitude in pyramidal cells, but do not affect cortical parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons. We discuss possible functional and practical implications as well as potential mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Supercomputers and Reverse Engineering of Motoneuron Firing Patterns</a></h4>

              
                In this study, we achieved a major step forward in the analysis of firing patterns of populations of motoneurons, through remarkably extensive parameter searches enabled by massively-parallel computation on supercomputers. The ability to implement these extensive parameter searches seem ideally matched to understanding the many parameters that define the inputs to neuron populations that generate these patterns. Therefore, we investigated the feasibility of using supercomputer-based models of spinal motoneurons as a basis for reverse engineering (RE) their firing patterns to identify the organization of their inputs, which we defined as the amplitudes and patterns of excitation, inhibition, and neuromodulation. This study combines two advances: 1) highly-realistic motoneuron models based on extensive in situ voltage and current clamp studies focused on neuromodulatory actions, and 2) implementation of these models using the Laboratory Computing Resource Center at Argonne National Laboratory to carry thousands (soon millions) of simulations simultaneously. The goal for computing and performing RE on over 300,000 combinations of excitatory, inhibitory, and neuromodulatory inputs was twofold: 1) to estimate the synaptic input to the motoneuron pool and 2) to generate training data for identifying the excitatory, inhibitory, and neuromodulatory inputs based on output firing patterns. As with other neural systems, any given motoneuron firing pattern could potentially be non-unique with respect to the excitatory, inhibitory, and neuromodulatory input combination (many input combinations produce similar outputs). However, our initial results show that the neuromodulatory input makes the motoneuron input-output properties so nonlinear that the effective RE solution space is restricted. The RE approach we demonstrate in this work is successful in generating estimates of the actual simulated patterns of excitation, inhibition, and neuromodulation with variances accounted for ranging from 75% to 90%. It was striking that the nonlinearities induced in firing patterns by the neuromodulation inputs did not impede RE, but instead generated distinctive features in firing patterns that aided RE. These simulations demonstrate the potential of this form of RE analysis. It is likely that the ever-increasing power of supercomputers will allow increasingly accurate RE of neuron inputs from their firing patterns from many neural systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">"Paradoxical wakefulness" induced by psychedelic 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine in mice</a></h4>

              
                Vigilance states - waking, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and paradoxical sleep, are thought to be controlled by several cortical and subcortical neuromodulatory circuits, among which the serotonergic (5-HT) system plays an important role. Recently, serotonergic psychedelics have attracted attention as potent antidepressants. While they are known to induce profound changes in subjective experience, the immediate and delayed effects of psychedelics on classical signatures of sleep-wake states remain under-investigated. To address this, we performed chronic electrophysiological recordings in the cortex of freely moving adult male mice following an injection of a short-acting psychedelic 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT). The most noticeable effect of 5-MeO-DMT administration was the suppression of paradoxical sleep and an acute induction of a mixed state of vigilance, characterised instead by prominent SWS-like slow waves on the EEG and LFP in awake, moving animals. We posit that the occurrence of this state in mice, which we refer to as 'paradoxical wakefulness', may be a rodent equivalent of the altered state of consciousness induced by psychedelics in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Regions with intermediate DNA methylation are epigenomic hotspots governing behavioral adaptation to changing environments</a></h4>

              
                Epigenetic and associated gene expression changes in the brain drive animals ability to adapt to changing environments. However, epigenetic attributes of environmental adaptation are unknown. Here we show that exercise, unpredictable stress, and environmental enrichment, conditions that elicit adaptive changes in synaptic plasticity and spatial learning, result in CpG methylation changes in regions that exist in both methylated and unmethylated states (i.e., epigenetically bistable) in hippocampal granule cells. Sustained exposures altered both the epiallelic proportions at these regions and neuronal and behavioral adaptation, indicating their adaptive nature. These malleable regions were enriched in exons and enhancer-associated chromatin marks. Their locations were mostly unique to specific environments but converged on similar synaptic genes. Lastly, manipulating DNA methylation altered epiallelic proportions at bistable regions in granule cells and phenocopied adaptive behavior. We propose that shifts in epiallelic proportions at evolutionarily conserved bistable regions, via gene expression changes, contribute to hippocampal plasticity and behavioral adaptation to changing environments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Vimo: Visual Analysis of Neuronal Connectivity Motifs</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in high-resolution connectomics provide researchers access to accurate reconstructions of vast neuronal circuits and brain networks for the first time. Neuroscientists anticipate analyzing these networks to gain a better understanding of information processing in the brain. In particular, scientists are interested in identifying specific network motifs, i.e., repeating subgraphs of the larger brain network that are believed to be neuronal building blocks. To analyze these motifs, it is crucial to review instances of a motif in the brain network and then map the graph structure to the detailed 3D reconstructions of the involved neurons and synapses. We present Vimo, an interactive visual approach to analyze neuronal motifs and motif chains in large brain networks. Experts can sketch network motifs intuitively in a visual interface and specify structural properties of the involved neurons and synapses to query large connectomics datasets. Motif instances (MIs) can be explored in high-resolution 3D renderings of the involved neurons and synapses. To reduce visual clutter and simplify the analysis of MIs, we designed a continuous focus&context metaphor inspired by continuous visual abstractions that allows the user to transition from the highly-detailed rendering of the anatomical structure to views that emphasize the underlying motif structure and synaptic connectivity. Furthermore, Vimo supports the identification of motif chains where a motif is used repeatedly to form a longer synaptic chain. We evaluate Vimo in a user study with seven domain experts and an in-depth case study on motifs in the central complex (CX) of the fruit fly brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An in vivo platform for rebuilding functional neocortical tissue</a></h4>

              
                Recent progress in cortical stem cell transplantation has demonstrated its potential to repair the brain. However, current transplant models have yet to demonstrate that the circuitry of transplant-derived neurons can encode useful function to the host. This is likely due to missing cell types within the grafts, abnormal proportions of cell types, abnormal cytoarchitecture, and inefficient vascularization. Here, we devised a transplant platform for testing neocortical tissue prototypes. Dissociated mouse embryonic telencephalic cells in a liquid scaffold were transplanted into aspiration-lesioned adult mouse cortices. The donor neuronal precursors differentiated into upper and deep layer neurons that exhibited synaptic puncta, projected outside of the graft to appropriate brain areas, became electrophysiologically active within one month post-transplant, and responded to visual stimuli. Interneurons and oligodendrocytes were present at normal densities in grafts. Grafts became fully vascularized by 1-week post-transplant and vessels in grafts were perfused with blood. With this paradigm, we could also organize cells into layers. Overall, we have provided proof of concept for an in vivo platform that can be used for developing and testing neocortical-like tissue prototypes.

                The sleep disorder Narcolepsy, a hypocretin deficiency disorder thought to be due to degeneration of hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin neurons, is currently treated symptomatically. We evaluated the efficacy of two small molecule hypocretin/orexin receptor-2 (HCRTR2) agonists in narcoleptic male orexin/tTA; TetO-DTA mice. TAK-925 (1-10 mg/kg, s.c.) and ARN-776 (1-10 mg/kg, i.p.) were injected 15 min before dark onset in a repeated measures design. EEG, EMG, subcutaneous temperature (Tsc ) and activity were recorded by telemetry; recordings for the first 6-h of the dark period were scored for sleep/wake and cataplexy. At all doses tested, TAK-925 and ARN-776 caused continuous wakefulness and eliminated sleep for the first hour. Both TAK-925 and ARN-776 caused dose-related delays in NREM sleep onset. All doses of TAK-925 and all but the lowest dose of ARN-776 eliminated cataplexy during the first hour after treatment; the anti-cataplectic effect of TAK-925 persisted into the 2nd hour for the highest dose. TAK-925 and ARN-776 also reduced the cumulative amount of cataplexy during the 6-h post-dosing period. The acute increase in wakefulness produced by both HCRTR2 agonists was characterized by increased spectral power in the gamma EEG band. Although neither compound provoked a NREM sleep rebound, both compounds affected NREM EEG during the 2nd hour post-dosing. TAK-925 and ARN-776 also increased gross motor activity, running wheel activity and Tsc , suggesting that the wake-promoting and sleep-suppressing activities of these compounds could be a consequence of hyperactivity. Nonetheless, the anti-cataplectic activity of TAK-925 and ARN-776 is encouraging for the development of HCRTR2 agonists.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Strategic control of location and ordinal context in visual working memory</a></h4>

              
                Working memory requires encoding stimulus identity and context (e.g., where or when it was presented). To explore the neural bases of the strategic control of context binding in working memory, we acquired fMRI while subjects performed delayed recognition of three orientation patches presented serially and at different locations. The recognition probe was an orientation patch with a superimposed digit, and depending on pretrial instruction subjects responded according to the probe's location (location-relevant), the ordinal position corresponding to its digit (order-relevant), or just its orientation (context-irrelevant). Delay-period signal in PPC was greater for context-relevant than for context-irrelevant trials, and multivariate decoding revealed strong sensitivity to context binding requirements (relevant vs. irrelevant) and to critical domain of context (location- vs. order-relevant) in both occipital cortex and PPC. At recognition, multivariate inverted encoding modeling revealed markedly different patterns in these two regions, suggesting different context-processing functions. In occipital cortex, an active representation of the location of each of the three samples was reinstated, regardless of trial type. The pattern in PPC, in contrast, suggested a filtering of location-context information that was dependent upon trial type. These results indicate that PPC exerts strategic control over the representation of location context in visual working memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of aging on successful object encoding:Enhanced semantic representations compensate for impaired visual representations</a></h4>

              
                Whereas episodic memory and visual processing decline substantially with healthy aging, semantic knowledge is generally spared. There is evidence that older adults can take advantage of their spared semantic knowledge to support their performance in episodic memory and visual tasks. Here, we used fMRI combined with representational similarity analyses (RSA) to examine how visual and semantic representations stored during encoding predict subsequent object memory. Young and older adults encoded images of objects during fMRI scanning and recalled these images while rating the vividness of their memories. After scanning, participants discriminated between studied images and similar lures. RSA based on a deep convolutional neural network and normative concept feature data was used to link patterns of neural activity during encoding to visual and semantic representations. The quality of visual representations was reduced in older adults, consistent with dedifferentiation, whereas the quality of semantic representations was enhanced in older adults, consistent with hyperdifferentiation. Despite dedifferentiation, visual representations stored in early visual cortex predicted later recall with high vividness in both young and older adults, with no age-related differences. In contrast, semantic representations in lingual and fusiform gyrus were associated with better subsequent object picture recall in older but not in young adults. This finding is consistent with evidence that older adults rely on semantic knowledge to compensate for cognitive deficits. Taken together, the results suggest that the age-related neural dedifferentiation for visual information in posterior regions might be partly counteracted by a boost on semantic representations in more anterior areas.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. Primary symptoms of PD arise with the loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the Substantia Nigra Pars Compacta, but it affects the hippocampus and cortex also, usually in its later stage. Approximately 15% of PD cases familial with a genetic mutation. Two of the most associated genes with autosomal recessive (AR) early-onset familial PD are PINK1 and PARK2. There is a need for In-vitro studies of these genetic mutations in order to understand the neurophysiological changes in patients' neurons that may contribute to neurodegeneration. In this work, we generated and differentiated DA and hippocampal neurons from iPSCs derived from two patients with a double mutation in their PINK1 and PARK2 (one homozygous and one heterozygous) genes and assessed their neurophysiology compared to two healthy controls. We showed that the synaptic activity of PD neurons generated from patients with the PINK1 and PARK2 mutations is impaired in the hippocampus and dopaminergic neurons. Mutant dopaminergic neurons had enhanced excitatory post-synaptic activity. In addition, DA neurons with the homozygous mutation of PINK1 exhibited more pronounced electrophysiological differences compared to the control neurons. Signaling network analysis of RNA sequencing results revealed that Focal adhesion and ECM receptor pathway were the top 2 upregulated pathways in the mutant PD neurons. These phenotypes are reversed to PD phenotypes of other mutations, suggesting that the interaction of the two mutations may yield different mechanisms of PD.

                In three experiments with rats, we analyzed the potential anxiolytic effects of sodium valproate, an anticonvulsant drug that has shown additional pharmacodynamic effects in animal models, including anxiolytic action. Since previous results have revealed that injecting valproate before allowing animals to consume a novel flavor solution resulted in an attenuation of neophobia, we predicted a similar effect when the novel flavor is presented on a drug-free trial in the presence of a context previously associated with the drug. In line with this hypothesis, in our first experiment we observed a reduction in neophobia to a novel flavor for those animals tested in the presence of the context associated with Sodium Valproate. However, a control group that received the drug before being allowed access to the novel flavor showed a significant reduction in consumption. Experiment 2 revealed that the unconditioned effects of the drug include a deleterious effect on the animals' locomotor activity that probably interferes with drinking behavior. Finally, in a third experiment, we directly tested the potential anxiolytic properties of sodium valproate by injecting the drug before implementing a fear conditioning procedure. These findings are explained in terms of the unconditioned anxiolytic action of the drug and the formation of an association between the context and the effects of the drug that evokes a conditioned response reminiscent of such anxiolytic effect.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Abstraction of reward context facilitates relative reward coding in dorsal and ventral anterior cingulate cortex</a></h4>

              
                The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is believed to be involved in many cognitive processes, including linking goals to actions and tracking decision-relevant contextual information. ACC neurons robustly encode expected outcomes, but how this relates to putative functions of ACC remains unknown. Here, we approach this question from the perspective of population codes by analyzing neural spiking data in the ventral and dorsal banks of the ACC in monkeys trained to perform a stimulus-motor mapping task. We found that neural populations favor a representational geometry that emphasizes contextual information, while facilitating the independent, abstract representation of multiple task-relevant variables. In addition, trial outcomes were primarily encoded relative to task context, suggesting that the population structures we observe could be a mechanism allowing feedback to be interpreted in a context-dependent manner. Together, our results point to a prominent role for ACC in context-setting and relative interpretation of outcomes, facilitated by abstract, or "untangled," representations of task variables.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">On the Mechanisms of Audio-Visual Integration for Manual Interception</a></h4>

              
                Natural interception actions such as catching a ball require accurate motion prediction and typically involve multiple senses. Laboratory interception studies focus on vision and commonly ignore sound. Here we ask how visual and auditory signals are integrated to guide interception. Observers tracked the brief launch of a simulated baseball randomly paired with batting sounds of varying intensities and made a quick pointing movement at the ball. Interception endpoints revealed systematic overestimation of target speed when ball launch was paired with a loud versus a quiet sound, even though sound was never informative. We applied a Bayesian observer model showing that audio-visual integration, strongest at the shortest presentation duration, depended on visual certainty. Continuous eye movements uncovered that sound influenced visual speed estimates within 125 ms of ball launch. Our findings suggest that auditory and visual signals are rapidly and optimally weighed to guide interception.

                The Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a role in cell proliferation and differentiation in healthy development and in tumors, however its requirement for brain development remains unclear. Here we used a conditional mouse allele for Egfr to examine its contributions to perinatal forebrain development at the tissue level. Subtractive bulk ventral and dorsal deletions of Egfr revealed that ventral but not dorsal telencephalic EGFR expression is critical for forebrain homeostasis and the presence of transiently EGFR-dependent glial lineages including robust depletion of oligodendrocytes that last the mouses lifetime. Sparse deletion using Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers (MADM) surprisingly reveals a regional requirement for EGFR in dorsal, but not ventral glial lineages including both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. These findings lead to a model in which EGFR-independent ventral glial progenitors compensate for the absence of EGFR-dependent dorsal glia in the forebrain, thus masking its precise role in the bulk model.

	<p>This study aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)-mediated adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis in depression models in vivo. Namptflox/flox mice were used to evaluate the role of NAMPT in depression. NAMPT and NAD levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) were measured, and depression-associated behavior, cognitive function, and social interaction were evaluated. The expression levels of BDNF, pCREB, CREB, monoamine neurotransmitters, and corticosterone (CORT) were also detected in the PFC. The contents of NAMPT and NAD decreased in the PFC in Namptflox/flox mice. Namptflox/flox mice showed depression-like behaviors, cognitive function deterioration, decreased social ability, and decreased dominance. Meanwhile, there were decreased expression levels of the pCREB/CREB ratio, but not BDNF, in the PFC. Levels of DA, 5-HT, and NE were decreased, and CORT was activated in the PFC of Namptflox/flox mice. Additionally, the role of NAMPT-NAD was examined in rats treated with nicotinamide riboside (NR) after being exposed to chronic unexpected mild stress (CUMS). NR reversed the decreased NAMPT expression in the PFC and HIP, and the NAD content in the PFC, but not HIP in rats with CUMS-induced depression. NR also improved depressive- and anxiolytic-like behaviors, locomotor activity, and cognitive function. BDNF expression and the pCREB/CREB ratio were significantly increased in both the PFC and HIP after NR treatment. The activation of CORT and decreased content of DA were reversed after NR treatment in the PFC. There was no difference in the 5-HT content among groups in both the PFC and HIP. Taken together, NAD synthesis induced by NAMPT could be associated with depression-like behaviors in mice, and the elevated NAD level by NR improved depression in rats.</p>

<p>This multi-center, randomized, double-blinded trial by Okuda, et al. assessed the impact of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) in the time to onset of first clinical symptoms attributable to a central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating event within a follow-up period of 96 weeks. Treatment with DMF resulted in over 80% risk reduction relative to placebo in the prevention of a first acute clinical event related to multiple sclerosis. A significant reduction in new and/or newly-enlarging T2-weighted hyperintense lesions was also observed.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) represents the earliest detectable pre-clinical phase of multiple sclerosis (MS). This study evaluated the impact of therapeutic intervention in preventing first symptom manifestation at this stage in the disease spectrum.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study involving people with RIS. Individuals without clinical symptoms typical of MS but with incidental brain MRI anomalies consistent with central nervous system (CNS) demyelination were included. Within 12 MS centers in the United States, participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to oral dimethyl fumarate (DMF) 240 mg twice daily or placebo. The primary endpoint was the time to onset of clinical symptoms attributable to a CNS demyelinating event within a follow-up period of 96 weeks. An intention-to-treat analysis was applied to all participating individuals in the primary and safety investigations. The study is registered at <a target="_blank"

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Participants from 12 centers were recruited from March 9, 2016, to October 31, 2019, with 44 people randomized to dimethyl fumarate and 43 to placebo. Following DMF treatment, the risk of a first clinical demyelinating event during the 96-week study period was highly reduced in the unadjusted Cox proportional-hazards regression model (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.05–0.63, <i>p</i> = 0.007). More moderate adverse reactions were present in the DMF (34 [32%]) than placebo groups (19 [21%]) but severe events were similar (DMF, 3 [5%]; placebo, 4 [9%]).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This is the first randomized clinical trial demonstrating the benefit of a disease-modifying therapy in preventing a first acute clinical event in people with RIS. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">A Subpopulation of Spikes Predicts Successful Epilepsy Surgery Outcome</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Epileptic spikes are the traditional interictal electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarker for epilepsy. Given their low specificity for identifying the epileptogenic zone (EZ), they are given only moderate attention in presurgical evaluation. This study aims to demonstrate that it is possible to identify specific spike features in intracranial EEG that optimally define the EZ and predict surgical outcome.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed spike features on stereo-EEG segments from 83 operated patients from 2 epilepsy centers (37 Engel IA) in wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep. After automated spike detection, we investigated 135 spike features based on rate, morphology, propagation, and energy to determine the best feature or feature combination to discriminate the EZ in seizure-free and non-seizure-free patients by applying 4-fold cross-validation.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The rate of spikes with preceding gamma activity in wakefulness performed better for surgical outcome classification (4-fold area under receiver operating characteristics curve [AUC] = 0.755 ± 0.07) than the seizure onset zone, the current gold standard (AUC = 0.563 ± 0.05, <i>p</i> = 0.015) and the ripple rate, an emerging seizure-independent biomarker (AUC = 0.537 ± 0.07, <i>p</i> = 0.006). Channels with a spike-gamma rate exceeding 1.9/min had an 80% probability of being in the EZ. Combining features did not improve the results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Resection of brain regions with high spike-gamma rates in wakefulness is associated with a high probability of achieving seizure freedom. This rate could be applied to determine the minimal number of spiking channels requiring resection. In addition to quantitative analysis, this feature is easily accessible to visual analysis, which could aid clinicians during presurgical evaluation. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                AD is a brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, and eventually the ability to carry out simple daily tasks. AD typically progresses over decades through multiple stages (Figure 1). First, at the preclinical (asymptomatic) stage, patients have no cognitive symptoms. However, at this stage, amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) of Tau proteins, and physiological alterations in neurons have already begun in focal regions of the brain, and worsen gradually over ~20 years [1–4].

	<p>The pathogenesis of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is complex, multilayered, and not fully understood, resulting in a lack of effective disease-modifying treatments for this prevalent neurodegenerative condition. Symptoms of PD are heterogenous, including motor impairment as well as non-motor symptoms such as depression, cognitive impairment, and circadian disruption. Aging and stress are important risk factors for PD, leading us to explore pathways that may either accelerate or protect against cellular aging and the detrimental effects of stress. Cortisol is a much-studied hormone that can disrupt mitochondrial function and increase oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, which are recognized as key underlying disease mechanisms in PD. The more recently discovered klotho protein, considered a general aging-suppressor, has a similarly wide range of actions but in the opposite direction to cortisol: promoting mitochondrial function while reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Both hormones also converge on pathways of vitamin D metabolism and insulin resistance, also implicated to play a role in PD. Interestingly, aging, stress and PD associate with an increase in cortisol and decrease in klotho, while physical exercise and certain genetic variations lead to a decrease in cortisol response and increased klotho. Here, we review the interrelated opposite actions of cortisol and klotho in the pathogenesis of PD. Together they impact powerful and divergent mechanisms that may go on to influence PD-related symptoms. Better understanding of these hormones in PD would facilitate the design of effective interventions that can simultaneously impact the multiple systems involved in the pathogenesis of PD.</p>

	<p>In GWAS studies, the neural adhesion molecule encoding the neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1) gene has been consistently linked with both depression and obesity. Although the linkage between NEGR1 and depression is the strongest, evidence also suggests the involvement of NEGR1 in a wide spectrum of psychiatric conditions. Here we show the expression of NEGR1 both in tyrosine- and tryptophan hydroxylase-positive cells. Negr1&amp;amp;minus;/&amp;amp;minus; mice show a time-dependent increase in behavioral sensitization to amphetamine associated with increased dopamine release in both the dorsal and ventral striatum. Upregulation of transcripts encoding dopamine and serotonin transporters and higher levels of several monoamines and their metabolites was evident in distinct brain areas of Negr1&amp;amp;minus;/&amp;amp;minus; mice. Chronic (23 days) escitalopram-induced reduction of serotonin and dopamine turnover is enhanced in Negr1&amp;amp;minus;/&amp;amp;minus; mice, and escitalopram rescued reduced weight of hippocampi in Negr1&amp;amp;minus;/&amp;amp;minus; mice. The current study is the first to show alterations in the brain monoaminergic systems in Negr1-deficient mice, suggesting that monoaminergic neural circuits contribute to both depressive and obesity-related phenotypes linked to the human NEGR1 gene.</p>

	<p>Background: Hand dysfunction is one of the main symptoms of stroke patients, but there is still a lack of accurate hand function assessment systems. This study focused on the application of the multi-dimensional intelligent visual quantitative assessment system (MDIVQAS) in the rehabilitation assessment of hand function in stroke patients and evaluate hand function rehabilitation in stroke patients. Methods: Eighty-two patients with stroke and unilateral hand dysfunction were evaluated by MDIVQAS. Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s Alpha coefficient was used to assess the internal consistency of MDIVQAS; the F-test is used to assess the differences in MDIVQAS for multiple repeated measures. Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s analysis was used to identify correlations of MDIVQAS with other assessment systems. T-tests were used to identify differences in outcomes assessed with MDIVQAS in patients before and after treatment. p&amp;amp;lt; 0.05 were considered significant. Results: (1) Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s Alpha coefficient of MDIVQAS in evaluating hand&amp;amp;rsquo;s function &amp;amp;gt;0.9. (2) There was no significant difference between the other repeated measurements, except for thumb rotation in MDIVQAS. (3) MDIVQAS had a significant correlation with other assessment systems (r &amp;amp;gt; 0.5, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). (4) There were significant differences in the evaluation of hand function in patients before and after treatment using MDIVQAS. Conclusion: The MDIVQAS system has good reliability and validity in the evaluation of stroke hand function, and it can also better evaluate the treatment effect.</p>

	<p>Palliative care adds significant burdens to healthcare workers. In neuropalliative care (NPC), additional challenges include patient symptom burdens, such as impairments in mobility, cognition, and communication. After one year of operating the first NPC ward in Germany, we assessed burdens, resources, and the number of deaths perceived as stressful. NPC physicians and nursing staff were compared with the team of other neurological wards, including a stroke unit. The assessment took place between March 2022 and May 2022. All 64 team members were contacted; the responder rate was 81%. The perceived burden was high but did not differ between groups. There were no differences between the NPC- and the neurological wards in the number of deaths perceived as stressful. However, rather than the number of deaths, the circumstances of dying influence the perceived distress. The resources mentioned were similar between groups, with the team and private life being most important. Communication difficulties were frequently cited as stressful, whereas successful communication was identified as a resource.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Forebrain Glucocorticoid Receptor Overexpression Alters Behavioral Encoding of Hippocampal CA1 Pyramidal Cells in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Glucocorticoid signaling influences hippocampal-dependent behavior and vulnerability to stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders. In mice, lifelong overexpression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in forebrain excitatory neurons altered exploratory behavior, cognition, and dorsal hippocampal gene expression in adulthood, but whether GR overexpression alters the information encoded by hippocampal neurons is not known. We performed <I>in vivo</I> microendoscopic calcium imaging of 1359 dorsal CA1 pyramidal cells in freely behaving male and female wild-type (WT) and GR-overexpressing (GRov) mice during exploration of a novel open field, where most CA1 neurons are expected to respond to center location and mobility. Most neurons showed sensitivity to center location and/or mobility based on single-neuron calcium amplitude and event rate, but these sensitivity patterns differed between genotypes. GRov neurons were more likely than WT neurons to display center sensitivity and less likely to display mobility sensitivity. More than one-third of these responsive GRov neurons were sensitive only to center location and not mobility, while uniquely center-sensitive neurons were rare in WT. Most center-sensitive neurons exhibited anticipatory activity, suggesting they could drive behavior. We conclude that, compared with wild-type, dorsal CA1 pyramidal cells in GRov mice preferentially respond to center location rather than mobility in a novel open field. Such changes in the information encoded by individual hippocampal neurons in an aversive environment could underlie changes in stress vulnerability because of genetic or epigenetic variations in glucocorticoid receptor signaling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Cortical Pyramidal and Parvalbumin Cells Exhibit Distinct Spatiotemporal Extracellular Electric Potentials</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Brain circuits are composed of diverse cell types with distinct morphologies, connections, and distributions of ion channels. Modeling suggests that the spatial distribution of the extracellular voltage during a spike depends on cellular morphology, connectivity, and identity. However, experimental evidence from the intact brain is lacking. Here, we combined high-density recordings from hippocampal region CA1 and neocortex of freely moving mice with optogenetic tagging of parvalbumin-immunoreactive (PV) cells. We used ground truth tagging of the recorded pyramidal cells (PYR) and PV cells to construct binary classification models. Features derived from single-channel waveforms or from spike timing alone allowed near-perfect classification of PYR and PV cells. To determine whether there is unique information in the spatial distribution of the extracellular potentials, we removed all single-channel waveform information from the multichannel waveforms using an event-based delta-transformation. We found that spatiotemporal features derived from the transformed waveforms yield accurate classification. The extracellular analog of the spatial distribution of the initial depolarization phase provided the highest contribution to the spatially based prediction. Compared with PV cell spikes, PYR spikes exhibited higher spatial synchrony at the beginning of the extracellular spike and lower synchrony at the trough. The successful classification of PYR and PV cells based on purely spatial features provides direct experimental evidence that spikes of distinct cell types are associated with distinct spatial distributions of extracellular potentials.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Generic Inhibitory Function of Corollary Discharge in Motor Intention: Evidence from the Modulation Effects of Speech Preparation on the Late Components of Auditory Neural Responses</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The importance of action&ndash;perception loops necessitates efficient computations linking motor and sensory systems. Corollary discharge (CD), a concept in motor-to-sensory transformation, has been proposed to predict the sensory consequences of actions for efficient motor and cognitive control. The predictive computation has been assumed to realize via inhibiting sensory reafference when actions are executed. Continuous control throughout the course of action demands inhibitory function ubiquitously on all potential reafference when sensory consequences are not available before execution. However, the temporal and functional characteristics of CD are unclear. When does CD begin to operate? To what extent does CD inhibit sensory processes? How is the inhibitory function implemented in neural computation? Using a delayed articulation paradigm with three types of auditory probes (speech, nonspeech, and nonhuman sounds) in an electroencephalography experiment with 20 human participants (7 males), we found that preparing to speak without knowing what to say (general preparation) suppressed neural responses to each type of auditory probe, suggesting a generic inhibitory function of CD in motor intention. Moreover, power and phase coherence in low-frequency bands (1&ndash;8 Hz) were both suppressed, indicating that inhibition was mediated by dampening response amplitude and adding temporal variance to sensory processes. Furthermore, inhibition was stronger for sounds that humans can produce than nonhuman sounds, hinting that the generic inhibitory function of CD is regulated by the established motor&ndash;sensory associations. These results suggest a functional and temporal granularity of corollary discharge that mediates multifaceted computations in motor and cognitive control.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pre-exposure to azithromycin enhances gonococcal resilience to subsequent ciprofloxacin exposure: an in vitro study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The effect of sequential exposure to different antibiotics is an underexplored topic. Azithromycin can be detected in humans for up to 28 days post-ingestion and may prime bacterial responses to subsequently ingested antibiotics. Methods: In this in vitro study, we assessed if preexposure to azithromycin could accelerate the acquisition of resistance to ciprofloxacin in Neisseria gonorrhoeae reference strain, WHO–F. In a morbidostat, we set two conditions in 3 vials each: mono-exposure (preexposure to Gonococcal Broth followed by exposure to ciprofloxacin) and dual sequential exposure (preexposure to azithromycin followed by exposure to ciprofloxacin).The growth of the cultures was measured by a software (MATLAB). The program decided if gonococcal broth or antibiotics were added to the vials in order to keep the evolution of the cultures. Samples were taken twice a week until the end of the experiment i.e. until resistance was achieved or cellular death. Additionally, six replicates of WHO–F WT and WHO–F with rplV mutation, caused by azithromycin, were exposed to increasing concentrations of ciprofloxacin in plates to assess if there were differences in the rate of resistance emergence. Results: We found that after 12 hours of pre-exposure to azithromycin, N. gonorrhoeae's resilience to ciprofloxacin exposure increased. Pre-exposure to azithromycin did not, however, accelerate the speed to acquisition of ciprofloxacin resistance. Conclusions:  We found that azithromycin does not accelerate the emergence of ciprofloxacin resistance, but there were differences in the molecular pathways to the acquisition of ciprofloxacin resistance: the strains preexpossed to azithromycin followed a different route (GyrA: S91F pathway) than the ones without antibiotic preexposure (GyrA:D95N pathway). However, the number of isolates is too small to draw such strong conclusions.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Bidirectional regulation by “star forces”: Ionotropic astrocyte's optical stimulation suppresses synaptic plasticity, metabotropic one strikes back</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The role of astrocytes in modulating synaptic plasticity is an important question that until recently was not addressed due to limitations of previously existing technology. In the present study, we took an advantage of optogenetics to specifically activate astrocytes in hippocampal slices in order to study effects on synaptic function. Using the AAV-based delivery strategy, we expressed the ionotropic channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) or the metabotropic Gq-coupled Opto-a1AR opsins specifically in hippocampal astrocytes to compare different modalities of astrocyte activation. In electrophysiological experiments, we observed a depression of basal field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in the CA1 hippocampal layer following light stimulation of astrocytic ChR2. The ChR2-mediated depression increased under simultaneous light and electrical theta-burst stimulation (TBS). Application of the type 2 purinergic receptor antagonist suramin prevented depression of basal synaptic transmission, and switched the ChR2-dependent depression into potentiation. The GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist, phaclofen, did not prevent the depression of basal fEPSPs, but switched the ChR2-dependent depression into potentiation comparable to the values for TBS in control slices. In contrast, light stimulation of Opto-a1AR expressed in astrocytes led to an increase in basal fEPSPs, as well as a potentiation of synaptic responses to TBS significantly. A specific blocker of the Gq protein downstream target, the phospholipase C, U73122, completely prevented the effects of Opto-a1AR stimulation on basal fEPSPs or Opto + TBS responses. To understand molecular basis for the observed effects, we performed an analysis of gene expression in these slices using quantitative PCR approach. We observed a significant upregulation of “immediate-early” gene expression in hippocampal slices after light activation of Opto-a1AR-expressing astrocytes alone (<i>cRel</i>, <i>Arc</i>, <i>Fos</i>, <i>JunB</i>, and <i>Egr1</i>) or paired with TBS (<i>cRel</i>, <i>Fos</i>, and <i>Egr1</i>). Activation of ChR2-expressing hippocampal astrocytes was insufficient to affect expression of these genes in our experimental conditions. Thus, we concluded that optostimulation of astrocytes with ChR2 and Opto-a1AR optogenetic tools enables bidirectional modulation of synaptic plasticity and gene expression in hippocampus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Breast Milk Exposure is Associated With Cortical Maturation in Preterm Infants</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Breast milk exposure is associated with improved neurocognitive outcomes following preterm birth but the neural substrates linking breast milk with outcome are uncertain. We tested the hypothesis that high versus low breast milk exposure in preterm infants results in cortical morphology that more closely resembles that of term-born infants.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied 135 preterm (&lt;32 weeks’ gestation) and 77 term infants. Feeding data were collected from birth until hospital discharge and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at term-equivalent age. Cortical indices (volume, thickness, surface area, gyrification index, sulcal depth, and curvature) and diffusion parameters (fractional anisotropy [FA], mean diffusivity [MD], radial diffusivity [RD], axial diffusivity [AD], neurite density index [NDI], and orientation dispersion index [ODI]) were compared between preterm infants who received exclusive breast milk for &lt;75% of inpatient days, preterm infants who received exclusive breast milk for ≥75% of inpatient days and term-born controls. To investigate a dose response effect, we performed linear regression using breast milk exposure quartile weighted by propensity scores.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In preterm infants, high breast milk exposure was associated with reduced cortical gray matter volume (<i>d</i> = 0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.14 to 0.94, <i>p</i> = 0.014), thickness (<i>d</i> = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.08 to 0.84, <i>p</i> = 0.039), and RD (<i>d</i> = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.002 to 0.77, <i>p</i> = 0.039), and increased FA (<i>d</i> = −0.38, 95% CI = −0.74 to −0.01, <i>p</i> = 0.037) after adjustment for age at MRI, which was similar to the cortical phenotype observed in term-born controls. Breast milk exposure quartile was associated with cortical volume (ß = −0.192, 95% CI = −0.342 to −0.042, <i>p</i> = 0.017), FA (ß = 0.223, 95% CI = 0.075 to 0.372, <i>p</i> = 0.007), and RD (ß = −0.225, 95% CI = −0.373 to −0.076, <i>p</i> = 0.007) following adjustment for age at birth, age at MRI, and weighted by propensity scores, suggesting a dose effect.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>High breast milk exposure following preterm birth is associated with a cortical imaging phenotype that more closely resembles the brain morphology of term-born infants and effects appear to be dose-dependent. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Bayesian Multi-View Clustering given complex inter-view structure [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Multi-view datasets are becoming increasingly prevalent. These datasets consist of different modalities that provide complementary characterizations of the same underlying system. They can include heterogeneous types of information with complex relationships, varying degrees of missingness, and assorted sample sizes, as is often the case in multi-omic biological studies. Clustering multi-view data allows us to leverage different modalities to infer underlying systematic structure, but most existing approaches are limited to contexts in which entities are the same across views or have clear one-to-one relationships across data types with a common sample size. Many methods also make strong assumptions about the similarities of clusterings across views. We propose a Bayesian multi-view clustering approach (BMVC) which can handle the realities of multi-view datasets that often have complex relationships and diverse structure. BMVC incorporates known and complex many-to-many relationships between entities via a probabilistic graphical model that enables the joint inference of clusterings specific to each view, but where each view informs the others. Additionally, BMVC estimates the strength of the relationships between each pair of views, thus moderating the degree to which it imposes dependence constraints. We benchmarked BMVC on simulated data to show that it accurately estimates varying degrees of inter-view dependence when inter-view relationships are not limited to one-to-one correspondence. Next, we demonstrated its ability to capture visually interpretable inter-view structure in a public health survey of individuals and households in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria. Finally, we showed that BMVC clusters integrate the complex relationships between multi-omic profiles of breast cancer patient data, improving the biological homogeneity of clusters and elucidating hypotheses for functional biological mechanisms. We found that BMVC leverages complex inter-view structure to produce higher quality clusters than those generated by standard approaches. We also showed that BMVC is a valuable tool for real-world discovery and hypothesis generation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Significant demotivating factors affecting Saudi EFL students: An investigative study with PYP students [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Motivation has long been seen as a deciding factor in the learning of a foreign language and in ensuring success for the learners. As a corollary to this, demotivation adversely affects learning success and negatively influences learning outcomes. The present study examines the factors that negatively affect Saudi EFL learners.   Methods: The study subjects are 45 male and 35 female learners, and the data were collected using a 50-item questionnaire. The factors under study are course instructor, course-content and facilities, attitude towards EFL and socio-cultural factors.  Data have been analyzed using the SPSS software.   Results: Results show that the factors around socio-cultural, and course instructor (M=4.06, 3.67) respectively were the most influential in aggravating the student's demotivation. Furthermore, experience of failure is at play as a moderate factor (M=2.84) whereas the course content and facilities and attitude towards EFL factors, (M=2.57; M=1.83) are perceived as less influential factors in demotivating the EFL students. Findings also show a marginal non-significant difference between male and female participants regarding perceptions of the demotivating factors (males = 5.30, females= 5.70); the difference is not significant, P=, .834.   Conclusions: It is presumed that the findings of this study might be helpful for EFL learners and instructors of Saudi Arabia in devising coping strategies to overcome demotivation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The cocktail infection: anaerobic and aerobic co-Infections in tubercular vertebral osteomyelitis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Anaerobic organisms have been known to have an association with dental infections, bacteremia, endocarditis and soft tissue infections. However, anaerobic isolation from bone and joint infections are relatively rare. Sparse literature has been found on reports of anaerobic osteomyelitis. There is no literature reported on anaerobic osteomyelitis complicating Tuberculosis of spine. Case Report: We report two cases of tuberculosis of spine complicated by aerobic and anerobic infections. The first is a case of a young female who presented with chronic lower backache and fever. Examination revealed a lumbar scoliosis with paraspinal tenderness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine showed lumbar spondylodiscitis with multiple abscesses. There were air-fluid levels noted in the abscesses. The pus sent for CBNAAT (cartridge based nucleic acid amplification test) was positive. Further the cultures also grew Escherichia coli (aerobic) Bacteroids fragilis and Peptoniphilus asachrolyticus (anaerobic) organisms. She improved with a course of intravenous antibiotics and decompression surgery. The second case is a middle aged man who presented with chronic neck pain and fever. Examination revealed kyphosis of the neck with spasm of the neck muscles and midline tenderness. MRI showed C4-5 cervical spondylodiscitis with parapharyngeal collections showing air-fluid levels. The pus culture showed Streptococcus constellatus (aerobic) and  Prevotella sps. (anaerobic). The CBNAAT report was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics and cervical decompression. Conclusion: Though tubercular vertebral osteomyelitis (TVO) is usually a diagnosis in itself, it should not hinder us from considering secondary infections (both aerobic and anaerobic) complicating the osteomyelitis. Further, the presence of air-fluid levels on imaging studies and the presence of foul smell during operative exploration of the spine must arouse the suspicion of an anaerobic co-infection. Isolation and treatment of these organisms are crucial as they may hamper the clinical outcome of the primary TVO.
