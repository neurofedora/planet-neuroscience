	<p>Pain is a complex response to noxious stimuli. Upon detection of the nociceptive stimulus by first-order neurons or nociceptors, an action potential ascends to the spinal dorsal horn, a crucial site for synapsing with second-order neurons. These second-order neurons carry the nociceptive stimulus to supraspinal regions, notably the thalamus. Although extensive research has focused on spinal-level nociceptive mechanisms (e.g., neurotransmitters, receptors, and glial cells), the thalamus is still poorly elucidated. The role of the thalamus in relaying sensory and motor responses to the cortex is well known. However, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms in the synapse between the second-order and third-order neurons that transmit this impulse to the somatosensory cortex, where the response is processed and interpreted as pain, is still lacking. Thus, this review investigated the thalamus&amp;amp;rsquo;s role in transmitting nociceptive impulses. Current evidence indicates the involvement of the neurotransmitters glutamate and serotonin, along with NMDA, P2X4, TLR4, FGR, and NLRP3 receptors, as well as signaling pathways including ERK, P38, NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B, cytokines, and glial cells at nociceptive synapses within the thalamus.</p>

                <p>Many neurons including vasopressin (VP) magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs) of the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON) generate afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs) during spiking to slow firing, a phenomenon known as spike frequency adaptation. The AHP is underlain by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> currents, and while slow component (sAHP) features are well described, its mechanism remains poorly understood. Previous work demonstrated that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels is a primary source of sAHP activation in SON oxytocin neurons, but no obvious channel coupling was described for VP neurons. Given this, we tested the possibility of an intracellular source of sAHP activation, namely, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling organelles endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria in male and female Wistar rats. We demonstrate that ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion greatly inhibits sAHPs without a corresponding decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. Caffeine sensitized AHP activation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In contrast to ER, disabling mitochondria with CCCP or blocking mitochondria Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporters (MCUs) enhanced sAHP amplitude and duration, implicating mitochondria as a vital buffer for sAHP-activating Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Block of mitochondria Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> release via triphenylphosphonium (TPP<sup>+</sup>) failed to affect sAHPs, indicating that mitochondria Ca<sup>2+</sup> does not contribute to sAHP activation. Together, our results suggests that ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release activates sAHPs and mitochondria shape the spatiotemporal trajectory of the sAHP via Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering in VP neurons. Overall, this implicates organelle Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and specifically ER&ndash;mitochondria-associated membrane contacts, as an important site of Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomain activity that regulates sAHP signaling pathways. Thus, this site plays a major role in influencing VP firing activity and systemic hormonal release.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/30/e0195242024?rss=1">Neural Representation of Valenced and Generic Probability and Uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                <p>Representing the probability and uncertainty of outcomes facilitates adaptive behavior by allowing organisms to prepare in advance and devote attention to relevant events. Probability and uncertainty are often studied only for valenced (appetitive or aversive) outcomes, raising the question of whether the identified neural machinery also processes the probability and uncertainty of motivationally neutral outcomes. Here, we aimed to dissociate valenced from valence-independent (i.e., generic) probability (<I>p</I>; maximum at <I>p</I>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1) and uncertainty (maximum at <I>p</I> = 0.5) signals using human neuroimaging. In a Pavlovian task (<I>n</I> = 41; 19 females), different cues predicted appetitive, aversive, or neutral liquids with different probabilities (<I>p</I> = 0, <I>p</I> = 0.5, <I>p</I> = 1). Cue-elicited motor responses accelerated, and pupil sizes increased primarily for cues that predicted valenced liquids with higher probability. For neutral liquids, uncertainty rather than probability tended to accelerate cue-induced responding and decrease pupil size. At the neural level, generic uncertainty signals were limited to the occipital cortex, while generic probability also activated the anterior ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These generic probability and uncertainty signals contrasted with cue-induced responses that only encoded the probability and uncertainty of valenced liquids in medial prefrontal, insular, and occipital cortices. Our findings show a behavioral and neural dissociation of generic and valenced signals. Thus, some parts of the brain keep track of motivational charge while others do not, highlighting the need and usefulness of characterizing the exact nature of learned representations.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/30/e0261242024?rss=1">{beta}-arrestins Are Scaffolding Proteins Required for Shh-Mediated Axon Guidance</a></h4>

              
                <p>During nervous system development, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) guides developing commissural axons toward the floor plate of the spinal cord. To guide axons, Shh binds to its receptor Boc and activates downstream effectors such as Smoothened (Smo) and Src family kinases (SFKs). SFK activation requires Smo activity and is also required for Shh-mediated axon guidance. Here we report that &beta;-arrestin1 and &beta;-arrestin2 (&beta;-arrestins) serve as scaffolding proteins that link Smo and SFKs in Shh-mediated axon guidance. We found that &beta;-arrestins are expressed in rat commissural neurons. We also found that Smo, &beta;-arrestins, and SFKs form a tripartite complex, with the complex formation dependent on &beta;-arrestins. &beta;-arrestin knockdown blocked the Shh-mediated increase in Src phosphorylation, demonstrating that &beta;-arrestins are required to activate Src kinase downstream of Shh. &beta;-arrestin knockdown also led to the loss of Shh-mediated attraction of rat commissural axons in axon turning assays. Expression of two different dominant-negative &beta;-arrestins, &beta;-arrestin1 V53D which blocks the internalization of Smo and &beta;-arrestin1 P91G-P121E which blocks its interaction with SFKs, also led to the loss of Shh-mediated attraction of commissural axons. In vivo, the expression of these dominant-negative &beta;-arrestins caused defects in commissural axon guidance in the spinal cord of chick embryos of mixed sexes. Thus we show that &beta;-arrestins are essential scaffolding proteins that connect Smo to SFKs and are required for Shh-mediated axon guidance.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/30/e1331232024?rss=1">Segmenting and Predicting Musical Phrase Structure Exploits Neural Gain Modulation and Phase Precession</a></h4>

              
                <p>Music, like spoken language, is often characterized by hierarchically organized structure. Previous experiments have shown neural tracking of notes and beats, but little work touches on the more abstract question: how does the brain establish high-level musical structures in real time? We presented Bach chorales to participants (20 females and 9 males) undergoing electroencephalogram (EEG) recording to investigate how the brain tracks musical phrases. We removed the main temporal cues to phrasal structures, so that listeners could only rely on harmonic information to parse a continuous musical stream. Phrasal structures were disrupted by locally or globally reversing the harmonic progression, so that our observations on the original music could be controlled and compared. We first replicated the findings on neural tracking of musical notes and beats, substantiating the positive correlation between musical training and neural tracking. Critically, we discovered a neural signature in the frequency range ~0.1&nbsp;Hz (modulations of EEG power) that reliably tracks musical phrasal structure. Next, we developed an approach to quantify the phrasal phase precession of the EEG power, revealing that phrase tracking is indeed an operation of active segmentation involving predictive processes. We demonstrate that the brain establishes complex musical structures online over long timescales (&gt;5&nbsp;s) and actively segments continuous music streams in a manner comparable to language processing. These two neural signatures, phrase tracking and phrasal phase precession, provide new conceptual and technical tools to study the processes underpinning high-level structure building using noninvasive recording techniques.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/30/e1587232024?rss=1">Cell- and Pathway-Specific Disruptions in the Accumbens of Fragile X Mouse</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. The mesocorticolimbic system, which includes the prefrontal cortex (PFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and nucleus accumbens core (NAcC), is essential for regulating socioemotional behaviors. We employed optogenetics to compare the functional properties of the BLA-&gt;NAcC, PFC-&gt;NAcC, and reciprocal PFCBLA pathways in <I>Fmr1&ndash;/y::Drd1a-tdTomato</I> male mice. In FXS mice, the PFCBLA reciprocal pathway was unaffected, while significant synaptic modifications occurred in the BLA/PFC-&gt;NAcC pathways. We observed distinct changes in D1 striatal projection neurons (SPNs) and separate modifications in D2 SPNs. In FXS mice, the BLA/PFC-&gt;NAcC-D2 SPN pathways demonstrated heightened synaptic strength. Focusing on the BLA-&gt;NAcC pathway, linked to autistic symptoms, we found increased AMPAR and NMDAR currents and elevated spine density in D2 SPNs. Conversely, the amplified firing probability of BLA-&gt;NAcC-D1 SPNs was not accompanied by increased synaptic strength, AMPAR and NMDAR currents, or spine density. These pathway-specific alterations resulted in an overall enhancement of excitatory-to-spike coupling, a physiologically relevant index of how efficiently excitatory inputs drive neuronal firing, in both BLA-&gt;NAcC-D1 and BLA-&gt;NAcC-D2 pathways. Finally, the absence of fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMRP) led to impaired long-term depression specifically in BLA-&gt;D1 SPNs. These distinct alterations in synaptic transmission and plasticity within circuits targeting the NAcC highlight the potential role of postsynaptic mechanisms in selected SPNs in the observed circuit-level changes. This research underscores the heightened vulnerability of the NAcC in the context of FMRP deficiency, emphasizing its pivotal role in the pathophysiology of FXS.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/30/e1717232024?rss=1">Electrophysiological Mechanisms and Validation of Ferritin-Based Magnetogenetics for Remote Control of Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Magnetogenetics was developed to remotely control genetically targeted neurons. A variant of magnetogenetics uses magnetic fields to activate transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) channels when coupled with ferritin. Stimulation with static or RF magnetic fields of neurons expressing these channels induces Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and modulates behavior. However, the validity of ferritin-based magnetogenetics has been questioned due to controversies surrounding the underlying mechanisms and deficits in reproducibility. Here, we validated the magnetogenetic approach Ferritin-iron Redistribution to Ion Channels (FeRIC) using electrophysiological (Ephys) and imaging techniques. Previously, interference from RF stimulation rendered patch-clamp recordings inaccessible for magnetogenetics. We solved this limitation for FeRIC, and we studied the bioelectrical properties of neurons expressing TRPV4 (nonselective cation channel) and transmembrane member 16A (TMEM16A; chloride-permeable channel) coupled to ferritin (FeRIC channels) under RF stimulation. We used cultured neurons obtained from the rat hippocampus of either sex. We show that RF decreases the membrane resistance (Rm) and depolarizes the membrane potential in neurons expressing TRPV4<sup>FeRIC</sup>. RF does not directly trigger action potential firing but increases the neuronal basal spiking frequency. In neurons expressing TMEM16A<sup>FeRIC</sup>, RF decreases the Rm, hyperpolarizes the membrane potential, and decreases the spiking frequency. Additionally, we corroborated the previously described biochemical mechanism responsible for RF-induced activation of ferritin-coupled ion channels. We solved an enduring problem for ferritin-based magnetogenetics, obtaining direct Ephys evidence of RF-induced activation of ferritin-coupled ion channels. We found that RF does not yield instantaneous changes in neuronal membrane potentials. Instead, RF produces responses that are long-lasting and moderate, but effective in controlling the bioelectrical properties of neurons.</p>

                <p>Linking sensory input and its consequences is a fundamental brain operation. During behavior, the neural activity of neocortical and limbic systems often reflects dynamic combinations of sensory and task-dependent variables, and these "mixed representations" are suggested to be important for perception, learning, and plasticity. However, the extent to which such integrative computations might occur outside of the forebrain is less clear. Here, we conduct cellular-resolution two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in the superficial "shell" layers of the inferior colliculus (IC), as head-fixed mice of either sex perform a reward-based psychometric auditory task. We find that the activity of individual shell IC neurons jointly reflects auditory cues, mice's actions, and behavioral trial outcomes, such that trajectories of neural population activity diverge depending on mice's behavioral choice. Consequently, simple classifier models trained on shell IC neuron activity can predict trial-by-trial outcomes, even when training data are restricted to neural activity occurring prior to mice's instrumental actions. Thus, in behaving mice, auditory midbrain neurons transmit a population code that reflects a joint representation of sound, actions, and task-dependent variables.</p>

                <p>It has been suggested that, prior to a saccade, visual neurons predictively respond to stimuli that will fall in their receptive fields after completion of the saccade. This saccadic remapping process is thought to compensate for the shift of the visual world across the retina caused by eye movements. To map the timing of this predictive process in the brain, we recorded neural activity using electroencephalography during a saccade task. Human participants (male and female) made saccades between two fixation points while covertly attending to oriented gratings briefly presented at various locations on the screen. Data recorded during trials in which participants maintained fixation were used to train classifiers on stimuli in different positions. Subsequently, data collected during saccade trials were used to test for the presence of remapped stimulus information at the post-saccadic retinotopic location in the peri-saccadic period, providing unique insight into when remapped information becomes available. We found that the stimulus could be decoded at the remapped location ~180&nbsp;ms post-stimulus onset, but only when the stimulus was presented 100&ndash;200&nbsp;ms before saccade onset. Within this range, we found that the timing of remapping was dictated by stimulus onset rather than saccade onset. We conclude that presenting the stimulus immediately before the saccade allows for optimal integration of the corollary discharge signal with the incoming peripheral visual information, resulting in a remapping of activation to the relevant post-saccadic retinotopic neurons.</p>

                <p>Light plays an essential role in a variety of physiological processes, including vision, mood, and glucose homeostasis. However, the intricate relationship between light and an animal's feeding behavior has remained elusive. Here, we found that light exposure suppresses food intake, whereas darkness amplifies it in male mice. Interestingly, this phenomenon extends its reach to diurnal male Nile grass rats and healthy humans. We further show that lateral habenula (LHb) neurons in mice respond to light exposure, which in turn activates 5-HT neurons in the dorsal Raphe nucleus (DRN). Activation of the LHb-&gt;5-HT<sup>DRN</sup> circuit in mice blunts darkness-induced hyperphagia, while inhibition of the circuit prevents light-induced anorexia. Together, we discovered a light-responsive neural circuit that relays the environmental light signals to regulate feeding behavior in mice.</p>

                <p>Completely ignoring a salient distractor presented concurrently with a target is difficult, and sometimes attention is involuntarily attracted to the distractor's location (attentional capture). Employing the N2ac component as a marker of attention allocation toward sounds, in this study we investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of auditory attention across two experiments. Human participants (male and female) performed an auditory search task, where the target was accompanied by a distractor in two-third of the trials. For a distractor more salient than the target (Experiment 1), we observe not only a distractor N2ac (indicating attentional capture) but the full chain of attentional dynamics implied by the notion of attentional capture, namely, (1) the distractor captures attention before the target is attended, (2) allocation of attention to the target is delayed by distractor presence, and (3) the target is attended after the distractor. Conversely, for a distractor less salient than the target (Experiment 2), although responses were delayed, no attentional capture was observed. Together, these findings reveal two types of spatial attentional dynamics in the auditory modality (distraction with and without attentional capture).</p>

                <p>Mature vertebrates maintain posture using vestibulospinal neurons that transform sensed instability into reflexive commands to spinal motor circuits. Postural stability improves across development. However, due to the complexity of terrestrial locomotion, vestibulospinal contributions to postural refinement in early life remain unexplored. Here we leveraged the relative simplicity of underwater locomotion to quantify the postural consequences of losing vestibulospinal neurons during development in larval zebrafish of undifferentiated sex. By comparing posture at two timepoints, we discovered that later lesions of vestibulospinal neurons led to greater instability. Analysis of thousands of individual swim bouts revealed that lesions disrupted movement timing and corrective reflexes without impacting swim kinematics, and that this effect was particularly strong in older larvae. Using a generative model of swimming, we showed how these disruptions could account for the increased postural variability at both timepoints. Finally, late lesions disrupted the fin/trunk coordination observed in older larvae, linking vestibulospinal neurons to postural control schemes used to navigate in depth. Since later lesions were considerably more disruptive to postural stability, we conclude that vestibulospinal contributions to balance increase as larvae mature. Vestibulospinal neurons are highly conserved across vertebrates; we therefore propose that they are a substrate for developmental improvements to postural control.</p>

                Background Public tenders are vital for a country’s GDP and citizens’ quality of life, enabling public administration to achieve various goals. Developing and developed countries allocate over 10% of their GDP to public procurement. This highlights the significant societal support public tenders can provide, making it important to consider how they can further benefit society. Policy and implications Public procurement can achieve policy objectives and benefit society by selecting tenders based on criteria beyond price, such as economic advantage and social benefits. This approach, endorsed by EU directives since 2014, encourages innovation and socially responsible practices. Contracting authorities in the EU can use social, environmental, and qualitative criteria to determine the most advantageous offers. Poland’s Public Procurement Law (PPL) allows contract award criteria based on quality and price, including social aspects. Contracting authorities can specify criteria like employing marginalized groups, though these criteria often face scrutiny and legal challenges. Non-price criteria aim to enhance competition and achieve social, environmental, and economic goals. Recommendations EU and Polish laws permit and encourage using social aspects as contract award criteria in public procurement. However, contracting authorities must analyze priorities, risk balancing, time constraints, and departmental coordination to effectively implement these criteria. This approach can improve the social situation and support specific groups. Conclusions Public procurement significantly influences a country’s economy and quality of life, with EU and Polish laws allowing social criteria in contract awards. Directive 2014/24/EU supports tenders based on economic and social benefits. Poland’s PPL aligns with this, emphasizing marginalized group employment. Effective implementation fosters job creation, social integration, and improved living standards.

                Salivary gland cancers (SGC) are rare neoplasms that exhibit a wide array of histological heterogeneities. Most patients presenting with SGCs are asymptomatic, as they are typically slow-growing and localized. Primary surgical resection is the cornerstone treatment for SGCs and radiotherapy is performed in selected cases. There is no consensus on concrete standard post-operative guidelines. Patients are followed-up for years, however an agreed duration of follow-up is less elucidated in the literature present on the subject. Distant metastases are the primary cause of treatment failure. Post-operative diagnostic evidence of disease recurrence or distant metastases is heavily guided by radiological examinations. Patients with SGCs have better outcomes with a well-structured and lengthy follow-up plan. This review aims to suggest an appropriate follow-up duration and radiological modalities used post-operatively for SGC patients.

                Background Many behavioural, pharmacological, and metabolic studies in mice require fasting, yet the possibility of fasting-induced torpor affecting data is rarely considered. Torpor is a state characterised by depressed metabolism and profound alterations in physiology and behaviour. In this study, we aimed to determine whether a chronic food restriction paradigm, common in behavioural studies, was sufficient to induce torpor in mice. Methods Mice were food restricted to ~85-90% of their bodyweight, as is typically done, and monitored using continuous thermal imaging. Results We observed that body temperature significantly decreased over days of food restriction, and it was significantly related to the drop in bodyweight (r2=0.8989, p<0.0001). All mice reliably entered torpor daily from day 8 of food restriction which coincided with bodyweight stabilisation at ~85%. We found a strong positive relationship between the magnitude of the decrease of bodyweight and the proportion of mice entering torpor each day (r2=0.8715, p<0.0001). Conclusions Overall, we found that torpor is readily induced in response to food restriction. Considering that hunger is frequently used as a motivational drive in behavioural tasks, it is likely that torpor occurrence is common in such studies, while remaining undetected and unaccounted for. Due to the profound effect of torpor on physiology, it is possible that torpor induction may be confounding subsequent data and represents an important source of variation. We recommend that body temperature is always monitored noninvasively in studies where food restriction is employed, to determine when torpor is occurring, and that torpor history is appropriately controlled for within and across experimental groups.

                Background Many behavioural, pharmacological, and metabolic studies in mice require fasting, yet the possibility of fasting-induced torpor affecting the data is rarely considered. Torpor is a state characterised by depressed metabolism and profound alterations to physiology and behaviour. In this study we aimed to determine how the effects of torpor on experimental outcomes could be mitigated. Methods To this end, timing and characteristics of fasting-induced torpor in response to feeding in the morning versus feeding in the night were compared using non-invasive monitoring of peripheral body temperature. Results Night-fed mice entered significantly more torpor bouts per day compared to morning-fed mice (Morning: 2.79±0.197 (mean ± SEM); Night: 4.79±0.533 (mean ± SEM); p=0.0125), but these bouts were shorter on average by ~1.5h. Latency to the first torpor bout following feeding tended to be shorter during night feeding (Morning: 9.57±0.8h (mean ± SEM); Night: 6.66±1.2h (mean ± SEM); p=0.0928). Moreover, torpor bouts typically occurred during the dark phase in the morning-fed group, whilst night feeding resulted in a shift of torpor occurrence to earlier in the day (Morning: 14.2±0.4 ZT h (mean ± SEM); Night: 12.2±0.9 ZT h (mean ± SEM); p=0.0933). There was a high degree of variation in torpor occurrence within and between animals in each group. Conclusions We recommend that feeding time is kept consistent between days and the same across animals to minimise variation in torpor occurrence. Moreover, the timing of food provision may be optimised to allow measurements to be taken during euthermia, to mitigate the effects of torpor on the variables investigated. Finally, we recommend that body temperature is monitored non-invasively to determine when torpor is occurring, and that testing, or sample collection is conducted when the torpor history is comparable between animals.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1602/v2?src=rss">Households with children under 5 years and older adults, and probability of expenditure on Comsumption of Food Away from Home (CFAFH) in Peru in 2021: A Cross-Sectional Study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                For the Consumption of food away from home CFAFH study, it is necessary to analyze the economic variable of families and the way it is distributed, since it allows a broader perspective of what a household invests in food consumption and how it is associated with health. The aim of this research was to determine the probability of expenditure on households that consume food away from home, with the presence of children under five years (Ch<5y) and households with the presence of older adults (HOA). A cross-sectional, descriptive, and quantitative study was carried out based on the grouping and analysis of data obtained from the Peruvian National Household Survey (ENAHO) 2021 database. After joining the database, the household type variables were created. Households with and without children under five years, and households with and without older adults were selected, as well as other variables such as the area of origin, gender of the head of the household, ethnicity, education level, marital status, age of the head of the household, occupation of the head of the household, and poverty. The results show that households with children under 5 spend 56.35 USDollars per month. While households with older adults spend 34.72 USDollars per month. The variables that allow for a higher probability of FAFH purchase in both groups studied (households with children and older adults): belonging to the rural area (p=0.000; p=0.000), being of Aymara ethnicity (p=0. 000; p=0.000), being of African descent (p=0.000; p=0.011), Having a dependent job (p=0.035; p=0.000), the non-extremely poor (p=0.000; p=0.009), and the non-poor (p=0.000; p=0.000). These results warrant that it is necessary to generate awareness in the population about the food that is sold and consumed away from home for an appropriate selection of healthy options.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-828/v1?src=rss">A comprehensive review on epigenetic and epitranscriptomic-mediated regulation of antibiotic resistance [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Antibiotic resistance is the leading cause of death globally, with a higher possibility of the emergence of highly resistant pathogens, leading to epidemics. Several antibiotic resistance mechanisms have been discovered, such as enhanced efflux of antibiotics, reduced influx of antibiotics, alteration of antibiotics or their targets, and adaptation to antibiotics. However, this mechanism cannot fully explain the development of antibiotic resistance because the genes associated with this mechanism have been elucidated. However, the factors governing their regulation are not yet fully understood. Recent studies have highlighted the epigenetic and epitranscriptomic roles of antibiotic resistance development-associated genes. Epigenetic modification is associated with DNA modification, whereas epitranscriptomic modification is associated with RNA modification to control gene expression by regulating various biological phenomena such as splicing, translation, and stability. Therefore, this review will focus on the discovery of epigenetic modifications, particularly by DNA methyltransferases, such as restriction-modification (R-M) systems associated with methyltransferases, orphan DNA methyltransferases, and nucleoid-associated proteins that contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance. This scrutinization further expands to epitranscriptomic modification of non-coding RNA, which has a role in the regulation of antibiotic resistance. Epitranscriptomic modification of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which is a major target of antibiotics, has been well explored. while non-coding RNA such as cis and trans small non coding RNA, and riboswitches are poorly explored. This epigenetic and epitranscriptomic modification will help to understand the regulation of antibiotic resistance-associated genes, which will help to identify key regulators of antibiotic resistance, paving the way for new antibiotic discovery, leading to decreased antibiotic mortality globally.

                <p>by Noah B. Herrington, Yan Chak Li, David Stein, Gaurav Pandey, Avner Schlessinger</p>

Protein kinase function and interactions with drugs are controlled in part by the movement of the DFG and ɑC-Helix motifs that are related to the catalytic activity of the kinase. Small molecule ligands elicit therapeutic effects with distinct selectivity profiles and residence times that often depend on the active or inactive kinase conformation(s) they bind. Modern AI-based structural modeling methods have the potential to expand upon the limited availability of experimentally determined kinase structures in inactive states. Here, we first explored the conformational space of kinases in the PDB and models generated by AlphaFold2 (AF2) and ESMFold, two prominent AI-based protein structure prediction methods. Our investigation of AF2’s ability to explore the conformational diversity of the kinome at various multiple sequence alignment (MSA) depths showed a bias within the predicted structures of kinases in DFG-in conformations, particularly those controlled by the DFG motif, based on their overabundance in the PDB. We demonstrate that predicting kinase structures using AF2 at lower MSA depths explored these alternative conformations more extensively, including identifying previously unobserved conformations for 398 kinases. Ligand enrichment analyses for 23 kinases showed that, on average, docked models distinguished between active molecules and decoys better than random (average AUC (avgAUC) of 64.58), but select models perform well (e.g., avgAUCs for PTK2 and JAK2 were 79.28 and 80.16, respectively). Further analysis explained the ligand enrichment discrepancy between low- and high-performing kinase models as binding site occlusions that would preclude docking. The overall results of our analyses suggested that, although AF2 explored previously uncharted regions of the kinase conformational space and select models exhibited enrichment scores suitable for rational drug discovery, rigorous refinement of AF2 models is likely still necessary for drug discovery campaigns.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012276">Generating information-dense promoter sequences with optimal string packing</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Virgile Andreani, Eric J. South, Mary J. Dunlop</p>

Dense arrangements of binding sites within nucleotide sequences can collectively influence downstream transcription rates or initiate biomolecular interactions. For example, natural promoter regions can harbor many overlapping transcription factor binding sites that influence the rate of transcription initiation. Despite the prevalence of overlapping binding sites in nature, rapid design of nucleotide sequences with many overlapping sites remains a challenge. Here, we show that this is an NP-hard problem, coined here as the nucleotide String Packing Problem (SPP). We then introduce a computational technique that efficiently assembles sets of DNA-protein binding sites into dense, contiguous stretches of double-stranded DNA. For the efficient design of nucleotide sequences spanning hundreds of base pairs, we reduce the SPP to an Orienteering Problem with integer distances, and then leverage modern integer linear programming solvers. Our method optimally packs sets of 20–100 binding sites into dense nucleotide arrays of 50–300 base pairs in 0.05–10 seconds. Unlike approximation algorithms or meta-heuristics, our approach finds provably optimal solutions. We demonstrate how our method can generate large sets of diverse sequences suitable for library generation, where the frequency of binding site usage across the returned sequences can be controlled by modulating the objective function. As an example, we then show how adding additional constraints, like the inclusion of sequence elements with fixed positions, allows for the design of bacterial promoters. The nucleotide string packing approach we present can accelerate the design of sequences with complex DNA-protein interactions. When used in combination with synthesis and high-throughput screening, this design strategy could help interrogate how complex binding site arrangements impact either gene expression or biomolecular mechanisms in varied cellular contexts.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012273">A low-dimensional approximation of optimal confidence</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pierre Le Denmat, Tom Verguts, Kobe Desender</p>

Human decision making is accompanied by a sense of confidence. According to Bayesian decision theory, confidence reflects the learned probability of making a correct response, given available data (e.g., accumulated stimulus evidence and response time). Although optimal, independently learning these probabilities for all possible data combinations is computationally intractable. Here, we describe a novel model of confidence implementing a low-dimensional approximation of this optimal yet intractable solution. This model allows efficient estimation of confidence, while at the same time accounting for idiosyncrasies, different kinds of biases and deviation from the optimal probability correct. Our model dissociates confidence biases resulting from the estimate of the reliability of evidence by individuals (captured by parameter α), from confidence biases resulting from general stimulus independent under and overconfidence (captured by parameter β). We provide empirical evidence that this model accurately fits both choice data (accuracy, response time) and trial-by-trial confidence ratings simultaneously. Finally, we test and empirically validate two novel predictions of the model, namely that 1) changes in confidence can be independent of performance and 2) selectively manipulating each parameter of our model leads to distinct patterns of confidence judgments. As a tractable and flexible account of the computation of confidence, our model offers a clear framework to interpret and further resolve different forms of confidence biases.

                <p>by Wentao Li, Han Chen, Xiaoqian Jiang, Arif Harmanci</p>

Increasing genetic and phenotypic data size is critical for understanding the genetic determinants of diseases. Evidently, establishing practical means for collaboration and data sharing among institutions is a fundamental methodological barrier for performing high-powered studies. As the sample sizes become more heterogeneous, complex statistical approaches, such as generalized linear mixed effects models, must be used to correct for the confounders that may bias results. On another front, due to the privacy concerns around Protected Health Information (PHI), genetic information is restrictively protected by sharing according to regulations such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This limits data sharing among institutions and hampers efforts around executing high-powered collaborative studies. Federated approaches are promising to alleviate the issues around privacy and performance, since sensitive data never leaves the local sites. Motivated by these, we developed FedGMMAT, a federated genetic association testing tool that utilizes a federated statistical testing approach for efficient association tests that can correct for confounding fixed and additive polygenic random effects among different collaborating sites. Genetic data is never shared among collaborating sites, and the intermediate statistics are protected by encryption. Using simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate FedGMMAT can achieve the virtually same results as pooled analysis under a privacy-preserving framework with practical resource requirements.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002547">Wnt signaling modulates the response to DNA damage in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc by regulating the EGFR pathway</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ben Ewen-Campen, Norbert Perrimon</p>

Despite the deep conservation of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, cells in different contexts vary widely in their susceptibility to DNA damage and their propensity to undergo apoptosis as a result of genomic lesions. One of the cell signaling pathways implicated in modulating the DDR is the highly conserved Wnt pathway, which is known to promote resistance to DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation in a variety of human cancers. However, the mechanisms linking Wnt signal transduction to the DDR remain unclear. Here, we use a genetically encoded system in <i>Drosophila</i> to reliably induce consistent levels of DNA damage in vivo, and demonstrate that canonical Wnt signaling in the wing imaginal disc buffers cells against apoptosis in the face of DNA double-strand breaks. We show that Wg, the primary Wnt ligand in <i>Drosophila</i>, activates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling via the ligand-processing protease Rhomboid, which, in turn, modulates the DDR in a <i>Chk2</i>-, <i>p53</i>-, and <i>E2F1-</i>dependent manner. These studies provide mechanistic insight into the modulation of the DDR by the Wnt and EGFR pathways in vivo in a highly proliferative tissue. Furthermore, they reveal how the growth and patterning functions of Wnt signaling are coupled with prosurvival, antiapoptotic activities, thereby facilitating developmental robustness in the face of genomic damage.

                Background Variables such as dietary intake are measured with error yet frequently used in observational epidemiology. Although this limitation is sometimes noted, these variables are still often modeled as covariates without formal correction or sincere dialogue about measurement unreliability potentially weakening the validity of statistical conclusions. Further, larger sample sizes increase power (bias) to detect spurious correlations. Counterintuitively, recent work suggested a non-monotonic relationship between confounder unreliability and how much controlling for the confounder reduces (or induces) bias when testing for an exposure-outcome association. If true, such non-monotonicity would be especially concerning for applications such as nutrition, where measurement reliability varies substantially, and large sample sizes are common. Methods We offer a detailed derivations of the square partial correlation between the outcome and exposure, controlling for the confounder. In our derivation, the measurement reliabilities of exposures and confounders are not arbitrarily constrained to be equal. Further, our theoretical results are investigated using simulations. Results Reassuringly, these derivations and simulations show that the counterintuitive non-monotonicity relationship between confounder unreliability and how much controlling for the confounder reduces (or induces) bias when testing for an exposure-outcome association is an artifact of the arbitrary constraint which forces the measurement reliabilities of exposures and confounders to be equal, which that does not always hold. Conclusions The profound and manifold effects of measurement error on estimation and statistical conclusion validity in realistic scenarios indicate that merely mentioning measurement error as a limitation and then dispensing with it is not an adequate response. We also explore questions for optimal study design subject to resource constraints when considering reliability of exposures, covariates, and outcomes.

                Exposure to outdoor air pollution has been linked to adverse health effects, including potential widespread impacts on the CNS. Ongoing brain development may render children and adolescents especially vulnerable to neurotoxic effects of air pollution. While mechanisms remain unclear, promising advances in human neuroimaging can help elucidate both sensitive periods and neurobiological consequences of exposure to air pollution. Herein we review the potential influences of air pollution exposure on neurodevelopment, drawing from animal toxicology and human neuroimaging studies. Due to ongoing cellular and system-level changes during childhood and adolescence, the developing brain may be more sensitive to pollutants’ neurotoxic effects, as a function of both timing and duration, with relevance to cognition and mental health. Building on these foundations, the emerging field of environmental neuroscience is poised to further decipher which air toxicants are most harmful and to whom.

                Intellectual disability is defined as limitations in cognitive and adaptive behavior that often arise during development. Disordered sleep is common in intellectual disability and, given the importance of sleep for cognitive function, it may contribute to other behavioral phenotypes. Animal models of intellectual disability, in particular of monogenic intellectual disability syndromes (MIDS), recapitulate many disease phenotypes and have been invaluable for linking some of these phenotypes to specific molecular pathways. An emerging feature of MIDS, in both animal models and humans, is the prevalence of metabolic abnormalities, which could be relevant for behavior. Focusing on specific MIDS that have been molecularly characterized, we review sleep, circadian, and metabolic phenotypes in animal models and humans and propose that altered metabolic state contributes to the abnormal sleep/circadian phenotypes in MIDS.

                Zhang et al. illustrate IBSP elevation in lung adenocarcinoma bone metastasis. IBSP potentiates murine lung cancer cell bone metastasis depending on macrophage differentiation. Mechanistically, IBSP induces a forward shift of macrophage-to-osteoclast differentiation, leading to early osteolysis. Inhibition of RAC1 reduces the incidence of bone metastasis and ameliorates bone destruction.

Loss of KDM5C leads to increased IRF-driven inflammatory gene expression at steady state, resulting in diminished type I IFN production and antigen presentation when stimulated.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95328">Targeting plasmid-encoded proteins that contain immunoglobulin-like domains to combat antimicrobial resistance</a></h4>

              
                Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant threat to human health. Although vaccines have been developed to combat AMR, it has proven challenging to associate specific vaccine antigens with AMR. Bacterial plasmids play a crucial role in the transmission of AMR. Our recent research has identified a group of bacterial plasmids (specifically, IncHI plasmids) that encode large molecular mass proteins containing bacterial immunoglobulin-like domains. These proteins are found on the external surface of the bacterial cells, such as in the flagella or conjugative pili. In this study, we show that these proteins are antigenic and can protect mice from infection caused by an AMR <i>Salmonella</i> strain harboring one of these plasmids. Furthermore, we successfully generated nanobodies targeting these proteins, that were shown to interfere with the conjugative transfer of IncHI plasmids. Considering that these proteins are also encoded in other groups of plasmids, such as IncA/C and IncP2, targeting them could be a valuable strategy in combating AMR infections caused by bacteria harboring different groups of AMR plasmids. Since the selected antigens are directly linked to AMR itself, the protective effect extends beyond specific microorganisms to include all those carrying the corresponding resistance plasmids.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93158">Shared structure facilitates working memory of multiple sequences</a></h4>

              
                Daily experiences often involve the processing of multiple sequences, yet storing them challenges the limited capacity of working memory (WM). To achieve efficient memory storage, relational structures shared by sequences would be leveraged to reorganize and compress information. Here, participants memorized a sequence of items with different colors and spatial locations and later reproduced the full color and location sequences one after another. Crucially, we manipulated the consistency between location and color sequence trajectories. First, sequences with consistent trajectories demonstrate improved memory performance and a trajectory correlation between reproduced color and location sequences. Second, sequences with consistent trajectories show neural reactivation of common trajectories, and display spontaneous replay of color sequences when recalling locations. Finally, neural reactivation correlates with WM behavior. Our findings suggest that a shared common structure is leveraged for the storage of multiple sequences through compressed encoding and neural replay, together facilitating efficient information organization in WM.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88929">Glycan-shielded homodimer structure and dynamical features of the canine distemper virus hemagglutinin relevant for viral entry and efficient vaccination</a></h4>

              
                Canine distemper virus (CDV) belongs to morbillivirus, including measles virus (MeV) and rinderpest virus, which causes serious immunological and neurological disorders in carnivores, including dogs and rhesus monkeys, as recently reported, but their vaccines are highly effective. The attachment glycoprotein hemagglutinin (CDV-H) at the CDV surface utilizes signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) and Nectin-4 (also called poliovirus-receptor-like-4; PVRL4) as entry receptors. Although fusion models have been proposed, the molecular mechanism of morbillivirus fusion entry is poorly understood. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the globular head domain of CDV-H vaccine strain at 3.2 Å resolution, revealing that CDV-H exhibits a highly tilted homodimeric form with a six-bladed β-propeller fold. While the predicted Nectin-4-binding site is well conserved with that of MeV-H, that of SLAM is similar but partially different, which is expected to contribute to host specificity. Five <i>N</i>-linked sugars covered a broad area of the CDV-H surface to expose receptor-binding sites only, supporting the effective production of neutralizing antibodies. These features are common to MeV-H, although the glycosylation sites are completely different. Furthermore, real-time observation using high-speed atomic force microscopy revealed highly mobile features of the CDV-H dimeric head via the connector region. These results suggest that sugar-shielded tilted homodimeric structure and dynamic conformational changes are common characteristics of morbilliviruses and ensure effective fusion entry and vaccination.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88573">YAP/TAZ enhances P-body formation to promote tumorigenesis</a></h4>

              
                The role of processing bodies (P-bodies) in tumorigenesis and tumor progression is not well understood. Here, we showed that the oncogenes YAP/TAZ promote P-body formation in a series of cancer cell lines. Mechanistically, both transcriptional activation of the P-body-related genes <i>SAMD4A, AJUBA</i>, and <i>WTIP</i> and transcriptional suppression of the tumor suppressor gene <i>PNRC1</i> are involved in enhancing the effects of YAP/TAZ on P-body formation in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. By reexpression of PNRC1 or knockdown of P-body core genes (<i>DDX6, DCP1A,</i> and <i>LSM14A</i>), we determined that disruption of P-bodies attenuates cell proliferation, cell migration, and tumor growth induced by overexpression of YAP<sup>5SA</sup> in CRC. Analysis of a pancancer CRISPR screen database (DepMap) revealed co-dependencies between YAP/TEAD and the P-body core genes and correlations between the mRNA levels of <i>SAMD4A, AJUBA, WTIP, PNRC1,</i> and YAP target genes. Our study suggests that the P-body is a new downstream effector of YAP/TAZ, which implies that reexpression of PNRC1 or disruption of P-bodies is a potential therapeutic strategy for tumors with active YAP.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97289">Presynaptic Rac1 in the hippocampus selectively regulates working memory</a></h4>

              
                One of the most extensively studied members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, Rac1 is an intracellular signal transducer that remodels actin and phosphorylation signaling networks. Previous studies have shown that Rac1-mediated signaling is associated with hippocampal-dependent working memory and longer-term forms of learning and memory and that Rac1 can modulate forms of both pre- and postsynaptic plasticity. How these different cognitive functions and forms of plasticity mediated by Rac1 are linked, however, is unclear. Here, we show that spatial working memory in mice is selectively impaired following the expression of a genetically encoded Rac1 inhibitor at presynaptic terminals, while longer-term cognitive processes are affected by Rac1 inhibition at postsynaptic sites. To investigate the regulatory mechanisms of this presynaptic process, we leveraged new advances in mass spectrometry to identify the proteomic and post-translational landscape of presynaptic Rac1 signaling. We identified serine/threonine kinases and phosphorylated cytoskeletal signaling and synaptic vesicle proteins enriched with active Rac1. The phosphorylated sites in these proteins are at positions likely to have regulatory effects on synaptic vesicles. Consistent with this, we also report changes in the distribution and morphology of synaptic vesicles and in postsynaptic ultrastructure following presynaptic Rac1 inhibition. Overall, this study reveals a previously unrecognized presynaptic role of Rac1 signaling in cognitive processes and provides insights into its potential regulatory mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93509">Sex differences in discrimination behavior and orbitofrontal engagement during context-gated reward prediction</a></h4>

              
                Animals, including humans, rely on contextual information to interpret ambiguous stimuli. Impaired context processing is a hallmark of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and addiction. While sex differences in the prevalence and manifestations of these disorders are well established, potential sex differences in context processing remain uncertain. Here, we examined sex differences in the contextual control over cue-evoked reward seeking and its neural correlates, in rats. Male and female rats were trained in a bidirectional occasion-setting preparation in which the validity of two auditory reward-predictive cues was informed by the presence, or absence, of a visual contextual feature (LIGHT: X+/DARK: X−/LIGHT: Y−/DARK: Y+). Females were significantly slower to acquire contextual control over cue-evoked reward seeking. However, once established, the contextual control over behavior was more robust in female rats; it showed less within-session variability (less influence of prior reward) and greater resistance to acute stress. This superior contextual control achieved by females was accompanied by an increased activation of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) compared to males. Critically, these behavioral and neural sex differences were specific to the contextual modulation process and not observed in simple, context-independent, reward prediction tasks. These results indicate a sex-biased trade-off between the speed of acquisition and the robustness of performance in the contextual modulation of cued reward seeking. The different distribution of sexes along the fast learning ↔ steady performance continuum might reflect different levels of engagement of the OFC, and might have implications for our understanding of sex differences in psychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91072">Single-molecule analysis reveals the phosphorylation of FLS2 governs its spatiotemporal dynamics and immunity</a></h4>

              
                The <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> FLAGELLIN-SENSITIVE2 (FLS2), a typical receptor kinase, recognizes the conserved 22 amino acid sequence in the N-terminal region of flagellin (flg22) to initiate plant defense pathways, which was intensively studied in the past decades. However, the dynamic regulation of FLS2 phosphorylation at the plasma membrane after flg22 recognition needs further elucidation. Through single-particle tracking, we demonstrated that upon flg22 treatment the phosphorylation of Ser-938 in FLS2 impacts its spatiotemporal dynamics and lifetime. Following Förster resonance energy transfer-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and protein proximity indexes assays revealed that flg22 treatment increased the co-localization of GFP-tagged FLS2/FLS2<sup>S938D</sup> but not FLS2<sup>S938A</sup> with AtRem1.3-mCherry, a sterol-rich lipid marker, indicating that the phosphorylation of FLS2<sup>S938</sup> affects FLS2 sorting efficiency to <i>At</i>Rem1.3-associated nanodomains. Importantly, we found that the phosphorylation of Ser-938 enhanced flg22-induced FLS2 internalization and immune responses, demonstrating that the phosphorylation may activate flg22-triggered immunity through partitioning FLS2 into functional <i>At</i>Rem1.3-associated nanodomains, which fills the gap between the FLS2<sup>S938</sup> phosphorylation and FLS2-mediated immunity.

While the theoretical benefits of predator camouflage are well established, no study has yet been able to quantify its consequences for hunting success in natural conditions. We used high-resolution movement data to quantify how barn owls (<i>Tyto alba</i>) conceal their approach when using a sit-and-wait strategy. We hypothesized that hunting barn owls would modulate their landing force, potentially reducing noise levels in the vicinity of prey. Analysing 87,957 landings by 163 individuals equipped with GPS tags and accelerometers, we show that barn owls reduce their landing force as they approach their prey, and that landing force predicts the success of the following hunting attempt. Landing force also varied with the substrate, being lowest on man-made poles in field boundaries. The physical environment, therefore, affects the capacity for sound camouflage, providing an unexpected link between predator-prey interactions and land use. Finally, hunting strike forces in barn owls were the highest recorded in any bird, relative to body mass, highlighting the range of selective pressures that act on landings and the capacity of these predators to modulate their landing force. Overall, our results provide the first measurements of landing force in a wild setting, revealing a new form of motion-induced sound camouflage and its link to hunting success.

">Motor Cortical Neuronal Hyperexcitability Associated with α-Synuclein Aggregation</a></h4>

              
                Dysfunction of the cerebral cortex is thought to underlie motor and cognitive impairments in Parkinsons disease (PD). While cortical function is known to be suppressed by abnormal basal ganglia output following dopaminergic degeneration, it remains to be determined how the deposition of Lewy pathology disrupts cortical circuit integrity and function. Moreover, it is also unknown whether cortical Lewy pathology and midbrain dopaminergic degeneration interact to disrupt cortical function in late-stage. To begin to address these questions, we injected -synuclein (Syn) preformed fibrils (PFFs) into the dorsolateral striatum of mice to seed Syn pathology in the cortical cortex and induce degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Using this model system, we reported that Syn aggregates accumulate in the motor cortex in a layer- and cell-subtype-specific pattern. Particularly, intratelencephalic neurons (ITNs) showed earlier accumulation and greater extent of Syn aggregates relative to corticospinal neurons (CSNs). Moreover, we demonstrated that the intrinsic excitability and inputs resistance of Syn aggregates-bearing ITNs in the secondary motor cortex (M2) are increased, along with a noticeable shrinkage of cell bodies and loss of dendritic spines. Last, neither the intrinsic excitability of CSNs nor their thalamocortical input was altered by a partial striatal dopamine depletion associated with Syn pathology. Our results documented motor cortical neuronal hyperexcitability associated with Syn aggregation and provided a novel mechanistic understanding of cortical circuit dysfunction in PD.

">Satellite glial contact enhances differentiation and maturation of human induced sensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Induced sensory neurons (iSNs) generated from pluripotent stem cells are used to model human peripheral neuropathies, however current differentiation protocols produce sensory neurons with an embryonic phenotype. Peripheral glial cells contact sensory neurons early in development and contribute to formation of the canonical pseudounipolar morphology, but these signals are not encompassed in current iSN differentiation protocols. Here, we show that terminal differentiation of iSNs in co-culture with rodent Dorsal Root Ganglion satellite glia (rSG) advances their differentiation and maturation. Co-cultured iSNs develop a pseudounipolar morphology through contact with rSGs. This transition depends on semaphorin-plexin guidance cues and on glial gap junction signaling. In addition to morphological changes, iSNs terminally differentiated in co-culture exhibit enhanced spontaneous action potential firing, more mature gene expression, and increased susceptibility to paclitaxel induced axonal degeneration. Thus, iSNs differentiated in coculture with rSGs provide a better model for investigating human peripheral neuropathies.

">Aberration correction in long GRIN lens-based microendoscopes for extended field-of-view two-photon imaging in deep brain regions</a></h4>

              
                Two-photon (2P) fluorescence imaging through gradient index (GRIN) lens-based endoscopes is fundamental to investigate the functional properties of neural populations in deep brain circuits. However, GRIN lenses have intrinsic optical aberrations, which severely degrade their imaging performance. GRIN aberrations decrease the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution of fluorescence signals, especially in lateral portions of the field-of-view (FOV), leading to restricted FOV and smaller number of recorded neurons. This is especially relevant for GRIN lenses of several millimeters in length, which are needed to reach the deeper regions of the rodent brain. We have previously demonstrated a novel method to enlarge the FOV and improve the spatial resolution of two-photon microendoscopes based on GRIN lenses of length < 4.1 mm (Antonini et al. eLife 2020). However, previously developed microendoscopes were too short to reach the most ventral regions of the mouse brain. In this study, we combined optical simulations with fabrication of aspherical polymer microlenses through three-dimensional (3D) microprinting to correct for optical aberrations in long (length > 6 mm) GRIN lens-based microendoscopes (diameter, 500 {micro}m). Long corrected microendoscopes had improved spatial resolution, enabling imaging in significantly enlarged FOVs. Moreover, using synthetic calcium data we showed that aberration correction enabled detection of cells with higher SNR of fluorescent signals and decreased cross-contamination between neurons. Finally, we applied long corrected microendoscopes to perform large-scale and high precision recordings of calcium signals in populations of neurons in the olfactory cortex, a brain region laying approximately 5 mm from the brain surface, of awake head-tethered mice. Long corrected microendoscopes are powerful new tools enabling population imaging with unprecedented large FOV and high spatial resolution in the most ventral regions of the mouse brain.

">Presymptomatic Targeted Circuit Manipulation for Ameliorating Huntington's Disease Pathogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Early stages of Huntington's disease (HD) before the onset of motor and cognitive symptoms are characterized by imbalanced excitatory and inhibitory output from the cortex to striatal and subcortical structures. The window before the onset of symptoms presents an opportunity to adjust the firing rate within microcircuits with the goal of restoring the impaired E/I balance, thereby preventing or slowing down disease progression. Here, we investigated the effect of presymptomatic cell-type specific manipulation of activity of pyramidal neurons and parvalbumin interneurons in the M1 motor cortex on disease progression in the R6/2 HD mouse model. Our results show that dampening excitation of Emx1 pyramidal neurons or increasing activity of parvalbumin interneurons once daily for 3 weeks during the pre-symptomatic phase alleviated HD-related motor coordination dysfunction. Cell-type-specific modulation to normalize the net output of the cortex is a potential therapeutic avenue for HD and other neurodegenerative disorders.

">CD2AP is Co-Expressed with Tropomyosin-Related Kinase A and Ras-Related Protein Rab-5A in Cholinergic Neurons of the Murine Basal Forebrain</a></h4>

              
                Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons project to the hippocampus and cortex, are critical for learning and memory, and are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). GWAS have consistently shown that genomic variants at the CD2AP gene locus are associated with significant increased risk of AD. GWAS studies have also shown that genetic variants in endocytosis genes, including RAB5A, significantly increase susceptibility to AD. Previous work in our lab has shown that CD2AP functions as a docking-scaffold/adaptor protein as a coordinator of nerve growth factor (NGF) and trophic signaling in neurons. We have also demonstrated that CD2AP positively regulates Rab5-mediated mechanisms of endocytosis in primary sensory neurons. The purpose of this study was to perform an in vivo characterization of CD2AP expression in cholinergic neurons of the brain regions most relevant to AD pathogenesis and to investigate the colocalization of CD2AP and Rab5 in cholinergic neurons of the murine basal forebrain. Brain tissue was perfused, harvested from ChATBAC-eGFP transgenic mice (N=4 male, N=4 female; aged 10 mo), where cholinergic neurons (co-) express green fluorescence protein (GFP) in central and peripheral neurons that express choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Frozen tissue sections were used to assess the specificity of the reporter in mouse brain along with localization of both CD2AP and Rab5 (co-) expression using immunofluorescence (IF) analysis of ChAT-GFP+ neurons and primary antibodies against ChAT, CD2AP and Rab5. Image J software was used to develop and optimize a colocalization assay for CD2AP and Rab5 puncta. Experiments were repeated in a follow-up cohort of aged-adult mice (N=2 male, N=2 female; aged 18 mo). IF expression of CD2AP was quantified in the basal forebrain, diagonal band of Broca (vDB), and striatal regions and compared to results from the cortical regions of the adult mouse brain. Colocalization of CD2AP was observed in the cell bodies of ChAT-GFP+ neurons of the striatum, vDB and basal forebrain regions, where CD2AP expression intensity as well as the number of cell bodies with positive signal increased incrementally. Colocalization analyses revealed near-complete overlap of CD2AP and Rab5 expression in ChAT-GFP+ cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain region. We conclude that cholinergic neurons express CD2AP in healthy adult and aged-adult mouse brains. These data provide the first evidence of quantifiable CD2AP protein expression of cholinergic neurons specific to the diagonal band of Broca (vDB) and basal forebrain. Together with previous research from our lab, these data support a role for CD2AP in the pathogenesis of AD through orchestration of endocytosis and retrograde signaling. Ongoing studies are underway to verify these findings in a novel AD mouse model that incorporates the humanized variant of CD2AP, created by MODEL-AD, where we aim to further investigate how CD2AP variants may affect mechanistic components of Rab5 endocytosis as well as subsequent survival of cholinergic neurons in the context of known amyloid beta and Tau pathologies.

">Overlapping Cortical Substrate of Biomechanical Control and Subjective Agency</a></h4>

              
                Every movement requires the nervous system to solve a complex biomechanical control problem, but this process is mostly veiled from one's conscious awareness. Simultaneously, we also have conscious experience of controlling our movements - our sense of agency (SoA). Whether SoA corresponds to those neural representations that implement actual neuromuscular control is an open question with ethical, medical, and legal implications. If SoA is the conscious experience of control, this predicts that SoA can be decoded from the same brain structures that implement the so-called "inverse kinematic" computations for planning movement. We correlated human fMRI measurements during hand movements with the internal representations of a deep neural network (DNN) performing the same hand control task in a biomechanical simulation - revealing detailed cortical encodings of sensorimotor states, idiosyncratic to each subject. We then manipulated SoA by usurping control of participants' muscles via electrical stimulation, and found that the same voxels which were best explained by modeled inverse kinematic representations - which, strikingly, were located in canonically visual areas - also predicted SoA. Importantly, model-brain correspondences and robust SoA decoding could both be achieved within single subjects, enabling relationships between motor representations and awareness to be studied at the level of the individual.

                The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system has been implicated in pair bond formation. However, involvements of DA release, real time activities, and electrophysiological activities of D1/D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell in pair bonding remain unclear. This work verified that male mandarin voles after pair bonding released higher levels of DA in the NAc shell and displayed higher levels of D1 MSNs activity and lower levels of D2 MSNs activity upon sniffing their partners compared to upon sniffing an unknown female. Moreover, pair bonding induced differential alterations in both synaptic plasticity and neuronal intrinsic excitability in both D1 MSNs and D2 MSNs. In addition, chemogenetic inhibition (activation) of ventral pallidum-projecting D2 MSNs in the NAc shell enhanced (inhibited) pair bond formation, respectively. These findings suggest that different neuronal activity of NAc shell D1 MSNs / D2 MSNs regulated by increasing DA release after pair bonding may be a neurobiological mechanism underlying pair bond formation.

">Neural correlates of phonetic categorization under auditory (phoneme) and visual (grapheme) modalities</a></h4>

              
                We tested whether the neural mechanisms of phonetic categorization are specific to speech sounds or generalize to graphemes (i.e., visual letters) of the same phonetic label. Given that linguistic experience shapes categorical processing, and letter-speech sound matching plays a crucial role during early reading acquisition, we hypothesized sound phoneme and visual grapheme tokens representing the same linguistic identity might recruit common neural substrates, despite originating from different sensory modalities. Behavioral and neuroelectric brain responses (ERPs) were acquired as participants categorized stimuli from sound (phoneme) and homologous letter (grapheme) continua each spanning a /da/ - /ga/ gradient. Behaviorally, listeners were faster and showed stronger categorization of phoneme compared to graphemes. At the neural level, multidimensional scaling of the EEG revealed responses self-organized in a categorial fashion such that tokens clustered within their respective modality beginning ~150-250 ms after stimulus onset. Source-resolved ERPs further revealed modality-specific and overlapping brain regions supporting phonetic categorization. Left inferior frontal gyrus and auditory cortex showed stronger responses for sound category members compared to phonetically ambiguous tokens, whereas early visual cortices paralleled this categorical organization for graphemes. Auditory and visual categorization also recruited common visual association areas in extrastriate cortex but in opposite hemispheres (auditory = left; visual=right). Our findings reveal both auditory and visual sensory cortex supports categorical organization for phonetic labels within their respective modalities. However, a partial overlap in phoneme and grapheme processing among occipital brain areas implies the presence of an isomorphic, domain-general mapping for phonetic categories in dorsal visual system.

">Longevity or Well-being? A Dual-Dimension Structure of Neuroticism</a></h4>

              
                The development of personality traits is often viewed as evolutionarily adaptive. Current neuroticism research, however, predominantly highlights its negative health impacts, neglecting its potential evolutionary advantages. We propose that neuroticism's inter-individual variability can be structured into two distinct geometric dimensions. One, named the Emotional Reactivity-Instability/Distress Spectrum (ERIS), correlates strongly with longevity and is associated with chronic diseases and risk-averse lifestyle. This dimension is underpinned by evolutionarily conserved subcortical brain regions and genes. The other, resembling the overall neuroticism score, is primarily linked to mental and stress-related disorders, as well as life satisfaction. It involves higher-order emotional brain regions and is genetically enriched in human-accelerated regions. Collectively, these dimensions represent a dual-strategy personality framework that optimizes survival and well-being, with the former being evolutionarily conservative and the latter potentially an unique human adaptation.

Through a stochastic study, we found a series of strong correlations between the intervals of tonically firing spikes with the existence of spike frequency adaptation generated by injecting constant currents of varying intensities into layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the ferret medial prefrontal cortex. Based on this, we derived a relationship formula for the interspike intervals (ISIs). According to this formula, an ISI can be expressed as a product of the first ISI and a mathematical sequence that factorials the history of all previous ISIs. When this formula was applied to individual neurons, the sequence part exhibited minimal variation in value against the intensity of stimulation and was similar across injected current intensities, serving as a precursor to timing which is related to spike number rather than time after stimulation. In contrast, the first ISI decreased negative logarithmically with the intensity of injected current, acting as a scale factor. Finally, we successfully predicted the timing of spike occurrences based on the characteristics of this sequence formula and replicated spike train generated by strong stimulation using partial information from spike trains generated by weak stimuli.

">Neuron-specific partial reprogramming in the dentate gyrus impacts mouse behavior and ameliorates age-related decline in memory and learning.</a></h4>

              
                Age-associated neurodegenerative disorders represent significant challenges due to progressive neuronal decline and limited treatments. In aged mice, partial reprogramming, characterized by pulsed expression of reprogramming factors, has shown promise in improving function in various tissues, but its impact on the aging brain remains poorly understood. Here we investigated the impact of in vivo partial reprogramming on mature neurons in the dentate gyrus of young and aged mice. Using two different approaches: a neuron-specific transgenic reprogrammable mouse model and neuron-specific targeted lentiviral delivery of OSKM reprogramming factors, we demonstrated that in vivo partial reprogramming of mature neurons in the dentate gyrus, a neurogenic niche in the adult mouse brain, can influence animal behavior, and ameliorate age-related decline in memory and learning. These findings underscore the potential of in vivo partial reprogramming as an important therapeutic intervention to rejuvenate the neurogenic niche and ameliorate cognitive decline associated with aging or neurodegeneration.

">Effects of working memory training on cognitive flexibility, dendritic spine density and long-term potentiation in female mice</a></h4>

              
                Working memory (WM) is a cognitive function that refers to the ability of short-term storage and manipulation of information necessary for the accomplishment of a task. Two brain regions involved in WM are the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HPC). Several studies have suggested that training in WM (WMT) can improve performance in other cognitive tasks. However, our understanding of the neurobiological changes induced by WMT is very limited. Previous work from our lab has shown that WMT enhances synaptic and structural plasticity in the PFC and HPC in male mice. In this study, we investigate the effect of WMT on cognitive flexibility and synaptic properties in PFC and HPC in adult female mice. To this end, female adult mice were split into 3 groups: a) naive which remained in their home cage, b) non-adaptive which learned to alternate the arms in the T-maze but without any delays and c) adaptive which were trained in the delayed alternation task for 9 days. The delayed alternation task was used for WMT. In one cohort, following the delayed alternation task, all mice were tested in the attention set-shifting (AST) task in order to measure cognitive flexibility, and then, the brains were harvested for Golgi-Cox staining to study dendritic spine density. Our results showed that in female mice, there were no differences in performance in the AST among the three groups tested, however, the latency to make a choice was reduced. With regards to dendritic spine density, no significant differences were identified in PFC while increased dendritic spine density was found in the hippocampus of the adaptive group, compared to the naive group. In a second cohort, acute brain slices were prepared following the delayed alternation task to investigate the synaptic properties in the PFC and the HPC. Evoked field excitatory post-synaptic potential (fEPSP) recordings were performed in either PFC or HPC brain slices. Our results show that tetanic-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the PFC was not different among the three training groups. In the HPC, theta-burst induced LTP was significantly increased in the adaptive group also compared to the other two groups. These results reveal both similarities and differences of WMT on cognitive flexibility, dendritic spine density and LTP in females, compared to males.

">Differentiation of Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis from Multiple Sclerosis Using a Novel Brain Lesion Segmentation and Classification Pipeline</a></h4>

              
                Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting the central nervous system, while Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a sudden, often monophasic inflammatory condition of the brain and spinal cord. Only 17% of ADEM cases are correctly diagnosed on the first visit due to overlapping clinical and radiological presentations with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) [1]. Both ADEM and MS are demyelinating diseases, meaning they cause brain lesions by damaging the myelin sheath, leading to scar tissue that disrupts nerve signals [2]. Previous machine learning pipelines have differentiated Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) (a different demyelinating disease) from MS and ADEM from NMOSD based on MRI imagery with varying accuracies [3, 4]. Our novel Classifier for Demyelinating Disease (CDD) pipeline is the first to differentiate ADEM from MS using MRI imagery. It does this in two stages: a segmentation stage which creates segmentation masks of the lesions and a classification stage to classify them as either ADEM or MS. Additionally, we introduce a novel ADEM dataset from open-access medical case reports. The CDD pipeline achieves an accuracy of 90.0% on our validation dataset, making it a potentially viable diagnostic tool in the future. All data and code is available here. 2

">A comprehensive chemotyping and gonadal regulation of seven kisspeptinergic neuronal populations in the mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Herein, we present a systematic analysis, using dual and multiplex RNAscope methods, of seven kisspeptinergic neuronal populations, based on their chemotyping and distribution throughout the mouse brain. The co-expression of mRNAs coding for neuropeptides, for excitatory and inhibitory transmitter biosynthetic enzymes, and for sex steroid receptors are described in four hypothalamic and three extra-hypothalamic nuclei. These include a newly characterized kisspeptin-expressing ventral premammillary nucleus cell group co-expressing vesicular glutamate transporter 2, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide and neurotensin mRNAs. Kisspeptin mRNA (Kiss1) was observed within both somatic and dendritic compartments at a single-cell level in two hypothalamic sites, a prominent and previously undescribed feature of kisspeptin neurons in these two cell groups. Patterns of altered Kiss1 expression following gonadectomy among these seven KP populations suggest that androgen receptor signaling may also play a previously unremarked role in gonadal feedback regulation of kisspeptinergic neuronal function. Data from this study provide a chemoanatomical basis for hypothesis generation regarding the functional diversity of kisspeptinergic signaling in hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic brain.

">Lack of Single Amino Acids Transcriptionally Remodels Sensory Systems to Enhance the Intake of Protein and Microbiota</a></h4>

              
                Adequate intake of dietary essential amino acids (eAAs) is vital for protein synthesis and metabolism. Any single eAA deprivation is sufficient to increase protein intake in Drosophila melanogaster. How such nutritional -needs- are transformed into behavioral -wants- remains poorly understood. We derived transcriptomes from the heads of flies deprived of individual eAAs to identify mechanisms by which this is achieved. We found that, while specific eAA deprivations have unique effects on gene expression, a large set of changes are shared across deprivations. We show that Or92a upregulation upon eAA deprivation increases the exploitation of yeast, the main protein source of flies. Furthermore, Ir76a upregulation was crucial for feeding on Lactobacillus, a gut bacterium that ameliorates the fitness of eAA-deprived flies. Our work uncovers common and unique transcriptional changes induced by individual eAA deprivations in an animal and reveals novel mechanisms underlying the organisms behavioral and physiological response to eAA challenges.

">Distinct subcircuits within the mesolimbic dopamine system encode the salience and valence of social stimuli</a></h4>

              
                The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system (MDS) is the canonical reward pathway that has been studied extensively in the context of the rewarding properties of sex, food, and drugs of abuse. In contrast, very little is known about the role of the MDS in the processing of the rewarding and aversive properties of social stimuli. Social interactions can be characterized by their salience (i.e., importance) and their rewarding or aversive properties (i.e., valence). Here, we test the novel hypothesis that projections from the medial ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core codes for the salience of social stimuli through the phasic release of DA in response to both rewarding and aversive social stimuli. In contrast, we hypothesize that projections from the lateral VTA to the NAc shell codes for the rewarding properties of social stimuli by increasing the tonic release of DA and the aversive properties of social stimuli by reducing the tonic release of DA. Using DA amperometry, which monitors DA signaling with a high degree of temporal and anatomical resolution, we measured DA signaling in the NAc core or shell while rewarding and aversive social interactions were taking place. These findings, as well as additional anatomical and functional studies, provide strong support for the proposed neural circuitry underlying the response of the MDS to social stimuli. Together, these data provide a novel conceptualization of how the functional and anatomical heterogeneity within the MDS detect and distinguish between social salience, social reward, and social aversion.

">Proprioception Impacts Body Perception in Healthy Aging: Insights from a Psychophysical and Computational Approach</a></h4>

              
                The experience of owning a body (body ownership, BO) and the perception of our body dimensions (metric body representation, mBR) depend on the integration of multisensory cues. As the human sensory system is subjected to a decline along the lifespan, encompassing all sensory modalities, we hypothesize that body perception may be different in older, as compared to young adults. Here, we investigate this hypothesis by comparing the multisensory processing underlying BO and mBR in healthy older (> 65 years) and young individuals. First, we applied rigorous computational and psychophysical methods to assess alterations in mBR and BO quantitatively. We then modeled the manifold relationship between the observed body misperceptions and the potential underlying sensory, motor, and cognitive factors. The results highlight significant differences between the two groups, with higher distortions in perceived arm dimensions and an increased tendency to experience ownership towards a virtual hand in the aged group. These differences in both mBR and BO are explained by the reduced proprioceptive abilities of older adults, suggesting a crucial role of proprioception in driving age-dependent plasticity in body representations. Overall, our modeling and experimental approach provide new perspectives on altered body perception during aging, suggesting that they stem from the physiological proprioceptive decline occurring in older adults, and laying the groundwork to generate prevention and stimulation strategies to restore accurate body perception in aging.

">Impaired experience-dependent inter-areal network connectivity across the visual cortex in Fmr1 KO mice</a></h4>

              
                Fragile X syndrome (FX) is the most prevalent inheritable form of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), characterized by hypersensitivity, difficulty in habituating to new sensory stimuli, and intellectual disability. Individuals with FX often experience visual perception and learning deficits. Visual experience leads to the emergence of the familiarity-evoked theta band oscillations in the primary visual cortex (V1) and the lateromedial area (LM) of mice. These theta oscillations in V1 and LM are synchronized with each other, providing a mechanism of sensory multi-areal binding. However, how this multi-areal binding and the corresponding theta oscillations are altered in FX is not known. Using iDISCO whole brain clearing with light-sheet microscopy, we quantified immediate early gene Fos expression in V1 and LM, identifying deficits in experience-dependent neural activity in FX mice. We performed simultaneous in vivo recordings with silicon probes in V1 and LM of awake mice and channelrhodopsin-2-assisted circuit mapping (CRACM) in acute brain slices to examine the neural activity and strength of long-range synaptic connections between V1 and LM in both wildtype (WT) and Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice, the model of FX, before and after visual experience. Our findings reveal synchronized familiarity-evoked theta oscillations in V1 and LM, the increased strength of V1[-&gt;]LM functional and synaptic connections, which correlated with the corresponding changes of presynaptic short-term plasticity in WT mice. The LM oscillations were attenuated in FX mice and correlated with impaired functional and synaptic connectivity and short-term plasticity in the feedforward (FF) V1[-&gt;]LM and feedback (FB) LM[-&gt;]V1 pathways. Finally, using 4Pi single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) in thick brain tissue, we identified experience-dependent changes in the density and shape of dendritic spines in layer 5 pyramidal cells of WT mice, which correlated with the functional synaptic measurements. Interestingly, there was an increased dendritic spine density and length in naive FX mice that failed to respond to experience. Our study provides the first comprehensive characterization of the role of visual experience in triggering inter-areal neural synchrony and shaping synaptic connectivity in WT and FX mice.

">Multi-omic ADNI CSF and plasma data integration identifies distinct metabolic transitions in disease progression in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Age and APOE allele status are the two greatest risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, with microglial processing, recycling of debris and cholesterol transport emerging as other key genetic determinants from AD GWAS. How risk factors contribute to neuronal loss is an unanswered question. Using the ADNI dataset, we provide evidence for distinct processes driving neurodegeneration in AD across a range of ADAS13 scores binned into quartiles (Q1-4) found in ADNI. In Q1 individuals, we see evidence of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) associated with complement and HDL proteins, independent of tau and hippocampal atrophy rates. In Q2 individuals, we see specific protein/lipid correlation networks that are associated with tau and hippocampal atrophy. Also in Q2, we see variations in enzyme levels (LPA2G7, LPCAT2) that impact phosphatidylcholine availability for cholesterol efflux onto CNS lipoproteins. Low LPA2G7 and high LPCAT are associated with lower disruption of ANLS, while high LPA2G7 and low LPCAT are associated with higher disruption. In Q3 individuals, DHA and plasmalogens appear to be protective of astrogliosis, presumably by decreasing lipid droplet size, and increasing their lipid debris flux capacity. The networks we identify in this analysis provide evidence that progressively elevated cellular cholesterol levels, likely the result of accelerating neuronal and myelin debris, are perturbing homeostatic processes, resulting in disruption of astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS), contributing to lipid droplet formation, and astrogliosis. Existing studies have already identified elevated cellular cholesterol as the driver of increased access of APP to {beta}- and {gamma}-secretase for {beta}-amyloid production in late-onset AD. Importantly, we provide evidence that points to actionable variations in lipids associated with slower disease progression and decreased metabolic disruption and inflammation. We believe this positive feedback loop (neurodegeneration [-&gt;] lipid debris processing [-&gt;] metabolic disruption [-&gt;] neurodegeneration) is a key destabilizing cycle responsible for disease progression in AD, reinforcing the perspective that Alzheimer's is fundamentally a metabolic disease. Our findings are consistent with established lipid risk factor associations. We anticipate the mechanistic insights from our analysis will advance nutritional and pharmacological interventions and slow cognitive decline.

">Examining the Central Auditory Processing Using a Multi-Feature ERP Paradigm to Phonetic, Prosodic and Acoustic Features</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have shown that multi-feature paradigms can be used for the investigation of the central auditory processing. In this study, we developed a speech multi-feature paradigm with phonetic, prosodic, and acoustic changes. Our aim was to examine the participants' involuntary discrimination of the changes of speech sound features while they were watching a movie without any sound or subtitles. All five deviant conditions (vowel, consonant, stress, intensity, frequency) elicited statistically significant MMN ERP responses which varied in amplitude depending on the condition; stress was also connected with the occurrence of the LDN component. With vowel, consonant and stress among the conditions that received the most statistically significant ERPs, we could suggest that the current multi-feature paradigm can be used to successfully elicit the MMN ERP component and potentially to assess phonological processing in children and adults.

">Entorhinal cortex represents task-relevant remote locations independent of CA1</a></h4>

              
                Neurons can collectively represent the current sensory experience while an animal is exploring its environment or remote experiences while the animal is immobile. These remote representations can reflect learned associations and be required for learning. Neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) reflect the animal's current location during movement, but little is known about what MEC neurons collectively represent during immobility. Here, we recorded thousands of neurons in superficial MEC and dorsal CA1 as mice learned to associate two pairs of rewarded locations. We found that during immobility, the MEC neural population frequently represented positions far from the animal's location, which we defined as 'non-local coding'. Cells with spatial firing fields at remote locations drove non-local coding, even as cells representing the current position remained active. While MEC non-local coding has been reported during sharp-wave ripples in downstream CA1, we observed non-local coding more often outside of ripples. In fact, CA1 activity was less coordinated with MEC during non-local coding. We further observed that non-local coding was pertinent to the task, as MEC preferentially represented remote task-relevant locations at appropriate times, while rarely representing task-irrelevant locations. Together, this work raises the possibility that MEC non-local coding could strengthen associations between locations independently from CA1.

">Effector-Specific Neural Representations of Perceptual Decisions Independent of Motor Actions and Sensory Modalities</a></h4>

              
                Neuroscientific research has shown that perceptual decision-making occurs in effector-specific brain regions that are associated with the required motor response. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that dissociated decisions from coinciding processes, such as motor actions partly challenge this, indicating abstract representations that might vary across stimulus modalities. However, cross-modal comparisons have been difficult since most task designs differ not only in modality but also in effectors, motor response, and level of abstraction. Here, we describe an fMRI experiment where participants compared frequencies of two sequentially presented visual flicker stimuli in a delayed match-to-comparison task, which controlled for motor actions and stimulus sequence. Using Bayesian modelling, we estimated subjective frequency differences based on the time order effect. These values were applied in support vector regression analysis of a multi-voxel pattern whole-brain searchlight approach to identify brain regions containing information on subjective decision values. Furthermore, a conjunction analysis with data from a re-analyzed analogue vibrotactile study was conducted for a cross-modal comparison. Both analyses revealed significant activation patterns in the left dorsal (PMd) and ventral (PMv) premotor cortex as well as in the bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS). While previous primate and human imaging research have implicated these regions in transforming sensory information into action, our findings indicate that the IPS processes abstract decision signals while PMd and PMv represent an effector-specific, but motor response independent encoding of perceptual decisions that persists across sensory domains.

">Assessing the balance between excitation and inhibition in chronic pain through the aperiodic component of EEG</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain is a prevalent and debilitating condition whose neural mechanisms are incompletely understood. An imbalance of cerebral excitation and inhibition (E/I), particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), is believed to represent a crucial mechanism in the development and maintenance of chronic pain. Thus, identifying a non-invasive, scalable marker of E/I could provide valuable insights into the neural mechanisms of chronic pain and aid in developing clinically useful biomarkers. Recently, the aperiodic component of the electroencephalography (EEG) power spectrum has been proposed to represent a noninvasive proxy for E/I. We, therefore, assessed the aperiodic component in the mPFC of resting-state EEG recordings in 149 people with chronic pain and 115 healthy participants. We found robust evidence against differences in the aperiodic component in the mPFC between people with chronic pain and healthy participants, and no correlation between the aperiodic component and pain intensity. These findings were consistent across different subtypes of chronic pain and were similarly found in a whole-brain analysis. Their robustness was supported by preregistration and multiverse analyses across many different methodological choices. Together, our results suggest that the EEG aperiodic component does not differentiate between people with chronic pain and healthy individuals. These findings and the rigorous methodological approach can guide future studies investigating non-invasive, scalable markers of cerebral dysfunction in people with chronic pain and beyond.

">Methodological approaches to derive the heartbeat-evoked potential: pastpractices and future recommendations</a></h4>

              
                The heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP), a cortical response time-locked to each heartbeat, is suggested as an implicit electrophysiological marker reflecting the cortical processing of heartbeats, and more broadly interoceptive processing. An increasing number of studies suggest that HEP may be a meaningful clinical measure. However, on the scalp, HEP are low amplitude signals that are mixed with direct cardiac field artefacts. Therefore, signal processing pipelines that separate the cortical HEP from cardiac field artefacts are required. With a view to establishing optimal and standardised HEP pipelines, this review aims to evaluate the current approaches to this analysis used within the literature, address gaps and inconsistencies in HEP pipelines, and highlight the impact of crucial parameter choices. To do this, a scoping review investigated current HEP processing methods and parameters used in EEG and MEG studies. Testing these processing methods on Temple University's normal scalp EEG data (Obeid and Picone, 2016), the effect of different methods/parameters (e.g. HEP window, electrodes, filters, independent component analysis (ICA) and artefact subspace reconstruction (ASR)) on HEP extraction was explored. EEG studies (N=101) demonstrated greater parameter variability and heterogeneity than MEG studies (N=10), although significantly more studies used EEG. ICA without cardiac field artefact and ASR at threshold 20 exhibit similar results for artefact removal. Statistical analysis revealed that the RR interval, the start and end of the HEP window and the start of the baseline correction window significantly affect HEP values in pre-frontal, frontal and centrotemporal electrodes. Publications should report critical values for reliable HEP extraction, emphasising the need for standardised methods to enhance study comparison and reproducibility and establish a gold standard in the field.

">Two-factor synaptic consolidation reconciles robust memory with pruning and homeostatic scaling</a></h4>

              
                Memory consolidation involves a process of engram reorganization and stabilization that is thought to occur primarily during sleep through a combination of neural replay, homeostatic plasticity, synaptic maturation, and pruning. From a computational perspective, however, this process remains puzzling, as it is unclear how the underlying mechanisms can be incorporated into a common mathematical model of learning and memory. Here, we propose a solution by deriving a consolidation model that uses replay and two-factor synapses to store memories in recurrent neural networks with sparse connectivity and maximal noise robustness. The model offers a unified account of experimental observations of consolidation, such as multiplicative homeostatic scaling, task-driven synaptic pruning, increased neural stimulus selectivity, and preferential strengthening of weak memories. The model further predicts that intrinsic synaptic noise scales sublinearly with synaptic strength; this is supported by a meta-analysis of published synaptic imaging datasets.

">Flexible Control of Motor Units: Is the Multidimensionality of Motor Unit Manifolds a Sufficient Condition?</a></h4>

              
                The level of flexibility in the neural control of motor units remains a topic of debate. Understanding this flexibility would require the identification of the distribution of common inputs to the motor units. In this study, we identified large samples of motor units from two lower limb muscles: the vastus lateralis (VL; up to 60 motor units/participant) and gastrocnemius medialis (GM; up to 67 motor units/participant). First, we applied a linear dimensionality reduction method to assess the dimensionality of the manifolds underlying the motor unit activity. We subsequently investigated the flexibility in motor unit control under two conditions: sinusoidal contractions with torque feedback, and online control with visual feedback on motor unit firing rates. Overall, we found that the activity of GM motor units was effectively captured by a single latent factor defining a unidimensional manifold, whereas the VL motor units were better represented by three latent factors defining a multidimensional manifold. Despite this difference in dimensionality, the recruitment of motor units in the two muscles exhibited similar but limited levels of flexibility. Using a spiking network model, we proposed that VL motor unit behaviors can be explained by a combination of a single common input of cortical origin with recurrent circuits involving connections with other motor unit pools. This study clarifies an important debated issue in motor unit control by showing that motor unit firings can lie in a multidimensional manifold; however, it may still be impossible for the central nervous system to flexibly control these motor units.

">Flexible hippocampal representation of abstract boundaries supports memory-guided choice.</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive maps in the hippocampus encode the relative locations of spatial cues in an environment and dynamically adapt their representation when boundaries geometrically change. In parallel, hippocampal cognitive maps can represent abstract knowledge, yet it's unclear whether the hippocampus is sensitive to geometric changes to the borders, extreme coordinates, of abstract knowledge spaces. Here, we use a memory-guided decision making task to test whether the human hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex(mPFC) flexibly learn abstract boundary representations in distinct two-dimensional(2D) knowledge spaces. Despite being unnecessary to accurately make decisions, participants conserve a 2D map-like representation of abstract boundaries after the task, where the precision of their representation relates to prior choice accuracy. Finding that the hippocampus and mPFC represent the Euclidean distance of a decision cue to the most proximal boundary during decision making, we then test whether there are brain regions sensitive to boundary-defined contextual changes in abstract spaces. We observe flexible hippocampal representation of abstract boundaries, where the fidelity of this representation relates to task performance. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of hippocampal boundary representations in facilitating flexible knowledge retrieval in dynamically changing abstract contexts.

">Contrasting topologies of synchronous and asynchronous functional brain networks</a></h4>

              
                We generated asynchronous functional networks (aFNs) using a novel method called optimal causation entropy (oCSE) and compared aFN topology to the correlation-based synchronous functional networks (sFNs) which are commonly used in network neuroscience studies. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series from 212 participants of the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) study were used to generate aFNs and sFNs. As a demonstration of how aFNs and sFNs can be used in tandem, we used multivariate mixed effects models to determine whether age interacted with node efficiency to influence connection probabilities in the two networks. After adjusting for differences in network density, aFNs had higher global efficiency but lower local efficiency than the sFNs. In the aFNs, nodes with the highest outgoing global efficiency tended to be in the brainstem and orbitofrontal cortex. aFN nodes with the highest incoming global efficiency tended to be members of the Default Mode Network (DMN) in sFNs. Age interacted with node global efficiency in aFNs and node local efficiency in sFNs to influence connection probability. We conclude that the sFN and aFN both offer information about functional brain connectivity which the other type of network does not.

">Whole-Body Networks: A Holistic Approach for Studying Aging</a></h4>

              
                Aging is a multiorgan disease, yet the traditional approach is to study each organ in isolation. Such organ-specific studies allowed us to gather invaluable information regarding the pathomechanisms that contribute to senescence. But we believe that a big-picture exploration of the whole-body network (WBN) during aging could be complementary. In this study, we analyzed the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), breathing rate and heart rate time series of a young and an elderly group during eyes-open resting-state. By exploring the time-lagged coupling between the different organs we constructed WBNs. First, we showed that our analytical pipeline could identify regional differences in the networks of both populations, allowing us to proceed with the remaining of the analysis. By comparing the WBNs of young and elderly, a complex relationship emerged where some connections were stronger and some weaker in the elderly. Finally, the interconnectivity and segregation of the WBNs negatively correlated with the short-term memory of the young participants. This study: i) validated our methods, ii) identified differences between the two groups and iii) showed correlation with behavioral metrics. We are at the edge of a paradigm shift on how aging-related research is conducted and we believe that our methodology should be implemented in more complex mental and/or physical tasks to better demonstrate the alterations of WBNs as we age.

">Sleep Fragmentation Modulates the Neurophysiological Correlates of Cognitive Fatigue</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive fatigue (CF) is a critical factor affecting performance and well-being. It can be altered in suboptimal sleep quality conditions, e.g., in patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnea who experience both intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation (SF). Understanding the neurophysiological basis of SF in healthy individuals can provide insights to improve cognitive functioning in disrupted sleep conditions. In this electroencephalographical (EEG) study, we investigated in 16 healthy young participants the impact of experimentally induced SF on the neurophysiological correlates of CF measured before, during, and after practice on the TloadDback, a working memory task tailored to each individual maximal cognitive resources. Participants spent two times three consecutive nights in the laboratory, once in an undisrupted sleep (UdS) condition and once in a SF condition induced by non-awakening auditory stimulations, counterbalanced, and performed the TloadDback task both in a high (HCL) and a low (LCL) cognitive load condition. EEG activity was recorded during wakefulness in the 5-minutes resting state immediately before and after, as well as during the 16-minutes of the TloadDback task practice. In the high cognitive load under sleep fragmentation (HCL-SF) condition, high beta power increased during the TloadDback indicating heightened cognitive effort, and beta and alpha power increased in the post- vs. pre task resting state, suggesting a relaxation rebound. In the low cognitive load/undisturbed sleep (LCL-UdS) condition, low beta activity increased suggesting a relaxed focus, as well as mid beta activity associated with active thinking. These findings highlight the dynamic impact of SF on the neurophysiological correlates of CF and underscore the importance of sleep quality and continuity to maintain optimal cognitive functioning.

	<p>Background: Lumbar foraminal stenosis (LFS) involves the narrowing of neural foramina, leading to nerve compression, significant lower back pain and radiculopathy, particularly in the aging population. Management includes physical therapy, medications and potentially invasive surgeries such as foraminotomy. Advances in diagnostic and treatment strategies are essential due to LFS&amp;amp;rsquo;s complexity and prevalence, which underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in optimizing patient outcomes. Method: This literature review on LFS employed a systematic methodology to gather and synthesize recent scientific data. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Library databases using specific keywords related to LFS. The search, restricted to English language articles from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2023, focused on peer-reviewed articles, clinical trials and reviews. Due to the heterogeneity among the studies, data were qualitatively synthesized into themes related to diagnosis, treatment and pathophysiology. Results: This literature review on LFS analyzed 972 articles initially identified, from which 540 remained after removing duplicates. Following a rigorous screening process, 20 peer-reviewed articles met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. These studies primarily focused on evaluating the diagnostic accuracy, treatment efficacy and pathophysiological insights into LFS. Conclusion: The comprehensive review underscores the necessity for precise diagnostic and management strategies for LFS, highlighting the role of a multidisciplinary approach and the utility of a unified classification system in enhancing patient outcomes in the face of this condition&amp;amp;rsquo;s increasing prevalence.</p>

	<p>Studies of social cognition have shown gender differences regarding human face processing. One interesting finding is the enhanced processing of opposite-gender faces at different time stages, as revealed by event-related brain potentials. Crucially, from an evolutionary perspective, such a bias might interact with the emotional expression of the face. To investigate this, 100 participants (50 female, 50 male) completed an expression-detection task while their EEG was recorded. In three blocks, fearful, happy and neutral faces (female and male) were randomly presented, with participants instructed to respond to only one predefined target expression level in each block. Using linear mixed models, we observed both faster reaction times as well as larger P1 and late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes for women compared to men, supporting a generally greater female interest in faces. Highly interestingly, the analysis revealed an opposite-gender bias at P1 for happy target faces. This suggests that participants&amp;amp;rsquo; attentional templates may include more opposite-gender facial features when selectively attending to happy faces. While N170 was influenced by neither the face nor the participant gender, LPP was modulated by the face gender and specific combinations of the target status, face gender and expression, which is interpreted in the context of gender-emotion stereotypes. Future research should further investigate this expression and attention dependency of early opposite-gender biases.</p>

	<p>Heterogeneity has been one of the main barriers to understanding and treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous studies have identified several subtypes of ASD through unsupervised clustering analysis. However, most of them primarily depicted the pairwise similarity between individuals through second-order relationships, relying solely on patient data for their calculation. This leads to an underestimation of the complexity inherent in inter-individual relationships and the diagnostic information provided by typical development (TD). To address this, we utilized an elastic net model to construct an individual deviation-based hypergraph (ID-Hypergraph) based on functional MRI data. We then conducted a novel community detection clustering algorithm to the ID-Hypergraph, with the aim of identifying subtypes of ASD. By applying this framework to the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange repository data (discovery: 147/125, ASD/TD; replication: 134/132, ASD/TD), we identified four reproducible ASD subtypes with roughly similar patterns of ALFF between the discovery and replication datasets. Moreover, these subtypes significantly varied in communication domains. In addition, we achieved over 80% accuracy for the classification between these subtypes. Taken together, our study demonstrated the effectiveness of identifying subtypes of ASD through the ID-hypergraph, highlighting its potential in elucidating the heterogeneity of ASD and diagnosing ASD subtypes.</p>

                Background Tuberculosis (TB) continues to pose a serious threat to the public health system in India. Although the National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP) is providing a wide range of interventions from early diagnosis to complete treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality from TB, adverse drug reactions (ADR) remain a challenge in treatment adherence and completion. Methods An observational cross-sectional study was conducted in selected districts of Gujarat state. A total of 593 reported TB patients were recruited with an adjusted unified distribution based on the type of cases, site of diseases, and service facility through a simple random sampling method. A semi-structured questionnaire tool was used to collect socio-demographic, clinical, and ADR-related data from the TB patients. Data was analyzed for the frequency, percentage, chi-squared, and adjusted odds ratio to find the association between the variables. Results The majority of the study participants were male (87.2%), aged 15 to 60 (57.8%), daily laborers (22.4%), and married (64.2%). Over 75% of individuals had pulmonary TB, with 87% having experienced their first episode, 83% being new cases, and 44.7% having a history of addiction. ADR with mild symptoms was reported by more than a quarter (29%) of TB patients during the intensive phase (77%). The association between ADR experience and drug susceptibility was significant (p<0.005) and drug-resistant TB patients experience two times more ADRs than drug-sensitive TB patients (OR 2.04). Binomial logistic regression was carried out to describe the association between various variables and occurrence of ADRs. Conclusion The study highlighted a need to enhance health care providers’ capacity and program structure for managing ADRs among TB patients. In order to completely eliminate TB across the country, it also emphasized the attention for a holistic and all-encompassing strategy for managing TB patients at the field level.

                Midkine is a secreted protein that acts as a growth factor or cytokine involved in cell survival and inflammatory processes. It accumulates in amyloid plaques, which are hallmarks of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The reproducibility of Midkine research would be enhanced if the community had access to well-characterized anti-Midkine antibodies. In this study, we characterized 8 commercial Midkine antibodies for Western blot and immunoprecipitation, using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in a knockout cell line and isogenic parental control. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address the antibody reproducibility issue by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Curculigo latifolia Dryand. ex W. T. Aiton, from the genus Curculigo, is a medicinal plant traditionally used to treat numerous illnesses such as fever, stomach aches, jaundice, wounds, and inflammation. C. latifolia is a perennial herb that is widely found in tropical and subtropical regions, such as Southeast Asia, Southern China, Bangladesh, Australia, and the Andaman Islands. This review collates the reported studies on the different aspects of C. latifolia from its plant description, nutritional value, phytochemistry, chemical composition, and pharmacological properties. This review aims to identify gaps in the literature and provide useful references for future work on this plant. Previous studies have shown that C. latifolia contains high mineral contents of calcium, iron, and magnesium, which are essential components of human health. Moreover, the plant is rich in phytochemicals, which play a prominent role in various pharmacological activities. The most common compounds identified included curculigoside, crassifoside I, nyasicoside, and curculigine. C. latifolia demonstrated high antioxidant activity through its ability to scavenge superoxide anions, 1,1–diphenyl–2–picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2’-azino–bis(3–ethylbenzthiazoline–6–sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radicals, reducing ferric ions to ferrous complexes, iron chelation, and β –carotene bleaching. It was also shown that the roots, stems, and leaves of C. latifolia were effective in exerting antimicrobial activity against several microbial strains, including Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtillis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Erwinia sp., Klebsiella sp., Pseudomonas sp., Candida albicans, Salmonella choleraesuis and Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, the root, fruit, leaf, petiole, and rhizome extracts were found to improve glucose uptake and insulin secretion in diabetic rats, suggesting their antidiabetic potential. C. latifolia presents a wide range of medicinal properties that could make it a promising functional food or source of food supplements to prevent nutrition–related or chronic diseases.

                <p>Psychotic symptoms and delusional beliefs have been linked to dopamine transmission in both healthy and clinical samples and are assumed to result at least in part from perceiving illusory patterns in noise. However, the existing literature on the role of dopamine in detecting patterns in noise is inconclusive. To address this issue, we assessed the effect of manipulating dopaminergic neurotransmission on illusory pattern perception in healthy individuals (<I>n </I>= 48, <I>n </I>= 19 female) in a double-blind placebo-controlled within-subjects design (see preregistration at <A HREF="https://osf.io/a4k9j/">https://osf.io/a4k9j/</A>). We predicted individuals on versus off &#x029F;-DOPA to be more likely to perceive illusory patterns, specifically objects in images containing only noise. Using a signal detection model, however, we found no credible evidence that &#x029F;-DOPA compared with placebo increased false alarm rates. Further, &#x029F;-DOPA did not reliably modulate measures of accuracy, discrimination sensitivity, and response bias. In all cases, Bayesian statistics revealed strong evidence in favor of the null hypothesis. The task design followed previous work on illusory pattern perception and comprised a limited number of items per condition. The results therefore need to be interpreted with caution, as power was limited. Future studies should address illusory pattern perception using more items and take into account potential dose-dependent effects and differential effects in healthy versus clinical samples.</p>

                <p>Typical statistical practices in the biological sciences have been increasingly called into question due to difficulties in the replication of an increasing number of studies, many of which are confounded by the relative difficulty of null significance hypothesis testing designs and interpretation of <I>p</I>-values. Bayesian inference, representing a fundamentally different approach to hypothesis testing, is receiving renewed interest as a potential alternative or complement to traditional null significance hypothesis testing due to its ease of interpretation and explicit declarations of prior assumptions. Bayesian models are more mathematically complex than equivalent frequentist approaches, which have historically limited applications to simplified analysis cases. However, the advent of probability distribution sampling tools with exponential increases in computational power now allows for quick and robust inference under any distribution of data. Here we present a practical tutorial on the use of Bayesian inference in the context of neuroscientific studies in both rat electrophysiological and computational modeling data. We first start with an intuitive discussion of Bayes' rule and inference followed by the formulation of Bayesian-based regression and ANOVA models using data from a variety of neuroscientific studies. We show how Bayesian inference leads to easily interpretable analysis of data while providing an open-source toolbox to facilitate the use of Bayesian tools.</p>

                Background Hyperintensities on T2-weighted images in the spinal cord are a complex and diagnostically challenging entity that can present with diverse clinical features. This study protocol outlines a comprehensive investigation to understand the causes, clinical and imaging characteristics, and correlation with pathological findings of hyperintensities on T2-weighted images in the spinal cord. By establishing a systematic assessment approach, this study seeks to provide valuable insights into these abnormalities’ diagnostic and prognostic implications. Methods The study will be conducted as a prospective observational design. Patients with clinically diagnosed or suspected spinal cord lesion presenting with intramedullary T2-weighted hyperintensity and referred for MRI evaluation will be included. Data collection will encompass patient demographics, clinical features, and extensive imaging parameters. Pathological data, when available, will be correlated with imaging findings. Various statistical methods will be employed to analyse the data, including frequency analysis, comparative tests, logistic regression, and survival analysis. Expected Results The study anticipates elucidating the spectrum of etiologies underlying hyperintensities on T2-weighted images in the spinal cord and their clinical and imaging profiles. The systematic approach will offer a structured diagnostic method, while correlations with pathological data will provide an enhanced understanding of these conditions. The results are expected to provide clinicians with valuable insights into diagnosing, treating, and prognosticating patients with spinal cord hyperintensities on T2-weighted images.

This study was carried out to assess the effect of priming duration and metabolite concentration on the priming of five (5) different crops, using the metabolites of five (5) bacterial isolates. The crop seeds were treated in the cold-extracted metabolites of the five isolates at five (5) different priming durations (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 h) and then in five metabolite concentrations (200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 mg/L) of the five extracted metabolites at the optimal priming duration determined in the first experiment. Characterization of the cold-extracted metabolites was also carried out using gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results revealed that priming cowpea and soybean for longer durations (< 3 h) could hinder their growth and development. Lower concentrations were observed to be optimal for cowpea and soybean, but for sesame and okra, there was no detectable pattern with metabolite concentration. The GC-MS revealed the presence of some molecules (e.g. hexadecanoic acid) that have shown plant growth promotion potential in other studies. This study showed that seeds with large endosperm, such as, cowpea and soybean, are more prone to the deleterious effects of treatment for longer durations. Further experiments should be carried out to isolate and purify the bioactive moieties for further studies and onward application.

                Background Glioblastoma (GBM) is a clinically challenging primary brain tumor with poor survival outcome despite surgical resection and intensive chemoradiation. The metabolic heterogeneity of GBM can become biomarkers for treatment response, resistance, and outcome prediction. The aim of the study is to investigate metabolic distinctions between primary and recurrent GBM tissue and patient plasma to establish feasibility for metabolic profiling. Methods A single-center cohort study analyzed tissue and blood samples from 15 patients with GBM using untargeted metabolomic/lipidomic assays. Metabolomic, lipidomic, and biogenic amine analyses were conducted on GBM tissue and patient plasma at diagnosis and recurrence using untargeted mass spectrometry. The study utilized a small but longitudinally collected cohort to evaluate alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between specimens at diagnosis and recurrence. Results Exploratory analysis revealed significant alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between diagnostic and recurrent states in both tumor and plasma specimens. Notable metabolites differed at recurrence, including N-alpha-methylhistamine, glycerol-3-phosphate, phosphocholine, and succinic acid in tissue, and indole-3-acetate, and urea in plasma. Principal component analysis revealed distinct metabolomic profiles between tumor tissue and patient plasma. Distinct metabolic profiles were observed in GBM tissue and patient plasma at recurrence, demonstrating the feasibility of using metabolomic methodologies for longitudinal studies. One patient exhibited a unique tumor resistance signature at diagnosis, possibly indicating a high-risk metabolomic phenotype. Conclusions In this small cohort, the findings suggest the potential of metabolomic signatures of GBM tissue and patient plasma for risk stratification, outcome prediction, and the development of novel adjuvant metabolic-targeting therapies. The findings suggest metabolic discrepancies at diagnosis and recurrence in tissue and plasma, highlighting potential implications for evaluation of clinical response. The identification of significant changes in metabolite abundance emphasizes the need for larger studies using targeted metabolomics to validate and further explore these profiles.

                Background Machine vision faces significant challenges when applied to text recognition on cardboard packaging particularly due to multiple printing methods, irregular character shapes, and curved packaging surfaces. Methods This research introduces a novel deep learning application for recognizing binarized expiration date and batch code characters printed using multiple printing methods. The method, based on Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN), enables character recognition directly from in the images without the need for extracting handcrafted features. In detail, this approach performs character recognition by using the whole image as input, extracting and learning salient character features directly from the packaging surface images. Results The R-CNN model, with a precision of 91.1% and an F1 score of 80.9%, effectively recognizes manufacturing markings on pharmaceutical packages, with inconsistencies in the characters’ shapes. In a comparative experiment using the same dataset of images, the R-CNN model significantly outperformed Tesseract OCR, achieving much higher precision, recall, and F1 scores. Conclusions The results of this study reveal that the deep learning method outperforms the well-established optical character recognition method in recognizing text characters printed with different printing methods. Presented in this study, the deep learning method recognizes text characters with high precision. It is also suitable for recognizing text printed on curved surfaces, provided proper preprocessing is applied. The problem investigated in the study differs from previous research in the field, focusing on the recognition of texts printed with different printing methods. The research thus fills a gap in text recognition that existed in the research of the field. Furthermore, the study presents new ideas that will be utilized in our future research.

                Background Recent studies have established that Medicinal Marijuana (MM) is beneficial in the treatment of spasms, sleep, and pain in adult patients with varying medical diagnoses and symptoms. However, MM has rarely been used for the treatment of Cerebral Palsy (CP) complications in adults. The aim of this systematic literature review was to explore MM interventions globally, with a focus on identifying the best practice with MM for the treatment of complications of CP. Methods A systematic literature search was performed using keywords and synonyms related to MM treatment and CP complications. Inclusions and exclusions were scoped to scholarly peer reviewed academic literature published 2019 to 2021 located in the Deakin Library collection. A screening process confirmed criteria adherence and identified additional papers in referencing. The papers were appraised and evaluated to ensure selections do not have perceived or actual bias. Results From 409 publications, 27 papers were selected for review because they investigated the benefits of MM treatment for patients with sleep, pain, and spasm complications. There was no literature found on the use of MM for adults with CP. Discussion Recent research has demonstrated that with an informed understanding of MM treatment adult patients with varying medical diagnoses and symptoms can use MM to manage sleep disruption and improve relaxation. Therefore, there are potential benefits for the use of MM in treating spasticity, pain, sleep, quality of life, and social and emotional wellbeing in adult patients with CP. No funding was sort or provided for this review and the results are specific to adults with CP, so they are not to be generalized to other populations.

                Background The objective of this systematic review was to analyze the effects of the physical activity (PA) intervention as an adjuvant strategy to pharmacological treatment in people with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and non-remitted depression (NRD). Methods A search strategy was realized from five databases: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science. Eleven articles attained the inclusion criteria. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database and Oxford’s Evidence Levels were used to classify the quality appraisal. Results The more significant outcome for this analysis was the improvement of depression by PA or exercise in TRD and NRD. According to the FITT (Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type) principle, there was some variability in the PA intervention, and except for one article, they all were classified as excellent in terms of quality description. Conclusions This review highlights the potential of PA intervention as an adjuvant program to improve different traits of TRD and NRD. The remission of depression seems to be higher after PA intervention, showing improvements in quality of life, sleep quality, executive function, and vitality.

                Introduction Acquired hemophilia is a rare disease characterized by the presence of neutralizing autoantibodies against hemostasis factors, most often factor VII. However, a few cases of anti-factor VII (FVII) autoantibodies have been reported in the literature. We report a case in this regard. Case report A 28-year-old woman with no family or personal history presented with a severe hemorrhagic syndrome made of very abundant metrorrhagia with multiple compressive cervical hematomas, associated with pulmonary embolism and thrombosis. of the right external iliac vein. On the biological assessment, the patient presented with an undetectable PT with a factor VII titer less than 6%. The hemorrhagic syndrome was aggravated by infusions of activated factor VII (FVIIa) with the appearance of hemoptysis and hematomas in all four limbs. Etiological assessment concluded the presence of anti-factor VII autoantibodies as well as circulating lupus anticoagulant. Other antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) antibodies as well as antibodies against other hemostasis factors were absent. A treatment combining corticosteroid therapy (1mg per kg per day of prednisone) and Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (3g) was initiated. Faced with the persistence of the hemorrhagic syndrome, rituximab was administered according to the rheumatological protocol (1g on D1 and 1g on D15). Metrorrhagia improved initially but recurred with the resumption of menstruation with a drop in hemoglobin from 9 to 7 g/dl. Plasmapheresis sessions were attempted but thromboses on the catheters occurred each time. Immunoglobulin (IVIg) courses were administered. No anticoagulant was administered. TP increased to 23%. Levels of neutralizing antibodies fell from 512 to 2 IBU at the last follow-up at five months from the bleeding event. The circulating lupus anticoagulant was present on the follow-up test after 12 weeks, thus confirming the diagnosis of APS. Conclusion Our patient presents an extremely rare case of acquired haemophilia. The combination of corticosteroid therapy, conventional and biological immunosupressives, IVIG and plasmapheresis saved the patient. In the absence of consensus on the treatment, it remains adapted according to the severity of the haemorrhagic syndrome and the associated comorbidities.

                <p>by Thomas Williams, James M. McCaw, James M. Osborne</p>

The role of direct cell–to–cell spread in viral infections—where virions spread between host and susceptible cells without needing to be secreted into the extracellular environment—has come to be understood as essential to the dynamics of medically significant viruses like hepatitis C and influenza. Recent work in both the experimental and mathematical modelling literature has attempted to quantify the prevalence of cell–to–cell infection compared to the conventional free virus route using a variety of methods and experimental data. However, estimates are subject to significant uncertainty and moreover rely on data collected by inhibiting one mode of infection by either chemical or physical factors, which may influence the other mode of infection to an extent which is difficult to quantify. In this work, we conduct a simulation–estimation study to probe the practical identifiability of the proportion of cell–to–cell infection, using two standard mathematical models and synthetic data that would likely be realistic to obtain in the laboratory. We show that this quantity cannot be estimated using non–spatial data alone, and that the collection of a data which describes the spatial structure of the infection is necessary to infer the proportion of cell–to–cell infection. Our results provide guidance for the design of relevant experiments and mathematical tools for accurately inferring the prevalence of cell–to–cell infection in <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> contexts.

Reduction of amyloid beta (Aβ) has been shown to be effective in treating Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the underlying assumption that neurons are the main source of pathogenic Aβ is untested. Here, we challenge this prevailing belief by demonstrating that oligodendrocytes are an important source of Aβ in the human brain and play a key role in promoting abnormal neuronal hyperactivity in an AD knock-in mouse model. We show that selectively suppressing oligodendrocyte Aβ production improves AD brain pathology and restores neuronal function in the mouse model in vivo. Our findings suggest that targeting oligodendrocyte Aβ production could be a promising therapeutic strategy for treating AD.

Awards can propel academic careers. They also reflect the culture and values of the scientific community. But do awards incentivize greater transparency, inclusivity, and openness in science? Our cross-disciplinary survey of 222 awards for the “best” journal articles across all 27 SCImago subject areas revealed that journals and learned societies administering such awards generally publish little detail on their procedures and criteria. Award descriptions were brief, rarely including contact details or information on the nominations pool. Nominations of underrepresented groups were not explicitly encouraged, and concepts that align with Open Science were almost absent from the assessment criteria. At the same time, 10% of awards, especially the recently established ones, tended to use article-level impact metrics. USA-affiliated researchers dominated the winner’s pool (48%), while researchers from the Global South were uncommon (11%). Sixty-one percent of individual winners were men. Overall, Best Paper awards miss the global calls for greater transparency and equitable access to academic recognition. We provide concrete and implementable recommendations for scientific awards to improve the scientific recognition system and incentives for better scientific practice.

Miq as a potential antiviral agent for Newcastle disease [version 8; peer review: 2 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Recent evidence suggests that some flavonoid compounds obtained from crude methanol extract of mistletoe leaves (Dendrophthoe pentandra L. Miq), also known as Benalu Duku (BD), have antimicrobial effects. Thus, the plant has the potential to eliminate viruses that may cause outbreaks in chicken farms. This study aimed to prove the in vitro ability of flavonoid compounds, namely quercetin-like compounds (QLCs), to eliminate field viruses, specifically the Newcastle disease virus (NDV). Methods This research was performed in two stages. An in vitro test was used with a post-test of the control groups designed at a significance of 0.05. BD leaves (5 kg) were extracted using a maceration method with methanol and then separated into hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol fractions. The final extracted products were separated using semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to obtain QLCs. The QLCs were identified and compared with quercetin using HPLC, proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The activity of QLCs was tested in vitro against the NDV at a virulence titter of 10−5 Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50% (TCID50) in chicken kidney cell culture. Results Solutions of 0.05% (w/v) QLCs were discovered to have antiviral activity against NDVs, with an average cytopathogenic effect antigenicity at a 10−5 dilution (p<0.05). Conclusions QLCs from flavonoids from the leaves of BD have in vitro antiviral bioactivity against NDV at a virulence titter of 10-5 Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50% (TCID50) in chicken kidney cell culture. QLCs may have the potential to be developed as medicinal compounds for the treatment of other human or animal viral infections.

                Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex and Asexual (LGBTQIA+) people struggle to identify a healthcare service that understands their problems and needs. Additionally, healthcare professionals also find it difficult to care for LGBTQIA+ as very little is studied or heard about management. The article presents a protocol for a pilot study aimed at the development of an LGBTQIA+ care curriculum for health science professionals. The study includes Phase I: The development of a curriculum based on a literature review and focus group discussion among LGBTQIA+ individuals, and Phase II: Pilot testing of LGBTQIA+ care curriculum. The study outcome will reflect the improvement in the knowledge of healthcare professionals on LGBTQIA+ care.

                Background Malnourished pregnant women are at increased risk of micronutrient deficiency. We assessed the vitamin B12 status in both malnourished and normally nourished pregnant women and their neonates. Additionally, we studied the association between maternal B12 levels, cord B12 levels and neonatal anthropometry. Methods This cross-sectional study enrolled 63 malnourished and 63 normally nourished mothers and neonates. Maternal and cord blood samples were collected at the time of delivery for estimation of vitamin B12 levels. Maternal and cord vitamin B12 levels were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test. Neonatal anthropometry was correlated with maternal and cord B12 levels using Spearman’s correlation. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 25. Results Mean maternal age was 26.58 yrs. The median cord B12 levels were lower than the maternal B12 levels. Maternal B12 levels showed a strong positive correlation with cord B12 levels (rho = 0.879; p < 0.001). Maternal (p < 0.001) and cord (p < 0.001) vitamin B12 levels were significantly lower in the malnourished group than in the normally nourished group. In malnourished group, 66.8% mothers and 95.2% neonates were Vitamin B12 deficient, whereas 1.5% mothers and 4.7% neonates were vitamin B12 deficient in normally nourished group. In the malnourished group, maternal B12 levels were positively correlated with birth weight (rho 0.363, p = 0.003) and length (rho 0.330, p =0.008), whereas cord B12 levels were positively correlated with birth weight in the normally nourished group. (rho 0.277 p= 0.028) Conclusion High rates of vitamin B12 deficiency were observed in malnourished mothers and neonates. There was a positive correlation between birth weight, length, and maternal vitamin B12 levels in malnourished mothers. These findings emphasize the need to address maternal malnutrition and vitamin B12 deficiency to improve neonatal health.

                Gallstone ileus, a rare complication of cholelithiasis, presents significant morbidity and mortality challenges, with no established consensus on optimal management. This study aimed to highlight the complexities surrounding its occurrence and emphasize the need for tailored therapeutic strategies. An 88-year-old female, with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presented with diffuse abdominal pain and vomiting. Clinical evaluation revealed signs of small-bowel obstruction. Radiological assessments, including Computed Tomography CT) scans, confirmed biliary ileus, showcasing a sizable gallstone causing subacute obstruction. Emergency surgery involving enterolithotomy was performed, successfully addressing the immediate concerns. Postoperative follow-up demonstrated a one-year asymptomatic period, emphasizing the effectiveness of the chosen intervention. Gallstone ileus typically follows acute cholecystitis, leading to gallstone erosion and fistula formation commonly in the duodenum. Diagnosis is challenging because of nonspecific symptoms, necessitating a high index of suspicion. Computed tomography (CT) plays a pivotal role in accurate and rapid diagnoses. This study delves into the intricate details of gallstone ileus presentation, complications, and the debate surrounding optimal surgical management, acknowledging the effectiveness of the two-stage procedure and emerging laparoscopic approaches. This case provides valuable insights into the intricate facets of gallstone ileus and emphasizes the need for individualized treatment strategies. Successful management, as demonstrated in our case, underscores the importance of considering patient-specific factors when choosing between the surgical approaches. This study supports recent reports advocating for laparoscopic interventions, encouraging further exploration of evolving therapeutic modalities for gallstone ileus.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Multiple cortical motor areas are critically involved in the voluntary control of discrete movement (e.g., reaching) and gait. Here, we outline experimental findings in nonhuman primates with clinical reports and research in humans that explain characteristic movement control mechanisms in the primary, supplementary, and presupplementary motor areas, as well as in the dorsal premotor area. We then focus on single-neuron activity recorded while monkeys performed motor sequences consisting of multiple discrete movements, and we consider how area-specific control mechanisms may contribute to the performance of complex movements. Following this, we explore the motor areas in cats that we have considered as analogs of those in primates based on similarities in their cortical surface topology, anatomic connections, microstimulation effects, and activity patterns. Emphasizing that discrete movement and gait modification entail similar control mechanisms, we argue that single-neuron activity in each area of the cat during gait modification is compatible with the function ascribed to the activity in the corresponding area in primates, recorded during the performance of discrete movements. The findings that demonstrate the premotor areas’ contribution to locomotion, currently unique to the cat model, should offer highly valuable insights into the control mechanisms of locomotion in primates, including humans.

                Background There have been significant changes in the lifestyles of individuals in the past few decades, which has led to increased morbidity and mortality worldwide. Both smoking and chewing forms of tobacco are highly prevalent, especially in India, and are implicated as causes of diseases, including oropharyngeal carcinomas. Effective tobacco cessation techniques and sources can help overcome addiction and reduce the disease burden in society. The aim was to evaluate the quality and readability of contents of various sources on an internet website about tobacco cessation. Objectives i) To evaluate the readability of internet content (Google) regarding tobacco cessation using Flesch–Kincaid readability tests and the quality of internet content (Google) by using the JAMA benchmark, HONcode and DISCERN questionnaire. Methods A content review was employed to screen the content of the Google search engine for educational tobacco cessation websites, and the top 50 websites were selected according to criteria and reviewed by two reviewers. The readability of the internet content (Google) regarding tobacco cessation was evaluated using Flesch–Kincaid readability tests. The quality of the screened sites was evaluated by using the JAMA benchmark, HONcode and DISCERN questionnaire, and the readability and quality of the screened websites were correlated using the above instruments. Results FK readability ease was found to be 49% standard and 30% easy. The FK grade test found that 33% of the content could be easily understood by < 5th grade. All 4 JAMA benchmarks were met by 23% of websites, and authorship was the least fulfilled criterion. Correlation analysis revealed a significant association between FK ease score and FK grade score. Conclusions The Read-ability Ease and Read-ability Grade Levels of the websites related to tobacco cessation were not standard, and few websites fulfilled the JAMA benchmarks and had HONcode certification.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>The vagus nerve, as an important component of the gut-brain axis, plays a crucial role in the communication between the gut and brain. It influences food intake, fat metabolism, and emotion by regulating the gut-brain axis, which is closely associated with the development of gastrointestinal, psychiatric, and metabolism-related disorders. In recent years, significant progress has been made in understanding the vagus-mediated regulatory pathway, highlighting its profound implications in the development of many diseases. Here, we summarize the latest advancements in vagus-mediated gut-brain pathways and the novel interventions targeting the vagus nerve. This will provide valuable insights for future research on treatment of obesity and gastrointestinal and depressive disorders based on vagus nerve stimulation.

     alt="Clinicopathologic Dissociation: Robust Lafora Body Accumulation in Malin KO Mice Without Observable Changes in Home-Cage Behavior"/>
<p>One-year-old mice with deletions of <i>malin</i> display robust Lafora body accumulation, astrogliosis, microgliosis, and evidence of cortical circuit dysfunction. Despite these pathologies, malin KO mice exhibited no abnormalities in a wide range of home-cage neurobehavioral endpoints, pointing to a broad window for intervention in this otherwise fatal form of epilepsy. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Lafora disease (LD) is a syndrome of progressive myoclonic epilepsy and cumulative neurocognitive deterioration caused by recessively inherited genetic lesions of EPM2A (laforin) or NHLRC1 (malin). Neuropsychiatric symptomatology in LD is thought to be directly downstream of neuronal and astrocytic polyglucosan aggregates, termed Lafora bodies (LBs), which faithfully accumulate in an age-dependent manner in all mouse models of LD. In this study, we applied home-cage monitoring to examine the extent of neurobehavioral deterioration in a model of malin-deficient LD as a means to identify robust preclinical endpoints that may guide the selection of novel genetic treatments. At 6 weeks, ∼6–7 months, and ∼12 months of age, malin-deficient mice (“KO”) and wild-type (WT) littermates underwent a standardized home-cage behavioral assessment designed to non-obtrusively appraise features of rest/arousal, consumptive behaviors, risk aversion, and voluntary wheel-running. At all timepoints, and over a range of metrics that we report transparently, WT and KO mice were essentially indistinguishable. In contrast, within WT mice compared across the same timepoints, we identified age-related nocturnal hypoactivity, diminished sucrose preference, and reduced wheel-running. Neuropathological examinations in subsets of the same mice revealed expected age-dependent LB accumulation, gliosis, and microglial activation in cortical and subcortical brain regions. At 12 months of age, despite the burden of neocortical LBs, we did not identify spontaneous seizures during an electroencephalographic (EEG) survey, and KO and WT mice exhibited similar spectral EEG features. However, in an in vitro assay of neocortical function, paroxysmal bursts of network activity (UP states) in KO slices were more prolonged at 3 and 6 months of age, but similar to WT at 12 months. KO mice displayed a distinct response to pentylenetetrazole, with a greater incidence of clonic seizures and a more pronounced postictal suppression of movement, feeding, and drinking behavior. Together, these results highlight the clinicopathologic dissociation in a mouse model of LD, where the accrual of LBs may latently modify cortical circuit function and seizure threshold without clinically meaningful changes in home-cage behavior. Our findings allude to a delay between LB accumulation and neurobehavioral decline in LD: one that may provide a window for treatment, and whose precise duration may be difficult to ascertain within the typical lifespan of a laboratory mouse.</p>

                <p>Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) safety and efficacy in patients with large core infarcts receiving oral anticoagulants (OAC) are unknown. In the SELECT2 trial (NCT03876457), 29 of 180 (16%; vitamin K antagonists 15, direct OACs 14) EVT, and 18 of 172 (10%; vitamin K antagonists 3, direct OACs 15) medical management (MM) patients reported OAC use at baseline. EVT was not associated with better clinical outcomes in the OAC group (EVT 6 [4–6] vs MM 5 [4–6], adjusted generalized odds ratio 0.89 [0.53–1.50]), but demonstrated significantly better outcomes in patients without OAC (EVT 4 [3–6] vs MM 5 [4–6], adjusted generalized odds ratio 1.87 [1.45–2.40], <i>p</i> = 0.02). The OAC group had higher comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation (70% vs 17%), congestive heart failure (28% vs 10%), and hypertension (87% vs 72%), suggesting increased frailty. However, the results were consistent after adjustment for these comorbidities, and was similar regardless of the type of OACs used. Whereas any hemorrhage rates were higher in the OAC group receiving EVT (86% in OAC vs 70% in no OAC), no parenchymal hemorrhage or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were observed with OAC use in both the EVT and MM arms. Although we did not find evidence that the effect was due to excess hemorrhage or confounded by underlying cardiac disease or older age, OAC use alone should not exclude patients from receiving EVT. Baseline comorbidities and ischemic injury extent should be considered while making individualized treatment decisions. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

Nevertheless, a meaningful framework to organize the telencephalon in any reptile has, with rare exception, yet to be presented. To address this gap in knowledge, the telencephalon was investigated in two species of crocodiles. A variety of morphological stains were used to examine tissue in transverse, horizontal, and sagittal planes of sections. Besides providing a description of individual nuclei, brain parts were organized based on two features. One was related to two fixed, internal structures: the lateral ventricle and the dorsal medullary lamina. The other was the alignment of neurons into either layers, cortex, or not, nucleus. Viewed from this perspective, all structures, with limited exceptions, could be accurately placed within the telencephalon regardless of the plane of section. Furthermore, this framework can be applied to other reptiles. A further extension of this scheme suggests that all structures in the telencephalon could be grouped into one of two categories: pallial or basal.</p>

                Villéga, Fernandes, Jézéquel et al. report that NMDAR open channel blockers, such as ketamine, favor receptor trapping at excitatory synapses through enhanced interactions with scaffolding proteins. They further show that ketamine-elicited trapping enhancement alleviates NMDAR synaptic impairments and behavioral deficits caused by autoantibodies from patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis.

This suppression event induces β-catenin uncoupling from transmembrane integrins, which triggers inside-out signaling. Consequently, integrin engagement with epithelial-deposited ECM leads to extensive COL1 fibril branching conducive to neoplastic transformation.

                Small ubiquitin-binding domains such as NZF domains bind ubiquitin with low affinity. Michel et al. show that secondary conserved patches on NZF domains provide either linkage or substrate specificity by providing avid bidentate interactions. This way, the NZF1 domain of HOIP reads ubiquitination events on NEMO and optineurin.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96507">The mechanism of mammalian proton-coupled peptide transporters</a></h4>

              
                Proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters (POTs) are of great pharmaceutical interest owing to their promiscuous substrate binding site that has been linked to improved oral bioavailability of several classes of drugs. Members of the POT family are conserved across all phylogenetic kingdoms and function by coupling peptide uptake to the proton electrochemical gradient. Cryo-EM structures and alphafold models have recently provided new insights into different conformational states of two mammalian POTs, SLC15A1, and SLC15A2. Nevertheless, these studies leave open important questions regarding the mechanism of proton and substrate coupling, while simultaneously providing a unique opportunity to investigate these processes using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Here, we employ extensive unbiased and enhanced-sampling MD to map out the full SLC15A2 conformational cycle and its thermodynamic driving forces. By computing conformational free energy landscapes in different protonation states and in the absence or presence of peptide substrate, we identify a likely sequence of intermediate protonation steps that drive inward-directed alternating access. These simulations identify key differences in the extracellular gate between mammalian and bacterial POTs, which we validate experimentally in cell-based transport assays. Our results from constant-PH MD and absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations also establish a mechanistic link between proton binding and peptide recognition, revealing key details underpining secondary active transport in POTs. This study provides a vital step forward in understanding proton-coupled peptide and drug transport in mammals and pave the way to integrate knowledge of solute carrier structural biology with enhanced drug design to target tissue and organ bioavailability.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93804">Aberrant hippocampal Ca2+ microwaves following synapsin-dependent adeno-associated viral expression of Ca2+ indicators</a></h4>

              
                Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) such as GCaMP are invaluable tools in neuroscience to monitor neuronal activity using optical imaging. The viral transduction of GECIs is commonly used to target expression to specific brain regions, can be conveniently used with any mouse strain of interest without the need for prior crossing with a GECI mouse line, and avoids potential hazards due to the chronic expression of GECIs during development. A key requirement for monitoring neuronal activity with an indicator is that the indicator itself minimally affects activity. Here, using common adeno-associated viral (AAV) transduction procedures, we describe spatially confined aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> microwaves slowly travelling through the hippocampus following expression of GCaMP6, GCaMP7, or R-CaMP1.07 driven by the synapsin promoter with AAV-dependent gene transfer in a titre-dependent fashion. Ca<sup>2+</sup> microwaves developed in hippocampal CA1 and CA3, but not dentate gyrus nor neocortex, were typically first observed at 4 wk after viral transduction, and persisted up to at least 8 wk. The phenomenon was robust and observed across laboratories with various experimenters and setups. Our results indicate that aberrant hippocampal Ca<sup>2+</sup> microwaves depend on the promoter and viral titre of the GECI, density of expression, as well as the targeted brain region. We used an alternative viral transduction method of GCaMP which avoids this artefact. The results show that commonly used Ca<sup>2+</sup>-indicator AAV transduction procedures can produce artefactual Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. Our aim is to raise awareness in the field of these artefactual transduction-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> microwaves, and we provide a potential solution.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91783">circHIPK3 nucleates IGF2BP2 and functions as a competing endogenous RNA</a></h4>

              
                Circular RNAs represent a class of endogenous RNAs that regulate gene expression and influence cell biological decisions with implications for the pathogenesis of several diseases. Here, we disclose a novel gene-regulatory role of circHIPK3 by combining analyses of large genomics datasets and mechanistic cell biological follow-up experiments. Using time-course depletion of circHIPK3 and specific candidate RNA-binding proteins, we identify several perturbed genes by RNA sequencing analyses. Expression-coupled motif analyses identify an 11-mer motif within circHIPK3, which also becomes enriched in genes that are downregulated upon circHIPK3 depletion. By mining eCLIP datasets and combined with RNA immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrate that the 11-mer motif constitutes a strong binding site for IGF2BP2 in bladder cancer cell lines. Our results suggest that circHIPK3 can sequester IGF2BP2 as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA), leading to target mRNA stabilization. As an example of a circHIPK3-regulated gene, we focus on the <i>STAT3</i> mRNA as a specific substrate of IGF2BP2 and validate that manipulation of circHIPK3 regulates IGF2BP2-<i>STAT3</i> mRNA binding and, thereby, <i>STAT3</i> mRNA levels. Surprisingly, absolute copy number quantifications demonstrate that IGF2BP2 outnumbers circHIPK3 by orders of magnitude, which is inconsistent with a simple 1:1 ceRNA hypothesis. Instead, we show that circHIPK3 can nucleate multiple copies of IGF2BP2, potentially via phase separation, to produce IGF2BP2 condensates. Our results support a model where a few cellular circHIPK3 molecules can induce IGF2BP2 condensation, thereby regulating key factors for cell proliferation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87746">Optical mapping of ground reaction force dynamics in freely behaving Drosophila melanogaster larvae</a></h4>

              
                During locomotion, soft-bodied terrestrial animals solve complex control problems at substrate interfaces, but our understanding of how they achieve this without rigid components remains incomplete. Here, we develop new all-optical methods based on optical interference in a deformable substrate to measure ground reaction forces (GRFs) with micrometre and nanonewton precision in behaving <i>Drosophila</i> larvae. Combining this with a kinematic analysis of substrate-interfacing features, we shed new light onto the biomechanical control of larval locomotion. Crawling in larvae measuring ~1 mm in length involves an intricate pattern of cuticle sequestration and planting, producing GRFs of 1–7 µN. We show that larvae insert and expand denticulated, feet-like structures into substrates as they move, a process not previously observed in soft-bodied animals. These ‘protopodia’ form dynamic anchors to compensate counteracting forces. Our work provides a framework for future biomechanics research in soft-bodied animals and promises to inspire improved soft-robot design.

	<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disabilities with persistent impairments in cognition, communication, and social behavior. Although environmental factors play a role in ASD etiopathogenesis, a growing body of evidence indicates that ASD is highly inherited. In the last two decades, the dramatic rise in the prevalence of ASD has interested researchers to explore the etiologic role of epigenetic marking and incredibly abnormal DNA methylation. This review aimed to explain the current understanding of the association between changes in DNA methylation signatures and ASD in patients or animal models. We reviewed studies reporting alterations in DNA methylation at specific genes as well as epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs). Finally, we hypothesized that specific changes in DNA methylation patterns could be considered a potential biomarker for ASD diagnosis and prognosis and even a target for pharmacological intervention.</p>

                <p>The adult turtle spinal cord can generate multiple kinds of limb movements, including swimming, three forms of scratching, and limb withdrawal (flexion reflex), even without brain input and sensory feedback. There are many multifunctional spinal neurons, activated during multiple motor patterns, and some behaviorally specialized neurons, activated during only one. How do multifunctional and behaviorally specialized neurons each contribute to motor output? We analyzed in vivo intracellular recordings of multifunctional and specialized neurons. Neurons tended to spike in the same phase of the hip-flexor (HF) activity cycle during swimming and scratching, though one preferred opposite phases. During both swimming and scratching, a larger fraction of multifunctional neurons than specialized neurons were highly rhythmic. One group of multifunctional neurons was active during the HF-on phase and another during the HF-off phase. Thus, HF&ndash;extensor alternation may be generated by a subset of multifunctional spinal neurons during both swimming and scratching. Scratch-specialized neurons and flexion reflex-selective neurons may instead trigger their respective motor patterns, by biasing activity of multifunctional neurons. In phase-averaged membrane potentials of multifunctional neurons, trough phases were more highly correlated between swimming and scratching than peak phases, suggesting that rhythmic inhibition plays a greater role than rhythmic excitation. We also provide the first intracellular recording of a turtle swim-specialized neuron: tonically excited during swimming but inactive during scratching and flexion reflex. It displayed an excitatory postsynaptic potential following each swim-evoking electrical stimulus and thus may be an intermediary between reticulospinal axons and the swimming CPG they activate.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0065-24.2024?rss=1">Gaze and Arrows: Does the Gaze-Following Patch in the Posterior Temporal Cortex Differentiate Social and Symbolic Spatial Cues?</a></h4>

              
                <p>The gaze-following patch (GFP) is located in the posterior temporal cortex and has been described as a cortical module dedicated to processing other people's gaze-direction in a domain-specific manner. Thus, it appears to be the neural correlate of Baron-Cohen's eye direction detector (EDD) which is one of the core modules in his mindreading system&mdash;a neurocognitive model for the theory of mind concept. Inspired by Jerry Fodor's ideas on the modularity of the mind, Baron-Cohen proposed that, among other things, the individual modules are domain specific. In the case of the EDD, this means that it exclusively processes eye-like stimuli to extract gaze-direction and that other stimuli, which may carry directional information as well, are processed elsewhere. If the GFP is indeed EDD's neural correlate, it must meet this expectation. To test this, we compared the GFP's BOLD activity during gaze-direction following with the activity during arrow-direction following in the present human fMRI study. Contrary to the expectation based on the assumption of domain specificity, we did not find a differentiation between gaze- and arrow-direction following. In fact, we were not able to reproduce the GFP as presented in the previous studies. A possible explanation is that in the present study&mdash;unlike the previous work&mdash;the gaze stimuli did not contain an obvious change of direction that represented a visual motion. Hence, the critical stimulus component responsible for the identification of the GFP in the previous experiments might have been visual motion.</p>

                <p>by Hsun Chiang, Chih-Ang Chung</p>

Capillary plexus cultivation is crucial in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Theoretical simulations have been conducted to supplement the expensive experimental works. However, the mechanisms connecting mechanical and chemical stimuli remained undefined, and the functions of the different VEGF forms in the culture environment were still unclear. In this paper, we developed a hybrid model for simulating short-term <i>in vitro</i> capillary incubations. We used the Cellular Potts model to predict individual cell migration, morphology change, and continuum mechanics to quantify biogel deformation and VEGF transport dynamics. By bridging the mechanical regulation and chemical stimulation in the model, the results showed good agreement between the predicted network topology and experiments, in which elongated cells connected, forming the network cords and round cells gathered, creating cobblestone-like aggregates. The results revealed that the capillary-like networks could develop in high integrity only when the mechanical and chemical couplings worked adequately, with the cell morphology and haptotaxis driven by the soluble and bound forms of VEGF, respectively, functioning simultaneously.

                <p>by Simon K. S. Chu, Kush Narang, Justin B. Siegel</p>

Protein stability plays a crucial role in a variety of applications, such as food processing, therapeutics, and the identification of pathogenic mutations. Engineering campaigns commonly seek to improve protein stability, and there is a strong interest in streamlining these processes to enable rapid optimization of highly stabilized proteins with fewer iterations. In this work, we explore utilizing a mega-scale dataset to develop a protein language model optimized for stability prediction. ESM<sub>therm</sub> is trained on the folding stability of 528k natural and <i>de novo</i> sequences derived from 461 protein domains and can accommodate deletions, insertions, and multiple-point mutations. We show that a protein language model can be fine-tuned to predict folding stability. ESM<sub>therm</sub> performs reasonably on small protein domains and generalizes to sequences distal from the training set. Lastly, we discuss our model’s limitations compared to other state-of-the-art methods in generalizing to larger protein scaffolds. Our results highlight the need for large-scale stability measurements on a diverse dataset that mirrors the distribution of sequence lengths commonly observed in nature.

                <p>by Florian Borse, Dovydas Kičiatovas, Teemu Kuosmanen, Mabel Vidal, Guillermo Cabrera-Vives, Johannes Cairns, Jonas Warringer, Ville Mustonen</p>

Quantitative understanding of microbial growth is an essential prerequisite for successful control of pathogens as well as various biotechnology applications. Even though the growth of cell populations has been extensively studied, microbial growth remains poorly characterised at the spatial level. Indeed, even isogenic populations growing at different locations on solid growth medium typically show significant location-dependent variability in growth. Here we show that this variability can be attributed to the initial physiological states of the populations, the interplay between populations interacting with their local environment and the diffusion of nutrients and energy sources coupling the environments. We further show how the causes of this variability change throughout the growth of a population. We use a dual approach, first applying machine learning regression models to discover that location dominates growth variability at specific times, and, in parallel, developing explicit population growth models to describe this spatial effect. In particular, treating nutrient and energy source concentration as a latent variable allows us to develop a mechanistic resource consumer model that captures growth variability across the shared environment.
As a consequence, we are able to determine intrinsic growth parameters for each local population, removing confounders common to location-dependent variability in growth. Importantly, our explicit low-parametric model for the environment paves the way for massively parallel experimentation with configurable spatial niches for testing specific eco-evolutionary hypotheses.

                <p>by Yanel E. Bernardi, Estefania Sanchez-Vasquez, Rocío Belén Márquez, Michael L. Piacentino, Hugo Urrutia, Izadora Rossi, Karina L. Alcântara Saraiva, Antonio Pereira-Neves, Marcel I. Ramirez, Marianne E. Bronner, Natalia de Miguel, Pablo H. Strobl-Mazzulla</p>

While interactions between neural crest and placode cells are critical for the proper formation of the trigeminal ganglion, the mechanisms underlying this process remain largely uncharacterized. Here, by using chick embryos, we show that the microRNA (miR)-203, whose epigenetic repression is required for neural crest migration, is reactivated in coalescing and condensing trigeminal ganglion cells. Overexpression of miR-203 induces ectopic coalescence of neural crest cells and increases ganglion size. By employing cell-specific electroporations for either miR-203 sponging or genomic editing using CRISPR/Cas9, we elucidated that neural crest cells serve as the source, while placode cells serve as the site of action for miR-203 in trigeminal ganglion condensation. Demonstrating intercellular communication, overexpression of miR-203 in the neural crest in vitro or in vivo represses an miR-responsive sensor in placode cells. Moreover, neural crest-secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs), visualized using pHluorin-CD63 vector, become incorporated into the cytoplasm of placode cells. Finally, RT-PCR analysis shows that small EVs isolated from condensing trigeminal ganglia are selectively loaded with miR-203. Together, our findings reveal a critical role in vivo for neural crest-placode communication mediated by sEVs and their selective microRNA cargo for proper trigeminal ganglion formation.

                Background Industry 4.0 is a significant technical revolution that combines big data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cyber-physical systems to improve manufacturing productivity. This study investigates the impact of digital trust and sustainable attitude on perceived value and the intention to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. It also examines the moderating role of uncertainty avoidance in these relationships. Methods Data were collected from 189 employees of leading manufacturing companies in Indonesia that are recognized for their Industry 4.0 practices. The data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares (PLS) methodology with SmartPLS software to test the proposed hypotheses and explore the moderating effects. Results The findings reveal that both digital trust and sustainable attitude significantly influence perceived value. However, these factors do not directly affect the intention to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. Uncertainty avoidance moderates the relationship between digital trust and adoption intention. Specifically, in environments with high uncertainty avoidance, digital trust becomes a critical factor influencing the decision to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. Conclusions The study provides valuable insights for organizations aiming to implement Industry 4.0 initiatives. It highlights the importance of fostering digital trust and considering cultural dimensions, such as uncertainty avoidance, in their technology adoption strategies.

                Background Coding in medical procedures is crucial for patients, and errors made by hospital administration during the coding process can have an impact on both the financial results and the course of therapy. The present study aims to assess the accuracy of diagnostic and procedural codes as recorded by the hospital’s coders and to also evaluate their impact on the hospital’s revenue. Methods In a local hospital in Najran, Saudi Arabia, a cross-sectional observational analysis was conducted on patients with a clinical coder. The percentage of precision and error following the re-coding of cases was calculated using a statistical analysis. Results Primary diagnosis was incorrectly coded in 57 (26 per cent) records, and secondary diagnosis was incorrectly coded in 21 (9.9 per cent) records. Inaccurate medical labelling has been seen in emergency rooms, operating rooms, and gynaecology facilities. Discussion The percentage of records with the most incorrect coding was found to be 16 (7.5 per cent) in the emergency room, 10 (4.7 per cent) in the surgical clinic, and 5 (2.3 per cent) in the gynaecology/OBS clinic. Six (2.8 per cent) records in the private clinic had inaccurate secondary diagnoses, followed by four (1.9 per cent) and two (1 per cent) records in nephrology. Conclusion The percentage of inaccurate clinical codes in primary diagnoses reached (26.8 per cent) and the percentage of incorrect clinical codes in secondary diagnoses reached (9.9 per cent).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cannabis consumption has increased from 1.5% to 2.5% in Canada between 2012 and 2019. Clinical studies have indicated effects of prenatal cannabis exposure on birth weight, substance use, and neurodevelopmental disorders, but are confounded by several difficult to control variables. Animal models allow for examination of the mechanism of cannabis-induced changes in neurodevelopment and behavior, while controlling dose and timing. Several animal models of prenatal cannabis exposure exist which provide varying levels of construct validity, control of dose, and exposure to maternal stress. Using a voluntary oral consumption model, mouse dams received 5 mg/kg Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) whole cannabis oil in peanut butter daily from gestational day 1 (GD1) to postnatal day 10 (PD10). At GD1, GD18, PD1, PD10, and PD15, maternal plasma was collected; pup brains were collected from GD18 onward. Pup brains had higher levels of THC and cannabidiol at each time point, each of which persisted in maternal plasma and pup brains past the end of treatment (PD15). Male and female adolescent offspring were examined for changes to ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neuron activity and cocaine-seeking behavior. Prenatal and early postnatal (GD1–PD10) cannabis-exposed male, but not female mice had decreased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) input, depolarized resting membrane potential, and increased spontaneous firing of VTA dopamine neurons. Cannabis-exposed offspring showed faster decay of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) currents in both sexes. However, no differences in cocaine-seeking behavior were noted. These data characterize a voluntary prenatal cannabis exposure model and demonstrates VTA dopamine neuronal activity is disinhibited in offspring.</p>

                Improvements in DNA sequencing technology are allowing the dramatic increase of whole genome data for a wide variety of species. Such genome sequence data can assist the monitoring of intraspecific genetic diversity, but is often lacking for threatened species. In this project, we focused on the national Red List, a catalog of extinct and threatened species, issued by the Japanese government. We combined the data included in it with the record of genome assembly in NCBI and tabulated the assembly availability of the species in the list. The combined data shows a low percentage (2.1%) of the availability of whole genome sequence data for the taxa ranked on the Japanese Red List as well as a strong bias towards mammals and birds in Animalia and vascular plants in Plantae. Our data presentation highlights potential systematic limitations in genome sequencing (e.g., budget for sequencing large genomes of amphibians) and instructs future policies including which taxon needs more effort for genome sequencing. The resultant tables are available in the original website https://treethinkers.nig.ac.jp/redlist/ and are regularly updated.

<p>Proteoglycans are important multifunctional components of the central and peripheral nervous systems and represent a diverse group of specialized proteins that stabilize and functionalize these tissues.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Central and peripheral nervous system (CNS/PNS) proteoglycans (PGs) have diverse functional roles, this study examined how these control cellular behavior and tissue function. The CNS/PNS extracellular matrix (ECM) is a dynamic, responsive, highly interactive, space-filling, cell supportive, stabilizing structure maintaining tissue compartments, ionic microenvironments, and microgradients that regulate neuronal activity and maintain the neuron in an optimal ionic microenvironment. The CNS/PNS contains a high glycosaminoglycan content (60% hyaluronan, HA) and a diverse range of stabilizing PGs. Immobilization of HA in brain tissues by HA interactive hyalectan PGs preserves tissue hydration and neuronal activity, a paucity of HA in brain tissues results in a pro-convulsant epileptic phenotype. Diverse CS, KS, and HSPGs stabilize the blood–brain barrier and neurovascular unit, provide smart gel neurotransmitter neuron vesicle storage and delivery, organize the neuromuscular junction basement membrane, and provide motor neuron synaptic plasticity, and photoreceptor and neuron synaptic functions. PG-HA networks maintain ionic fluxes and microgradients and tissue compartments that contribute to membrane polarization dynamics essential to neuronal activation and neurotransduction. Hyalectans form neuroprotective perineuronal nets contributing to synaptic plasticity, memory, and cognitive learning. Sialoglycoprotein associated with cones and rods (SPACRCAN), an HA binding CSPG, stabilizes the inter-photoreceptor ECM. HSPGs pikachurin and eyes shut stabilize the photoreceptor synapse aiding in phototransduction and neurotransduction with retinal bipolar neurons crucial to visual acuity. This is achieved through Laminin G motifs in pikachurin, eyes shut, and neurexins that interact with the dystroglycan–cytoskeleton–ECM-stabilizing synaptic interconnections, neuronal interactive specificity, and co-ordination of regulatory action potentials in neural networks.</p>

                Synucleinopathies, including Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), are characterized by neuronal loss accompanied by α-synuclein (α-syn) accumulation in the brain. While research conventionally focused on brain pathology, there is growing interest in peripheral alterations. Erythrocytes, which are rich in α-syn, have emerged as a compelling site for synucleinopathies-related alterations. Erythrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), containing pathological α-syn species, can traverse the blood–brain barrier (BBB) under certain conditions and the gastrointestinal tract, where α-syn and gut microbiota interact extensively. This review explores the accumulating evidence of erythrocyte involvement in synucleinopathies, as well as their potential in disease pathogenesis and diagnosis. Given their unique properties, erythrocytes and erythrocyte-derived EVs may also serve as an ideal therapeutic platform for treating synucleinopathies and beyond.

                HERV-K(HML-2), the youngest clade of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), includes many intact or nearly intact proviruses, but no replication competent HML-2 proviruses have been identified in humans. HML-2-related proviruses are present in other primates, including rhesus macaques, but the extent and timing of HML-2 activity in macaques remains unclear. We have identified 145 HML-2-like proviruses in rhesus macaques, including a clade of young, rhesus-specific insertions. Age estimates, intact ORFs, and insertional polymorphism of these insertions are consistent with recent or ongoing infectious activity in macaques. 106 of the proviruses form a clade characterized by an ~750 bp sequence between <i>env</i> and the 3' LTR, derived from an ancient recombination with a HERV-K(HML-8)-related virus. This clade is found in Old World monkeys (OWM), but not great apes, suggesting it originated after the ape/OWM split. We identified similar proviruses in white-cheeked gibbons; the gibbon insertions cluster within the OWM recombinant clade, suggesting interspecies transmission from OWM to gibbons. The LTRs of the youngest proviruses have deletions in U3, which disrupt the Rec Response Element (RcRE), required for nuclear export of unspliced viral RNA. We show that the HML-8 derived region functions as a Rec-independent constitutive transport element (CTE), indicating the ancestral Rec-RcRE export system was replaced by a CTE mechanism.

                Functional interactions between the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, as revealed by strong oscillatory synchronization in the theta (6–11 Hz) frequency range, correlate with memory-guided decision-making. However, the degree to which this form of long-range synchronization influences memory-guided choice remains unclear. We developed a brain-machine interface that initiated task trials based on the magnitude of prefrontal-hippocampal theta synchronization, then measured choice outcomes. Trials initiated based on strong prefrontal-hippocampal theta synchrony were more likely to be correct compared to control trials on both working memory-dependent and -independent tasks. Prefrontal-thalamic neural interactions increased with prefrontal-hippocampal synchrony and optogenetic activation of the ventral midline thalamus primarily entrained prefrontal theta rhythms, but dynamically modulated synchrony. Together, our results show that prefrontal-hippocampal theta synchronization leads to a higher probability of a correct choice and strengthens prefrontal-thalamic dialogue. Our findings reveal new insights into the neural circuit dynamics underlying memory-guided choices and highlight a promising technique to potentiate cognitive processes or behavior via brain-machine interfacing.

                Hippocampal place cells in freely moving rodents display both theta phase precession and procession, which is thought to play important roles in cognition, but the neural mechanism for producing theta phase shift remains largely unknown. Here, we show that firing rate adaptation within a continuous attractor neural network causes the neural activity bump to oscillate around the external input, resembling theta sweeps of decoded position during locomotion. These forward and backward sweeps naturally account for theta phase precession and procession of individual neurons, respectively. By tuning the adaptation strength, our model explains the difference between ‘bimodal cells’ showing interleaved phase precession and procession, and ‘unimodal cells’ in which phase precession predominates. Our model also explains the constant cycling of theta sweeps along different arms in a T-maze environment, the speed modulation of place cells’ firing frequency, and the continued phase shift after transient silencing of the hippocampus. We hope that this study will aid an understanding of the neural mechanism supporting theta phase coding in the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96797">Unraveling the role of urea hydrolysis in salt stress response during seed germination and seedling growth in Arabidopsis thaliana</a></h4>

              
                Urea is intensively utilized as a nitrogen fertilizer in agriculture, originating either from root uptake or from catabolism of arginine by arginase. Despite its extensive use, the underlying physiological mechanisms of urea, particularly its adverse effects on seed germination and seedling growth under salt stress remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that salt stress induces excessive hydrolysis of arginine-derived urea, leading to an increase in cytoplasmic pH within seed radical cells, which, in turn, triggers salt-induced inhibition of seed germination (SISG) and hampers seedling growth. Our findings challenge the long-held belief that ammonium accumulation and toxicity are the primary causes of SISG, offering a novel perspective on the mechanism underlying these processes. This study provides significant insights into the physiological impact of urea hydrolysis under salt stress, contributing to a better understanding of SISG.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94509">Speech and music recruit frequency-specific distributed and overlapping cortical networks</a></h4>

              
                To what extent does speech and music processing rely on domain-specific and domain-general neural networks? Using whole-brain intracranial EEG recordings in 18 epilepsy patients listening to natural, continuous speech or music, we investigated the presence of frequency-specific and network-level brain activity. We combined it with a statistical approach in which a clear operational distinction is made between <i>shared</i>, <i>preferred,</i> and domain-<i>selective</i> neural responses. We show that the majority of focal and network-level neural activity is shared between speech and music processing. Our data also reveal an absence of anatomical regional selectivity. Instead, domain-selective neural responses are restricted to distributed and frequency-specific coherent oscillations, typical of spectral fingerprints. Our work highlights the importance of considering natural stimuli and brain dynamics in their full complexity to map cognitive and brain functions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94007">Multi-omic analysis of bat versus human fibroblasts reveals altered central metabolism</a></h4>

              
                Bats have unique characteristics compared to other mammals, including increased longevity and higher resistance to cancer and infectious disease. While previous studies have analyzed the metabolic requirements for flight, it is still unclear how bat metabolism supports these unique features, and no study has integrated metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics to characterize bat metabolism. In this work, we performed a multi-omics data analysis using a computational model of metabolic fluxes to identify fundamental differences in central metabolism between primary lung fibroblast cell lines from the black flying fox fruit bat (<i>Pteropus alecto</i>) and human. Bat cells showed higher expression levels of Complex I components of electron transport chain (ETC), but, remarkably, a lower rate of oxygen consumption. Computational modeling interpreted these results as indicating that Complex II activity may be low or reversed, similar to an ischemic state. An ischemic-like state of bats was also supported by decreased levels of central metabolites and increased ratios of succinate to fumarate in bat cells. Ischemic states tend to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which would be incompatible with the longevity of bats. However, bat cells had higher antioxidant reservoirs (higher total glutathione and higher ratio of NADPH to NADP) despite higher mitochondrial ROS levels. In addition, bat cells were more resistant to glucose deprivation and had increased resistance to ferroptosis, one of the characteristics of which is oxidative stress. Thus, our studies revealed distinct differences in the ETC regulation and metabolic stress responses between human and bat cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93983">Neural activity ramps in frontal cortex signal extended motivation during learning</a></h4>

              
                Learning requires the ability to link actions to outcomes. How motivation facilitates learning is not well understood. We designed a behavioral task in which mice self-initiate trials to learn cue-reward contingencies and found that the anterior cingulate region of the prefrontal cortex (ACC) contains motivation-related signals to maximize rewards. In particular, we found that ACC neural activity was consistently tied to trial initiations where mice seek to leave unrewarded cues to reach reward-associated cues. Notably, this neural signal persisted over consecutive unrewarded cues until reward-associated cues were reached, and was required for learning. To determine how ACC inherits this motivational signal we performed projection-specific photometry recordings from several inputs to ACC during learning. In doing so, we identified a ramp in bulk neural activity in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)-to-ACC projections as mice received unrewarded cues, which continued ramping across consecutive unrewarded cues, and finally peaked upon reaching a reward-associated cue, thus maintaining an extended motivational state. Cellular resolution imaging of OFC confirmed these neural correlates of motivation, and further delineated separate ensembles of neurons that sequentially tiled the ramp. Together, these results identify a mechanism by which OFC maps out task structure to convey an extended motivational state to ACC to facilitate goal-directed learning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97256">Energetic demands regulate sleep-wake rhythm circuit development</a></h4>

              
                Sleep and feeding patterns lack strong daily rhythms during early life. As diurnal animals mature, feeding is consolidated to the day and sleep to the night. In <i>Drosophila</i>, circadian sleep patterns are initiated with formation of a circuit connecting the central clock to arousal output neurons; emergence of circadian sleep also enables long-term memory (LTM). However, the cues that trigger the development of this clock-arousal circuit are unknown. Here, we identify a role for nutritional status in driving sleep-wake rhythm development in <i>Drosophila</i> larvae. We find that in the 2nd instar larval period (L2), sleep and feeding are spread across the day; these behaviors become organized into daily patterns by the 3rd instar larval stage (L3). Forcing mature (L3) animals to adopt immature (L2) feeding strategies disrupts sleep-wake rhythms and the ability to exhibit LTM. In addition, the development of the clock (DN1a)-arousal (Dh44) circuit itself is influenced by the larval nutritional environment. Finally, we demonstrate that larval arousal Dh44 neurons act through glucose metabolic genes to drive onset of daily sleep-wake rhythms. Together, our data suggest that changes to energetic demands in developing organisms trigger the formation of sleep-circadian circuits and behaviors.

	<p>Self-ambivalence, a prevalent phenomenon in daily life, has been increasingly substantiated by research. It refers to conflicting self-views and evaluations, primarily concerning self-worth and morality. Previous behavioral research has distinguished self-worth and moral ambivalence, but it remains unclear whether they have separable neural bases. The present study addressed this question by examining resting-state brain activity (i.e., the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, fALFF) and connectivity (i.e., resting-state functional connectivity, RSFC) in 112 college students. The results found that self-worth ambivalence was positively related to the fALFF in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and left superior parietal lobule (SPL). The RSFC strength between the SPL and precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) was positively related to self-worth ambivalence. Moral ambivalence was positively associated with the fALFF in the left SPL (extending into the temporoparietal junction) and right SPL. The RSFC strengths between the left SPL/TPJ and OFC, as well as the RSFC strengths between the right SPL as a seed and the bilateral middle and inferior temporal gyrus, were associated with moral ambivalence. Overall, the neural bases of self-worth and moral ambivalence are associated with the SPL and OFC, involved in attentional alertness and value representation, respectively. Additionally, the neural basis of moral ambivalence is associated with the TPJ, responsible for mentalizing.</p>

	<p>In recent decades, the debate on consciousness has been conditioned by the idea of bottom-up emergence, which has influenced scientific research and raised a few obstacles to any attempt to bridge the explanatory gap. The analysis and explanation of vision conducted according to the accredited methodologies of scientific research in terms of physical stimuli, objectivity, methods, and explanation has encountered the resistance of subjective experience. Moreover, original Gestalt research into vision has generally been merged with cognitive neuroscience. Experimental phenomenology, building on the legacy of Gestalt psychology, has obtained new results in the fields of amodal contours and color stratifications, light perception, figurality, space, so-called perceptual illusions, and subjective space and time. Notwithstanding the outcomes and the impulse given to neuroscientific analyses, the research carried out around these phenomena has never directly confronted the issue of what it means to be conscious or, in other words, the nature of consciousness as self-referentiality. Research has tended to focus on the percept. Therefore, explaining the non-detachability of parts in subjective experience risks becoming a sort of impossible achievement, similar to that of Baron Munchausen, who succeeds in escaping unharmed from this quicksand by pulling himself out by his hair. This paper addresses how to analyze seeing as an undivided whole by discussing several basic dimensions of phenomenal consciousness on an experimental basis and suggesting an alternative way of escaping this quicksand. This mind-set reversal also sheds light on the organization and dependence relationships between phenomenology, psychophysics, and neuroscience.</p>

	<p>Studies on decision-making have classically focused exclusively on its cognitive component. Recent research has shown that a further essential component of decisional processes is the emotional one. Indeed, the emotional route in decision-making plays a crucial role, especially in situations characterized by ambiguity, uncertainty, and risk. Despite that, individual differences concerning such components and their associations with individual traits, decisional styles, and psychophysiological profiles are still understudied. This pilot study aimed at investigating the relationship between individual propensity toward using an emotional or cognitive information-processing route in decision-making, EEG and autonomic correlates of the decisional performance as collected via wearable non-invasive devices, and individual personality and decisional traits. Participants completed a novel task based on realistic decisional scenarios while their physiological activity (EEG and autonomic indices) was monitored. Self-report questionnaires were used to collect data on personality traits, individual differences, and decisional styles. Data analyses highlighted two main findings. Firstly, different personality traits and decisional styles showed significant and specific correlations, with an individual propensity toward either emotional or cognitive information processing for decision-making. Secondly, task-related EEG and autonomic measures presented a specific and distinct correlation pattern with different decisional styles, maximization traits, and personality traits, suggesting different latent profiles.</p>

	<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is primarily characterized by core deficits in social skills, communication, and cognition and by repetitive stereotyped behaviors. These manifestations are variable between individuals, and ASD pathogenesis is complex, with over a thousand implicated genes, many epigenetic factors, and multiple environmental influences. The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) mediated brain reward system is held to play a key role, but the rapidly expanding literature reveals intricate, nuanced signaling involving a wide array of mesolimbic loci, neurotransmitters and receptor subtypes, and neuronal variants. How altered DA signaling may constitute a downstream convergence of the manifold causal origins of ASD is not well understood. A clear working framework of ASD pathogenesis may help delineate common stages and potential diagnostic and interventional opportunities. Hence, we summarize the known natural history of ASD in the context of emerging data and perspectives to update ASD reward signaling. Then, against this backdrop, we proffer a provisional framework that organizes ASD pathogenesis into successive levels, including (1) genetic and epigenetic changes, (2) disrupted mesolimbic reward signaling pathways, (3) dysregulated neurotransmitter/DA signaling, and finally, (4) altered neurocognitive and social behavior and possible antagonist/agonist based ASD interventions. This subdivision of ASD into a logical progression of potentially addressable parts may help facilitate the rational formulation of diagnostics and targeted treatments.</p>

	<p>Breast cancer (BC) and depression are globally prevalent problems. Numerous reviews have indicated the high prevalence of depression among BC survivors. However, the long-term impact of depression on survival among BC survivors has not been well explored. For this investigation, we aimed to explore the relationship between BC, depression, and mortality from a national random sample of adult American women. Data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (years 2005&amp;amp;ndash;2010) were linked with mortality data from the National Death Index up to December 31st, 2019. A total of 4719 adult women (ages 45 years and older) were included in the study sample with 5.1% having breast cancer and more than a tenth (12.7%) having depression. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality risk among those with BC was 1.50 (95% CI = 1.05&amp;amp;ndash;2.13) compared to those without BC. In the adjusted analysis, the risk of all-cause mortality was highest among women with both depression and BC (HR = 3.04; 95% CI = 1.15&amp;amp;ndash;8.05) compared to those without BC or depression. The relationship between BC and mortality was moderated by cardiovascular diseases, anemia, smoking, age, PIR, and marital status. Our analysis provides vital information on factors that could be helpful for interventions to reduce mortality risk among those with BC and depression. In addition, given the higher risk of mortality with co-occurring BC and depression, collaborative healthcare practices should help with widespread screening for and treatment of depression among BC survivors.</p>

	<p>Mild cognitive impairment impacts a sizable segment of the older population, and often evolves into dementia within a few years. At this stage, subjects may benefit from non-pharmacological therapies that can delay or stop the progression of the mild cognitive impairment into dementia and are crucial for improvement in the subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s quality of life, while also being easily accessible and safe for use. Many research studies have shown that a variety of exercises, including cognitive training, have the potential to enhance or optimize cognitive function and general well-being. Recently, many authors have suggested video games as a promising approach for cognitive training and neurorehabilitation in older people, thanks to their increasing motivation and training effects through immersion in stimulating environments. Under this premise, our narrative review&amp;amp;rsquo;s objective is to discuss and summarize the body of existing material on the role of video games in improving cognitive performance, daily life activities, and depression symptoms in older individuals with different levels of cognitive decline. From the papers reviewed, it emerged that older subjects trained with video games showed a significant improvement in cognitive functions, sleep quality, and psychiatric symptoms, positioning video games as an intriguing and useful tool.</p>

	<p>Purpose: This study aims to highlight the feasibility of an olfactory training program entirely monitored through online media in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Classic olfactory training was performed with a sample with olfactory loss due COVID-19 (n = 11). Participants were engaged on a weekly video call in order to improve adherence and collect information regarding the number of correct answers and the individuals&amp;amp;rsquo; perception of olfactory function. The olfactory status after training was compared to two groups, one composed of participants who contracted COVID-19 but did not report olfactory loss (n = 11) and a sample composed of healthy participants (n = 11). Results: The experimental group showed improvements throughout the training period (TDI score on week 0 was 20.3 (5.6) and 24.6 (4.3) for week 12, and on week 24 was 25.4 (6.2) (F = 5.115, df = 2, 20, p = 0.016), and post hoc tests showed that participants significantly improved their TDI score in W12 compared to W0 (SMD = 0.869, p = 0.041) and in W24 compared to W0 (SMD = 0.859, p = 0.041). The experimental group showed lower scores when compared with both groups, and the no OT COVID-19 group showed lower scores than the healthy control group, even though they did not report olfactory alterations. Conclusions: Findings suggest that the strategies applied to improve adherence were successful since 100% of the sample completed the training adherence, offering a valuable framework for future olfactory training studies.</p>

<p>This study addresses a clinically relevant knowledge gap – whether low-dose interleukin-2 (LD-IL-2) treatment long after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is still effective for chronic post-traumatic headache (PTH) and cognitive impairments. We have found that LD-IL-2 treatment preferentially expands meningeal regulatory T (Treg) cells, thereby abolishing PTH-related behaviors and memory deficit in mice with a wide therapeutic time window. This identifies Treg as a cellular target and LD-IL-2 as a promising therapy for mTBI with the potential of reducing polypharmacy.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite the high prevalence, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)-induced chronic headache and cognitive deficits are poorly understood and lack effective treatments. Low-dose interleukin-2 (LD-IL-2) treatment soon after mTBI or overexpressing IL-2 in brain astrocytes prior to injury protects mice from developing post-traumatic headache (PTH)-related behaviors and cognitive decline. The present study addresses a clinically relevant knowledge gap: whether LD-IL-2 treatment long after the initial injury is still effective for chronic PTH and cognitive deficits.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>mTBI was induced by a noninvasive closed-head weight drop method. LD-IL-2 was administered 4–6 weeks post-mTBI to assess its effects on chronic PTH-related facial mechanical hypersensitivity as well as mTBI-induced impairment in novel object recognition and object location tests. Endogenous regulatory T (Treg) cells were depleted to investigate the mechanism of action of LD-IL-2.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Delayed LD-IL-2 treatment abolished chronic PTH-related behaviors. It also completely reversed mTBI-induced cognitive impairment in both male and female mice. Treg cell depletion not only prolonged PTH-related behaviors but also abolished the effects of LD-IL-2. Interestingly, LD-IL-2 treatment significantly increased the number of Treg cells in dura but not in brain tissues.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results suggest that the beneficial effects of LD-IL-2 treatment are mediated through the expansion of meningeal Treg cells. Collectively, our study identifies Treg as a cellular target and LD-IL-2 as a promising therapy for both chronic PTH and mTBI-induced cognitive impairment for both males and females, with a wide therapeutic time window and the potential of reducing polypharmacy in mTBI treatment.

                The field of rodent behavioral neuroscience is undergoing two major sea changes: an ever-growing technological revolution, and worldwide calls to consider sex as a biological variable (SABV) in experimental design. Both have enormous potential to improve the precision and rigor with which the brain can be studied, but the convergence of these shifts in scientific practice has exposed critical limitations in classic and widely used behavioral paradigms. While our tools have advanced, our behavioral metrics – mostly developed in males and often allowing for only binary outcomes – have not. This opinion article explores how this disconnect has presented challenges for the accurate depiction and interpretation of sex differences in brain function, arguing for the expansion of current behavioral constructs to better account for behavioral diversity.

	<p>Sex differences in the effect of prolonged sitting time on anxiety symptoms have not yet been explored. This study examined the sex-specific association between prolonged sitting time and anxiety prevalence in Korean adults. Community-dwelling adults aged &amp;amp;gt;18 years who underwent a cross-sectional structured study survey of physical activity and mental health tests were enrolled as part of the Kangbuk Samsung Hospital Cohort Study from 2012 to 2019. The prevalence of anxiety was evaluated using the Clinically Useful Anxiety Outcome Scale (CUXOS) questionnaire. The mean daily sitting time was 7.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.4 h in men and 6.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.6 h in women. After adjustments for possible confounding factors, the adjusted mean CUXOS score was the highest in participants sitting for &amp;amp;ge;10 h, followed by 5&amp;amp;ndash;9 h, and &amp;amp;lt;5 h, in that order. In the post-hoc Bonferroni analysis, there were significant differences in the adjusted mean CUXOS scores in group comparisons. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted after adjusting for potential confounding factors. A prolonged sitting time was positively associated with an increased prevalence of anxiety in both men and women, with stronger associations in women than in men. It is necessary to prevent anxiety by adjusting or reducing sitting time in adults, especially women.</p>

	<p>Background: Stroke guideline statements are important references for clinicians due to the rapidly evolving nature of treatments. Guideline statements should be informed by up-to-date systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) because they provide the highest level of evidence. To investigate the utilization of SRs/MAs in stroke management guidelines, we conducted a literature review of guidelines and extracted relevant information regarding SRs/MAs. Methods: A literature review was conducted in PubMed with supplementation using the Trip medical database with the term &amp;amp;ldquo;stroke&amp;amp;rdquo; as the target population, followed by using the filter &amp;amp;ldquo;guidelines&amp;amp;rdquo;. We extracted the number of included SRs/MAs, the years of publication, the country of origin, and other characteristics of interest. Descriptive statistics were generated using the R software version 4.2.1. Results: We included 27 guideline statements. The median number of overall SRs or MAs within the guidelines was 4.0 (interquartile range [IQR] = 2&amp;amp;ndash;9). For MAs only, the median number included in the guidelines was 3.0 (IQR = 2.0&amp;amp;ndash;5.5). Canadian guidelines had the oldest citations, with a median gap of 12.0 (IQR = 5.2&amp;amp;ndash;18.0) years for the oldest citation, followed by European (median = 12; IQR = 9.5&amp;amp;ndash;13.5) and US (median = 10.0; IQR = 5.2&amp;amp;ndash;16) guidelines. Conclusions: Stroke guideline writing groups and issuing bodies should devote greater effort to the inclusion of up-to-date SRs/MAs in their guideline statements so that clinicians can reference recent data with the highest level of evidence.</p>

                <p>Glutamatergic synapses exhibit significant molecular diversity, but circuit-specific mechanisms that underlie synaptic regulation are not well characterized. Prior reports show that Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) Tiam1 regulates perforant path-&gt;dentate gyrus granule neuron synapses. In the present study, we report Tiam1's homolog Tiam2 is implicated in glutamatergic neurotransmission in CA1 pyramidal neurons. We find that Tiam2 regulates evoked excitatory glutamatergic currents via a postsynaptic mechanism mediated by the catalytic Dbl-homology domain. Overall, we present evidence for RhoGEF Tiam2's role in glutamatergic synapse function at Schaffer collateral-&gt;CA1 pyramidal neuron synapses.</p>

                Fibroadenoma of the breast most often arises during the late teens and early reproductive years. It is the most prevalent tumor in women < 30 years. After the age of 40 to 45, fibroadenomas are rarely observed as new masses in women. Fibroadenomas are made up of both epithelial and stromal components. Fibroadenoma is the most frequent type of breast tumor. It is crucial to diagnose preoperatively, both clinically and pathologically, by using F.N.A.C. Postoperatively, Fibroadenoma is confirmed histopathology. However, malignant transformation is very rare in Fibroadenoma of the breast. Early identification, accurate analysis, and appropriate management are advantageous. The current study's goal is to examine preoperative and postoperative clinicopathological aspects of Fibroadenoma and to assess any differences between preoperative and postoperative diagnosis in patients admitted to Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Sawangi (M), Wardha, Maharashtra, India.

                Background/Objectives A drug-related problem (DRP) is an event or circumstance involving drug therapy that actually or potentially interferes with desired health outcomes. The aim of this study is to identify and categorize the DRPs associated with the use of antibiotics in women undergoing cesarean delivery and to analyze the causes of these problems, making an improvement proposal of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) use in accordance with international guidelines. Methods Observational, retrospective, descriptive study of 814 women undergoing cesarean delivery. Prescription adequacy was assessed based on the selection, administration, dose and duration of the antibiotic therapy. DRP analysis and characterization was conducted using the Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe (PCNE) Classification V 9.1. Results DRPs were detected in all women (1125, 1.38 DRPs/patient), the most frequent ones associated to failure to administer PAP (30.10% of patients) and to unnecessary postsurgical antibiotic (100%). Of the 1935 possible causes for DRPs identified, most of them were related to inappropriate drug selection. Cefazolin was administered to 98.07% of women with PAP and 71.45% of patients received postsurgical cefalexin, with 13 different antibiotics being used in total. Conclusions The implementation of therapeutic protocols and early identification of DRPs is proposed in order to optimize antibiotic use in the institution.

                Synaptotagmin-1 is a synaptic vesicle transmembrane protein that senses calcium influx via its tandem C2-domains, triggering synchronous neurotransmitter release. Disruption to SYT1 is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting the importance of identifying high-quality research reagents to enhance understanding of Synaptotagmin-1 in health and disease. Here we have characterized thirteen Synaptotagmin-1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Background The utilization of zein and gum arabic has grown in an attempt to formulate wall materials based on protein–polysaccharide complexes. This mixture provides a versatile shelter for hydrophilic (guava leaf extract, GLE) or lipophilic (fish oil, FO) bioactive compounds from unwanted environmental factors, and it can be used as an edible film-forming polymer. This study was undertaken to characterize FO-containing edible films that were double-layered with a film containing GLE. Methods Modified zein and gum arabic solutions (MG complex) were mixed at a ratio of 1:1.5 (v/v), adjusted to pH 5, added with glycerol (20% of the complex) and FO (5% of the complex), and finally adjusted to pH 5. This was prepared as the bottom/lower layer. The upper/active layer was prepared by mixing MG complex, glycerol, and GLE (1, 3, and 5% w/v of the complex). Physical, mechanical, microstructural, thermal, microbiological, and oxidative measurements were also performed. Results The total phenolic and flavonoid contents in GLE were 15.81 mg GAE/g extract and 6.99 mg QE/g extract, respectively. The IC50 of the DPPH radical scavenging activity of GLE was 26.86 ppm with antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli of 9.83 and 12.55 mm. The total plate counts of films double-layered with a film containing GLE were retained below 3 log CFU/g during 28-day storage. The peroxide values of these films were dimmed for no more than 9.08 meq/kg sample on day 28 of storage. Thickness (872.00-971.67 μm), water vapor transmission rate (12.99-17.04 g/m2/day), tensile strength (1.56-2.02 kPa), elongation at break (61.53-75.41%), glass transition (52.74-57.50°C), melting peak (131.59-142.35°C), inhibition against B. subtilis (33.67-40.58 mm), and inhibition against E. coli (2.05-9.04 mm) were obtained by double-layer films. Conclusions GLE can be successfully incorporated into the active layer of a double-layer film to improve its characteristics while significantly slowing down the microbial contamination and oxidation rate.

                Background The profound impacts of climate change on the environment, economy, and society are anticipated to significantly influence smallholder farmers, whose livelihoods and traditional ways of life are inextricably intertwined with the natural environment. This comprehensive study delves into the multifaceted factors shaping the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices and their subsequent effects on crop productivity among the small-scale farming communities in Nyimba District, situated within Zambia. Methods The study collected data from 194 smallholder farmer households across 12 villages in 4 agricultural camps of Nyimba District between June and July 2022. A logistic regression model was utilized to assess the factors influencing crop production and the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices in response to climate change and variability within the study area. Furthermore, propensity score matching was performed to evaluate the impacts of adopting climate-smart agriculture by comparing adopter households with their non-adopter counterparts. Results The logit regression model’s findings from the research indicate that several factors influence smallholder farmer households’ adoption of climate-smart agricultural techniques and crop productivity. These factors include the farmer’s educational level, household size, fertilizer utilization, the household head’s age and gender, farming experience duration, livestock ownership status, annual household income, farmland size, the household head’s marital status, and access to climate-related information. Additionally, the propensity score matching analysis revealed that crop yields among smallholder farmers who adopted climate-smart agricultural practices were 20.20% higher compared to non-adopters. Furthermore, the analysis showed that implementing such practices in the study area led to a 21.50% increase in maize yields for adopter households relative to their non-adopter counterparts. Conclusion The findings of this research offer valuable insights to policymakers, guiding them in enhancing farmers’ climate change adaptation strategies and formulating relevant policies. Nevertheless, these initiatives and concerted efforts possess the potential to mitigate the detrimental impacts posed by climate change and climatic variability.

Slow-wave sleep (SWS), characterized by slow oscillations (SOs, <1Hz) of alternating active and silent states in the thalamocortical network, is a primary brain state during Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep. In the last two decades, the traditional view of SWS as a global and uniform whole-brain state has been challenged by a growing body of evidence indicating that SO can be local and can coexist with wake-like activity. However, the mechanisms by which global and local SOs arise from micro-scale neuronal dynamics and network connectivity remain poorly understood. We developed a multi-scale, biophysically realistic human whole-brain thalamocortical network model capable of transitioning between the awake state and SWS, and we investigated the role of connectivity in the spatio-temporal dynamics of sleep SO. We found that the overall strength and a relative balance between long and short-range synaptic connections determined the network state. Importantly, for a range of synaptic strengths, the model demonstrated complex mixed SO states, where periods of synchronized global slow-wave activity were intermittent with the periods of asynchronous local slow-waves. An increase in the overall synaptic strength led to synchronized global SO, while a decrease in synaptic connectivity produced only local slow-waves that would not propagate beyond local areas. These results were compared to human data to validate probable models of biophysically realistic SO. The model producing mixed states provided the best match to the spatial coherence profile and the functional connectivity estimated from human subjects. These findings shed light on how the spatio-temporal properties of SO emerge from local and global cortical connectivity and provide a framework for further exploring the mechanisms and functions of SWS in health and disease.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is the progressive form of liver steatosis, the most common liver disease, and substantially increases the mortality rate. However, limited therapies are currently available to prevent MASH development. Identifying potential pharmacological treatments for the condition has been hampered by its heterogeneous and complex nature. Here, we identified a hepatic nonneuronal cholinergic signaling pathway required for metabolic adaptation to caloric overload. We found that cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 2 subunit (CHRNA2) is highly expressed in hepatocytes of mice and humans. Further, CHRNA2 is activated by a subpopulation of local acetylcholine-producing macrophages during MASH development. The activation of CHRNA2 coordinates defensive programs against a broad spectrum of MASH-related pathogenesis, including steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Hepatocyte-specific loss of CHRNA2 signaling accelerates the disease onset in different MASH mouse models. Activation of this pathway via pharmacological inhibition of acetylcholine degradation protects against MASH development. Our study uncovers a hepatic nicotinic cholinergic receptor pathway that constitutes a cell-autonomous self-defense route against prolonged metabolic stress and holds therapeutic potential for combatting human MASH.

<p>The two-intruders test is easy to perform, the time-effective and robust approach to assess and analyze a wide range of social communication traits in mice imitating most natural conditions. This test is indispensable in studies assessing the competitive nature of male- and female-driven behaviors and the underlying neural mechanisms in animal models.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Understanding the complex dynamics of social communication behaviors, such as exploration, communication, courtship, mating, and aggression in animal models, is crucial to reveal key neural and hormonal mechanisms underlying these behaviors. The two-intruders test is designed to investigate residents' behavior toward both male and female intruders within the home cage of the test male. During this test imitating natural conditions, several aspects of social interaction were investigated: Exploration, courtship, mating, and aggressive behavior. As mating and aggression involve overlapping neural circuits, the behavioral setup testing both behaviors is best at reflecting their competitive nature. Our findings demonstrate that resident male mice exhibit strong preference to communicate with a female intruder, which correlates with baseline testosterone levels of test males. Relevant female preference in the two-intruders test was also found in BALB/c males. Behavioral breakdown revealed the anogenital sniffing as a key behavioral feature that discriminates resident male behavior toward intruders of different sex. Furthermore, resident male interaction with female intruder was accompanied by neuronal activation in the ventromedial hypothalamus. We demonstrate that odor recognition underlies preference toward females in male residents, as experimental anosmia reduced communication with a female intruder. We conclude the two-intruders test setup to be a useful tool to study the neurological basis of social communication in animal models, which provides detailed analysis of various aspects of the laboratory animals’ social behavior in the most natural conditions.</p>
