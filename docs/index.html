                <p><i>SCN3B</i> encodes the β3 auxiliary subunit, essential for voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> (Nav) channel trafficking and gating. Although <i>SCN3B</i> has been associated with cardiac disorders, a link with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) has not been established. Using a genotype-first approach, we identified homozygous truncating variants (c.281G&gt;A-β3<sup>W94*</sup>, c.584 + 1G&gt;A-β3<sup>S196*</sup>) in 2 consanguineous Pakistani families, leading to global developmental delay, intellectual disability and autism, with severe cognitive impairment, ataxia, and seizures in the case of β3<sup>W94*</sup>. Electrophysiological analysis revealed subtype-specific gating alterations on multiple brain Nav channel subtypes. This is the first report linking <i>SCN3B</i> mutations to NDD, expanding our understanding of Nav channelopathies. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Pang et al. demonstrate that crossing nerve transfer restores motor function after peripheral nerve injury by enhancing interhemispheric cortical connectivity and reorganizing descending motor pathways. The contralateral motor cortex reinnervates the injured forelimb through strengthened cortico-rubro-spinal, rather than corticospinal, pathways. These findings identify therapeutic targets for nerve injury rehabilitation.

">Tension shapes memory: Computational insights into neural plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Mechanical forces have recently emerged as critical modulators of neural communication, yet their role in high-level cognitive functions remains poorly understood. Here, we present a biologically inspired spiking neural network model that integrates mechanical tension, vesicle dynamics, and spike-timing-dependent plasticity to examine how tension influences learning, memory, and cognitive operations such as pattern completion, projection, and association. We find that increased tension enhances synaptic efficiency by accelerating vesicle clustering and recovery, resulting in a 67% improvement in memory recall speed and a 17% increase in inter-regional synchrony during projection relative to relaxed states. Conversely, a 20% reduction in tension leads to a 31% decline in memory association performance, highlighting the tension-sensitive accessibility of stored information. The model further reveals that networks with 20% inhibitory neurons achieve optimal spatial precision in memory encoding and recall. Together, these in silico findings position mechanical tension as a functional neuromodulator and suggest new directions for neuromorphic design and energy-efficient, living computing platforms.

">Social Touch Suppresses Aggression via Thalamic Mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the neural circuitry underlying aggression is critical for both scientific insight and clinical intervention. Here, we identify the posterior intralaminar thalamic nucleus (PIL) as a key node in an anti-aggressive circuit activated by social touch. Using a rodent model, we demonstrate that deprivation of direct physical contact during social isolation leads to heightened aggression. Chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations reveal that PIL neurons activated by social touch inhibit aggression via excitatory projections to the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of the hypothalamus. This PIL-to-MPOA pathway is suppressed by input from the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH). Our findings establish a novel thalamic-hypothalamic circuit that mediates social touch-induced suppression of aggression, offering potential targets for therapeutic intervention in conditions marked by pathological aggression.

">Investigating motion-induced signal corruption in steady-state diffusion MRI</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Diffusion-weighted steady-state free precession (DW-SSFP) is a diffusion imaging sequence achieving high SNR efficiency and strong diffusion-weighting. A key challenge for in vivo DW-SSFP is the sequence's severe motion sensitivity, currently limiting investigations to low or no motion regimes. Here we establish a framework to both (1) investigate and (2) correct for the impact of subject motion on the DW-SSFP signal. Theory and Methods: An extended phase graphs (EPG) representation of the DW-SSFP signal was established incorporating a motion operator describing rigid body and pulsatile motion. The representation was validated using Monte Carlo simulations, and subsequently integrated into a data fitting routine for motion estimation and correction. The fitting routine was evaluated using both simulations and experimental 2D low-resolution single-shot timeseries DW-SSFP data acquired in a human brain, with a tensor reconstructed from the motion-corrected experimental DW-SSFP data. Results: The proposed EPG-motion framework gives excellent agreement to complementary Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating that diffusion coefficient estimation is robust over a range of motion and SNR regimes. Tensor estimates from the motion-corrected experimental DW-SSFP data give excellent visual agreement to complementary DW-SE data acquired in the same subject. Conclusion: Temporal information capturing the evolution of the DW-SSFP signal can be used to retrospectively (1) estimate subject motion and (2) reconstruct motion-corrected DW-SSFP data. Open-source software is provided, facilitating future investigations into the impact of subject-motion on DW-SSFP acquisitions.

">α-Synuclein driven cell susceptibility in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Early cellular events in Parkinson's disease (PD) remain elusive. While aggregation of -synuclein (Syn) into Lewy bodies marks advanced pathology, smaller Syn oligomers have been implicated in prodromal stages. Here we map Syn oligomers at single-particle resolution in post-mortem brain tissue from Braak stage 3/4 PD cases and matched controls. Quantitative imaging of 9,882 neurons across four regions captured over 112 million Syn oligomers. Mean intracellular Syn burden was unchanged between groups, but PD samples contained a higher fraction of neurons whose oligomer load exceeded a specific aggregation threshold. We term these aggregation-susceptible cells (ASCs). ASC enrichment in vulnerable regions supports a population-level model in which early pathology arises from a stochastic shift in cellular composition rather than altered Syn aggregation kinetics. This human-tissue, large-scale dataset provides a quantitative framework for detecting ASCs and for testing population-level interventions in PD and related proteinopathies.

">GPC5 expression highlights astrocytic heterogeneity and divergent hippocampal responses in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Dementia</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are central to central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis and memory consolidation. They also display remarkably heterogeneous morphological phenotypes, functions and molecular profiles between and within distinct regions of the human brain. Yet, their role in regional vulnerability in neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) remains poorly understood. To elucidate this subregional heterogeneity of astrocytes in the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex and its implication for neurodegeneration, we employed high-content neuropathology, integrating chromogenic immunohistochemistry (cIHC) and digital pathology, to map and quantify the expression of functional astrocytic markers (GFAP, ALDH1L1, AQP4, GPC5 and ALDH7A1) of healthy individuals, of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). We found that astrocytic markers followed distinct expression patterns in AD and PDD. In AD, GFAP was strongly reduced in specific hippocampal regions, whereas AQP4 was increased and GPC5 expression, although regionally stable, was locally associated with amyloid and tau pathology. In PDD, astrocytic responses were characterized by selective decreases in ALDH1L1 and ALDH7A1, with GFAP and GPC5 remaining largely unaffected. Notably, GFAP and GPC5 expression delineated distinct astrocytic subtypes that were differentially distributed across hippocampal subfields and showed specific responses to AD and PD pathologies. These findings provide new insights into the landscape of astrocytic heterogeneity in the human hippocampus and beyond, revealing disease- and region-specific astrocytic signatures. Importantly, they underscore the value of incorporating novel markers such as GPC5 to fully capture astrocytic diversity and to better understand astrocyte contributions to neurodegeneration.

">MCA: A Multicellular analysis Calcium Imaging toolbox for ImageJ</a></h4>

              
                Functional imaging using genetically encoded indicators, such as GCaMP, has become a foundational tool for in vivo experiments and allows for the analysis of cellular dynamics, sensory processing, and cellular communication. However, large scale or complex functional imaging experiments pose analytical challenges. Many programs have worked to create pipelines to address these challenges, however, most platforms require proprietary software, impose operational restrictions, offer limited outputs, or require significant knowledge of various programming languages, which collectively can limit utility. To address this, we designed MCA (a Multicellular Analysis toolkit) to work with ImageJ, a widely used open-source software which has been the standard image analysis platform for the last 30 years. We developed MCA to be visually intuitive, utilizing ImageJs platform to generate new images based on completed tasks so users can visually see each step in the analysis pipeline. In addition, MCA implements a user-friendly GUI providing a simple interface which resembles other native ImageJ plugins. We incorporated functionality for rigid registration to correct motion artifacts, algorithms for cell body prediction, and methods for annotating cells and exporting data. For cell prediction, we trained a custom model in Cellpose 2.0 for segmentation of nuclei expressing pan-neuronal nuclear localized GCaMP in zebrafish. We validated the accuracy of MCA output to previously published zebrafish calcium imaging data which elicited visually evoked neuronal responses. To show the versatility of MCA, we also show that our software can be utilized for multiple sensory modalities, brain regions, and multiple model organisms including Drosophila and mouse. Together these data show that MCA is viable for extracting calcium dynamics in a user-friendly environment for multiple forms of functional imaging.

">Probing the content of semantic representations in body-selective regions</a></h4>

              
                The extrastriate body area (EBA) has been known to selectively respond to human body parts, but recent work suggests it may encode richer scene semantics. However, it remains unclear what aspects of natural scenes constitute the semantic representation in the EBA. Here we address this question by analyzing the relationship between object co-occurrence in natural scene captions and EBA responses predicted by caption-based encoding models. This revealed object category pairs associated with EBA activity, leading to the hypothesis that EBA encodes the speed of human body motion implied in scenes. A subsequent behavioral experiment and correlation analyses confirmed this, showing strong correlations between EBA responses and implied motion ratings. In addition, the representation of implied body motion extends into the fusiform body area (FBA). Variance partitioning further showed that while body-related features such as the number of people and body size also contributed, implied motion uniquely explained the largest portion of EBA and FBA responses. Overall, semantic representations in body-selective regions are jointly shaped by multiple body-related features, with implied motion as the primary contributor. Our co-occurrence-based approach, combined with brain-to-model mapping methods, offers a novel, interpretable framework for understanding high-level visual representations in natural scene perception.

                Nociception, a phenomenon crucial for animal survival, deploys evolutionarily conserved molecular mechanisms. Among invertebrate species, cephalopods are of particular interest as they possess a well-developed brain speculated to be able to encode pain-like states. This has led to their inclusion in the Directive 2010/63 EU for welfare protection. However, the molecular mechanisms of nociception in cephalopods are still poorly characterised and it is important to address this knowledge gap to better understand cephlapods capacity to express pain states. Here we describe a bioinformatic pipeline utilising conserved nociceptive genes, to identify the orthologous candidates in the Octopus vulgaris transcriptome. We identified 51 genes we predict to function in nociception. These add to the mechanosensory TRPN and the unique chemotactile receptors recently identified in octopus suckers, thus expanding the set of genes that merit further functional characterisation in cephalopods. We therefore selected 38 orthologues in Caenorhabditis elegans, a tractable experimental platform and tested loss of function mutant strains of distinct functional gene classes (e.g., osm-9, egl-3, frpr-3) in a low pH avoidance paradigm. This identified 18 nociceptive-related genes to be prioritised for further functional characterisation in O. vulgaris.

">PMAT enhances sexual dimorphism of fear behaviors and facilitates female mice's generalized contextual fear extinction</a></h4>

              
                Enhanced signaling of dopamine and/or serotonin during highly arousing situations can be reduced or terminated by monoamine transporters. One such transporter, plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT, Slc29a4), attenuates both dopamine and serotonin signaling. An absence of selective pharmacological inhibitors means genetically modified mice constitutively deficient in PMAT remain the best tool with which to study PMAT's organism-level functional effects. Fear conditioning is a high arousal process. Generalization of fear is an evolutionarily advantageous process, whereby information learned from one experience is applied to other new but similar encounters. Pathological fear generalization, in contrast, is a core feature of most anxiety disorders. Given our previous findings indicating PMAT function reduces male mice's context fear and enhances extinction of female mice's cued fear, we hypothesized that PMAT would similarly reduce generalization (i.e., enhance discrimination) of context and cued fear in male and female mice, respectively. Our context and cued fear conditioning experiments in adult PMAT wildtype (+/+) and heterozygous (+/-) male and female mice partially supported our hypotheses. We discovered PMAT functions to facilitate extinction of contextually generalized fear, plus subsequent extinction of context-specific fear, selectively in females. Moreover, when specific fear cues or contexts were temporally presented before cues or contexts that were similar enough to make generalization possible, PMAT enhanced biological sex differences. Growing evidence reports common PMAT polymorphisms elicit measurable effects when PMAT function is reduced. Thus, we suspect future experiments may reveal positive associations between PMAT polymorphisms and risk for anxiety disorder symptoms, particularly in people assigned female at birth. Inclusion of these genetic variations in pharmacogenomic analyses may prove therapeutically beneficial.

">Pre-conscious reactions to faces as the biological roots of emotion perception</a></h4>

              
                Bodies respond to others emotions through subtle physiological changes. Whether these responses require conscious emotion recognition is debated. Here, we examined the relationship between visual awareness and physiological arousal in response to emotional faces. We recorded facial electromyography (EMG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and pupil dilation during the presentation of fearful, happy, and neutral faces, as well as their phase-scrambled versions, to the left eye. Meanwhile, rapidly changing Mondrian patterns were displayed to the right eye to suppress the left-eye stimuli. Participants pressed a button when they noticed a change from the flickering mask. This setup allowed us to compare behavioural and physiological responses during conscious versus subconscious processing of emotional content. Results showed faster breakthrough times for happy faces and moderate physiological responses to emotional information, even without conscious perception. Specifically, pupils and facial EMG were more responsive to fearful than to happy or neutral expressions. EDA was higher for faces compared to control stimuli, regardless of the emotional expression. Once visual awareness was established, emotional expressions elicited distinct responses that aligned with the perceived emotion. An exploratory analysis revealed a negative correlation between pupil dilation and autistic, alexithymic, and schizotypal traits, whereas empathy traits correlated positively. Our findings highlight the role of subcortical visual processing in detecting emotionally relevant stimuli and show that social abilities are linked to the physiological processing of emotions at a subconscious level. They underscore how subcortical mechanisms interact with the autonomic nervous system, enhancing our understanding of the biological foundations of emotion perception.

">Inflammation-enhanced synapse-specific phagocytosis by adult APP microglia in a microfluidic neuron-microglia co-culture model</a></h4>

              
                Microglia play a critical role in synapse remodeling and neuroinflammation, both of which are dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, most in vitro models rely on neonatal or immortalized microglia, limiting their relevance to adult pathophysiological context. Here, we present a compartmentalized microfluidic co-culture platform that enables spatially controlled interactions between primary cortical neurons and adult microglia from wild-type (WT) and APP-transgenic mice. This system allows precise functional analysis of microglia-synapse interactions under defined inflammatory conditions. Upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, APP microglia exhibited exaggerated morphological activation, elevated IL-1{beta} secretion, and selectively increased engulfment of synaptic material. In contrast, phagocytosis of non-specific substrates such as pHrodoTM Zymosan remained unchanged, suggesting a substrate-specific enhancement of microglial phagocytic activity. Blocking the complement receptor CD11b abolished the LPS-induced increase in synaptic uptake, confirming the role of complement-dependent pathways. Transcriptomic profiling revealed robust inflammatory responses in both genotypes, with selectively heightened expression of proinflammatory genes in APP microglia, consistent with a primed immune phenotype. Importantly, increased synaptic uptake occurred without measurable loss of global synaptic connectivity, highlighting the specificity and sensitivity of the system to detect microglial functional changes. This model captures genotype-dependent microglial reactivity (revealing phenotypes not fully captured by transcriptomic profiling) and provides a physiologically relevant, tractable in vitro platform for dissecting microglial contributions to synaptic pathology in neurodegenerative disease.

">Age-related cerebello-thalamo-cortical white matter degradation and executive function performance across the lifespan</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum supports higher-order cognition, such as working memory and executive function (EF) both directly and through connection with prefrontal areas via cortical loops. Thus, age-related degradation to white matter connectivity comprising cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) loops may underlie age-related differences in EF. In 190 healthy adults (aged 20-94 years) we collected diffusion tensor imaging scans and multiple tests of working memory and EF. Deterministic tractography was used to generate CTC tracts from which white matter metrics (mean, radial, axial diffusivities) were extracted. General linear model results indicated that reduced white matter integrity (i.e., higher diffusivity) was associated with significantly poorer EF performance in an age-dependent fashion. Higher mean, radial, and axial diffusivities in fronto-cerebellar white matter was associated with lower EF scores in older, but not younger, adults. These findings suggest CTC white matter connectivity is important for executive function performance and lend mechanistic evidence to the role of the cerebellum in age-related differences in higher-order cognitive operations.

">Adjudicating competing theories of semantic representation with 7T-fMRI and multivariate decoding</a></h4>

              
                Theories of semantic representation in the brain are numerous and contradictory and are supported by an equally contradictory literature of multivariate neuroimaging studies. Equipped with two pioneering tools - (1) a 7T-fMRI acquisition sequence capable of capturing signal in crucial ventral temporal regions, and (2) four innovative decoding methods that are designed to probe specific hypotheses about the nature of the semantic code - we resolve this confusion. Evidence best supports the hypothesis that the ventral anterior temporal lobe represents complex, multidimensional semantic information via an interdependent, dynamic code similar to that observed in neural networks. Similar representations - highly variable across individuals - were discovered in posterior temporal and occipitotemporal cortex. In summary, this work adjudicates competing theories of semantic cognition, thereby reconciling the discrepancy in results between multivariate imaging and other sources of evidence - neuropsyschology, noninvasive brain stimulation, intracranial electrophysiology, and neural network modelling.

">Developmental relationships between the human alpha rhythm and intrinsic neural timescales are dependent on neural hierarchy</a></h4>

              
                Maturation of human brain structure has been well-studied, but developmental changes to brain physiology are not as well understood. One consistent finding is that the peak alpha rhythm frequency (PAF) increases throughout childhood. Another is that resting-state functional connectivity shifts from sensorimotor regions in children to association regions in adolescents, a reorganization along a hierarchy called the sensorimotor-to-association (S-A) axis. In mature brains, the S-A axis has been parcellated physiologically using the duration of persistent neural activity, known as the intrinsic neural timescale (INT), which increases along the hierarchy. Here we studied the development of PAF and INT in a cohort of epilepsy patients 3 to 33 years of age undergoing intracranial electrocorticographic (ECoG) monitoring. Given the well-known developmental trajectory of PAF, and the ability to delineate hierarchy using INT, we hypothesized that changes to PAF and INT would correlate across development, but that their relationship may be influenced by hierarchy. Consequently, we predicted that age-dependent PAF increases would accompany INT decreases, and we tested whether their relationship varied between sensorimotor and association regions. We found that PAF increased significantly with age in both sensorimotor and association regions, while age-dependent INT decreases were only significant in association regions. Supporting this finding, we found a strong negative relationship between PAF and INT that was specific to association regions. Together, our results suggest that developmental divisions across the S-A axis manifest in the relationships between neurophysiological measures, providing further evidence that asynchronous development along the S-A axis depends on maturation of brain function.

">Inner speech and the neurobiology of psychosis</a></h4>

              
                Aberrations of inner speech have been linked to psychotic symptoms such as thought insertion and auditory verbal hallucinations. These symptoms may reflect failures of prediction and source monitoring. Normally, efference copies of speech motor commands are sent to auditory cortices and suppressed, helping distinguish self-generated from external input. If suppression malfunctions, predicted auditory input may become perceptually salient. Further, if self-monitoring or error detection-related regions are also impaired (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex, ACC), inner speech may be misattributed as external. We tested this proposal using neuroimaging meta-analyses, examining how the brain systems in overt and inner speech production in neurotypical participants overlap with findings from psychosis-spectrum participants performing a range of tasks. They showed increased activity in motor-related regions associated with inner speech (e.g., ventral premotor cortices) and decreased grey matter in bilateral auditory cortices and ACC, in regions specific to overt speech. Coactivation-based network analyses revealed that these ventral premotor and auditory regions form distinct, inversely coupled audiomotor networks. Classification suggests the ventral premotor network supports 'higher-level' language processing, while the audiomotor network supports 'lower-level' speech and self-referential processing. Overall, results accord with the proposal that psychotic symptoms like auditory verbal hallucinations derive from phenotypic hyperactivation in inner speech-related regions that yield affectively salient efference copy signals that are insufficiently suppressed and monitored as self-produced. In line with a hierarchical predictive-processing account, disruption of a distributed recurrent system distorts self-awareness and conscious experience.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Time-dependent features are present in many sensory stimuli. In the sensory cortices, timing features of stimuli are represented by spatial and temporal code. A potential mechanism by which cortical networks may perform temporal-to-spatial conversion is “reservoir computing.” The state of a recurrently-connected network, or a reservoir, represents current and prior inputs. In this experimental study, we determined whether the state of an isolated cortical network represents temporal information in the inputs. We used patterned optogenetic stimulation of dissociated primary rat cortical cultures. We delivered input sequences of patterns where one of the patterns occurred at different times in each sequence. The state of these experimental networks contained information about input sequences for at least a second, with at least 100-ms precision. Accurate classification required many neurons, suggesting that timing information was encoded via population code. Trajectory of the network state was largely determined by spatial features of the stimulus, with temporal features having a more subtle effect. The duration of spatial information retention was &gt; 2 s, similar to duration of short-term memory in the primary visual cortex. We concluded that local reservoir computation may be a plausible mechanism for temporal-to-spatial code conversion in sensory cortices.</span>

                <p>The interface barrier between the brain surface and the adjacent meninges is important for regulating exchanges of fluid, protein, and immune cells between the CNS and periphery. However, the cell types that form this important interface are not yet fully defined. To address this limitation, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell spatial transcriptomics together with morphological lineage tracing and immunostaining to describe the cell types forming the interface barrier of the adult murine cortex. We show that the cortical interface is composed of three major cell types, leptomeningeal cells, border astrocytes, and tissue-resident macrophages. On the nonparenchymal side, the interface is composed of transcriptionally distinct PDGFR&alpha;-positive leptomeningeal cells that are intermingled with macrophages. This leptomeningeal layer is lined by a population of transcriptionally distinct border astrocytes. The interface neighborhood is rich in growth factor mRNAs, including many leptomeningeal ligands predicted to act on both the border astrocytes and macrophages. On the CNS side of the interface is the relatively cell-sparse cortical layer 1 containing interneurons, microglia, parenchymal astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and oligodendrocytes. Except for the border astrocytes, layer 1 cells are not closely associated with the interface, suggesting that secreted ligands may be the major way the brain interface communicates with the underlying cortical parenchyma. Thus, our data provide a molecular/cellular resource describing the brain interface cell types and their interactions, thereby enabling future studies investigating how this distinct cellular compartment regulates CNS:periphery interactions.</p>

                <p>Autonomic imbalance&mdash;particularly reduced activity from brainstem parasympathetic cardiac vagal neurons (CVNs)&mdash;is a major characteristic of many cardiorespiratory diseases. Therapeutic approaches to selectively enhance CVN activity have been limited by the lack of defined, translationally relevant targets. Previous studies have identified an important excitatory synaptic pathway from oxytocin (OXT) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus to brainstem CVNs, suggesting that OXT could provide a key selective excitation of CVNs. In clinical studies, intranasal OXT has been shown to increase parasympathetic cardiac activity, improve autonomic balance, and reduce obstructive event durations and oxygen desaturations in obstructive sleep apnea patients. However, the mechanisms by which activation of hypothalamic OXT neurons, or intranasal OXT, enhance brainstem parasympathetic cardiac activity remain unclear. CVNs are located in two cholinergic brainstem nuclei: nucleus ambiguus (NA) and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMNX). In this study, we characterize the colocalization of OXT receptors (OXTRs) in both CVNs and non-CVN cholinergic neurons in the male and female mouse NA and DMNX nuclei. We found that OXT receptors are highly expressed in CVNs in the DMNX, but not in the NA. OXT increases the firing of DMNX CVN, with no effect on NA CVNs. Selective chemogenetic excitation of OXTR+ CVNs in the DMNX&mdash;achieved by a combination of Cre- and flp-dependent DREADD expression&mdash;evoked a rapid and sustained bradycardia. These findings suggest that activation of DMNX CVNs expressing OXTR with oxytocin may represent a novel translational therapeutic target for restoring autonomic balance in cardiorespiratory disorders.</p>

Mathematical theory that accounts for the stochastic character of spike sequences of IP<sub>3</sub>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling calculates the probability distributions of the features of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> time course, their moments and correlations. Including slow feedback from [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to components of the pathway poses a challenge to stochastic modelling. Here, we present a stochastic model that takes this feedback into account, allows for a non-linear dependency of the open probability of the Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor channel (IP<sub>3</sub>R) on the feedback variable and the inclusion of more than one feedback with different relaxation time scales. We use this novel modelling approach to describe the effect of ER depletion by non-linear rate expressions for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (CICR) and the measured non-linear IP<sub>3</sub>-dependency of the open probability as part of the dynamic feedback. Our theory can calculate spike amplitude distributions, correlation coefficients (C<sub>c</sub>) of interspike intervals (ISIs) and amplitudes, simulate ISI distributions and calculate their moments. We apply it to experiments with HEK293 cells. We find very good agreement between theoretical ISI distributions and their moments with experimental results. Many measured C<sub>c</sub>s show positive values in accordance with the ideas formulated by our theory. Surprisingly, most ISI-amplitude correlations are weak despite the decay of negative feedback during the ISI, which affects spike probability. We even find negative values of C<sub>c</sub>s, which indicate feedback that decreases the open probability of IP<sub>3</sub>R with increasing ISI. The components of the pathway causing this anticorrelation have not yet been identified. Our data suggest that they involve components that are subject to cell variability.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003333">Attractive serial dependence arises during decision-making</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jiangang Shan, Jasper E. Hajonides, Nicholas E. Myers</p>

Recall of stimuli is biased by stimulus history, variously manifested as an attractive bias toward or repulsive bias from previous stimuli (i.e., serial dependence). It is unclear when attractive versus repulsive biases arise and if they share neural mechanisms. A recent model of attractive serial dependence proposes a two-stage process in which adaptation causes a repulsive bias during encoding that is later counteracted by an attractive bias at the decision-making stage in a Bayesian-inference-like manner. Neural evidence exists for a repulsive bias at encoding, but evidence for the attractive bias during the response period has been more elusive. We recently (Hajonides et al., J Neurosci 43:2730–40, 2023) showed in a working memory task that while different stimuli in trial history exerted different (attractive or repulsive) serial biases on behavioral reports, during encoding the neural representation of the current item was always repulsively biased. Here, we assessed whether this discrepancy between neural and behavioral effects is resolved during subsequent decision-making. Multivariate decoding of human magnetoencephalography data during working memory recall showed a neural distinction between attractive and repulsive biases that is consistent with the two-stage model: an attractive neural bias was found in recall period. And stimuli that created a repulsive bias on behavior led to an early repulsive neural bias that is likely to have already been incorporated during the encoding phase. The neural attractive bias late in the trial was replicated in an independent electroencephalogram experiment. Our results suggest that attractive (but not repulsive) serial dependence arises during decision-making, and that priors that influence post-perceptual decision-making are updated by the previous trial’s target, but not by other stimuli.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitors have shown promising results in treatment of plexiform neurofibromas in neurofibromatosis type 1 patients, but data in adults are limited. The aim of this phase 2 study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of trametinib in adults with neurofibromatosis type 1.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Thirty patients with a diagnosis of generalized or mosaic neurofibromatosis type 1 and a symptomatic inoperable plexiform neurofibroma were treated with 2mg trametinib per day. Primary outcome measures were partial response rate on tumor volume at cycle 12 and overall partial response rate. Partial response was defined as ≥20% decrease in tumor volume compared to baseline as measured with 3-dimensional volumetric analysis on magnetic resonance imaging every sixth cycle. Secondary outcome measures were pain, pain interference, quality of life, and toxicity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Partial response rate after cycle 12 was 47% (n = 14/30). Overall partial response rate was 50% (n = 15/30). Median best response was −22% decrease of tumor volume (range: −63 to +7%), and median time until best response was 12 cycles (range: 6–42 cycles). Pain score and pain interference were significantly decreased after 12 cycles of treatment. No change in quality of life was reported. Acneiform rash and fatigue were the most reported adverse events. Overall rate of treatment discontinuation because of adverse events was 40%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We observed a positive effect of trametinib on tumor volume and significant pain reduction in adults with plexiform neurofibromas. However, adverse events are common and frequently led to early termination of treatment. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Lueg et al. discovered that deregulated MYC increases cancer cell sensitivity to N-myristoyltransferase inhibitors (NMTis). Mitochondrial dysfunction upon NMTi occurs selectively in high-MYC contexts through impaired complex I via effects on the NMT substrate and complex I assembly factor NDUFAF4. An approach for targeting MYC-driven cancers is revealed.

They highlight therapeutic strategies targeting the matrix-nucleus axis by tuning matrix properties, mechano-priming cells, and targeting mechanosensitive molecules, providing a promising paradigm for disease treatment and tissue regeneration.

                Hahn et al. use male rhesus macaques as a model to characterize the immunological consequences of cross-sex estrogen therapy in primates. 17β-estradiol suppresses endogenous testosterone production, induces female physical traits, and following mRNA vaccination, leads to increased T cell activation and modulation of immune gene expression.

                Gancedo-Verdejo et al. reveal age-associated molecular changes in mouse hippocampus and an age-dependent effect of environmental enrichment, focusing on 3D chromatin structure and gene expression. Environmental enrichment promotes aging-like changes in young mice, likely related to brain maturation; conversely, it reverts age-related alterations in old mice, suggesting neuronal rejuvenation.

                Ablation of lysosomal polyamine transporter ATP13A2 causes lysosome dysfunction, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Samaddar et al. demonstrate that ATP13A2 loss causes lysosomal accumulation of polyamines, which, in turn, disrupts Parkinson’s disease-linked lipid hydrolase β-glucocerebrosidase via lysosome deacidification and reduced enzyme-membrane electrostatic interactions in lysosomes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97860">The gut contractile organoid for studying the gut motility regulated by coordinating signals between interstitial cells of Cajal and smooth muscles</a></h4>

              
                The gut undergoes peristaltic movements regulated by intricate cellular interactions. How these interactions emerge in the developing gut remains poorly explored due to a lack of model system. We here developed a novel contractile organoid that is derived from the muscle layer of chicken embryonic hindgut. The organoid contained smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs; pacemaker) with few enteric neurons and underwent periodic contractions. The organoid was formed by self-organization with morphological arrangements of ICCs (internal) and SMCs (peripheral), allowing identification of these cells in live. GCaMP-Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging analyses revealed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients between ICC-ICC, SMC-SMC, or SMC-ICC were markedly coordinated. Pharmacological studies further suggested a role of gap junctions in ICC-to-SMC signaling, and also possible mechanical feedback from SMC’s contraction to ICC’s pace-making activities. In addition, two organoids with different rhythms became synchronized when mediated by SMCs, unveiling a novel contribution of SMCs to ICC’s pace-making. The gut contractile organoid developed in this study offers a useful model to understand how the rhythm coordination between/among ICCs and SMCs is regulated and maintained during gut development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107093">Risk-taking incentives predict aggression heuristics in female gorillas</a></h4>

              
                Competition is commonly reflected in aggressive interactions among groupmates as individuals try to attain or maintain higher social ranks that can offer them better access to critical resources. In this study, we investigate the factors that can shift competitive incentives against higher- or lower-ranking groupmates, that is, more or less powerful individuals. We use a long-term behavioural data set on five wild groups of the two gorilla species starting in 1998, and we show that most aggression is directed from higher- to lower-ranking adult females close in rank, highlighting rank-reinforcement incentives. Yet, females directed 42% of aggression to higher-ranking females than themselves. Females targeted groupmates of higher rank with increasing number of males in the group, suggesting that males might buffer female–female aggression risk. Contrarily, they targeted females of lower rank with increasing number of females in the group, potentially because this is a low-risk option that females prefer when they have access to a larger pool of competitors to choose from. Lactating and pregnant females, especially those in the latest stage of pregnancy, targeted groupmates of higher rank than the groupmates that cycling females targeted, suggesting that energetic needs may motivate females to risk confrontation with more powerful rivals. Our study provides critical insights into the evolution of competitive behaviour, showing that aggression heuristics, the simple rules that animals use to guide their aggressive interactions, are not merely species-specific but also dependent on the conditions that populations and individuals experience.

">A common representational code for event and object concepts in the brain</a></h4>

              
                Events and objects are two fundamental ways in which humans conceptualize their experience of the world. Despite the significance of this distinction for human cognition, it remains unclear whether the neural representations of object and event concepts are categorically distinct or, instead, can be explained in terms of a shared representational code. We investigated this question by analyzing fMRI data acquired from human participants (males and females) while they rated their familiarity with the meanings of individual words (all nouns) denoting object and event concepts. Multivoxel pattern analyses indicated that both categories of lexical concepts are represented in overlapping fashion throughout the association cortex, even in the areas that showed the strongest selectivity for one or the other type in univariate contrasts. Crucially, in these areas, a feature-based model trained on neural responses to individual event concepts successfully decoded object concepts from their corresponding activation patterns (and vice versa), showing that these two categories share a common representational code. This code was effectively modeled by a set of experiential feature ratings, which also accounted for the mean activation differences between these two categories. These results indicate that neuroanatomical dissociations between events and objects emerge from quantitative differences in the cortical distribution of more fundamental features of experience. Characterizing this representational code is an important step in the development of theory-driven brain-computer interface technologies capable of decoding conceptual content directly from brain activity.

">The Role of the Basal Ganglia in the Human Cognitive Architecture: A Dynamic Causal Modeling Comparison Across Tasks and Individuals</a></h4>

              
                Researchers agree input from the basal ganglia (BG) to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays an important role in cognition, but they disagree on its computational properties. Theoretical models characterize the majority of BG input as either direct (directly transmitting information to the PFC), or modulatory (indirectly influencing PFC activity through the gating of signals from other cortical areas). To determine the computational nature of these BG-PFC inputs in cognition, we tested three alternative connectivity configurations (Direct, Modulatory, and Mixed) within a large-scale cognitive architecture. This architecture, the Common Model of Cognition, has been independently validated using fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). The Direct model reflected the standard CMC configuration, featuring a bidirectional, direct connection between the BG and PFC modules. The Modulatory model removed this direct link, instead incorporating a unidirectional connection from the PFC to the BG and two modulatory pathways from the BG to the PFC that passed through other cortical modules. The Mixed model included both direct and modulatory connections. Using fMRI data from 200 HCP participants performing six cognitive tasks and one resting-state session, we applied Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) to estimate and compare the influence of these different BG-PFC connectivity patterns. Here, we show that for each of the six cognitive tasks and resting state, the Mixed model consistently outperformed the Direct and Modulatory models. The next best model depended on the specific cognitive task, suggesting the ability for the BG to flexibly adapt to various task demands. Taken together, the current data provide evidence for a likely set of core computations that the BG uses to differentially regulate cortical activity.

">The Microglial Trem2 R47H Alzheimer's Disease Risk Variant Impairs Early Hippocampal Synaptic Remodeling</a></h4>

              
                The rare R47H variant of the microglial TREM2 gene increases Alzheimers disease (AD) risk, but its effects on early hippocampal circuitry remain unclear. We examined basal synaptic transmission and synaptic density in 3-week-old Trem2 R47H knockin mice using in vitro whole-cell patch clamp recordings and immunohistochemistry. R47H mice displayed increased synaptic density in CA1 and CA3 regions, consistent with a trend towards increased spontaneous excitatory current frequency. Evoked synaptic currents, miniature EPSCs and spontaneous inhibitory current frequency were unaltered. Microglia shape synaptic circuits in early development by removing inactive synapses. Thus, inhibition of this role due to the Trem2 R47H mutation decreases the microglial reshaping of hippocampal connectivity during early postnatal development, without overtly altering basal synaptic activity. With ongoing synaptic plasticity, such early structural changes may predispose neural circuits to later dysfunction, particularly in the context of AD pathology, highlighting the importance of microglial TREM2 in developmental synaptic refinement.

">Evolution of Cajal-Retzius Cells in Vertebrates from an Ancient Class of Tp73+ Neurons</a></h4>

              
                In the developing cerebral cortex, Cajal Retzius (CR) cells are early-born neurons that orchestrate the development of mammalian-specific cortical features. However, this cell type has not been conclusively identified in non-mammalian species. Here we studied neurons expressing Tp73, a transcription factor specifically expressed in most mammalian CR cells. Comparisons of chicken, salamander, zebrafish, and little skate data indicate that Tp73-expressing neurons have conserved spatial distribution and transcriptomic signatures in vertebrates. Among the conserved Tp73-expressing cell types we find CR cells andTp73+ external tufted cells (ETCs) in the olfactory bulb of jawed vertebrates. ETCs and CR cells share the expression of most "canonical" CR cell transcription factors, such as Tp73, Lhx1, Lhx5, Ebf3, and Nr2f2, indicating that they are sister cell types. Our findings suggest that CR and ETCs evolved in stem vertebrates from cells involved in olfactory processing, with CR cells progressively acquiring new specialized roles in developmental signaling.

">Adaptive generalization and efficient learning under uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                People often use recognizable features to infer the value of novel consumables. This "generalization" strategy is known to be beneficial in stable environments, such that individuals can use previously learned rules and values in efficiently exploring new situations. However, it remains unclear whether and how individuals adjust their generalization strategy in volatile environments where previously learned information becomes obsolete. We hypothesized that individuals adaptively use generalization by continuously updating their beliefs about the credibility of the feature-based reward generalization model at each state. Our data showed that participants used generalization more when the novel environment remained consistent with the previously learned monotonic association between feature and reward, suggesting efficient utilization of prior knowledge. Against other accounts, we found that individuals incorporated an arbitration mechanism between feature-based value generalization and model-based learning based on volatility tracking. Notably, our suggested model captured differential impacts of generalization dependent on the context-volatility, such that individuals who were biased the most toward generalization showed the lowest learning errors when the value of stimuli are generalized along the recognizable feature, but showed the highest errors in a volatile environment. This work provides novel insights into the adaptive usage of generalization, orchestrating two distinctive learning mechanisms through monitoring their credibility, and highlights the potential adverse effects of overgeneralization in volatile contexts.

">Voltage Imaging of CA1 Pyramidal Cells and SST+ Interneurons Reveals Stability and Plasticity Mechanisms of Spatial Firing</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal place cells (PCs) are important for spatial coding and episodic memory. PCs' representations are modulated upon transitioning between environments (global remapping) but also change with repeated exposure to familiar spaces (representational drift). To gain insights into the mechanistic basis for this unique balance between circuit plasticity and stability, we used voltage imaging to longitudinally record the subthreshold and spiking activity of pyramidal neurons (PNs) and somatostatin-positive (SST) interneurons in CA1 during virtual navigation. A fraction of cells from both populations showed spatial representations, but many SSTs were speed-tuned or fired uniformly across space. Intracellular recordings revealed increased theta power and asymmetric ramp-like depolarization in PN place fields, while SSTs exhibited symmetric depolarization with no theta increase. Longitudinal recordings across weeks demonstrated representational drifts in both populations, although SSTs exhibited remarkably stable firing and subthreshold properties. Transition to a novel environment induced remapping in both populations, accompanied by increase in SST activity and reduction in PNs. These results provide new insights into how hippocampal circuits balance representational stability with experience-dependent plasticity.

">Connectivity of serotonin neurons reveals a constrained inhibitory subnetwork within the olfactory system.</a></h4>

              
                Inhibitory local interneurons (LNs) play an essential role in sensory processing by refining stimulus representations via a diverse collection of mechanisms. The morphological and physiological traits of individual LN types, as well as their connectivity within sensory networks, enable each LN type to support different computations such as lateral inhibition or gain control and are therefore ideal targets for modulatory neurons to have widespread impacts on network activity. In this study, we combined detailed connectivity analyses, serotonin receptor expression, neurophysiology, and computational modeling to demonstrate the functional impact of serotonin on a constrained LN network in the olfactory system of Drosophila. This subnetwork is composed of three LN types and we describe each of their distinctive morphology, connectivity, biophysical properties and odor response properties. We demonstrate that each LN type expresses different combinations of serotonin receptors and that serotonin differentially impacts the excitability of each LN type. Finally, by applying these serotonin induced changes in excitability to a computational model that simulates the impact of inhibition exerted by each LN-type, we predict a role for serotonin in adjusting the dynamic range of antennal lobe output neurons and in noise reduction in odor representations. Thus, a single modulatory system can differentially impact LN types that subserve distinct roles within the olfactory system.

">Neuron morphological physicality and variability define the non-random structure of connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Connectivity in neuronal networks is characterized by high complexity that is required for the correct function of the circuitry. Our attempts to capture it has thus far been limited to the addition of individual features of complexity to stochastic models, leading to limited insights into its origin. Based on the idea that the morphologies of neurons underlies the network structure, we developed an intuitive explanation for the mechanisms leading to structured, non-random connectivity. While a class of neurons on average innervates its entire surroundings, each individual one can only cover a small part of the space. That part is different for each neuron, but in a way that is not completely random, as it must be spatially continuous due to the physicality of neurites. We tested predictions from our hypothesis successfully in biophysically-detailed models and an electron-microscopic (EM) reconstruction of cortical connectivity. We distilled it into a simple stochastic algorithm that generates networks, which accurately match the EM reconstruction in basic network statistics as well as functionally relevant metrics of complexity. Our work may improve the understanding of the impact of neuron malformations and enable the study of the functional role of non-random network structure in simplified models.

">Individual differences shape conceptual representation in the brain</a></h4>

              
                Each person experiences the world through a unique conceptual lens, shaped by personal experiences, natural variations, or disease. These individual differences have remained largely inaccessible to cognitive neuroscience and clinical neurology, limiting the development of precision medicine approaches to cognitive disorders. To overcome this limitation, here we develop a new statistical framework to measure and interpret individual differences in functional brain representations. We apply this framework to characterize how different individuals represent the same concepts. Twenty-four participants listened to narrative stories while their brain activity was measured with functional MRI (fMRI). Encoding models were used to recover how hundreds of concepts were represented in each person's brain. Despite listening to identical stories, participants showed systematic individual differences in conceptual representations. These differences reveal person-specific biases in how concepts are represented in the brain. Individual variability was highest in regions that represent social information. Because these regions are thought to integrate sensory information with personal beliefs and experiences, the observed individual differences may reflect cognitive traits unique to each person. Our work reveals that individual differences are a systematic, measurable principle of conceptual representations in the human brain. By enabling researchers to measure and interpret differences in person-specific functional brain representations, our work establishes a new paradigm for precision neuroscience. This paradigm provides a rigorous foundation for developing fMRI applications in precision medicine to diagnose and monitor cognitive disorders.

">Predictive encoding of auditory sequences in the human prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Humans extract regularities from the environment to form expectations that guide perception and optimize behavior. Although the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is central to this process, the relative contributions of orbitofrontal (OFC) and lateral PFC (LPFC) remain unclear. Here, we show that the brain tracks sound regularities in an auditory deviance detection task to predict when a target deviant will occur. Intracranial EEG in epilepsy patients reveals prefrontal engagement, with earlier expectancy-related modulation in OFC and later modulation in LPFC. Connectivity analyses indicate bidirectional but asymmetrical expectancy-related information exchange between the two areas with a first lead by OFC, consistent with its role in initiating predictive encoding. Converging causal evidence shows that OFC lesions abolish sensitivity to expectancy, whereas LPFC lesions yield only modest effects not significantly different from controls. Together, these results provide electrophysiological and causal evidence for distinct, temporally organized contributions of prefrontal subregions to predictive processing.

">The rhythmic bimodal sensory stimulation in synchronous manner entrains the network oscillation in basolateral amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The state of neural oscillation is important for various brain functions. In the basolateral nucleus of amygdala (BA), the oscillation frequency is accelerated in retrieval of conditioned fear memory. The amygdala receives sensory inputs from associated cortex and thalamus. Therefore, we tried to apply the bimodal sensory stimulation at slow frequency (5 Hz, functional frequency in behavioral context) for the entrainment of the BA oscillation. Young adult rats (P24-30) were stimulated by LED illuminator and acoustic speaker at 1 or 5 Hz for 1 hour. Immediately after the stimulus was finished, BA slices were prepared and whole-cell recording was applied to projection neuron. The slow (0.5-2 Hz) rhythmic IPSCs obtained from the pyramidal neuron was accelerated at ~4 Hz by synchronous opto-acoustic stimulation at 5 Hz. However, the frequency of the neuron at the later recording did not change in the same slice, suggesting that this induced entrainment is transient and reversible phenomenon. As a result, the power distribution was shifted from 0.1-2 to 2-6 Hz by synchronous bimodal 5 Hz stimulation. The regularity of the interval between IPSCs, quantified by rhythm index and the concentration of power around peak frequency in the power spectrum, was not changed by rhythmic sensory stimulation. These results suggest that synchronous bimodal sensory stimuli control the neuronal oscillation frequency by applying with rhythmicity.

">REM Sleep Misfires: Intruding Delta Waves Forecast Tau, Amyloid, and Forgetting in Aging</a></h4>

              
                Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep degrades with age, and more severely in Alzheimer's disease (AD). REM sleep comprises about twenty percent of adult sleep, alternates between phasic and tonic periods, and includes delta waves (1-4Hz) in two forms: fast sawtooth waves and slower, NREM-like waves, whose expression dynamically varies across REM periods. Yet, the functional relevance of these REM sleep delta waves remains unknown. Here, using two independent cohorts, we show that aging is associated with a shift from fast sawtooth to slow NREM-like delta waves, particularly during phasic REM sleep, a period typically marked by high cortical activation. Beyond chronological age, this shift is associated with amyloid-beta and tau burden, suggesting that AD pathology disrupts REM-specific oscillatory patterns. Furthermore, this shift in REM oscillations is linked to impaired overnight memory consolidation, independent of NREM sleep quality. Moreover, variation in ApoE alleles, a major genetic risk factor for AD, was independently associated with a reduction in fast sawtooth wave density, thereby linking a genetic predisposition for AD to these specific REM microstructural changes. These findings identify a novel signature of memory decline in aging and implicate REM sleep as a distinct vulnerable substrate through which AD pathology may impair brain function.

">Thinging Through Modelling. Active Inference Meets Material Engagement</a></h4>

              
                In this simulation study, we adopt the comprehensive neurocomputational approach of Active Inference (AIF) to illustrate some key concepts of Material Engagement Theory (MET) [1]. MET posits that craftwork does not require, or rely on, rich internal 'pre-planning', i.e., complex and highly detailed representations that occur mainly in the maker's head. Instead, the maker engages materiality through 'thinging', where the human agent (the maker) is guided by and leverages the materiality of the artefact (such as a spinning of clay or a chunk of marble). MET assigns a crucial co-participatory role to materiality, attributing agency to it. We investigate MET's claims through the widely adopted theory of AIF [2]. Our first aim is to simulate the plausibility of the (creative) thinging, adopting a simple modelling scenario. Then, we also discuss its applicability to other, more complex cases, which seem to require greater levels of 'pre-thinking' (e.g., planning, imagining and conceptualising outcomes). We highlight how these cases, too, align with the general principle of thinging. With our AIF neurocomputational understanding, we explain that even in these situations, the predictive brains involved in the creative process attempt to minimise the complexity of their internal model. The upshot of this is that, always and everywhere, our human minds engage the materiality to make the most of the characteristic dynamics of the world surrounding us - things and processes alike.

">Frequency bands EEG Biomarkers for Dementia using Graph Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                We introduce a simple and interpretable model for classification of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Our focus essentially is on using deep learning to study how connectivity patterns that are integrated to classify the EEG signals and highlight the important discriminative features used by the model in predictions. In this study, we utilize the connectivity features across different frequency bands in multi edge Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and showed that edge features are complimentary. We use a simple GNN model to predict Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) in EEG. Our model is capable of achieving average accuracy of approximately 76% using Leave-One-Subject-Out-subject for FTD predictions which are better than the baselines and comparable to State of the arts models. In this article, we study the importance of the connectivity edges, nodes and frequency bands in the prediction of the model, focusing in explainable AI methods through saliency maps to interpret the model both locally and globally. The Saliency maps highlight the importance of Occipital and anterior temporal regions in the prediction of FTD. Furthermore, our results highlight the importance of Alpha and Theta bands in the prediction of FTD. Our observations align with previous research done using classical statistical methods. We argue that there are complimentary information in each each connectivity feature and frequency band brain networks. The impacts of each connectivity metrics on the prediction of the model are quantified to highlight the complimentary information in each connectivity measure.

">Direct Generation of Images from EEG using Schrödinger Bridge</a></h4>

              
                Real-world data is often noisy, making it challenging to extract true signals. Non-invasively recorded neural activities are among the most difficult data, yet its precise signal reconstruction is highly anticipated by communities developing non-invasive brain-machine interfaces. Several noise sources contribute to this challenge, including unrelated neuronal activity, non-brain bioelectricity, attenuation by the skull and scalp, and environmental noises. Additionally, the accumulation of noise varies significantly across subjects and recording sessions, resulting in widely diverging distributions of degraded observations. In this study, we propose modeling the noise accumulation process as a Schrodinger bridge and decoding the true signal by reversing this process. Compared to conventional guided Diffusion approach, our Schrodinger bridge approach effectively models diverse noise processes within a single framework, exhibiting greater robustness to inter-subject variability. Also, our approach doesn't require pre-aligning brain and image representations, which is an additional compute cost in the conventional approach.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The strength of neural reinstatement, a correlate of episodic memory retrieval, reportedly reflects the amount and fidelity of mnemonic content and is weaker in older than younger adults, especially for scene memoranda. Based on evidence that age-related declines in cortical thickness and volume contribute to age-related cognitive decline, we analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired from healthy young and older adults to examine relationships between cortical thickness, cortical volume, age, and scene-related reinstatement in 3 cortical regions implicated in scene processing: the parahippocampal place area, medial place area, and occipital place area. A “reinstatement index” was estimated from functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected during tests of source memory for scene images, and multiple regression analyses were employed to examine the effects of the variables of interest on scene reinstatement. There were robust age differences in reinstatement, cortical thickness, and cortical volume. In the parahippocampal place area and medial place area, cortical volume fully mediated the effects of age on reinstatement. Additionally, parahippocampal place area reinstatement strength predicted source memory performance independently of cortical volume or age. These findings suggest that age differences in scene reinstatement are mediated by cortical volume and that memory performance and cortical volume are associated with unique components of variance in reinstatement strength.</span>

                <p>Adolescent nicotine use is particularly concerning due to increased susceptibility to long-term effects and dependence during this critical developmental period. This study investigates the therapeutic effects of thiamine on nicotine withdrawal-induced anxiety, anhedonia, and depression in rats. Adolescent rats received nicotine (2&nbsp;mg/kg, s.c.) for 21&nbsp;d, followed by 21&nbsp;d of withdrawal. Thiamine (25 or 50&nbsp;mg/kg, i.p.) was administered during exposure and withdrawal. Behavioral assessments were used to evaluate anxiety- and depressive-like symptoms, and biochemical analyses measured oxidative stress markers, serotonin levels, MAO activity, BDNF, and GFAP as indicators of neuroinflammation in the prefrontal cortex. Nicotine withdrawal significantly elevated anxiety-, depression-, and anhedonia-like behaviors, increased oxidative stress, and upregulated MAO-A activity and GFAP expression, indicating neuroinflammatory effects. Notably, thiamine administration during both nicotine exposure and withdrawal effectively alleviated these behavioral impairments, restored serotonin levels, reduced oxidative stress markers, and mitigated the increase in GFAP expression. Additionally, thiamine alone has been shown to alleviate anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors. This study highlights thiamine's potential as a promising intervention for managing psychological distress associated with nicotine withdrawal. Given the high prevalence of adolescent nicotine use and its associated mental health challenges, further research on thiamine's mechanisms and therapeutic potential is warranted to improve treatment strategies during this critical developmental stage.</p>

                <p>Every neuron contains the same genomic information, but its complement of proteins is the product of countless neuron-specific steps including pre-mRNA splicing. Despite advances in RNA sequencing techniques, pre-mRNA splicing biases that favor one isoform over another are largely inscrutable in live neurons in situ. Here, in <I>Drosophila</I>, we developed bichromatic fluorescent reporters to investigate alternative splicing of <I>cacophony</I> (<I>cac</I>)&mdash;a gene that codes the pore-forming &alpha;<SUB>1</SUB> subunit of the primary neuronal voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (VGCC). These reporters revealed a neuron-specific pattern of exon biases, highly consistent from one animal to the next, suggesting that each neuron splices a unique and consistent portfolio of VGCC isoforms. Stereotypical patterns were observed within motor neurons and multidendritic sensory neurons of female larvae and also within mushroom body Kenyon cells of female adults. In a validation step, we demonstrated that exon splice bias reporting was not dependent on the choice of fluorophores. Additionally, functional properties of the female larval motor neuron terminals could be generally reconciled with the functional properties predicted for the reported exon bias. The application of this technology to a large gene such as <I>cac</I> provides a precedence for effective exon-reporter design for other <I>Drosophila</I> genes.</p>

                <p>by Haoran Chen, Yangyuan Zhang, Robert F. Murphy</p>

Recent advances in multiplexed fluorescence imaging have provided new opportunities for deciphering the complex spatial relationships among various cell types across diverse tissues. We introduce CytoSpatio, open-source software that constructs generative, multirange, and multitype point process models that capture interactions among multiple cell types at various distances simultaneously. On analyzing five cell types across five tissues, our software showed consistent spatial relationships within the same tissue type, with certain cell types like proliferating T cells consistently clustering across tissue types. It also revealed that the attraction-repulsion relationships between cell types like B cells and CD4-positive T cells vary with tissue type. Models for a published dataset demonstrated consistency with prior findings. CytoSpatio can also generate synthetic tissue patterns from learned models, a capability not provided by previous descriptive, motif-based approaches. This potentially allows spatially realistic simulations of how cell relationships affect tissue biochemistry.

                <p>by Amirmahdi Mostofinejad, David A. Romero, Dana Brinson, Thomas K. Waddell, Golnaz Karoubi, Cristina H. Amon</p>

Differentiation of embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into endoderm derivatives, including thyroid, thymus, lungs, liver, and pancreas, has broad implications for disease modeling and therapy. We utilize and expand a model development approach previously outlined by the authors to construct a model for the directed differentiation of iPSCs into definitive endoderm (DE). Assuming discrete intermediate stages in the differentiation process with a homogeneous population in each stage, three lineage models with two, three, and four populations and three growth models are constructed. Additionally, three models for error distribution are defined, resulting in a total of 27 models. Experimental data obtained <i>in vitro</i> are used for model calibration, model selection, and final validation. Model selection suggests that no transitory state during differentiation expresses the DE biomarkers CD117 and CD184, a finding corroborated by existing literature. Additionally, space-limited growth models, such as logistic and Gompertz growth, outperform exponential growth. Validation of the inferred model with leave-out data results in prediction errors of 26.4%. Using the inferred model, it is predicted that the optimal differentiation period is between 1.9 and 2.4 days, plating populations closer to 300 000 cells per well result in the highest yield efficiency, and that iPSC differentiation outpaces the DE proliferation as the main driver of the population dynamics. We also demonstrate that the model can predict the effect of growth modulators on cell population dynamics. Our model serves as a valuable tool for optimizing differentiation protocols, providing insights into developmental biology.

                <p>by John Robertson, Shorya Consul, Haris Vikalo</p>

Motivation: Oncoviruses, pathogens known to cause or increase the risk of cancer, include both common viruses such as human papillomaviruses and rarer pathogens such as human T-lymphotropic viruses. Computational methods for detecting viral DNA from data acquired by modern DNA sequencing technologies have enabled studies of the association between oncoviruses and cancers. Those studies are rendered particularly challenging when multiple species of oncovirus are present in a tumor sample. In such scenarios, merely detecting the presence of a sequencing read of viral origin is insufficiently informative—instead, a more precise characterization of the viral content in the sample is required.
Results: We address this need with NextVir, to our knowledge the first multi-class viral classification framework that adapts genomic foundation models to detecting and classifying sequencing reads of oncoviral origin. Specifically, NextVir explores several foundation models—DNABERT-S, Nucelotide Transformer, and HyenaDNA—and efficiently fine-tunes them to enable accurate identification of the sequencing reads’ origin. The results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed framework over existing deep learning methods and suggest downstream potential for foundational models in genomics.

Accurate determination of cell-type composition in disease-relevant tissues is essential for identifying potential disease targets and understanding tissue heterogeneity. Most current spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies lack single-cell resolution, which makes precise cell-type composition identification challenging. Several deconvolution methods have been developed to address this limitation by relying on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the same tissue as a reference to estimate the cell type composition in ST data spots. However, these methods often overlook the inherent differences between scRNA-seq and ST data. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a Domain-Adversarial Masked Autoencoder (SpaDAMA) method. SpaDAMA leverages Domain-Adversarial Learning (DAL) to facilitate effective knowledge transfer from the source domain (pseudo-ST data generated from scRNA-seq) to the target domain (real ST data). Through adversarial training, SpaDAMA harmonizes the distributions of both datasets and maps them onto a unified latent representation, thereby reducing discrepancies in data modalities. Furthermore, to strengthen the model’s capability in extracting reliable features from real ST data, SpaDAMA employs masking strategies that effectively minimize noise and mitigate spatial artifacts. We validated SpaDAMA on 32 simulated datasets and 4 real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in cell-type deconvolution and providing a promising tool for spatial transcriptomic analyses.

                <p>by Emily R. Bozich, Xiaolu Guo, Jennifer L. Wilson, Alexander Hoffmann</p>

Single-cell studies of signal transduction have revealed complex temporal dynamics that determine downstream biological function. For example, the stimulus-specific dynamics of the transcription factor NFκB specify stimulus-specific gene expression programs, and loss of specificity leads to disease. Thus, it is intriguing to consider drugs that may restore signaling specificity in disease contexts, or reduce activity but maintain signaling specificity to avoid unwanted side effects. However, while steady-state dose-response relationships have been the focus of pharmacological studies, there are no established methods for quantifying drug impact on stimulus-response signaling dynamics. Here we evaluated how drug treatments affect the stimulus-specificity of NFκB activation dynamics and its ability to accurately code ligand identity and dose. Specifically, we simulated the dynamic NFκB trajectories in response to 15 stimuli representing various immune threats under treatment of 10 representative drugs across 20 dosage levels. To quantify the effects on coding capacity, we introduced a Stimulus Response Specificity (SRS) score and a stimulus confusion score. We constructed stimulus confusion maps by employing epsilon network clustering in the trajectory space and in various dimensionally reduced spaces: canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD), functional principal component analysis (fPCA), and NFκB signaling codons (i.e., established, informative dynamic features). Our results indicated that the SRS score and the stimulus confusion map based on signaling codons are best-suited to quantify stimulus-specific NFκB dynamics confusion under pharmacological perturbations. Using these tools we found that temporal coding capacity of the NFκB signaling network is generally robust to a variety of pharmacological perturbations, thereby enabling the targeting of stimulus-specific dynamics without causing broad side-effects.

                <p>by Yuhang Zhang, Tao Sun, Boyang Zang, Sen Wan</p>

Decoding animal decision-making behavior from neural spike data emerges as a particularly challenging problem in neuroscience. To address this, we have devised a decision-making decoding model, incorporating a channel attention bi-directional long short-term memory network (CA-BiLSTM), with the aim of effectively parsing sparse neural spike data across multiple brain regions. Notably, the attention mechanism embedded within this model serves the crucial purpose of adeptly localizing neurons integral to decision-making stability within the task at hand. Specifically, when applied to the reproducible electrophysiology dataset from the International Brain Laboratory (IBL), our proposed model has demonstrated a remarkable capacity for accurately forecasting decision-making behavior in mice. Consequently, this investigation furnishes a novel perspective for unraveling the intricacies of neural decision-making mechanisms.

                <p>by Clara L. Shaw, David A. Kennedy</p>

Spillover of viruses into novel host species occurs frequently. Often, spillover results in dead-end infections in novel hosts, sometimes, in stuttering transmission chains that die out, and rarely, in large epidemics with sustained transmission. If we could identify early which outcome will occur following a spillover event, we could more appropriately invest in efforts to surveil, respond to, or prevent disease emergence. Our goal was to identify early epidemiological characteristics that correlate with these outcomes, including those predictive of population-level virus persistence in novel hosts. To identify these characteristics, we experimentally induced spillover in the <i>Caenorhabditis</i> nematode-Orsay virus system and measured infection prevalence in exposed populations and virus shedding and infection intensity from infected hosts in replicate populations of eight strains belonging to seven non-native host species. We then passaged 20 adult nematodes from exposed populations to virus-free plates where they reproduced, initiating new populations to which they had the potential to transmit virus. We used quantitative PCR to track virus presence in passaged host populations for 10 passages or until virus was undetectable, indicating its loss. We then used a correlative modeling and a mechanistic modeling approach to understand which epidemiological characteristics were associated with population-level viral persistence. In our correlative models, we found that the number of passages until virus loss was associated with early epidemiological characteristics in the spillover host populations, including infection prevalence in the initially exposed population, the ability of hosts to detectably shed the virus, and the relative susceptibility of the host species, but not infection intensity. When all these characteristics were included simultaneously in a correlative model, only infection prevalence and shedding were significantly associated with virus maintenance, and the model explained over half of the variation in the data. We then developed a mechanistic model that attempts to explain virus passage success by using our epidemiological characteristics data to calculate the probability that at least one worm infectious enough to infect a conspecific is transferred during passage. This mechanistic model explained 38% of the variation in the data on its own. With the goal of understanding how our mechanistic model falls short, we used model selection to test a suite of larger models that included or excluded each epidemiological characteristic and included random effects of strain, experimental line, passage number, and block while the mechanistic prediction was included as an offset. We found that 66% of the variation in our data could be explained by a model that included our mechanistic prediction in addition to infection prevalence, infection intensity, and random effects. Altogether, our study demonstrates that early epidemiological characteristics can play a substantial role in explaining the ultimate outcome of a spillover event.

<p>Monosynaptic rabies tracing shows that the ventral subiculum and thalamic paraventricular nucleus are sources of input to a nucleus accumbens shell- ventral pallidum pathway involved in modulating dopamine neuron activity.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAcSh) regulates motivation and reward via its dense projection to the ventral pallidum (VP). This ventral striatopallidal system has also been shown to regulate the activity of midbrain dopamine neurons and the release of dopamine in the NAcSh. The present study applied monosynaptic rabies tracing in the rat to quantify the brain-wide sources of synaptic input to neurons in the medial NAcSh that project to the ventromedial VP. The ventral subiculum of the hippocampus (vSub) was the largest source of input cells to the NAcSh-VP projection neurons. Anterograde tracing of vSub-NAcSh projection neurons demonstrated that their fibers terminated densely in the NAcSh largely avoiding other regions of the striatum. Another relatively strong source of input cells included the anterior part of the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (aPVT). The CA1, lateral septal nucleus, VP, paratenial thalamic nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, lateral preoptic area and dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus were moderately strong sources of input neurons. The prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala were found to be relatively weak sources of input. A lack of sex differences for all the sources of input identified indicates that there is no apparent sexual dimorphism in the afferents to the striatopallidal system. In summary, the vSub and the aPVT are the major sources of cortical and thalamic monosynaptic inputs to the NAcSh-VP projection neurons where these inputs converge to regulate behavior and dopamine release in the NAcSh.</p>

                Guo et al. perform a systematic assessment of genetic dependencies and cell surface targets in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, identifying biomarkers, mapping interpatient and intratumoral heterogeneity, and nominating combination strategies. Experimental validation of dependencies associated with mesenchymal/EMT gene expression signatures identified the CDS2 enzyme as a mesenchymal state selective dependency.

                Ren et al. demonstrate that TCF25 enhances lysosomal acidification via V-ATPase during glucose starvation, promoting autophagy to maintain energy balance. However, prolonged starvation makes TCF25-mediated lysosomal-autophagic activity crucial for ferritinophagy, ultimately causing lysosome-dependent cell death.

                Kim et al. develop a consensus definition for layer 6b (L6b) excitatory neurons in adult mouse neocortex, enabling comparisons of their synaptic organization and function across studies. These neurons project to layer 1; express CTGF, Cplx3, and Nxph4; and project locally and between ipsilateral cortical areas but not to the thalamus.

                Huang et al. show that spatial exploration activates astrocytes in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex (MECII). Visual inputs contribute to this process. They further demonstrate that in vivo suppression of MECII astrocytic activities is sufficient to suppress spatial exploration and MECII neuronal activities.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106963">Comment on ‘Criterion placement threatens the construct validity of neural measures of consciousness’</a></h4>

              
                In a recent article Fahrenfort and colleagues demonstrate that auditory and monetary punishment change the criteria that participants use to rate the clarity of perception (Fahrenfort et al., 2025). This leads them to conclude that “subjective measures do not reliably measure the construct they intend to measure” and that their construct validity is threatened. Here, we argue that the main findings had already been demonstrated in other experiments, and the general limitations of subjective measures has been known for decades without the field dismissing their usefulness. We further argue that the experimental manipulations of Fahrenfort and colleagues are so radical that they could be used to invalidate essentially any psychological/cognitive test. In our view, both of the above-mentioned conclusions are thus inappropriate considering the evidence presented, and we believe that the take-home message both before and after the study of Fahrenfort and colleagues is to acknowledge the limitations of subjective reports when they are used.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107622">Response to comment on ‘Criterion placement threatens the construct validity of neural measures of consciousness’</a></h4>

              
                In Fahrenfort et al., 2025 we show the influence of non-perceptual criterion shifts on neural measures of consciousness. We fully agree (and point out in our article) that it was already known that subjective measures are sensitive to criterion confounds, and we are happy to read that this is acknowledged by Sandberg and Overgaard in their comment (Sandberg and Overgaard, 2025). However, we contest that the main findings of our simulations and empirical studies had already been demonstrated. Several findings from our studies are novel, such as the fact that criterion effects reveal themselves as over- (or under-) estimations of both conscious and unconscious processing in tandem, and that this has tangible implications when analyzing real neural data. We also challenge the suggestion that our experimental manipulations are (too) radical compared to signal-to-noise variations that occur naturally between experiments.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105264">A Commander-independent function of COMMD3 in endosomal trafficking</a></h4>

              
                Endosomal recycling is a branch of intracellular membrane trafficking that retrieves endocytosed cargo proteins from early and late endosomes to prevent their degradation in lysosomes. A key player in endosomal recycling is the Commander complex, a 16-subunit protein assembly that cooperates with other endosomal factors to recruit cargo proteins and facilitate the formation of tubulo-vesicular carriers. While the crucial role of Commander in endosomal recycling is well established, its molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we genetically dissected the Commander complex using unbiased genetic screens and comparative targeted mutations. Unexpectedly, our findings revealed a Commander-independent function for COMMD3, a subunit of the Commander complex, in endosomal recycling. COMMD3 regulates a subset of cargo proteins independently of the other Commander subunits. The Commander-independent function of COMMD3 is mediated by its N-terminal domain (NTD), which binds and stabilizes ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1), a small GTPase regulating endosomal recycling. Mutations disrupting the COMMD3-ARF1 interaction diminish ARF1 expression and impair COMMD3-dependent cargo recycling. These data provide direct evidence that Commander subunits can function outside the holo-complex and raise the intriguing possibility that components of other membrane trafficking complexes may also possess functions beyond their respective complexes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104856">Multi-omics single-cell analysis reveals key regulators of HIV-1 persistence and aberrant host immune responses in early infection</a></h4>

              
                The clearance of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) remains a significant public health challenge due to impaired cellular immune responses and HIV-1 maintenance during acute infection. However, the genetic and epigenetic changes influencing the immune response on host infected cells remain unclear. Here, this study analyzes HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from people living with HIV-1 during early infection (&lt;6 months) using single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing. It is observed that HIV-1 hinders the antiviral response, particularly by interfering with the interferon signaling pathway. Multimodal analysis identifies KLF2 as a key transcription factor in infected CD4+ T cells. Moreover, cells harboring HIV-1 provirus are predominantly identified as Th17 cells, which exhibit elevated KLF2 activity. This suggests an increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and a constrained immune response due to the quiescent characteristics of these cells. The finding provides insights into the immune mechanisms and key regulators of HIV-1 maintenance in CD4+ T cells during the early stages of infection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84749">Migrating mesoderm cells self-organize into a dynamic meshwork structure during chick gastrulation</a></h4>

              
                Migration of cell populations is a fundamental process in morphogenesis and disease. The mechanisms of collective cell migration of epithelial cell populations have been well studied. It remains unclear, however, how the highly motile mesenchymal cells, which migrate extensively throughout the embryo, are connected with each other and coordinated as a collective. During chick gastrulation, cells emerging from the primitive streak and migrating in the 3D space between ectoderm and endoderm (mesoderm region) exhibit a novel form of collective migration. Using live imaging and quantitative analysis, such as topological data analysis (TDA), we found that these cells undergo a novel form of collective migration, in which they form a meshwork structure while moving away from the primitive streak. Overexpressing a mutant form of N-cadherin was associated with reduced speed of tissue progression and directionality of the collective cell movement, whereas the speed of individual cells remains unchanged. To investigate how this meshwork arises, we utilized an agent-based theoretical model, which suggests that cell elongation, cell-cell adhesion, and cell density are the key parameters for the meshwork formation. These data provide novel insights into how a supracellular structure of migrating mesenchymal cells may arise in loosely connected cell populations.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Brain commissures are antiparallel white matter fiber bundles that connect both hemispheres across the midsagittal plane at different anatomical levels. In the mammalian brain, the best-known commissures are the corpus callosum, the anterior and the posterior commissures. Recent studies have identified a new white matter pathway, the thalamic commissures (TCs), that connect the cortex to the contralateral thalamus in rodents and primates. However, the specific cortical regions that project via the TCs and their target thalamic nuclei are still unknown. To thoroughly and accurately map this projectome, we utilized the mouse Allen Brain Institute connectivity atlas. Our results indicate that not all cortical regions project via the TCs, with most of these regions concentrated in the rostral portion of the brain. In addition, our data suggest that the TCs projections are very numerous, although less robust than the ipsilateral counterpart. Furthermore, these projections had a high degree of bilateral symmetry. We did not find any projections from the thalamus to the contralateral cortex, suggesting that the TCs are not reciprocal. Our findings reinforce the concept of the thalamus as an interhemispheric connectivity hub and suggest that the TCs might play a role in interhemispheric functional modulation.</span>
