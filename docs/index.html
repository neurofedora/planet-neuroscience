                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/TU2UMRsefhw/article">Post-Turing tissue pattern formation: Advent of mechanochemistry</a></h4>

<p>by Felix Brinkmann, Moritz Mercker, Thomas Richter, Anna Marciniak-Czochra</p>

Chemical and mechanical pattern formation is fundamental during embryogenesis and tissue development. Yet, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are still elusive in many cases. Most current theories assume that tissue development is driven by chemical processes: either as a sequence of chemical patterns each depending on the previous one, or by patterns spontaneously arising from specific chemical interactions (such as “Turing-patterns”). Within both theories, mechanical patterns are usually regarded as passive by-products of chemical pre-patters. However, several experiments question these theories, and an increasing number of studies shows that tissue mechanics can actively influence chemical patterns during development. In this study, we thus focus on the interplay between chemical and mechanical processes during tissue development. On one hand, based on recent experimental data, we develop new mechanochemical simulation models of evolving tissues, in which the full 3D representation of the tissue appears to be critical for obtaining a realistic mechanochemical behaviour. The presented modelling approach is flexible and numerically studied using state of the art finite element methods. Thus, it may serve as a basis to combine simulations with new experimental methods in tissue development. On the other hand, we apply the developed approach and demonstrate that even simple interactions between tissue mechanics and chemistry spontaneously lead to robust and complex mechanochemical patterns. Especially, we demonstrate that the main contradictions arising in the framework of purely chemical theories are naturally and automatically resolved using the mechanochemical patterning theory.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TU2UMRsefhw" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Many animals depend on descending information from the brain for the initiation and proper execution of locomotion. Interestingly, after injury and the loss of such inputs, locomotor function can sometimes be regained without the regrowth of central connections. In the medicinal leech, <i>Hirudo verbana</i>, we have shown that crawling reemerges after removal of descending inputs. Here, we studied the mechanisms underlying this return of locomotion by asking if central pattern generators (CPGs) in crawl-recovered leeches are sufficient to produce crawl-specific intersegmental coordination. From recovered animals, we treated isolated chains of ganglia with dopamine to activate the crawl CPGs (one crawl CPG per ganglion), and observed fictive crawl-like bursting in the dorsal-longitudinal-excitor motoneuron (DE-3); an established crawl-monitor neuron. However, these preparations did not exhibit crawl-specific coordination across the CPGs. Although the crawl CPGs always generated bi-directional activation of adjacent CPGs, we never observed crawl-appropriate intersegmental phase delays. Because central circuits alone were unable to organize crawl-specific coordination, we tested the coordinating role of the peripheral nervous system. In transected leeches normally destined for recovery, we removed afferent information to the anterior-most (lead) ganglion located below the nerve-cord transection site. In these dually treated animals, overt crawling was greatly delayed or prevented. After filling the peripheral nerves with Neurobiotin tracer distal to the nerve-root lesion, we found a perfect correlation between regrowth of peripheral neuronal fibers and crawl recovery. Our study establishes that during recovery after injury crawl-specific intersegmental coordination switches to a new dependency on afferent information.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> In the field of motor control, a pressing issue to resolve is how the central and peripheral nervous system become retuned and work together to establish functional locomotor patterns after descending signals are chronically removed after injury. The work we have presented, in the medicinal leech, clarifies that central pattern generator (CPG) neural networks are highly plastic in their ability to incorporate different timing elements for their intersegmental coordination after descending-coordinating information is removed. Essentially, the crawl CPGs switch their dependence on descending-timing cues to those originating from proprioceptive neurons in the muscular body wall. Results from our experimentally tractable preparation may provide a platform to guide future studies of locomotor recovery in vertebrate animals after spinal cord injury.</p>

Abstract<p>Addiction is characterized by a profound intersubject (phenotypic) variability in the expression of addictive symptomatology and propensity to relapse following treatment. However, laboratory investigations have primarily focused on common neural substrates in addiction and have not yet been able to identify mechanisms that can account for the multifaceted phenotypic behaviors reported in the literature. To fill this knowledge gap theoretically, here we simulated phenotypic variations in addiction symptomology and responses to putative treatments, using both a neural model, based on cortico-striatal circuit dynamics, and an algorithmic model of reinforcement learning. These simulations rely on the widely accepted assumption that both the ventral, model-based, goal-directed system and the dorsal, model-free, habitual system are vulnerable to extra-physiologic dopamine reinforcements triggered by addictive rewards. We found that endophenotypic differences in the balance between the two circuit or control systems resulted in an inverted U-shape in optimal choice behavior. Specifically, greater unbalance led to a higher likelihood of developing addiction and more severe drug-taking behaviors. Furthermore, endophenotypes with opposite asymmetrical biases among cortico-striatal circuits expressed similar addiction behaviors, but responded differently to simulated treatments, suggesting personalized treatment development could rely on endophenotypic rather than phenotypic differentiations. We propose our simulated results, confirmed across neural and algorithmic levels of analysis, inform on a fundamental and, to date, neglected quantitative method to characterize clinical heterogeneity in addiction.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Addiction is known to encompass heterogeneity in its development, maintenance, and treatment response. While previous work has mostly focused on the common mechanisms underlying vulnerabilities in addiction at a group level, the neurocomputational causes for such intersubject variability in addition are not well-understood. To fill this knowledge gap, we combine a neural and a reinforcement learning model to reveal that the balance between neural circuits or computational control modalities characterizes the presence of behavioral phenotypes in addiction. The presence of converging effects, validated across neural and algorithmic levels of analysis, informs on a quantitative method to characterize clinical heterogeneity, and potentially helps future development of precision treatments.</p>

Abstract<p>The lateral amygdala (LA) plays a critical role in the formation of fear conditioned associative memories. Previous studies have used c-<i>fos</i> regulated expression to identify a spatially restricted population of neurons within the LA that is specifically activated by fear learning. These neurons are likely to be a part of a memory engram but, to date, functional evidence for this has been lacking. We show that neurons within a spatially restricted region of the LA had an increase in both the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSC) when compared to neurons recorded from home-cage control mice. We then more specifically addressed if this increased synaptic activity was limited to learning-activated neurons. Using a <i>fos</i>-<i>tau-LacZ</i> (<i>FTL</i>) transgenic mouse line, we developed a fluorescence-based method of identifying and recording from neurons activated by fear learning (<i>FTL<sup>+</sup></i>) in acute brain slices. An increase in frequency and amplitude of sPSCs was observed in <i>FTL<sup>+</sup></i> neurons when compared to non-activated <i>FTL<sup>-</sup></i> neurons in fear conditioned mice. No learning-induced changes were observed in the action potential input-output relationships. These findings support the idea that a discrete LA neuron population forms part of a memory engram through changes in synaptic connectivity.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The lateral amygdala (LA) is critical for the formation of associative fear memories, such as those formed by fear conditioning. A subset of neurons in LA are activated by fear conditioning suggesting that they may be part of a memory engram. However, there is no functional evidence to support this view. Electrophysiological characterisation of LA neurons shows that the frequency and amplitude of synaptic events increase following fear conditioning. A method based on β-galactosidase as a reporter was developed to locate activated neurons in acute slice. An increase in frequency and amplitude of synaptic events was observed in activated compared to non-activated neurons supporting the idea that a discrete LA neuron population forms part of a memory engram.</p>

Abstract
<p>Animals and humans rapidly detect specific features of sounds, but the time courses of the underlying neural response for different stimulus categories is largely unknown. Furthermore, the intricate functional organization of auditory information processing pathways is poorly understood. Here, we computed neuronal response latencies from simultaneously recorded spike trains and local field potentials (LFPs) along the first two stages of cortical sound processing, primary auditory cortex (A1) and lateral belt (LB), of awake, behaving macaques. Two types of response latencies were measured for spike trains as well as LFPs: (1) onset latency, time-locked to onset of external auditory stimuli; and (2) selection latency, time taken from stimulus onset to a selective response to a specific stimulus category. Trial-by-trial LFP onset latencies predominantly reflecting synaptic input arrival typically preceded spike onset latencies, assumed to be representative of neuronal output indicating that both areas may receive input environmental signals and relay the information to the next stage. In A1, simple sounds, such as pure tones (PTs), yielded shorter spike onset latencies compared to complex sounds, such as monkey vocalizations ("Coos"). This trend was reversed in LB, indicating a hierarchical functional organization of auditory cortex in the macaque. LFP selection latencies in A1 were always shorter than those in LB for both PT and Coo reflecting the serial arrival of stimulus-specific information in these areas. Thus, chronometry on spike-LFP signals revealed some of the effective neural circuitry underlying complex sound discrimination.</p>

<p>Cochlea displays complex and highly nonlinear behavior in response to
wide-ranging auditory stimuli. While there have been many recent advancements
in the modeling of cochlear dynamics, it remains unclear what mathematical
structures underlie the essential features of the extended cochlea. We
construct a dynamical system consisting of a series of strongly coupled
critical oscillators to show that high-dimensional nonhyperbolic dynamics can
account for high-order compressive nonlinearities, amplification of weak input,
frequency selectivity, and traveling waves of activity. As a single Hopf
bifurcation generically gives rise to features of cochlea at a local level, the
nonhyperbolicity mechanism proposed in this paper can be seen as a
higher-dimensional analogue for the entire extended cochlea.

<p>Cortical neurons in the fluctuation driven regime can realize ultrafast
population encoding. The underlying biophysical mechanisms, however, are not
well understood. Reducing action potential onset rapidness can impair the
ultrafast population encoding, but it is not clear whether rapid action
potential onset is sufficient for ultrafast population encoding. One hypothesis
proposes that rapid action potential onset is caused by the separation of the
axon initial segment, that is the initiation site of action potentials, from
the soma, and that this spatial separation also results in ultrafast population
encoding. Here we examined this hypothesis by studying the linear response
properties of a population of model neurons. We find that the axonal initiation
site position is not sufficient to generate an ultrafast response and reproduce
the high bandwidth observed in cortical neuron populations. Furthermore, the
high frequency regime of the linear response function of this model is
insensitive to correlation times of the input current contradicting empirical
evidence. By tuning the activation slope of the sodium current, we examined the
impact of voltage sensitivity of sodium channels on population encoding. When
high voltage sensitivity is introduced, the two empirically observed phenomena
can be recovered. By investigating varying soma sizes, we furthermore highlight
the effect of neuron morphology on the linear response. Our results show that
high onset rapidness of action potential initiation is not sufficient for
ultrafast response. In the light of recent experimental evidence about neural
activity dependent repositioning of the axon initial segment and the resulting
question about the functional properties of this phenomenon, our study predicts
that, while it can lead to more rapid action potential onsets in the soma, it
does not affect the linear response of a population of neurons.

<p>This document provides an overview of the material covered in a course taught
at Stanford in the spring quarter of 2018. The course draws upon insight from
cognitive and systems neuroscience to implement hybrid connectionist and
symbolic reasoning systems that leverage and extend the state of the art in
machine learning by integrating human and machine intelligence. As a concrete
example we focus on digital assistants that learn from continuous dialog with
an expert software engineer while providing initial value as powerful
analytical, computational and mathematical savants. Over time these savants
learn cognitive strategies (domain-relevant problem solving skills) and develop
intuitions (heuristics and the experience necessary for applying them) by
learning from their expert associates. By doing so these savants elevate their
innate analytical skills allowing them to partner on an equal footing as
versatile collaborators - effectively serving as cognitive extensions and
digital prostheses, thereby amplifying and emulating their human partner's
conceptually-flexible thinking patterns and enabling improved access to and
control over powerful computing resources.

<p>Feed-forward convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are currently
state-of-the-art for object classification tasks such as ImageNet. Further,
they are quantitatively accurate models of temporally-averaged responses of
neurons in the primate brain's visual system. However, biological visual
systems have two ubiquitous architectural features not shared with typical
CNNs: local recurrence within cortical areas, and long-range feedback from
downstream areas to upstream areas. Here we explored the role of recurrence in
improving classification performance. We found that standard forms of
recurrence (vanilla RNNs and LSTMs) do not perform well within deep CNNs on the
ImageNet task. In contrast, custom cells that incorporated two structural
features, bypassing and gating, were able to boost task accuracy substantially.
We extended these design principles in an automated search over thousands of
model architectures, which identified novel local recurrent cells and
long-range feedback connections useful for object recognition. Moreover, these
task-optimized ConvRNNs explained the dynamics of neural activity in the
primate visual system better than feedforward networks, suggesting a role for
the brain's recurrent connections in performing difficult visual behaviors.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36482">A multispecies coalescent model for quantitative traits</a></h4>

We present a multispecies coalescent model for quantitative traits that allows for evolutionary inferences at micro- and macroevolutionary scales. A major advantage of this model is its ability to incorporate genealogical discordance underlying a quantitative trait. We show that discordance causes a decrease in the expected trait covariance between more closely related species relative to more distantly related species. If unaccounted for, this outcome can lead to an overestimation of a trait's evolutionary rate, to a decrease in its phylogenetic signal, and to errors when examining shifts in mean trait values. The number of loci controlling a quantitative trait appears to be irrelevant to all trends reported, and discordance also affected discrete, threshold traits. Our model and analyses point to the conditions under which different methods should fare better or worse, in addition to indicating current and future approaches that can mitigate the effects of discordance.

Parkinson's disease is a progressive neuropathological disorder that belongs to the class of synucleopathies, in which the protein alpha-synuclein is found at abnormally high concentrations in affected neurons. Its hallmark are intracellular inclusions called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. We here report the structure of cytotoxic alpha-synuclein fibrils (residues 1-121), determined by cryo-electron microscopy structure at a resolution of 3.4Å. Two protofilaments form a polar fibril composed of staggered β-strands. The backbone of residues 38 to 95, including the fibril core and the non-amyloid component region, are well resolved in the EM map. Residues 50-57, containing three of the mutation sites associated with familial synucleinopathies, form the interface between the two protofilaments and contribute to fibril stability. A hydrophobic cleft at one end of the fibril may have implications for fibril elongation, and invites for the design of molecules for diagnosis and treatment of synucleinopathies.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36354">Nanoscale dysregulation of collagen structure-function disrupts mechano-homeostasis and mediates pulmonary fibrosis</a></h4>

Matrix stiffening with downstream activation of mechanosensitive pathways is strongly implicated in progressive fibrosis; however, pathologic changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) that initiate mechano-homeostasis dysregulation are not defined in human disease. By integrated multiscale biomechanical and biological analyses of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis lung tissue, we identify that increased tissue stiffness is a function of dysregulated post-translational collagen cross-linking rather than any collagen concentration increase whilst at the nanometre-scale collagen fibrils are structurally and functionally abnormal with increased stiffness, reduced swelling ratio, and reduced diameter. In ex vivo and animal models of lung fibrosis, dual inhibition of lysyl oxidase-like (LOXL) 2 and LOXL3 was sufficient to normalise collagen fibrillogenesis, reduce tissue stiffness, and improve lung function in vivo. Thus, in human fibrosis, altered collagen architecture is a key determinant of abnormal ECM structure-function, and inhibition of pyridinoline cross-linking can maintain mechano-homeostasis to limit the self-sustaining effects of ECM on progressive fibrosis.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/35458">Single-color, ratiometric biosensors for detecting signaling activities in live cells</a></h4>

Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors have revolutionized the study of signal transduction by enabling the real-time tracking of signaling activities in live cells. Investigating the interaction between signaling networks has become increasingly important to understanding complex cellular phenomena, necessitating an update of the biosensor toolkit to allow monitoring and perturbing multiple activities simultaneously in the same cell. We therefore developed a new class of fluorescent biosensors based on homo-FRET, deemed FLuorescence Anisotropy REporters (FLAREs), which combine the multiplexing ability of single-color sensors with a quantitative, ratiometric readout. Using an array of color variants, we were able to demonstrate multiplexed imaging of three activity reporters simultaneously in the same cell. We further demonstrate the compatibility of FLAREs for use with optogenetic tools as well as intravital two-photon imaging.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/34995">Structural basis of malodour precursor transport in the human axilla</a></h4>

Mammals produce volatile odours that convey different types of societal information. In <i>Homo sapiens</i>, this is now recognised as body odour, a key chemical component of which is the sulphurous thioalcohol, 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol (3M3SH). Volatile 3M3SH is produced in the underarm as a result of specific microbial activity, which act on the odourless dipeptide-containing malodour precursor molecule, S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH, secreted in the axilla (underarm) during colonisation. The mechanism by which these bacteria recognise S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH and produce body odour is still poorly understood. Here we report the structural and biochemical basis of bacterial transport of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH by <i>Staphylococcus hominis</i>, which is converted to the sulphurous thioalcohol component 3M3SH in the bacterial cytoplasm, before being released into the environment. Knowledge of the molecular basis of precursor transport, essential for body odour formation, provides a novel opportunity to design specific inhibitors of malodour production in humans.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/34171">Recurrent network model for learning goal-directed sequences through reverse replay</a></h4>

Reverse replay of hippocampal place cells occurs frequently at rewarded locations, suggesting its contribution to goal-directed path learning. Symmetric spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) in CA3 likely potentiates recurrent synapses for both forward (start to goal) and reverse (goal to start) replays during sequential activation of place cells. However, how reverse replay selectively strengthens forward synaptic pathway is unclear. Here, we show computationally that firing sequences bias synaptic transmissions to the opposite direction of propagation under symmetric STDP in the co-presence of short-term synaptic depression or afterdepolarization. We demonstrate that significant biases are created in biologically realistic simulation settings, and this bias enables reverse replay to enhance goal-directed spatial memory on a W-maze. Further, we show that essentially the same mechanism works in a two-dimensional open field. Our model for the first time provides the mechanistic account for the way reverse replay contributes to hippocampal sequence learning for reward-seeking spatial navigation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/33910">Dual leucine zipper kinase is required for mechanical allodynia and microgliosis after nerve injury</a></h4>

Neuropathic pain resulting from nerve injury can become persistent and difficult to treat but the molecular signaling responsible for its development remains poorly described. Here, we identify the neuronal stress sensor dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK; <i>Map3k12</i>) as a key molecule controlling the maladaptive pathways that lead to pain following injury. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of DLK reduces mechanical hypersensitivity in a mouse model of neuropathic pain. Furthermore, DLK inhibition also prevents the spinal cord microgliosis that results from nerve injury and arises distant from the injury site. These striking phenotypes result from the control by DLK of a transcriptional program in somatosensory neurons regulating the expression of numerous genes implicated in pain pathogenesis, including the immune gene <i>Csf1</i>. Thus, activation of DLK is an early event, or even the master regulator, controlling a wide variety of pathways downstream of nerve injury that ultimately lead to chronic pain.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/32937">Neurogenic decisions require a cell cycle independent function of the CDC25B phosphatase</a></h4>

A fundamental issue in developmental biology and in organ homeostasis is understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the balance between stem cell maintenance and differentiation into a specific lineage. Accumulating data suggest that cell cycle dynamics play a major role in the regulation of this balance. Here we show that the G2/M cell cycle regulator CDC25B phosphatase is required in mammals to finely tune neuronal production in the neural tube. We show that in chick neural progenitors, CDC25B activity favors fast nuclei departure from the apical surface in early G1, stimulates neurogenic divisions and promotes neuronal differentiation. We design a mathematical model showing that within a limited period of time, cell cycle length modifications cannot account for changes in the ratio of the mode of division. Using a CDC25B point mutation that cannot interact with CDK, we show that part of CDC25B activity is independent of its action on the cell cycle.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/361394v1?rss=1">Neural oligarchy: how synaptic plasticity breeds neurons with extreme influence</a></h4>

Synapses between cortical neurons are subject to constant modifications through synaptic plasticity mechanisms, which are believed to underlie learning and memory formation. The strengths of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the cortex follow a right-skewed long-tailed distribution. Similarly, the firing rates of excitatory and inhibitory neurons also follow a right-skewed long-tailed distribution. How these distributions come about and how they maintain their shape over time is currently not well understood. Here we propose a spiking neural network model that explains the origin of these distributions as a consequence of the interaction of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) of excitatory and inhibitory synapses and a multiplicative form of synaptic normalisation. Specifically, we show that the combination of additive STDP and multiplicative normalisation leads to lognormal-like distributions of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic efficacies as observed experimentally. The shape of these distributions remains stable even if spontaneous fluctuations of synaptic efficacies are added. In the same network, lognormal-like distributions of the firing rates of excitatory and inhibitory neurons result from small variability in the spiking thresholds of individual neurons. Interestingly, we find that variation in firing rates is strongly coupled to variation in synaptic efficacies: neurons with the highest firing rates develop very strong connections onto other neurons. Finally, we define an impact measure for individual neurons and demonstrate the existence of a small group of neurons with an exceptionally strong impact on the network, that arise as a result of synaptic plasticity. In summary, synaptic plasticity and small variability in neuronal parameters underlie a neural oligarchy in recurrent neural networks.

The retina is a complex neural circuit in which visual information is transmitted and processed from light perceiving photoreceptors to projecting retinal ganglion cells. Much of the computational power of the retina rests on signal integrating interneurons, such as bipolar cells in the outer retina. While mammals possess about 10 different bipolar cell types, zebrafish (Danio rerio) has at least six ON-type, seven OFF-type, and four mixed-input bipolar cells. Commercially available antibodies against bovine and human conventional protein kinase C (PKC)  and -{beta} are frequently used as markers for retinal ON-bipolar cells in different species, despite the fact that it is not known which bipolar cell subtype(s) they actually label. Moreover, the expression pattern of the five prkc genes (coding for PKC proteins) has not been systematically determined. While prkcg is not expressed in retinal tissue, the other four prkc (prkcaa, prkcab, prkcba, prkcbb) transcripts were found in different parts of the inner nuclear layer and some as well in the retinal ganglion cell layer. Immunohistochemical analysis in adult zebrafish retina using PKC? and PKC? antibodies showed an overlapping immunolabeling of ON-bipolar cells that are most likely of the BON s6L or RRod type and of the BON s6 type. However, comparison of transcript expression with immunolabling, implies that these antibodies are not specific for one single zebrafish conventional PKC, but rather detect a combination of PKC - and -{beta} variants.

Multisensory integration processes are fundamental to our sense of self as embodied beings. Bodily illusions, such as the rubber hand illusion (RHI) and the size-weight illusion (SWI), allow us to investigate how the brain resolves conflicting multisensory evidence during perceptual inference in relation to different facets of body representation. In the RHI, synchronous tactile stimulation of a participant's hidden hand and a visible rubber hand creates illusory bodily ownership; in the SWI, the perceived size of the body can modulate the estimated weight of external objects. According to Bayesian models, such illusions arise as an attempt to explain the causes of multisensory perception and may reflect the attenuation of somatosensory precision, which is required to resolve perceptual hypotheses about conflicting multisensory input. Recent hypotheses propose that the precision or salience of sensorimotor representations is determined by modulators of synaptic gain, like dopamine, acetylcholine and oxytocin. However, these neuromodulatory hypotheses have not been tested in the context of embodied multisensory integration. The present, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossed-over study (N = 41 healthy volunteers) aimed to investigate the effect of intranasal oxytocin (IN-OT) on multisensory integration processes, tested by means of the RHI and the SWI. Results showed that IN-OT enhanced the subjective feeling of ownership in the RHI, only when synchronous tactile stimulation was involved. Furthermore, IN-OT increased the embodied version of the SWI (quantified as weight estimation error). These findings suggest that oxytocin might modulate processes of visuo-tactile multisensory integration by increasing the precision of top-down signals against bottom-up sensory input.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/361220v1?rss=1">Representation of action concepts in left posterior temporal cortex that generalize across vision and language</a></h4>

We understand actions from both observation and written text, pointing to a common neural representation of action concepts. However, which parts of the brain encode action concepts independently of stimulus type, say language or visual observation, is an unresolved question in neuroscience. An overlap of activation for action observation and sentence comprehension has been observed in frontoparietal and occipitotemporal cortex, but it is unclear whether this overlap points to the access of stimulus-general action concepts or result from functionally independent neural populations that are activated via one stimulus type but not the other. Using fMRI-based MVPA we found that frontoparietal areas encode representations of observed actions and corresponding written sentences in an overlapping way, but these representations did not generalize across stimulus type. By contrast, only left lateral posterior temporal cortex (LPTC) encoded action representations that generalize across observed action scenes and sentences. This observed stimulus generality was not modulated by verbalization or visual imagery. The representational organization of stimulus-general action information in LPTC could be predicted from models that describe basic agent-patient relations (object- and person-directedness) and the general semantic similarity between actions. Person- and object-directedness were topographically organized along a gradient in temporal cortex reminiscent of more posterior object distinctions, pointing to an overarching organizational principle of action and object knowledge in temporal and occipital cortex. Together, our findings revealed fundamentally distinct generalization profiles of temporal and frontoparietal cortex and suggest that LPTC represents aspects of action concepts by integrating more basic precursors in posterior cortex.

Repeated exposure to a stimulus leads to reduced responses of stimulus-selective sensory neurons, an effect known as repetition suppression or stimulus-specific adaptation. Several influential models have been proposed to explain repetition suppression within hierarchically-organised sensory systems, with each specifying different mechanisms underlying repetition effects. We manipulated temporal expectations within a face repetition experiment to test a critical prediction of the predictive coding model of repetition suppression: that repetition effects will be larger following stimuli that appear at expected times compared to stimuli that appear at unexpected times. We recorded event-related potentials from 18 participants and mapped the spatiotemporal progression of repetition effects using mass univariate analyses. We then assessed whether the magnitudes of observed face image repetition effects were influenced by temporal expectations. In each trial participants saw an adapter face, followed by a 500ms or 1000ms interstimulus interval (ISI), and then a test face, which was the same or a different face identity to the adapter. Participants' expectations for whether the test face would appear after a 500ms ISI were cued by the sex of the adapter face. Our analyses revealed multiple repetition effects with distinct scalp topographies, extending until at least 800ms from stimulus onset. An early (158-203ms) repetition effect was larger for stimuli following surprising, rather than expected, 500ms ISI durations, contrary to the model predictions of the predictive coding model of repetition suppression. Later (230-609ms) repetition effects tended to be larger following expected stimulus onset times, in line with predictive coding models. Our results indicate that the relationship between repetition suppression and temporal expectation differs across the time course of the stimulus-evoked response, suggesting multiple distinct mechanisms driving repetition suppression that operate at different latencies within the visual hierarchy.

Six neuropeptides are expressed within the Drosophila brain circadian network. Our previous mRNA profiling suggested that AllatostatinC is a seventh neuropeptide and specifically expressed in dorsal clock neurons (DN1s). Our results here show that AstC is indeed expressed in DN1s, where it oscillates. AstC is also expressed in two less well-characterized circadian neuronal clusters, the DN3s and lateral posterior neurons (LPNs). Behavioral experiments indicate that clock neuron-derived AstC is required to mediate evening locomotor activity under short (winter-like) photoperiods. The AstC-Receptor 2 (AstC-R2) is expressed in LNds, the clock neurons that drive evening locomotor activity, and AstC-R2 is required in these neurons to modulate the same short photoperiod evening phenotype. Ex vivo calcium imaging indicates that AstC directly inhibits a single LNd neuron. The results suggest that a novel AstC/AstC-R2 signaling pathway, from dorsal circadian neurons to an LNd, regulates the behavioral response to changing photoperiod in Drosophila.

The understanding of Body Ownership (BO) largely relies on the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) where synchronous stroking of real and Rubber Hands (RH) leads to an illusion of ownership of RH provided physical, anatomical, postural and spatial plausibility of the two body-parts. RHI also occurs during visuomotor synchrony, in particular, when the visual feedback of virtual arm movements follows the trajectory of the instantiated motor command. Hence BO seems to result from a bottom-up integration of afferent and efferent proximal multisensory evidence, and top-down prediction of both externally and self-generated signals, which occurs when the predictions about upcoming sensory signals are accurate. In motor control, the differential processing of predicted and actual sensory consequences of self-generated actions is addressed by, the so-called, Forward Model (FM). Based on an efference copy or corollary discharge, FM issues predictions about the sensory consequences of motor commands and compares them with the actual outcome. The discrepancies (Sensory Prediction Errors, SPEs) are used to correct the action on the consecutive trial and provide new estimates of the current state of the body and the environment. Here, we propose that BO might be computed by FMs, and therefore, it might depend on their consistency, specifically, in contexts where the sensory feedback is self-generated. Crucially, to reduce SPE, FMs integrate both proximal (proprioceptive) and distal (vision, audition) sensory cues relevant to the task. Thus, if BO depends on the consistency of FMs, it would be compromised by the incongruency of not only proximal but also distal cues. To test our hypothesis, we devised an embodied VR-based task where action outcomes were signaled by distinct auditory cues. By manipulating the cues with respect to their spatiotemporal congruency and valence, we show that distal feedback which violates predictions about action outcomes compromises both BO and performance. These results demonstrate that BO is influenced by not only efferent and afferent cues which pertain to the body itself but also those arising outside of the body and suggest that in goal-oriented tasks BO might result from a computation of FM.

In addition to their support role in neurotransmitter and ion buffering, astrocytes directly regulate neurotransmission at synapses via local bidirectional signaling with neurons. Here, we reveal a new form of neuronal-astrocytic signaling that transmits retrograde dendritic signals to upstream neurons to activate recurrent synaptic circuits. Norepinephrine activates -adrenoreceptors in hypothalamic corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) neurons to stimulate dendritic release, which triggers an astrocytic calcium response and release of ATP; ATP stimulates action potentials in upstream glutamate and GABA neurons to activate recurrent excitatory and inhibitory synaptic circuits to the CRF neurons. Thus, norepinephrine activates a novel retrograde signaling mechanism in CRF neurons that engages astrocytes in order to extend dendritic volume transmission to reach distal presynaptic glutamate and GABA neurons, thereby amplifying volume transmission mediated by dendritic release.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/361006v1?rss=1">The processing of color preference in the brain</a></h4>

Decades of research has established that humans have preferences for some colors (e.g., blue) and a dislike of others (e.g., dark chartreuse), with preference varying systematically with variation in hue (e.g., Hurlbert &amp; Owen, 2015). Here, we used functional MRI to investigate why humans have likes and dislikes for simple patches of color, and to understand the neural basis of preference, aesthetics and value judgements more generally. We looked for correlations of a behavioural measure of color preference with the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response when participants performed an irrelevant orientation judgement task on colored squares. A whole brain analysis found a significant correlation between BOLD activity and color preference in the posterior midline cortex (PMC), centred on the precuneus but extending into the adjacent posterior cingulate and cuneus. These results demonstrate that brain activity is modulated by color preference, even when such preferences are irrelevant to the ongoing task the participants are engaged. They also suggest that color preferences automatically influence our processing of the visual world. Interestingly, the effect in the PMC overlaps with regions identified in neuroimaging studies of preference and value judgements of other types of stimuli. Therefore, our findings extends this literature to show that the PMC is related to automatic encoding of subjective value even for basic visual features such as color.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/360925v1?rss=1">High cell diversity and complex peptidergic signalling underlie placozoan behaviour</a></h4>

Placozoans, together with sponges, are the only animals devoid of a nervous system and muscles, yet both respond to sensory stimulation in a coordinated manner. How behavioural control in these free-living animals is achieved in the absence of neurons and, more fundamentally, how the first neurons evolved from more primitive communication cells during the rise of animals is not yet understood. The placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens is a millimeter-wide, flat, free-living marine animal composed of six morphologically identified cell types distributed across a simple bodyplan: a flat upper epithelium and a cylindrical lower epithelium interspersed with a loose layer of fiber cells. Its genome encodes several proneuropeptide genes and genes involved in neurosecretion in animals with a nervous system. Here we investigate neuropeptide signalling in Trichoplax adhaerens. We found specific expression of several neuropeptides in non-overlapping cell populations distributed over the three cell layers, revealing an unsuspected cell-type diversity of Trichoplax adhaerens. Using live imaging, we uncovered that treatments with 11 different neuropeptides elicited striking and consistent effects on the animals shape, patterns of movement and velocity that we categorized under three main types: (i) crinkling, (ii) turning, and (iii) flattening and churning. Together, the data demonstrate a crucial role for peptidergic signalling in nerveless placozoans and suggest that peptidergic volume signalling may have predated synaptic signalling in the evolution of nervous systems.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/360909v1?rss=1">The age-dependent relationship between resting heart rate variability and functional brain connectivity</a></h4>

Resting heart rate variability (HRV), an index of parasympathetic cardioregulation and an individual trait marker related to mental and physical health, decreases with age. Previous studies have associated resting HRV with structural and functional properties of the brain -- mainly in cortical midline and limbic structures. We hypothesized that HRV may alter its relationship with brain structure and function across the adult lifespan. In 388 healthy subjects of three age groups (140 younger: 26.0{+/-}4.2 years, 119 middle-aged: 46.3{+/-}6.2 years, 129 older: 66.9{+/-}4.7 years), gray matter structure (voxel-based morphometry) and resting-state functional connectivity (eigenvector centrality mapping and exploratory seed-based functional connectivity) were related to resting HRV, measured as the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD). Confirming previous findings, resting HRV decreased with age. For HRV-related gray matter volume, there were no statistically significant differences between the age groups, nor similarities across all age groups. In whole-brain functional connectivity analyses, we found an age-dependent association between resting HRV and eigenvector centrality in the bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), driven by the younger adults. Across all age groups, HRV was positively correlated with network centrality in bilateral posterior cingulate cortex. Seed-based functional connectivity analysis using the vmPFC cluster revealed an HRV-related cortico-cerebellar network in younger but not in middle-aged or older adults. Our results indicate that the decrease of HRV with age is accompanied by changes in functional connectivity along the cortical midline. This extends our knowledge of brain-body interactions and their changes over the lifespan.

Central and autonomic nervous system activity are coupled during sleep. Cortical slow oscillations (SOs, &lt;1Hz) coincide with brief bursts in heart rate (HR), but the functional consequence of this coupling in cognition remains elusive. We measured SO-HR temporal coupling (i.e., the peak-to-peak interval between downstate of SO event and HR burst) during a daytime nap, and asked whether this SO-HR timing measure was associated with perceptual speed and learning on a texture discrimination task, by testing subjects before and after a nap. The coherence of SO-HR events during sleep strongly correlated with an individual's perceptual speed in the morning and evening test sessions, but not with their change in performance after the nap (i.e., consolidation). We confirmed this result in two additional experimental visits, and also discovered that this association was visit-specific, indicating a reliable state (not trait) marker. Thus, we introduce a novel physiological index that may be a useful marker of state-dependent processing speed of an individual.

Recently, a least-squares-based method has been proposed to decode auditory attention from single-trial EEG recordings for an acoustic scenario with two competing speakers. This method aims at reconstructing the attended speech envelope from the EEG recordings using a trained spatio-temporal filter. While the performance of this method has been mainly studied for noiseless and anechoic acoustic conditions, it is important to fully understand its performance in realistic noisy and reverberant acoustic conditions. In this paper, we investigate auditory attention decoding (AAD) using EEG recordings for different acoustic conditions (anechoic, reverberant, noisy, and reverberant-noisy). In particular, we investigate the impact of different acoustic conditions for AAD filter training and for decoding. In addition, we investigate the influence on the decoding performance of the different acoustic components (i.e. reverberation, background noise and interfering speaker) in the reference signals used for decoding and the training signals used for computing the filters. First, we found that for all considered acoustic conditions it is possible to decode auditory attention with a decoding performance larger than 90%, even when the acoustic conditions for AAD filter training and for decoding are different. Second, when using reference signals affected by reverberation and/or background noise, a comparable decoding performance as when using clean reference signals can be obtained. In contrast, when using reference signals affected by the interfering speaker, the decoding performance significantly decreases. Third, the experimental results indicate that it is even feasible to use training signals affected by reverberation, background noise and/or the interfering speaker for computing the filters.

The perception gained by retina implants (RI) is limited, which asks for a learning regime to improve patients' visual perception. Here we simulated RI vision and investigated if object recognition in RI patients can be improved and maintained through training. Importantly, we asked if the trained object recognition can be generalized to a new task context, and to new viewpoints of the trained objects. For this purpose, we adopted two training tasks, a naming task where participants had to choose the correct label out of other distracting labels for the presented object, and a discrimination task where participants had to choose the correct object out of other distracting objects to match the presented label. Our results showed that, despite of the task order, recognition performance was improved in both tasks and lasted at least for a week. The improved object recognition, however, can be transferred only from the naming task to the discrimination task but not vice versa. Additionally, the trained object recognition can be transferred to new viewpoints of the trained objects only in the naming task but not in the discrimination task. Training with the naming task is therefore recommended for RI patients to achieve persistent and flexible visual perception.

Macroscale white matter pathways form the infrastructure for large-scale communication in the human brain, a prerequisite for healthy brain function. Conversely, disruptions in the brain's connectivity architecture are thought to play an important role in a wide range of psychiatric and neurological brain disorders. Here we show that especially connections important for global communication and network integration are involved in a wide range of brain disorders. We report on a meta-analytic connectome study comprising in total 895 patients and 1,016 controls across twelve neurological and psychiatric disorders. We extracted disorder connectome fingerprints for each of these twelve disorders, which were then combined into a cross-disorder disconnectivity involvement map, representing the involvement of each brain pathway across brain disorders. Our findings show connections central to the brain's infrastructure are disproportionally involved across a wide range of disorders. Connections critical for global network communication and integration display high disturbance across disorders, suggesting a general cross-disorder involvement and importance of these pathways in normal function. Taken together, our cross-disorder study suggests a convergence of disconnectivity across disorders to a partially shared disconnectivity substrate of central connections.

In language comprehension, a variety of contextual cues act in unison to render upcoming words more or less predictable. As a sentence unfolds, we use prior context (sentential constraints) to predict what the next words might be. Additionally, in a conversation, we can predict upcoming sounds through observing the mouth movements of a speaker (visual constraints). In electrophysiological studies, effects of visual salience have typically been observed early in language processing, while effects of sentential constraints have typically been observed later. We hypothesized that the visual and the sentential constraints might feed into the same predictive process such that effects of sentential constraints might also be detectable early in language processing through modulations of the early effects of visual salience. We presented participants with audiovisual speech while recording their brain activity with magnetoencephalography. Participants saw videos of a person saying sentences where the last word was either sententially constrained or not, and began with a salient or non-salient mouth movement. We found that sentential constraints indeed exerted an early (N1) influence on language processing. Sentential modulations of the N1 visual predictability effect were visible in brain areas associated with semantic processing, and were differently expressed in the two hemispheres. In the left hemisphere, visual and sentential constraints jointly suppressed the auditory evoked field, while the right hemisphere was sensitive to visual constraints only in the absence of strong sentential constraints. These results suggest that sentential and visual constraints can jointly influence even very early stages of audiovisual speech comprehension.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/360537v1?rss=1">Episodic Control as Meta-Reinforcement Learning</a></h4>

Recent research has placed episodic reinforcement learning (RL) alongside model-free and model-based RL on the list of processes centrally involved in human reward-based learning. In the present work, we extend the unified account of model-free and model-based RL developed by Wang et al. (2018) to further integrate episodic learning. In this account, a generic model-free "meta-learner" learns to deploy and coordinate among all of these learning algorithms. The meta-learner learns through brief encounters with many novel tasks, so that it learns to learn about new tasks. We show that when equipped with an episodic memory system inspired by theories of reinstatement and gating, the meta-learner learns to use the episodic and model-based learning algorithms observed in humans in a task designed to dissociate among the influences of various learning strategies. We discuss implications and predictions of the model.

Motor actions can be released much sooner than normal when the go-signal is of very high intensity (&gt; 100dBa). Although statistical evidence from individual studies has been mixed, it has been assumed that sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle activity could be used to distinguish between two neural circuits involved in movement triggering. We summarized meta-analytically the available evidence for this hypothesis, comparing the difference in premotor reaction time (RT) of actions where SCM activity was elicited (SCM+ trials) by loud acoustic stimuli against trials in which it was absent (SCM- trials). We found ten studies, all reporting comparisons between SCM+ and SCM- trials. Our mini meta-analysis showed that premotor RTs are faster in SCM+ than in SCM- trials. We also present experimental data showing the effects of foreperiod predictability can induce differences in RT that would be of similar size to those attributed to the activation of different neurophysiological pathways to trigger prepared actions. We discuss plausible physiological mechanisms that would explain differences in premotor RTs between SCM+ and SCM- trials.

Low-level visual features have been known to play a role in value-based decision-making. However, thus far, mainly single features were tested on one type of item using one method of measurement. Here, we test the contribution of low-level visual features on three items types: fractal-art images, faces, and snack food items. We test the role of visual features on preferences using both subjective ratings and choices. We show that low-level visual features contribute to value-based decision-making even after controlling for higher level configural features of faces like eye-distance and market features of snacks like calories. Importantly, we show that while low-level visual features consistently contribute to value-based decision-making, different features contribute to different types of items when using different measurement methods. Our study highlights the necessity of using multiple item types and multiple measurement methods to construct a unifying framework regarding the contribution of low-level features to value-based decision-making.

The perifornical/lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) orexin (hypocretin) system is involved in drug-seeking behavior elicited by drug-associated stimuli. Cocaine exposure is associated with presynaptic plasticity at LHA orexin cells such that excitatory input to orexin cells is enhanced, both acutely and into withdrawal. These changes may augment orexin cell reactivity to drug-related cues during abstinence and contribute to relapse-like behavior. Studies in hypothalamic slices from drug-naive animals indicate that agonism of group III metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) reduces presynaptic glutamate release onto orexin cells. Therefore, we examined the group III mGluR system as a potential target to reduce orexin cell excitability in-vivo, and tested whether activating these receptors could normalize orexin cell activity following cocaine and reduce cocaine-seeking elicited by drug-associated stimuli during abstinence. First, we verified that group III mGluRs regulate orexin cell activity in vivo by showing that intra-LHA infusions of the selective agonist L-(+)-2-Amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (L-AP4) reduces Fos expression in orexin cells following 24h food deprivation. Next, we extended these findings to show that intra-LHA L-AP4 infusions reduced discriminative stimulus-driven cocaine-seeking following withdrawal. L-AP4 had no effect on general motor activity of sucrose self-administration. Finally, using whole-cell patch clamp recordings from identified orexin cells in orexin-GFP transgenic mice, we show that enhanced presynaptic drive to orexin cells persists for up to 14d into withdrawal and that this plasticity is normalized by L-AP4. L-AP4 had no effect on measures of postsynaptic plasticity in cocaine-exposed animals. Together, these data indicate that agonism of LHA group III mGluRs reduces orexin cell activity in-vivo and is an effective strategy to suppress cocaine-seeking behavior following withdrawal. These effects are likely mediated, at least in part, by normalization of presynaptic plasticity at orexin cells that occurs as a result of cocaine exposure.

It is challenging to decipher molecular mechanisms in biological systems from system-level input-output data, especially for complex processes that involve interactions among multiple components. We addressed this general problem for the bacterial histidine kinase CheA, the activity of which is regulated in chemotaxis signaling complexes by bacterial chemoreceptors. We developed a general network model to describe the dynamics of the system, treating the receptor complex with coupling protein CheW and the P3P4P5 domains of kinase CheA as a regulated enzyme with two substrates, ATP and P1, the phosphoryl-accepting domain of CheA. Our simple network model allowed us to search hypothesis space systematically. For different and progressively more complex regulation schemes, we fit our models to a large set of input-output data with the aim of identifying the simplest possible regulation mechanisms consistent with the data. Our modeling and analysis revealed novel dual regulation mechanisms in which receptor activity regulated ATP binding plus one other process, either P1 binding or phosphoryl transfer between P1 and ATP. Strikingly, in our models receptor control affected the kinetic rate constants of substrate association and dissociation equally and thus did not alter the respective equilibrium constants. We suggest experiments that could distinguish between the two dual-regulation mechanisms. This systems-biology approach of combining modeling and a large input-output dataset should be applicable for studying other complex biological processes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/55xMZx8_bX8" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Serotonergic dysregulation is implicated in numerous psychiatric disorders. Serotonin plays widespread trophic roles during neurodevelopment; thus perturbations to this system during development may increase risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Epidemiological studies have examined association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment during pregnancy and increased autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk in offspring. It is unclear from these studies whether ASD susceptibility is purely related to maternal psychiatric diagnosis, or if treatment poses additional risk. We sought to determine if maternal SSRI treatment alone or in combination with genetically vulnerable background was sufficient to induce offspring behavior disruptions relevant to ASD. We exposed C57BL/6J or <i>Celf6</i><sup>+/-</sup> mouse dams to fluoxetine during different periods of gestation and lactation, and characterized offspring on tasks assessing social communicative interaction and repetitive behavior patterns including sensory sensitivities. We demonstrate robust reductions in pup ultrasonic vocalizations and alterations in social hierarchy behaviors, as well as perseverative behaviors and tactile hypersensitivity. <i>Celf6</i> mutant mice demonstrate social communicative deficits and perseverative behaviors, without further interaction with fluoxetine. Fluoxetine re-exposure in adulthood ameliorates the tactile hypersensitivity yet exacerbates the dominance phenotype. This suggests acute deficiencies in serotonin levels likely underlie the abnormal responses to sensory stimuli, while the social alterations are instead due to altered development of social circuits. These findings indicate maternal fluoxetine treatment, independent of maternal stress, can induce behavioral disruptions in mammalian offspring, thus contributing to our understanding of the developmental role of the serotonin system and the possible risks to offspring of SSRI treatment during pregnancy.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Human epidemiological studies suggest that taking antidepressants during pregnancy may increase risk autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. Since only women with a diagnosis take antidepressants, there is substantial debate on whether all increased ASD risk is contributed by the diagnosis, or if medication has an additional influence. We reasoned empirical studies in a reduced system might provide some indication if there was biological basis for such an influence. Our mouse studies show that, in the absence of other maternal manipulations or stressors, maternal selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) exposure alone can alter the behavioral circuits for sensory, social and repetitive behaviors, relevant to ASD, in a mammalian brain, and that some of these changes are reversible by SSRI re-exposure.</p>

Abstract<p>Human adolescence is a period of rapid changes in cognition and goal-directed behavior, and constitutes a major transitional phase towards adulthood. One of the mechanisms suggested to underlie the protracted maturation of functional brain networks, is the increased network integration and segregation enhancing neural efficiency. Importantly, the increasing coordinated network interplay throughout development is mediated through functional hubs, which are highly connected brain areas suggested to be pivotal nodes for the regulation of neural activity. To elucidate brain hub development during childhood and adolescence, we estimated voxel-wise eigenvector centrality (EC) using fMRI data from two different psychological contexts (resting state and a working memory task), in a large cross-sectional sample (n = 754) spanning the age from 8-22 years, and decomposed the maps using independent component analysis. Our results reveal significant age-related centrality differences in cingulo-opercular, visual and sensorimotor network nodes during both rest and task performance, suggesting that common neurodevelopmental processes manifest across different mental states. Supporting the functional significance of these developmental patterns, the centrality of the cingulo-opercular node was positively associated with task performance. These findings provide evidence for protracted maturation of hub properties in specific nodes of the brain connectome during the course of childhood and adolescence, and suggest that cingulo-opercular centrality is a key factor supporting neurocognitive development.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Adolescence is a sensitive period during ontogeny and a maturational gateway to adulthood. A better characterization of the brain changes underpinning cognitive and emotional development occurring during this period is key to inform models of normal and abnormal adaptation. Advanced brain imaging allows for <i>in vivo</i> studies of the protracted maturation of brain network function and connectivity during childhood and adolescence. Here, we used functional brain imaging to identify neural hubs during two psychological contexts in 754 children and adolescents. Key regions of the brain network showed increasing importance through adolescence, and individual differences in working memory performance was associated with the centrality of cingulo-opercular network nodes, suggesting a hot-spot for neurocognitive development.</p>

Abstract
<p>Expressions of emotion are powerful triggers for situation-appropriate responses by the observer. Of particular interest regarding the preparation of such adaptive actions are parietal and premotor cortices, given their potential for interaction with the amygdala (AMG), which is known to play a crucial role in the processing of affective information and in motor response. We set out to disentangle the respective roles of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and ventral premotor cortex (PMv) in humans in the processing of emotional body expressions by assessing remote effects of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) in the action network and in AMG. Participants were presented with blocks of short videos showing either angry or neutral whole-body actions. The experiment consisted of three fMRI sessions: two sessions were preceded by stimulation of either right IPL (rIPL) or right PMv (rPMv); and a third session assessed baseline activity. Interestingly, whereas at baseline the left AMG did not differentiate between neutral and angry body postures, a significant difference between these conditions emerged after stimulation of either rIPL or rPMv, with much larger responses to angry than to neutral stimuli. In addition, the effects of cTBS stimulation and emotion were also observed in two other action-relevant areas, the supplementary motor area and the superior parietal cortex. Together, these results show how areas involved in action and emotion perception and in action preparation interact dynamically.</p>

Abstract
<p>The basomedial amygdala (BM) influences the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) through direct glutamatergic projections as well as indirectly, through the anterior part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTa). However, BM and BNSTa axons end in a segregated fashion in VMH. BM projects to the core of VMH, where VMH’s projection cells are located, whereas BNSTa projects to the shell of VMH, where GABAergic cells that inhibit core neurons are concentrated. However, the consequences of this dual regulation of VMH by BM and BNSTa are unknown. To study this question, we recorded the responses of VMH’s shell and core neurons to the optogenetic activation of BM or BNSTa inputs in transgenic mice that selectively express Cre-recombinase in glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. Glutamatergic BM inputs fired most core neurons but elicited no response in GABAergic shell neurons. Following BM infusions of AAV-EF1α-DIO-hChR2-mCherry in Vgat-ires-Cre-Ai6 mice, no anterograde labeling was observed in the VMH, suggesting that GABAergic BM neurons do not project to the VMH. In contrast, BNSTa sent mostly GABAergic projections that inhibited both shell and core neurons. However, BNSTa-evoked IPSPs had a higher amplitude in shell neurons. Since we also found that activation of GABAergic shell neurons causes an inhibition of core neurons, these results suggest that depending on the firing rate of shell neurons, BNSTa inputs could elicit a net inhibition or disinhibition of core neurons. Thus, the dual regulation of VMH by BM and BNSTa imparts flexibility to this regulator of defensive and social behaviors.</p>

Abstract
<p>GPR139 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is expressed mainly in the brain, with the highest expression in the medial habenula. The modulation of GPR139 receptor function has been hypothesized to be beneficial in the treatment of some mental disorders, but behavioral studies have not yet provided causal evidence of the role of GPR139 in brain dysfunction. Because of the high expression of GPR139 in the habenula, a critical brain region in addiction, we hypothesized that GPR139 may play role in alcohol dependence. Thus, we tested the effect of GPR139 receptor activation using the selective, brain-penetrant receptor agonist JNJ-63533054 on addiction-like behaviors in alcohol-dependent male rats. Systemic administration of JNJ-63533054 (30 mg/kg but not 10 mg/kg, p.o.) reversed the escalation of alcohol self-administration in alcohol-dependent rats, without affecting water or saccharin intake in dependent rats or alcohol intake in nondependent rats. Moreover, systemic JNJ-63533054 administration decreased withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia, without affecting somatic signs of alcohol withdrawal. Further analysis demonstrated that JNJ-63533054 was effective only in a subgroup of dependent rats that exhibited compulsive-like alcohol drinking. Finally, site-specific microinjection of JNJ-63533054 in the habenula but not interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) reduced both alcohol self-administration and withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia in dependent rats. These results provide robust preclinical evidence that GPR139 receptor activation reverses key addiction-like behaviors in dependent animals, suggest that GPR139 may be a novel target for the treatment of alcohol use disorder, and demonstrate that GPR139 is functionally relevant in regulating mammalian behavior.</p>

<p>Human neurons expressing mutations associated with neurodegenerative disease are becoming more widely available. Hence, developing assays capable of accurately detecting changes that occur early in the disease process and identifying therapeutics able to slow these changes should become ever more important. Using automated live-cell imaging, we studied human motor neurons in the process of dying following neurotrophic factor withdrawal. We tracked different neuronal features, including cell body size, neurite length, and number of nodes. In particular, measuring the number of nodes in individual neurons proved to be an accurate predictor of relative health. Importantly, intermediate phenotypes were defined and could be used to distinguish between agents that could fully restore neurons and neurites and those only capable of maintaining neuronal cell bodies. Application of live-cell imaging to disease modeling has the potential to uncover new classes of therapeutic molecules that intervene early in disease progression.</p>

Abstract<p>Many animals depend on descending information from the brain for the initiation and proper execution of locomotion. Interestingly, after injury and the loss of such inputs, locomotor function can sometimes be regained without the regrowth of central connections. In the medicinal leech, <i>Hirudo verbana</i>, we have shown that crawling reemerges after removal of descending inputs. Here, we studied the mechanisms underlying this return of locomotion by asking if central pattern generators (CPGs) in crawl-recovered leeches are sufficient to produce crawl-specific intersegmental coordination. From recovered animals, we treated isolated chains of ganglia with dopamine to activate the crawl CPGs (one crawl CPG per ganglion), and observed fictive crawl-like bursting in the dorsal-longitudinal-excitor motoneuron (DE-3); an established crawl-monitor neuron. However, these preparations did not exhibit crawl-specific coordination across the CPGs. Although the crawl CPGs always generated bi-directional activation of adjacent CPGs, we never observed crawl-appropriate intersegmental phase delays. Because central circuits alone were unable to organize crawl-specific coordination, we tested the coordinating role of the peripheral nervous system. In transected leeches normally destined for recovery, we removed afferent information to the anterior-most (lead) ganglion located below the nerve-cord transection site. In these dually treated animals, overt crawling was greatly delayed or prevented. After filling the peripheral nerves with Neurobiotin tracer distal to the nerve-root lesion, we found a perfect correlation between regrowth of peripheral neuronal fibers and crawl recovery. Our study establishes that during recovery after injury crawl-specific intersegmental coordination switches to a new dependency on afferent information.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> In the field of motor control, a pressing issue to resolve is how the central and peripheral nervous system become retuned and work together to establish functional locomotor patterns after descending signals are chronically removed after injury. The work we have presented, in the medicinal leech, clarifies that central pattern generator (CPG) neural networks are highly plastic in their ability to incorporate different timing elements for their intersegmental coordination after descending-coordinating information is removed. Essentially, the crawl CPGs switch their dependence on descending-timing cues to those originating from proprioceptive neurons in the muscular body wall. Results from our experimentally tractable preparation may provide a platform to guide future studies of locomotor recovery in vertebrate animals after spinal cord injury.</p>

Abstract<p>Anxiety disorders often manifest in genetically susceptible individuals after psychosocial stress, but the mechanisms underlying these gene-environment interactions are largely unknown. We used the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) mouse model to study resilience and susceptibility to chronic psychosocial stress. We identified a strong genetic background effect in CSDS-induced social avoidance using four inbred mouse strains: 69% of C57BL/6NCrl (B6), 23% of BALB/cAnNCrl, 19% of 129S2/SvPasCrl, and 5% of DBA/2NCrl (D2) mice were stress-resilient. Furthermore, different inbred mouse strains responded differently to stress, suggesting they use distinct coping strategies. To identify biological pathways affected by CSDS, we used RNA-seq of three brain regions of two strains, B6 and D2: medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), ventral hippocampus (vHPC), and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. We discovered over-representation of oligodendrocyte-related genes in the differentially expressed gene population. Because oligodendrocytes myelinate axons, we measured myelin thickness and found significant region and strain-specific differences. For example, in resilient D2 mice mPFC axons had thinner myelin than controls, whereas susceptible B6 mice had thinner myelin than controls in the vHPC. Neither myelin-related gene expression in several other regions, nor corpus callosum thickness, differed between stressed and control animals. Our unbiased gene expression experiment suggests that myelin plasticity is a substantial response to chronic psychosocial stress, varies across brain regions, and is genetically controlled. Identification of genetic regulators of the myelin response will provide mechanistic insight into the molecular basis of stress-related diseases, such as anxiety disorders, a critical step in developing targeted therapy.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Chronic psychosocial stress is a well-established risk factor for anxiety disorders, but the development of targets for therapeutic intervention is limited by ignorance of the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. We used inbred genetically defined mice to identify neurobiological pathways that underlie stress-induced social avoidance, a type of anxiety. We found genetically controlled differences in myelin-related gene expression in stress-exposed mice, with concurrent differences in myelin thickness, suggesting that myelin plasticity is a major stress response of the brain. The adaptive response to stress may increase or decrease myelin thickness, depending on the demands of the specific circuit. Our findings provide a foundation for the identification of specific genetic regulators of chronic stress-induced myelin plasticity.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38060">BK channel inhibition by strong extracellular acidification</a></h4>

Mammalian BK-type voltage- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels are found in a wide range of cells and intracellular organelles. Among different loci, the composition of the extracellular microenvironment, including pH, may differ substantially. For example, it has been reported that BK channels are expressed in lysosomes with their extracellular side facing the strongly acidified lysosomal lumen (pH ~ 4.5). Here we show that BK activation is strongly and reversibly inhibited by extracellular H<sup>+</sup>, with its conductance-voltage relationship shifted by more than +100 mV at pH<sub>O</sub> 4. Our results reveal that this inhibition is mainly caused by H<sup>+</sup> inhibition of BK voltage-sensor (VSD) activation through three acidic residues on the extracellular side of BK VSD. Given that these key residues (D133, D147, D153) are highly conserved among members in the voltage-dependent cation channel superfamily, the mechanism underlying BK inhibition by extracellular acidification might also be applicable to other members in the family.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36734">Control of cyclic oligoadenylate synthesis in a type III CRISPR system</a></h4>

The CRISPR system for prokaryotic adaptive immunity provides RNA-mediated protection from viruses and mobile genetic elements. When viral RNA transcripts are detected, type III systems adopt an activated state that licenses DNA interference and synthesis of cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA). cOA activates nucleases and transcription factors that orchestrate the antiviral response. We demonstrate that cOA synthesis is subject to tight temporal control, commencing on target RNA binding, and is deactivated rapidly as target RNA is cleaved and dissociates. Mismatches in the target RNA are well tolerated and still activate the cyclase domain, except when located close to the 3' end of the target. Phosphorothioate modification reduces target RNA cleavage and stimulates cOA production. The 'RNA shredding' activity originally ascribed to type III systems may thus be a reflection of an exquisite mechanism for control of the Cas10 subunit, rather than a direct antiviral defence.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36073">A positive feedback-based mechanism for constriction rate acceleration during cytokinesis in <i>C. elegans</i></a></h4>

To ensure timely cytokinesis, the equatorial actomyosin contractile ring constricts at a relatively constant rate despite its progressively decreasing size. Thus, the per-unit-length constriction rate increases as ring perimeter decreases. To understand this acceleration, we monitored cortical surface and ring component dynamics during the first cytokinesis of the <i>C. elegans</i> embryo. We found that, per-unit-length, the amount of ring components (myosin, anillin) and the constriction rate increase with parallel exponential kinetics. Quantitative analysis of cortical flow indicated that the cortex within the ring is compressed along the axis perpendicular to the ring, and the per-unit-length rate of cortical compression increases during constriction in proportion to ring myosin. We propose that positive feedback between ring myosin and compression-driven flow of cortex into the ring drives an exponential increase in the per-unit-length amount of ring myosin to maintain a high ring constriction rate and support this proposal with an analytical mathematical model.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/35853">TRPV4 is the temperature-sensitive ion channel of human sperm</a></h4>

Ion channels control human sperm fertilizing ability by triggering hyperactivated motility, which is regulated by membrane potential, intracellular pH, and cytosolic calcium. Previous studies unraveled three essential ion channels that regulate these parameters: 1) the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel CatSper, 2) the K<sup>+</sup> channel KSper, and 3) the H<sup>+</sup> channel Hv1. However, the molecular identity of the sperm Na<sup>+</sup> conductance that mediates initial membrane depolarization and, thus, triggers downstream signaling events is yet to be defined. Here, we functionally characterize DSper, the Depolarizing Channel of Sperm, as the temperature-activated channel TRPV4. It is functionally expressed at both mRNA and protein levels, while other temperature-sensitive TRPV channels are not functional in human sperm. DSper currents are activated by warm temperatures and mediate cation conductance, that shares a pharmacological profile reminiscent of TRPV4. Together, these results suggest that TRPV4 activation triggers initial membrane depolarization, facilitating both CatSper and Hv1 gating and, consequently, sperm hyperactivation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/35718">Assessing reliability in neuroimaging research through intra-class effect decomposition (ICED)</a></h4>

Magnetic resonance imaging has become an indispensable tool for studying associations between structural and functional properties of the brain and behavior in humans. However, generally recognized standards for assessing and reporting the reliability of these techniques are still lacking. Here, we introduce a new approach for assessing and reporting reliability, termed intra-class effect decomposition (ICED). ICED uses structural equation modeling of data from a repeated-measures design to decompose reliability into orthogonal sources of measurement error that are associated with different characteristics of the measurements, for example, session, day, or scanning site. This allows researchers to describe the magnitude of different error components, make inferences about error sources, and inform them in planning future studies. We apply ICED to published measurements of myelin content and resting state functional connectivity. These examples illustrate how longitudinal data can be leveraged separately or conjointly with cross-sectional data to obtain more precise estimates of reliability.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/35676">Different contributions of preparatory activity in the basal ganglia and cerebellum for self-timing</a></h4>

The ability to flexibly adjust movement timing is important for everyday life. Although the basal ganglia and cerebellum have been implicated in monitoring of supra- and sub-second intervals, respectively, the underlying neuronal mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that in monkeys trained to generate a self-initiated saccade at instructed timing following a visual cue, neurons in the caudate nucleus kept track of passage of time throughout the delay period, while those in the cerebellar dentate nucleus were recruited only during the last part of the delay period. Conversely, neuronal correlates of trial-by-trial variation of self-timing emerged earlier in the cerebellum than the striatum. Local inactivation of respective recording sites confirmed the difference in their relative contributions to supra- and sub-second intervals. These results suggest that the basal ganglia may measure elapsed time relative to the intended interval, while the cerebellum might be responsible for the fine adjustment of self-timing.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/35261">Bidirectional encoding of motion contrast in the mouse superior colliculus</a></h4>

Detection of salient objects in the visual scene is a vital aspect of an animal's interactions with its environment. Here, we show that neurons in the mouse superior colliculus (SC) encode visual saliency by detecting motion contrast between stimulus center and surround. Excitatory neurons in the most superficial lamina of the SC are contextually modulated, monotonically increasing their response from suppression by the same-direction surround to maximal potentiation by an oppositely-moving surround. The degree of this potentiation declines with depth in the SC. Inhibitory neurons are suppressed by any surround at all depths. These response modulations in both neuronal populations are much more prominent to direction contrast than to phase, temporal frequency, or static orientation contrast, suggesting feature-specific saliency encoding in the mouse SC. Together, our findings provide evidence supporting locally generated feature representations in the SC, and lay the foundations towards a mechanistic and evolutionary understanding of their emergence.

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Ngang Heok   Tang, Yishi   Jin<br /> Development of a neuron critically depends on the organization of its cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletal components, such as tubulins and actins, have the remarkable ability to organize themselves into filaments and networks to support specialized and compartmentalized functions. Alterations in cytoskeletal proteins have long been associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. This review focuses on recent findings, primarily from forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans that illustrate how different tubulin protein isotypes can play distinct roles in neuronal development and function. Additionally, we discuss studies revealing new regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, and highlight recent technological advances in in vivo imaging and functional dissection of the neuronal cytoskeleton. <br /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Manuel   Valero, Liset Menendez   de la Prida<br /> Understanding how the brain represents events is a fundamental question in neuroscience. The entorhinal–hippocampal system is central to such representations, which are severely compromised in some neurological diseases. In spite of much progress, a comprehensive, integrated view of spatial, temporal and other aspects of episodic representation remains elusive. Here, we review recent data on the role of cell-type specific entorhinal inputs which excite deep and superficial CA1 pyramidal cells by direct and indirect pathways. We discuss how an entorhinal dialogue with deep-superficial CA1 cells can multiplex neuronal activity along theta phases and how their reactivation may be segregated during sharp-wave ripples. Thus, deep and superficial CA1 sublayers provide substrate for general hippocampal function. <br /> <h3 class="h3">Graphical abstract</h3> <img alt="image" height="159" src="http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438817302994-fx1.jpg" width="301" /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Yutaka   Yoshida, Tadashi   Isa<br /> An ability to control dexterous hand movements is considered to parallel the evolutionary development of the corticospinal tract and the appearance of direct connections between corticospinal neurons and motoneurons (the corticomotoneuronal (CM) pathway), which developed uniquely in higher primates. However, recent studies have revealed that some non-primate animal species have higher levels of dexterity than previously supposed, and in higher primates, various indirect non-CM descending pathways have been shown to participate in the control of dexterous movements. More recently, the CM pathway was shown to exist in rodents during early development, suggesting that rodents and primates diverged in their reliance on the CM pathway at some point in evolution, thus challenging the traditional view of the sequential development of hand control from rodents to primates. <br /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Robert R   Rozeske, Cyril   Herry<br /> The behavioral repertoire of an organism can be highly diverse, spanning from social to defensive. How an animal efficiently switches between distinct behaviors is a fundamental question whose inquiry will provide insights into the mechanisms that are necessary for an organism's survival. Previous work aimed at identifying the neural systems responsible for defensive behaviors, such as freezing, has demonstrated critical interactions between the prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Indeed, this foundational research has provided an indispensable anatomical framework that investigators are now using to understand the physiological mechanisms of defined neural circuits within the prefrontal cortex that code for the rapid and flexible expression of defensive behaviors. Here we review recent findings demonstrating temporal and rate coding mechanisms of freezing behavior in the prefrontal cortex. We hypothesize that anatomical features, such as target structure and cortical layer, as well as the nature of the information to be coded, may be critical factors determining the coding scheme. Furthermore, detailed behavioral analyses may reveal subtypes of defensive behaviors that represent the principle factor governing coding selection. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Tara E   Tracy, Li   Gan<br /> The accumulation of pathological tau in the brain is associated with neuronal deterioration and cognitive impairments in tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease. Tau, while primarily localized in the axons of healthy neurons, accumulates in the soma and dendrites of neurons under pathogenic conditions. Tau is found in both presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments of neurons in Alzheimer's disease. New research supports that soluble forms of tau trigger pathophysiology in the brain by altering properties of synaptic and neuronal function at the early stages of disease progression, before neurons die. Here we review the current understanding of how tau-mediated synaptic and neuronal dysfunction contributes to cognitive decline. Delineating the mechanisms by which pathogenic tau alters synapses, dendrites and axons will help lay the foundation for new strategies that can restore neuronal function in tauopathy. <br /><br />

Publication date: December 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 53<br />     Author(s): Henrik   Boije, Klas   Kullander<br /> The spinal circuitry governing the undulatory movements of swimming vertebrates consist of excitatory and commissural inhibitory interneurons and motor neurons. This locomotor network generates the rhythmic output, coordinate left/right alternation, and permit communication across segments. Through evolution, more complex movement patterns have emerged, made possible by sub-specialization of neural populations within the spinal cord. Walking tetrapods use a similar basic circuitry, but have added layers of complexity for the coordination of intralimbic flexor and extensor muscles as well as interlimbic coordination between the body halves and fore/hindlimbs. Although the basics of these circuits are known there is a gap in our knowledge regarding how different speeds and gaits are coordinated. Analysing subpopulations among described neuronal populations may bring insight into how changes in locomotor output are orchestrated by a hard-wired network. <br /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Adil G   Khan, Sonja B   Hofer<br /> Vision is an active process. What we perceive strongly depends on our actions, intentions and expectations. During visual processing, these internal signals therefore need to be integrated with the visual information from the retina. The mechanisms of how this is achieved by the visual system are still poorly understood. Advances in recording and manipulating neuronal activity in specific cell types and axonal projections together with tools for circuit tracing are beginning to shed light on the neuronal circuit mechanisms of how internal, contextual signals shape sensory representations. Here we review recent work, primarily in mice, that has advanced our understanding of these processes, focusing on contextual signals related to locomotion, behavioural relevance and predictions. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Anne   Bertolotti<br /> Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's, Huntington's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and prion disorders are devastating neurodegenerative diseases of increasing prevalence in aging populations. Although clinically different, they share similar molecular features: the accumulation of one or two proteins in abnormal conformations inside or outside neurons. Enhancing protein quality control systems could be a useful strategy to neutralize the abnormal proteins causing neurodegenerative diseases. This review emphasizes the subcellular location of protein deposits in neurodegenerative diseases and the need to tailor strategies aimed at boosting protein quality control systems to the affected subcellular compartment. Inhibition of a protein phosphatase terminating the unfolded protein response will be discussed as a strategy to protect from diseases associated with misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. <br /><br />

Publication date: December 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 53<br />     Author(s): Emilia   Favuzzi, Beatriz   Rico<br /> The complexity and precision of cortical circuitries is achieved during development due to the exquisite diversity of synapse types that is generated in a highly regulated manner. Here, we review the recent increase in our understanding of how synapse type-specific molecules differentially regulate the development of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Moreover, several synapse subtype-specific molecules have been shown to control the targeting, formation or maturation of particular subtypes of excitatory synapses. Because inhibitory neurons are extremely diverse, a similar molecular diversity is likely to underlie the development of different inhibitory synapses making it a promising topic for future investigation in the field of the synapse development. <br /><br />

Publication date: December 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 53<br />     Author(s): Caitlin E   Moyer, Yi   Zuo<br /> Dendritic spines are the postsynaptic sites of most excitatory synapses in the cerebral cortex. Their morphology and density change throughout life, reflecting the maturation and reorganization of excitatory circuits. The development of in vivo two-photon microscopy has enabled the monitoring of the same dendritic spines over time during different developmental periods. In this review we focus on recent in vivo imaging studies in rodents that have revealed cell type-specific and region-specific structural dynamics of dendritic spines. We also discuss how the contributions of local inhibitory neurons and long-distance excitatory and neuromodulatory inputs to the cortex influence dendritic spine development and dynamics. Such studies will facilitate our understanding of how environmental factors and experiences affect cortical synapse development. <br /><br />

Publication date: December 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 53<br />     Author(s): Clinton   Cave, Shanthini   Sockanathan<br /> The embryonic generation of motor neurons is a complex process involving progenitor patterning, fate specification, differentiation, and maturation. Throughout this progression, the differential expression of transcription factors has served as our road map for the eventual cell fate of nascent motor neurons. Recent findings from in vivo and in vitro models of motor neuron development have expanded our understanding of how transcription factors govern motor neuron identity and their individual regulatory mechanisms. With the advent of next generation sequencing approaches, researchers now have unprecedented access to the gene regulatory dynamics involved in motor neuron development and are uncovering new connections linking neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative disease. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Sylvain   Rama, Mickaël   Zbili, Dominique   Debanne<br /> Axons link distant brain regions and are usually considered as simple transmission cables in which reliable propagation occurs once an action potential has been generated. Safe propagation of action potentials relies on specific ion channel expression at strategic points of the axon such as nodes of Ranvier or axonal branch points. However, while action potentials are generally considered as the quantum of neuronal information, their signaling is not entirely digital. In fact, both their shape and their conduction speed have been shown to be modulated by activity, leading to regulations of synaptic latency and synaptic strength. We report here newly identified mechanisms of (1) safe spike propagation along the axon, (2) compartmentalization of action potential shape in the axon, (3) analog modulation of spike-evoked synaptic transmission and (4) alteration in conduction time after persistent regulation of axon morphology in central neurons. We discuss the contribution of these regulations in information processing. <br /><br />

Studies of female specific behaviors have remained niche, but the focus is changing as illustrated by the recent progress in understanding the female courtship responses and egg-laying decisions. In this review, we will cover our current knowledge about female behaviors in these two specific contexts. Recent studies elucidate on how females process the courtship song. They also show that egg-laying decisions are extremely complex, requiring the assessment of food, microbial, predator and social cues. Study of female responses will improve our understanding of how a nervous system processes different challenges. <br /><br />

Here, we discuss recent work using personalized brain network models to study structure–function relationships in human brains. We describe the steps necessary to build such models and show how this computational approach can provide previously unobtainable information through the ability to perform virtual experiments. Finally, we present examples of how personalized brain network models can be used to gain insight into the effects of local stimulation and improve surgical outcomes in epilepsy. <br /> <h3 class="h3">Graphical abstract</h3> <img alt="image" height="93" src="http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438818300059-fx1.jpg" width="301" /><br />

At each level of this pathway, neurogenesis, axonal elongation, pathfinding, target recognition and circuit reorganization including dendritic refinement of cortical layer 4 neurons occur contemporaneously and a multitude of molecular signals are used in differing combinations. We highlight recent advances in development of tactile circuitry and note gaps in our understanding. <br /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Rebecca A   Piskorowski, Vivien   Chevaleyre<br /> The hippocampus is a central region in the coding of spatial, temporal and episodic memory. Recent discoveries have revealed surprising and complex roles of the small area CA2 in hippocampal function. Lesion studies have revealed that this region is required for social memory formation. Area CA2 is targeted by extra-hippocampal paraventricular inputs that release vasopressin and can act to enhance social memory performance. In vivo recordings have revealed nonconventional activity by neurons in this region that act to both initiate hippocampal sharp-wave ripple events as well as encode spatial information during immobility. Silencing of CA2 pyramidal neurons has revealed that this area also acts to control hippocampal network excitability during encoding, and this balance of excitation and inhibition is disrupted in disease. This review summarizes recent findings and attempts to integrate these results into pre-existing models. <br /><br />

However, bulk of evidence demonstrates the requirement of the reciprocal interactions between cortical and thalamic neurons as key for the correct development of functional thalamocortical circuits. This reciprocal loop of connections is essential for sensory processing as well as for the execution of complex sensory-motor tasks. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of how mutual collaborations between both brain regions define area patterning and cell differentiation in the thalamus and cortex. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Craig   Blackstone<br /> Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are neurologic disorders characterized by prominent lower-extremity spasticity, resulting from a length-dependent axonopathy of corticospinal upper motor neurons. They are among the most genetically-diverse neurologic disorders, with &amp;gt;80 distinct genetic loci and over 60 identified genes. Studies investigating the molecular pathogenesis underlying HSPs have emphasized the importance of converging cellular pathogenic themes in the most common forms of HSP, providing compelling targets for therapy. Most notably, these include organelle shaping and biogenesis as well as membrane and cargo trafficking. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Kelsey A   Herrmann, Heather T   Broihier<br /> Although retrograde neurotrophin signaling has provided an immensely influential paradigm for understanding growth factor signaling in the nervous system, recent studies indicate that growth factors also signal via cell-autonomous, or autocrine, mechanisms. Autocrine signals have been discovered in many neuronal contexts, providing insights into their regulation and function. The growing realization of the importance of cell-autonomous signaling stems from advances in both conditional genetic approaches and in sophisticated analyses of growth factor dynamics, which combine to enable rigorous in vivo dissection of signaling pathways. Here we review recent studies defining autocrine roles for growth factors such as BDNF, and classical morphogens, including Wnts and BMPs, in regulating neuronal development and plasticity. Collectively, these studies highlight an intimate relationship between activity-dependent autocrine signaling and synaptic plasticity, and further suggest a common principle for coordinating paracrine and autocrine signaling in the nervous system. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Patrick   Lüningschrör, Michael   Sendtner<br /> Regulated release of neurotransmitter depends on the orchestrated function of a large number of proteins in the presynaptic compartment. When synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, these membranes and the attached proteins are endocytosed and either recycled or degraded. This turnover needs to be tightly regulated in a timely and spatially confined manner. Increasing evidence suggests that these mechanisms do not only serve for the removal of defective synaptic vesicles or structural proteins of the active zone but also contribute to pathways regulating synaptic strength. The corresponding presynaptic autophagy system thus appears also important for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. Exciting new studies provide evidence how the autophagy machinery recognizes and degrades synaptic components and lay the ground to understand how autophagy in the presynaptic compartment contributes to modulation and maintenance of synaptic function. <br /><br />

How can blood rapidly and precisely reach active neurons at a given time and location has remained enigmatic for a long time. A 2003 paper by Zonta et al. suggested key roles for astrocytes in the signaling between neurons and blood vessels. While a consensus on the specific intermediary roles of astrocytes in this process is still evolving, research in the past 15 years has led to a deeper and more refined understanding of the neuro-glio-vascular unit.

In 1983 Libet et al. demonstrated that brain activity associated with a voluntary act precedes conscious experience of the intention to act by several hundred milliseconds. The implication that it is the brain, rather than ‘free will’, that initiates voluntary acts has been discussed ever since by philosophers and lawyers, as well as by scientists. We show here how Libet’s original study gave rise to an entire research field of experimental investigations of volition.

The past decade has yielded substantial evidence that the gut microbiome modulates brain function, including for instance behaviors relevant to anxiety and depression, pointing to a need to identify the biological pathways involved. In 2013 Clarke and colleagues reported that the early-life microbiome regulates the hippocampal serotonergic system in a sex-dependent manner, findings that opened up numerous lines of inquiry on the effects of the microbiome on neurodevelopment and behavior.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>By using AT8-immunocytochemistry that visualizes hyperphosphorylated tau protein, we examined neurofibrillary changes related to sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in <span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 40 individuals at neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stages I–IV. We report the presence of abnormal tau changes within solitary pyramidal neurons in layers III and V of the neocortex. These pyramidal cells showed pathology in different cell compartments (dendritic, somatic, axonal) that appeared to occur sequentially: Tau pathology was seen in distal segments of the basal dendrites, then in proximal dendrites, the soma, and, finally, in the axon of affected neurons. These findings are remarkable in that they point to the existence of neurofibrillary changes in regions routinely associated with later NFT stages. In addition, they lend support to the idea that it may be the axons of cortico-cortical top-down neurons in neocortical fields involved in AD that carry and spread abnormal tau seeds in a focused manner (transsynaptically) into the distal dendritic segments of nerve cells following directly in the neuronal chain, thereby sustaining further tau-seeded templating.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Excessive excitation has been hypothesized to subsume a significant part of the acute damage occurring after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, reduced neuronal excitability, loss of neuronal firing, and a disturbed excitation/inhibition balance have been detected. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons are major regulators of perisomatic inhibition, principal neurons firing, and overall cortical excitability. However, their role in acute TBI pathogenic cascades is unclear. We exploited the chemogenetic Pharmacologically Selective Activation Module and Pharmacologically Selective Effector Module control of PV-Cre<sup>+</sup> neurons and the Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug (DREADD) control of principal neurons in a blunt model of TBI to explore the role of inhibition in shaping neuronal vulnerability to TBI. We demonstrated that inactivation of PV interneurons at the instance or soon after trauma enhances survival of principal neurons and reduces gliosis at 7 dpi whereas, activation of PV interneurons decreased neuronal survival. The protective effect of PV inactivation was suppressed by expressing the nuclear calcium buffer PV-nuclear localisation sequence in principal neurons, implying an activity-dependent neuroprotective signal. In fact, protective effects were obtained by increasing the excitability of principal neurons directly using DREADDs. Thus, we show that sustaining neuronal excitation in the early phases of TBI may reduce neuronal vulnerability by increasing activity-dependent survival, while excess activation of perisomatic inhibition is detrimental to neuronal integrity.</span>

<p>by Gregory J. Gerling, Lingtian Wan, Benjamin U. Hoffman, Yuxiang Wang, Ellen A. Lumpkin</p>

Distinct firing properties among touch receptors are influenced by multiple, interworking anatomical structures. Our understanding of the functions and crosstalk of Merkel cells and their associated neurites—the end organs of slowly adapting type I (SAI) afferents—remains incomplete. Piezo2 mechanically activated channels are required both in Merkel cells and in sensory neurons for canonical SAI responses in rodents; however, a central unanswered question is how rapidly inactivating currents give rise to sustained action potential volleys in SAI afferents. The computational model herein synthesizes mechanotransduction currents originating from Merkel cells and neurites, in context of skin mechanics and neural dynamics. Its goal is to mimic distinct spike firing patterns from wildtype animals, as well as <i>Atoh1</i> knockout animals that completely lack Merkel cells. The developed generator function includes a Merkel cell mechanism that represents its mechanotransduction currents and downstream voltage-activated conductances (slower decay of current) and a neurite mechanism that represents its mechanotransduction currents (faster decay of current). To mimic sustained firing in wildtype animals, a longer time constant was needed than the 200 ms observed for mechanically activated membrane depolarizations in rodent Merkel cells. One mechanism that suffices is to introduce an ultra-slowly inactivating current, with a time constant on the order of 1.7 s. This mechanism may drive the slow adaptation of the sustained response, for which the skin’s viscoelastic relaxation cannot account. Positioned within the sensory neuron, this source of current reconciles the physiology and anatomical characteristics of <i>Atoh1</i> knockout animals.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AN0hi7HylwE" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Extracting the statistics of event streams in natural environments is critical for interpreting current events and predicting future ones. The brain is known to rapidly find structure and meaning in unfamiliar streams of sensory experience, often by mere exposure to the environment (i.e. without explicit feedback). Yet, we know little about the brain pathways that support this type of statistical learning. Here, we test whether changes in white-matter connectivity due to training relate to our ability to extract temporal regularities. By combining behavioral training and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), we demonstrate that humans adapt to the environment’s statistics as they change over time from simple repetition to probabilistic combinations. In particular, we show that learning relates to the decision strategy that individuals adopt when extracting temporal statistics. We next test for learning-dependent changes in white-matter connectivity and ask whether they relate to individual variability in decision strategy. Our DTI results provide evidence for dissociable white-matter pathways that relate to individual strategy: extracting the exact sequence statistics (i.e. matching) relates to connectivity changes between caudate and hippocampus, while selecting the most probable outcomes in a given context (i.e. maximizing) relates to connectivity changes between prefrontal, cingulate and basal ganglia (caudate, putamen) regions. Thus, our findings provide evidence for distinct cortico-striatal circuits that show learning-dependent changes of white-matter connectivity and support individual ability to learn behaviorally-relevant statistics.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Training is known to improve performance in a range of sensory-motor tasks and alter white-matter connectivity, as measured by Diffusion Tensor imaging (DTI).

Abstract<p>Understanding how neural systems integrate, encode, and compute information is central to understanding brain function. Frequently, data from neuroscience experiments are multivariate, the interactions between the variables are non-linear, and the landscape of hypothesized or possible interactions between variables is extremely broad. Information theory is well suited to address these types of data as it possesses multivariate analysis tools, it can be applied to many different types of data, it can capture non-linear interactions, and it does not require assumptions about the structure of the underlying data (i.e., it is model independent). In this article, we walk through the mathematics of information theory along with common logistical problems associated with data type, data binning, data quantity requirements, bias, and significance testing. Next, we analyze models inspired by canonical neuroscience experiments to improve understanding and demonstrate the strengths of information theory analyses. To facilitate the use of information theory analyses, and an understanding of how these analyses are implemented, we also provide a free MATLAB software package that can be applied to a wide range of data from neuroscience experiments, as well as from other fields of study.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> A primary function of the brain is to process and store information. Therefore, it makes sense to analyze the behavior of the brain using information theory, a statistical tool especially designed to quantify information. Furthermore, given improvements in data gathering techniques, the power of information theory to analyze large, complex data sets is particularly relevant. In this tutorial, we provide a thorough introduction to information theory and how it can be applied to data gathered from the brain. Our primary audience for this tutorial is researchers new to information theory. We provide numerous intuitive examples including small abstract systems, small and large brain circuits, systems from famous neuroscience experiments, and free software to implement all calculations and models presented herein.</p>

Abstract
<p>Glutamate signaling is essential for the persistent neural activity in prefrontal cortex (PFC) that enables working memory. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are a diverse class of proteins that modulate excitatory neurotransmission via both presynaptic regulation of extracellular glutamate levels and postsynaptic modulation of ion channels on dendritic spines. This receptor class is of significant therapeutic interest for treatment of cognitive disorders associated with glutamate dysregulation. Working memory impairment and cortical hypoexcitability are both associated with advanced aging. Whether aging modifies PFC mGluR expression, and the extent to which any such alterations are regionally or subtype specific, however, is unknown. Moreover, it is unclear whether specific mGluRs in PFC are critical for working memory, and thus, whether altered mGluR expression in aging or disease is sufficient to play a causative role in working memory decline. Experiments in the current study first evaluated the effects of age on medial PFC (mPFC) mGluR expression using biochemical and molecular approaches in rats. Of the eight mGluRs examined, only mGluR5, mGluR3, and mGluR4 were significantly reduced in the aged PFC. The reductions in mGluR3 and mGluR5 (but not mGluR4) were observed in both mRNA and protein and were selectively localized to the prelimbic (PrL), but not infralimbic (IL), subregion of mPFC. Finally, pharmacological blockade of mGluR5 or mGluR2/3 using selective antagonists directed to PrL significantly impaired working memory without influencing non-mnemonic aspects of task performance. Together, these data implicate attenuated expression of PFC mGluR5 and mGluR3 in the impaired working memory associated with advanced ages.</p>

<p>The paper is devoted to the relationship between psychophysics and physics of
mind. The basic trends in psychophysics development are briefly discussed with
special attention focused on Teghtsoonian's hypotheses. These hypotheses pose
the concept of the universality of inner psychophysics and enable to speak
about psychological space as an individual object with its own properties.
Turning to the two-component description of human behavior (I. Lubashevsky,
Physics of the Human Mind, Springer, 2017) the notion of mental space is
formulated and human perception of external stimuli is treated as the emergence
of the corresponding images in the mental space. On one hand, these images are
caused by external stimuli and their magnitude bears the information about the
intensity of the corresponding stimuli. On the other hand, the individual
structure of such images as well as their subsistence after emergence is
determined only by the properties of mental space on its own. Finally, the
mental operations of image comparison and their scaling are defined in a way
allowing for the bounded capacity of human cognition. As demonstrated, the
developed theory of stimulus perception is able to explain the basic
regularities of psychophysics, e.g., (i) the regression and range effects
leading to the overestimation of weak stimuli and the underestimation of strong
stimuli, (ii) scalar variability (Weber's and Ekman' laws), and (\textit{iii})
the sequential (memory) effects. As the final result, a solution to the
Fechner-Stevens dilemma is proposed. This solution posits that Fechner's
logarithmic law is not a consequences of Weber's law but stems from the
interplay of uncertainty in evaluating stimulus intensities and the multi-step
scaling required to overcome the stimulus incommensurability.

<p>We consider a heteroclinic network in the framework of winnerless competition
of species. It consists of two levels of heteroclinic cycles. On the lower
level, the heteroclinic cycle connects three saddles, each representing the
survival of a single species; on the higher level, the cycle connects three
such heteroclinic cycles, in which nine species are involved. We show how to
tune the predation rates in order to generate the long time scales on the
higher level from the shorter time scales on the lower level. Moreover, when we
tune a single bifurcation parameter, first the motion along the lower and next
along the higher-level heteroclinic cycles are replaced by a heteroclinic cycle
between 3-species coexistence-fixed points and by a 9-species coexistence-fixed
point, respectively. We also observe a similar impact of additive noise. Beyond
its usual role of preventing the slowing-down of heteroclinic trajectories at
small noise level, its increasing strength can replace the lower-level
heteroclinic cycle by 3-species coexistence fixed-points, connected by an
effective limit cycle, and for even stronger noise the trajectories converge to
the 9-species coexistence-fixed point. The model has applications to systems in
which slow oscillations modulate fast oscillations with sudden transitions
between the temporary winners.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36133">Predictive regulation and human design</a></h4>

Organisms evolving toward greater complexity were selected across aeons to use energy and resources efficiently. Efficiency depended on prediction at every stage: first a clock to predict the planet’s statistical regularities; then a brain to predict bodily needs and compute commands that dynamically adjust the flows of energy and nutrients. Predictive regulation (allostasis) frugally matches resources to needs and thus forms a core principle of our design. Humans, reaching a pinnacle of cognitive complexity, eventually produced a device (the steam engine) that converted thermal energy to work and were suddenly awash in resources. Today boundless consumption in many nations challenges all our regulatory mechanisms, causing obesity, diabetes, drug addiction and their sequelae. So far we have sought technical solutions, such as drugs, to treat complex circuits for metabolism, appetites and mood. Here I argue for a different approach which starts by asking: why does our regulatory system, which evolution tuned for small satisfactions, now constantly demand 'more'?

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/34110">A novel source of arterial valve cells linked to bicuspid aortic valve without raphe in mice</a></h4>

Abnormalities of the arterial valve leaflets, predominantly bicuspid aortic valve, are the commonest congenital malformations. Although many studies have investigated the development of the arterial valves, it has been assumed that, as with the atrioventricular valves, endocardial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is the predominant mechanism. We show that arterial is distinctly different from atrioventricular valve formation. Whilst the four septal valve leaflets are dominated by NCC and EndMT-derived cells, the intercalated leaflets differentiate directly from <i>Tnnt2-Cre</i>+/Isl1+ progenitors in the outflow wall, via a Notch-Jag dependent mechanism. Further, when this novel group of progenitors are disrupted, development of the intercalated leaflets is disrupted, resulting in leaflet dysplasia and bicuspid valves without raphe, most commonly affecting the aortic valve. This study thus overturns the dogma that heart valves are formed principally by EndMT, identifies a new source of valve interstitial cells, and provides a novel mechanism for causation of bicuspid aortic valves without raphe.

<p>by Daniel Munro, Dario Ghersi, Mona Singh</p>

A major goal of cancer genomics is to identify somatic mutations that play a role in tumor initiation or progression. Somatic mutations within transcription factors are of particular interest, as gene expression dysregulation is widespread in cancers. The substantial gene expression variation evident across tumors suggests that numerous regulatory factors are likely to be involved and that somatic mutations within them may not occur at high frequencies across patient cohorts, thereby complicating efforts to uncover which ones are cancer-relevant. Here we analyze somatic mutations within the largest family of human transcription factors, namely those that bind DNA via Cys2His2 zinc finger domains. Specifically, to hone in on important mutations within these genes, we aggregated somatic mutations across all of them by their positions within Cys2His2 zinc finger domains. Remarkably, we found that for three classes of cancers profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)—Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma, Colon and Rectal Adenocarcinomas, and Skin Cutaneous Melanoma—two specific, functionally important positions within zinc finger domains are mutated significantly more often than expected by chance, with alterations in 18%, 10% and 43% of tumors, respectively. Numerous zinc finger genes are affected, with those containing Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) repressor domains preferentially targeted by these mutations. Further, the genes with these mutations also have high overall missense mutation rates, are expressed at levels comparable to those of known cancer genes, and together have biological process annotations that are consistent with roles in cancers. Altogether, we introduce evidence broadly implicating mutations within a diverse set of zinc finger proteins as relevant for cancer, and propose that they contribute to the widespread transcriptional dysregulation observed in cancer cells.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ei87dOiwXCQ" width="1" />

Abstract<p>One of the major challenges in visual neuroscience is represented by foreground-background segmentation. Data from nonhuman primates show that segmentation leads to two distinct, but associated processes: the enhancement of neural activity during figure processing (i.e., foreground enhancement) and the suppression of background-related activity (i.e., background suppression). To study foreground-background segmentation in ecological conditions, we introduce a novel method based on parametric modulation of low-level image properties followed by application of simple computational image-processing models. By correlating the outcome of this procedure with human fMRI activity, measured during passive viewing of 334 natural images, we produced easily interpretable "correlation images" from visual populations. Results show evidence of foreground enhancement in all tested regions, from V1 to LOC, while background suppression occurs in V4 and LOC only. "Correlation images" derived from V4 and LOC revealed a preserved spatial resolution of foreground textures, indicating a richer representation of the salient part of natural images, rather than a simplistic model of object shape. Our results indicate that scene segmentation occurs during natural viewing, even when individuals are not required to perform any particular task.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Foreground-background segmentation has been considered critical to form discrete object representations from continuous sensory percepts. We developed a pre-filtering approach which overcame typical limitations in modeling brain responses to complex stimuli and could be generalized to related processes. Our findings provide novel support to the hypothesis that foreground-background segmentation of natural scenes occurs during passive perception, sustained by the distributed activity of multiple areas across the visual processing stream. Specifically, while foreground information is enhanced along the entire visual pathway, V4 and LOC show a background suppression effect, though retaining texture information from the foreground.

Abstract
<p>Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is caused by clotting in the cerebral arteries, leading to brain oxygen deprivation and cerebral infarction. Recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is currently the only Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for ischemic stroke. However, tPA has to be administered within 4.5 h from the disease onset and delayed treatment of tPA can increase the risk of neurovascular impairment, including neuronal cell death, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and hemorrhagic transformation. A key contributing factor for tPA-induced neurovascular impairment is activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). We used a clinically-relevant mouse embolic model of focal-cerebral ischemia by insertion of a single embolus of blood clot to block the right middle cerebral artery. We showed that administration of the potent and highly selective gelatinase inhibitor SB-3CT extends the time window for administration of tPA, attenuating infarct volume, mitigating BBB disruption, and antagonizing the increase in cerebral hemorrhage induced by tPA treatment. We demonstrated that SB-3CT attenuates tPA-induced expression of vascular MMP-9, prevents gelatinase-mediated cleavage of extracellular laminin, rescues endothelial cells, and reduces caveolae-mediated transcytosis of endothelial cells. These results suggest that abrogation of MMP-9 activity mitigates the detrimental effects of tPA treatment, thus the combination treatment holds great promise for extending the therapeutic window for tPA thrombolysis, which opens the opportunity for clinical recourse to a greater number of patients.</p>

<p>Nodes of Ranvier are unique regions where voltage-gated sodium channels are highly enriched to drive saltatory conduction. Genetic ablations in adult mice with loss of specific nodal proteins causes slow but progressive nodal deterioration associated with decreased nerve conduction and axonopathy. What has remained unaddressed is whether loss of nodal proteins at different time points in postnatal life follows similar timelines of nodal disorganization. Here we utilized simultaneous ablation of Neurofascin (NF186) and Ankyrin G (AnkG) in mice of both sexes at three specific time points. We report that concurrent ablation of these core nodal components at postnatal day 13 (P13) leads to accelerated nodal destabilization in comparison with P23, and this disorganization is even slower when ablated at P93. Ablation of NF186 with AnkG at P13 reduced the half-life of NF186 to 15 days compared to 1 month at P23, which increased to 2 months at P93, indicating increasing nodal stability. The half-life of AnkG at the nodes also increased with age but showed enhanced disappearance from the node in the absence of NF186, with a half-life of 3 days at P13 ablation. The nodal disorganization occurred in a sequential manner, with AnkG disappearing first from the nodal areas irrespective of the timing of ablation, and led to decreased nerve conduction and affected axonal health. Together, our studies reveal that nodes of Ranvier in myelinated axons continue to become more stable with age and suggest that nodal disorganization in adult human demyelinating disorders occurs slowly until neurological symptoms become evident.</p>

<p>The time-changing nature of our world demands processing of huge amounts of
information in fast and reliable way to generate successful behaviors.
Therefore, significant brain resources are devoted to process spatiotemporal
information. Neural basis of spatial processing and their cognitive correlates
are well established mostly for static environments. Nonetheless, in
time-changing situations the brain exploits specific processing mechanisms for
temporal information based on prediction and anticipation, as time compression
during visual perception and mental navigation. Alternative hypothesis of time
compaction integrates both views, postulating that dynamic situations are
internally represented as static spatial maps where temporal information is
extracted by predicting and structuring the relevant interactions.
Nevertheless, empirical approaches tackling the biological soundness of time
compaction are still lacking. Here we show that performance in a discrimination
learning task involving dynamic situations can be either favored or hampered
via previous exposition to interfering static scenes. In this sense, men were
effectively conditioned in contrast to a control group, in coherence with the
hypothesis. Meanwhile, women performed on par with control men, regardless of
the previous conditioning. This suggests time compaction is a salient cognitive
strategy in men when dealing with dynamic situations, while women seem to rely
on a broader range of information processing strategies. Finally, we further
corroborated the time compaction mechanism involved in these experimental
findings through a mathematical model of the experimental process. Our results
point to some form of static internal representation mechanism at cognitive
level involved in decision-making and strategy planning in dynamic situations

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10409">A neuro-inspired system for online learning and recognition of parallel spike trains, based on spike latency and heterosynaptic STDP. (arXiv:1806.10409v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Humans perform remarkably well in many cognitive tasks including pattern
recognition. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying this process are not
well understood. Nevertheless, artificial neural networks, inspired in brain
circuits, have been designed and used to tackle spatio-temporal pattern
recognition tasks. In this paper we present a multineuronal spike pattern
detection structure able to autonomously implement online learning and
recognition of parallel spike sequences (i.e., sequences of pulses belonging to
different neurons/neural ensembles). The operating principle of this structure
is based on two spiking/synaptic neurocomputational characteristics: spike
latency, that enables neurons to fire spikes with a certain delay and
heterosynaptic plasticity, that allows the own regulation of synaptic weights.
From the perspective of the information representation, the structure allows
mapping a spatio-temporal stimulus into a multidimensional, temporal, feature
space. In this space, the parameter coordinate and the time at which a neuron
fires represent one specific feature. In this sense, each feature can be
considered to span a single temporal axis. We applied our proposed scheme to
experimental data obtained from a motor inhibitory cognitive task. The test
exhibits good classification performance, indicating the adequateness of our
approach. In addition to its effectiveness, its simplicity and low
computational cost suggest a large scale implementation for real time
recognition applications in several areas, such as brain computer interface,
personal biometrics authentication or early detection of diseases.

<p>The clustering coefficient quantifies the abundance of connected triangles in
a network and is a major descriptive statistics of networks. For example, it
finds an application in the assessment of small-worldness of brain networks,
which is affected by attentional and cognitive conditions, age, psychiatric
disorders and so forth. However, it remains unclear how the clustering
coefficient should be measured in a correlation-based network, which is among
major representations of brain networks. In the present article, we propose
clustering coefficients tailored to correlation matrices. The key idea is to
use three-way partial correlation or partial mutual information to measure the
strength of the association between the two neighbouring nodes of a focal node
relative to the amount of pseudo-correlation expected from indirect paths
between the nodes. Our method avoids the difficulties of previous applications
of clustering coefficient (and other) measures in defining correlational
networks, i.e., thresholding on the correlation value, discarding of negative
correlation values, the pseudo-correlation problem and full partial correlation
matrices whose estimation is computationally difficult. For proof of concept,
we apply the proposed clustering coefficient measures to functional magnetic
resonance imaging data obtained from healthy participants of various ages and
compare them with conventional clustering coefficients. We show that the
clustering coefficients decline with the age. The proposed clustering
coefficients are more strongly correlated with age than the conventional ones
are. We also show that the local variants of the proposed clustering
coefficients are useful in characterising individual nodes. In contrast, the
conventional local clustering coefficients were strongly correlated with and
therefore may be confounded by the node's connectivity.

<p>It is widely believed that the backpropagation algorithm is essential for
learning good feature detectors in early layers of artificial neural networks,
so that these detectors are useful for the task performed by the higher layers
of that neural network. At the same time, the traditional form of
backpropagation is biologically implausible. In the present paper we propose an
unusual learning rule, which has a degree of biological plausibility, and which
is motivated by Hebb's idea that change of the synapse strength should be local
- i.e. should depend only on the activities of the pre and post synaptic
neurons. We design a learning algorithm that utilizes global inhibition in the
hidden layer, and is capable of learning early feature detectors in a
completely unsupervised way. These learned lower layer feature detectors can be
used to train higher layer weights in a usual supervised way so that the
performance of the full network is comparable to the performance of standard
feedforward networks trained end-to-end with a backpropagation algorithm.

<p>Probabilistic inference provides a language for describing how organisms may
learn from and adapt to their environment. The computations needed to implement
probabilistic inference often require specific representations, akin to having
the suitable data structures for implementing certain algorithms in computer
programming. Yet it is unclear how such representations can be instantiated in
the stochastic, parallel-running biochemical machinery found in cells (such as
single-celled organisms). Here, we show how representations for supporting
inference in Markov models can be embodied in cellular circuits, by combining a
concentration-dependent scheme for encoding probabilities with a mechanism for
directional counting. We show how the logic of protein production and
degradation constrains the computation we set out to implement. We argue that
this process by which an abstract computation is shaped by its biochemical
realization strikes a compromise between "rationalistic" information-processing
perspectives and alternative approaches that emphasize embodiment.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The sympathetic system’s role in modulating vasculature and its influence on emotions and personality led us to test the hypothesis that interactions between brain resting-state networks (RSNs) and pulse amplitude (indexing sympathetic activity) would be associated with emotions and personality. In 203 participants, we characterized RSN spatiotemporal characteristics, and phase–amplitude associations of RSN fluctuations with pulse and respiratory recordings. We found that RSNs are spatially reproducible within participants and were temporally associated with low frequencies (LFs &lt; 0.1 Hz) in physiological signals. LF fluctuations in pulse amplitude were not related to cardiac electrical activity and preceded LF fluctuations in RSNs, while LF respiratory amplitude fluctuations followed LF fluctuations in RSNs. LF phase dispersion (PD) (lack of synchrony) between RSNs and pulse (PD<sub>pulse</sub>) (not respiratory) correlated with the common variability in measures of personality and emotions, with more synchrony being associated with more positive temperamental characteristics. Voxel-level PD<sub>pulse</sub> mapping revealed an “autonomic brain network,” including sensory cortices and dorsal attention stream, with significant interactions with peripheral signals. Here, we uncover associations between pulse signal amplitude (presumably of sympathetic origin) and brain resting state, suggesting that interactions between central and autonomic nervous systems are important for characterizing personality and emotions.</span>

A reductively mechanistic approach to neuroscience suggests that low-level physical laws determine our actions and that mental states are epiphenomena. In this scheme there seems to be little room for free will or genuine agency. I argue here that physical indeterminacy provides room for the information entailed in patterns of neuronal firing – the mental content of beliefs, goals, and intentions – to have real causal power in decision-making.

<p>by Giri P. Krishnan, Burke Q. Rosen, Jen-Yung Chen, Lyle Muller, Terrence J. Sejnowski, Sydney S. Cash, Eric Halgren, Maxim Bazhenov</p>

Sleep spindles are brief oscillatory events during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Spindle density and synchronization properties are different in MEG versus EEG recordings in humans and also vary with learning performance, suggesting spindle involvement in memory consolidation. Here, using computational models, we identified network mechanisms that may explain differences in spindle properties across cortical structures. First, we report that differences in spindle occurrence between MEG and EEG data may arise from the contrasting properties of the core and matrix thalamocortical systems. The matrix system, projecting superficially, has wider thalamocortical fanout compared to the core system, which projects to middle layers, and requires the recruitment of a larger population of neurons to initiate a spindle. This property was sufficient to explain lower spindle density and higher spatial synchrony of spindles in the superficial cortical layers, as observed in the EEG signal. In contrast, spindles in the core system occurred more frequently but less synchronously, as observed in the MEG recordings. Furthermore, consistent with human recordings, in the model, spindles occurred independently in the core system but the matrix system spindles commonly co-occurred with core spindles. We also found that the intracortical excitatory connections from layer III/IV to layer V promote spindle propagation from the core to the matrix system, leading to widespread spindle activity. Our study predicts that plasticity of intra- and inter-cortical connectivity can potentially be a mechanism for increased spindle density as has been observed during learning.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/n6XKqTbGe3g" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/26/6011?rss=1">h-Type Membrane Current Shapes the Local Field Potential from Populations of Pyramidal Neurons</a></h4>

<p>In cortex, the local field potential (LFP) is thought to mainly stem from correlated synaptic input to populations of geometrically aligned neurons. Computer models of single cortical pyramidal neurons showed that subthreshold voltage-dependent membrane conductances can also shape the LFP signal, in particular the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (<i>I</i><sub>h</sub>; h-type). This ion channel is prominent in various types of pyramidal neurons, typically showing an increasing density gradient along the apical dendrites. Here, we investigate how <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> affects the LFP generated by a model of a population of cortical pyramidal neurons. We find that the LFP from populations of neurons that receive uncorrelated synaptic input can be well predicted by the LFP from single neurons. In this case, when input impinges on the distal dendrites, where most h-type channels are located, a strong resonance in the LFP was measured near the soma, whereas the opposite configuration does not reveal an <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> contribution to the LFP. Introducing correlations in the synaptic inputs to the pyramidal cells strongly amplifies the LFP, while maintaining the differential effects of <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> for distal dendritic versus perisomatic input. Previous theoretical work showed that input correlations do not amplify LFP power when neurons receive synaptic input uniformly across the cell. We find that this crucially depends on the membrane conductance distribution: the asymmetric distribution of <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> results in a strong amplification of the LFP when synaptic inputs to the cell population are correlated. In conclusion, we find that the h-type current is particularly suited to shape the LFP signal in cortical populations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The local field potential (LFP), the low-frequency part of extracellular potentials recorded in neural tissue, is often used for probing neural circuit activity. While the cortical LFP is thought to mainly reflect synaptic inputs onto pyramidal neurons, little is known about the role of subthreshold active conductances in shaping the LFP. By means of biophysical modeling we obtain a comprehensive, qualitative understanding of how LFPs generated by populations of cortical pyramidal neurons depend on active subthreshold currents, and identify the key importance of the h-type channel. Our results show that LFPs can give information about the active properties of neurons and that preferred frequencies in the LFP can result from those cellular properties instead of, for example, network dynamics.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/26/5996?rss=1">Laminin {beta}2 Chain Regulates Retinal Progenitor Cell Mitotic Spindle Orientation via Dystroglycan</a></h4>

<p>Vertebrate retinal development follows a pattern during which retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) give rise to all retinal cell types in a highly conserved temporal sequence. RPC proliferation and cell cycle exit are tightly coordinated to ensure proper and timely production of each of the retinal cell types. Extracellular matrix (ECM) plays an important role in eye development, influencing RPC proliferation and differentiation. In this study, we demonstrate that laminins, key ECM components, in the inner limiting membrane, control mitotic spindle orientation by providing environmental cues to the RPCs. <i>In vivo</i> deletion of laminin β2 in mice of both sexes results in a loss RPC basal processes and contact with the ECM, leading to a shift of the mitotic spindle pole orientation toward asymmetric cell divisions. This leads to decreased proliferation and premature RPC pool depletion, resulting in overproduction of rod photoreceptors at the expense of bipolar cells and Müller glia. Moreover, we show that deletion of laminin β2 leads to disruption and mislocalization of its receptors: dystroglycan and β1-integrin. Addition of exogenous β2-containing laminins to laminin β2-deficient retinal explants stabilizes the RPC basal processes and directs their mitotic spindle orientation toward symmetric divisions, leading to increased RPC proliferation, as well as restores proper receptor localization at the retinal surface. Finally, functional blocking of dystroglycan in wild-type retinal explants phenocopies laminin β2 ablation. Our data suggest that dystroglycan-mediated signaling between RPCs and the ECM is of key importance in controlling critical developmental events during retinogenesis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The mechanisms governing retinogenesis are subject to both intrinsic and extrinsic signaling cues. Although the role of intrinsic signaling has been the subject of many studies, our understanding of the role of the microenvironment in retinal development remains unclear. Using a combination of <i>in vivo</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> approaches, we demonstrate that laminins, key extracellular matrix components, provide signaling cues that control retinal progenitor cell attachment to the basement membrane, mitotic axis, proliferation, and fate adoption. Moreover, we identify, for the first time, dystroglycan as the receptor responsible for directing retinal progenitor cell mitotic spindle orientation. Our data suggest a mechanism where dystroglycan-mediated signaling between the cell and the extracellular matrix controls the proliferative potential of progenitors in the developing CNS.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/26/5982?rss=1">Local BDNF Delivery to the Injured Cervical Spinal Cord using an Engineered Hydrogel Enhances Diaphragmatic Respiratory Function</a></h4>

<p>We developed an innovative biomaterial-based approach to repair the critical neural circuitry that controls diaphragm activation by locally delivering brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to injured cervical spinal cord. BDNF can be used to restore respiratory function via a number of potential repair mechanisms; however, widespread BDNF biodistribution resulting from delivery methods such as systemic injection or lumbar puncture can lead to inefficient drug delivery and adverse side effects. As a viable alternative, we developed a novel hydrogel-based system loaded with polysaccharide-BDNF particles self-assembled by electrostatic interactions that can be safely implanted in the intrathecal space for achieving local BDNF delivery with controlled dosing and duration. Implantation of BDNF hydrogel after C4/C5 contusion-type spinal cord injury (SCI) in female rats robustly preserved diaphragm function, as assessed by <i>in vivo</i> recordings of compound muscle action potential and electromyography amplitudes. However, BDNF hydrogel did not decrease lesion size or degeneration of cervical motor neuron soma, suggesting that its therapeutic mechanism of action was not neuroprotection within spinal cord. Interestingly, BDNF hydrogel significantly preserved diaphragm innervation by phrenic motor neurons (PhMNs), as assessed by detailed neuromuscular junction morphological analysis and retrograde PhMN labeling from diaphragm using cholera toxin B. Furthermore, BDNF hydrogel enhanced the serotonergic axon innervation of PhMNs that plays an important role in modulating PhMN excitability. Our findings demonstrate that local BDNF hydrogel delivery is a robustly effective and safe strategy to restore diaphragm function after SCI. In addition, we demonstrate novel therapeutic mechanisms by which BDNF can repair respiratory neural circuitry.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Respiratory compromise is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality following traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). We used an innovative biomaterial-based drug delivery system in the form of a hydrogel that can be safely injected into the intrathecal space for achieving local delivery of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) with controlled dosing and duration, while avoiding side effects associated with other delivery methods. In a clinically relevant rat model of cervical contusion-type SCI, BDNF hydrogel robustly and persistently improved diaphragmatic respiratory function by enhancing phrenic motor neuron (PhMN) innervation of the diaphragm neuromuscular junction and by increasing serotonergic innervation of PhMNs in ventral horn of the cervical spinal cord. These exciting findings demonstrate that local BDNF hydrogel delivery is a safe and robustly effective strategy to maintain respiratory function after cervical SCI.</p>

<p>Natural environments convey information through multiple sensory modalities, all of which contribute to people's percepts. Although it has been shown that visual or auditory content of scene categories can be decoded from brain activity, it remains unclear how humans represent scene information beyond a specific sensory modality domain. To address this question, we investigated how categories of scene images and sounds are represented in several brain regions. A group of healthy human subjects (both sexes) participated in the present study, where their brain activity was measured with fMRI while viewing images or listening to sounds of different real-world environments. We found that both visual and auditory scene categories can be decoded not only from modality-specific areas, but also from several brain regions in the temporal, parietal, and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Intriguingly, only in the PFC, but not in any other regions, categories of scene images and sounds appear to be represented in similar activation patterns, suggesting that scene representations in PFC are modality-independent. Furthermore, the error patterns of neural decoders indicate that category-specific neural activity patterns in the middle and superior frontal gyri are tightly linked to categorization behavior. Our findings demonstrate that complex scene information is represented at an abstract level in the PFC, regardless of the sensory modality of the stimulus.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our experience in daily life includes multiple sensory inputs, such as images, sounds, or scents from the surroundings, which all contribute to our understanding of the environment. Here, for the first time, we investigated where and how in the brain information about the natural environment from multiple senses is merged to form modality-independent representations of scene categories. We show direct decoding of scene categories across sensory modalities from patterns of neural activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). We also conclusively tie these neural representations to human categorization behavior by comparing patterns of errors between a neural decoder and behavior. Our findings suggest that PFC is a central hub for integrating sensory information and computing modality-independent representations of scene categories.</p>

<p>Vacuolar sorting protein 35 (VPS35) is a critical component of retromer, which is essential for selective endosome-to-Golgi retrieval of membrane proteins. VPS35 deficiency is implicated in neurodegenerative disease pathology, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, exactly how VPS35 loss promotes AD pathogenesis remains largely unclear. VPS35 is expressed in various types of cells in the brain, including neurons and microglia. Whereas neuronal VPS35 plays a critical role in preventing neurodegeneration, the role of microglial VPS35 is largely unknown. Here we provide evidence for microglial VPS35's function in preventing microglial activation and promoting adult hippocampal neurogenesis. VPS35 is expressed in microglia in various regions of the mouse brain, with a unique distribution pattern in a brain region-dependent manner. Conditional knocking out of VPS35 in microglia of male mice results in regionally increased microglial density and activity in the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), accompanied by elevated neural progenitor proliferation, but decreased neuronal differentiation. Additionally, newborn neurons in the mutant DG show impaired dendritic morphology and reduced dendritic spine density. When examining the behavioral phenotypes of these animals, microglial VPS3S-depleted mice display depression-like behavior and impairment in long-term recognition memory. At the cellular level, VPS35-depleted microglia have grossly enlarged vacuolar structures with increased phagocytic activity toward postsynaptic marker PSD95, which may underlie the loss of dendritic spines observed in the mutant DG. Together, these findings identify an important role of microglial VPS35 in suppressing microglial activation and promoting hippocampal neurogenesis, which are both processes involved in AD pathogenesis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The findings presented here provide the first <i>in vivo</i> evidence that Vacuolar sorting protein 35 (VPS35)/retromer is essential for regulating microglial function and that when microglial retromer mechanics are disrupted, the surrounding brain tissue can be affected in a neurodegenerative manner. These findings present a novel, microglial-specific role of VPS35 and raise multiple questions regarding the mechanisms underlying our observations. These findings also have myriad implications for the field of retromer research and the role of retromer dysfunction in neurodegenerative pathophysiology. Furthermore, they implicate a pivotal role of microglia in the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and the survival/integration of newborn neurons in the adult hippocampus.</p>

<p>Microdeletion of the human 16p11.2 gene locus has been linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability and confers risk for a number of other neurodevelopmental deficits. Transgenic mice carrying 16p11.2 deletion (<i>16p11</i><sup>+/–</sup>) display phenotypes reminiscent of those in human patients with 16p11.2 deletion syndrome, but the molecular mechanisms and treatment strategies for these phenotypes remain unknown. In this study, we have found that both male and female <i>16p11</i><sup>+/–</sup> mice exhibit deficient NMDA receptor (NMDAR) function in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain region critical for high-level "executive" functions. Elevating the activity of mPFC pyramidal neurons with a CaMKII-driven Gq-DREADD (Gq-coupled designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) led to the significant increase of NR2B subunit phosphorylation and the restoration of NMDAR function, as well as the amelioration of cognitive and social impairments in <i>16p11</i><sup>+/–</sup> mice. These results suggest that NMDAR hypofunction in PFC may contribute to the pathophysiology of 16p11.2 deletion syndrome and that restoring PFC activity is sufficient to rescue the behavioral deficits.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The 16p11.2 deletion syndrome is strongly associated with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. Using a mouse model carrying the 16p11.2 deletion, <i>16p11</i><sup>+/–</sup>, we identified NMDA receptor hypofunction in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Elevating the activity of PFC pyramidal neurons with a chemogenetic tool, Gq-DREADD, led to the restoration of NMDA receptor function and the amelioration of cognitive and social impairments in <i>16p11</i><sup>+/–</sup> mice. These results have revealed a novel route for potential therapeutic intervention of 16p11.2 deletion syndrome.</p>

<p>Preparatory activity, characterized by gradual, longer timescale changes in neural activity, is present in a number of different brain areas before the onset of simple movements and is believed to be important for movement initiation. However, relatively little is known about such activity before initiation of naturally learned movement sequences. The song of an adult male zebra finch is a well studied example of a naturally learned movement sequence and previous studies have shown robust premotor activity immediately before song. Here, I characterize longer timescale changes in neural activity in adult male zebra finch premotor nucleus HVC before onset of song bouts. I show that interneurons and a subset of basal-ganglia-projecting neurons change their activity several hundred milliseconds before song bout onset. Interneurons increased their activity, whereas basal-ganglia-projecting neurons either increased or decreased their activity. Such changes in neural activity were larger, started earlier, and were more common specifically before song bouts that began with the short, repetitive, introductory notes (INs) characteristic of zebra finch song bouts. Further, stronger and earlier changes were also correlated with successful song sequence initiation. Finally, a small fraction of basal-ganglia-projecting neurons that increased their activity before song bout onset did not have song or IN-related activity, suggesting a specialized preparatory role for such neurons. Overall, these data suggest that pre-bout activity in HVC represents preparatory activity important for initiation of a naturally learned movement sequence.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Changes in neuronal activity well before the onset of simple movements are thought to be important for movement initiation. However, a number of animal movements consist of sequences of simple movements and relatively little is known about neuronal activity before such movement sequences. Using adult zebra finch song, a well studied example of a movement sequence, I show here that neurons in premotor nucleus HVC change their activity hundreds of milliseconds before song bout onset. In most neurons, the presence of such changes correlated with successful song sequence initiation. My results show the presence of preparatory neural activity in HVC and suggest a role for HVC in sequence initiation in addition to its established role in song sequence timing.</p>

<p>A growing number of studies implicate the brain's reward circuitry in aggressive behavior. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms within brain reward regions that modulate the intensity of aggression as well as motivation for it have been underexplored. Here, we investigate the cell-type-specific influence of FosB, a transcription factor known to regulate a range of reward and motivated behaviors, acting in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key reward region, in male aggression in mice. We show that FosB is specifically increased in dopamine D1 receptor (Drd1)-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) in NAc after repeated aggressive encounters. Viral-mediated induction of FosB selectively in D1-MSNs of NAc intensifies aggressive behavior without affecting the preference for the aggression-paired context in a conditioned place preference (CPP) assay. In contrast, FosB induction selectively in D2-MSNs reduces the time spent exploring the aggression-paired context during CPP without affecting the intensity of aggression per se. These data strongly support a dissociable cell-type-specific role for FosB in the NAc in modulating aggression and aggression reward.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Aggressive behavior is associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders and can be disruptive for affected individuals as well as their victims. Studies have shown a positive reinforcement mechanism underlying aggressive behavior that shares many common features with drug addiction. Here, we explore the cell-type-specific role of the addiction-associated transcription factor FosB in the nucleus accumbens in aggression. We found that FosB expression promotes aggressive behavior, effects that are dissociable from its effects on aggression reward. This finding is a significant first step in identifying therapeutic targets for the reduction of aggressive behavior across a range of neuropsychiatric illnesses.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/26/5900?rss=1">Blocking Autophagy in Oligodendrocytes Limits Functional Recovery after Spinal Cord Injury</a></h4>

<p>Autophagy mechanisms are well documented in neurons after spinal cord injury (SCI), but the direct functional role of autophagy in oligodendrocyte (OL) survival in SCI pathogenesis remains unknown. Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved lysosomal-mediated catabolic pathway that ensures degradation of dysfunctional cellular components to maintain homeostasis in response to various forms of stress, including nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Using pharmacological gain and loss of function and genetic approaches, we investigated the contribution of autophagy in OL survival and its role in the pathogenesis of thoracic contusive SCI in female mice. Although upregulation of <i>Atg5</i> (an essential autophagy gene) occurs after SCI, autophagy flux is impaired. Purified myelin fractions of contused 8 d post-SCI samples show enriched protein levels of LC3B, ATG5, and BECLIN 1. Data show that, while the nonspecific drugs rapamycin (activates autophagy) and spautin 1 (blocks autophagy) were pharmacologically active on autophagy <i>in vivo</i>, their administration did not alter locomotor recovery after SCI. To directly analyze the role of autophagy, transgenic mice with conditional deletion of <i>Atg5</i> in OLs were generated. Analysis of hindlimb locomotion demonstrated a significant reduction in locomotor recovery after SCI that correlated with a greater loss in spared white matter. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that deletion of <i>Atg5</i> from OLs resulted in decreased autophagic flux and was detrimental to OL function after SCI. Thus, our study provides evidence that autophagy is an essential cytoprotective pathway operating in OLs and is required for hindlimb locomotor recovery after thoracic SCI.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study describes the role of autophagy in oligodendrocyte (OL) survival and pathogenesis after thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI). Modulation of autophagy with available nonselective drugs after thoracic SCI does not affect locomotor recovery despite being pharmacologically active <i>in vivo</i>, indicating significant off-target effects. Using transgenic mice with conditional deletion of <i>Atg5</i> in OLs, this study definitively identifies autophagy as an essential homeostatic pathway that operates in OLs and exhibits a direct functional role in SCI pathogenesis and recovery. Therefore, this study emphasizes the need to discover novel autophagy-specific drugs that specifically modulate autophagy for further investigation for clinical translation to treat SCI and other CNS pathologies related to OL survival.</p>

<p>Recent studies suggest that spontaneous and action potential-evoked neurotransmitter release processes are independently regulated. However, the mechanisms that uncouple the two forms of neurotransmission remain unclear. In cultured mouse and rat neurons, we show that the two C2 domain-containing protein copine-6 is localized to presynaptic terminals and binds to synaptobrevin2 as well as other SNARE proteins in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent interaction of copine-6 with synaptobrevin2 selectively suppresses spontaneous neurotransmission in a reaction that requires the tandem tryptophan residues at the C-terminal region of synaptobrevin2. Accordingly, copine-6 loss of function augmented presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation-mediated neurotransmitter release. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelation, on the other hand, occluded copine-6-mediated suppression of release. We also evaluated the molecular specificity of the copine-6-dependent regulation of spontaneous release and found that overexpression of copine-6 did not suppress spontaneous release in synaptobrevin2-deficient neurons. Together, these results suggest that copine-6 acts as a specific Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent suppressor of spontaneous neurotransmission.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Synaptic transmission occurs both in response to presynaptic action potentials and spontaneously, in the absence of stimulation. Currently, much more is understood about the mechanisms underlying action potential-evoked neurotransmission compared with spontaneous release. However, recent studies have shown selective modulation of spontaneous neurotransmission process by several neuromodulators, suggesting specific molecular regulation of spontaneous release. In this study, we identify copine-6 as a specific regulator of spontaneous neurotransmission. By both gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments, we show that copine-6 functions as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent suppressor of spontaneous release. These results further elucidate the mechanisms underlying differential regulation of evoked and spontaneous neurotransmitter release.</p>

<p>SALM1 (SALM (synaptic adhesion-like molecule), also known as LRFN2 (leucine rich repeat and fibronectin type III domain containing), is a postsynaptic density (PSD)-95-interacting synaptic adhesion molecule implicated in the regulation of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) clustering largely based on <i>in vitro</i> data, although its <i>in vivo</i> functions remain unclear. Here, we found that mice lacking SALM1/LRFN2 (<i>Lrfn2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice) show a normal density of excitatory synapses but altered excitatory synaptic function, including enhanced NMDAR-dependent synaptic transmission but suppressed NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal CA1 region. Unexpectedly, SALM1 expression was detected in both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons and <i>Lrfn2</i><sup>–/–</sup> CA1 pyramidal neurons showed decreases in the density of inhibitory synapses and the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory synaptic transmission. Behaviorally, ultrasonic vocalization was suppressed in <i>Lrfn2</i><sup>–/–</sup> pups separated from their mothers and acoustic startle was enhanced, but locomotion, anxiety-like behavior, social interaction, repetitive behaviors, and learning and memory were largely normal in adult male <i>Lrfn2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice. These results suggest that SALM1/LRFN2 regulates excitatory synapse function, inhibitory synapse development, and social communication and startle behaviors in mice.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Synaptic adhesion molecules regulate synapse development and function, which govern neural circuit and brain functions. The SALM/LRFN (synaptic adhesion-like molecule/leucine rich repeat and fibronectin type III domain containing) family of synaptic adhesion proteins consists of five known members for which the <i>in vivo</i> functions are largely unknown. Here, we characterized mice lacking SALM1/LRFN2 (SALM1 KO) known to associate with NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and found that these mice showed altered NMDAR-dependent synaptic transmission and plasticity, as expected, but unexpectedly also exhibited suppressed inhibitory synapse development and synaptic transmission. Behaviorally, SALM1 KO pups showed suppressed ultrasonic vocalization upon separation from their mothers and SALM1 KO adults showed enhanced responses to loud acoustic stimuli. These results suggest that SALM1/LRFN2 regulates excitatory synapse function, inhibitory synapse development, social communication, and acoustic startle behavior.</p>

<p>NADPH oxidase (Nox)-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been linked to neuronal polarity, axonal outgrowth, cerebellar development, regeneration of sensory axons, and neuroplasticity. However, the specific roles that individual Nox isoforms play during nervous system development <i>in vivo</i> remain unclear. To address this problem, we investigated the role of Nox activity in the development of retinotectal connections in zebrafish embryos. Zebrafish broadly express four <i>nox</i> genes (<i>nox1</i>, <i>nox2/cybb</i>, <i>nox5</i>, and <i>duox</i>) throughout the CNS during early development. Application of a pan-Nox inhibitor, celastrol, during the time of optic nerve (ON) outgrowth resulted in significant expansion of the ganglion cell layer (GCL), thinning of the ON, and a decrease in retinal axons reaching the optic tectum (OT). With the exception of GCL expansion, these effects were partially ameliorated by the addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, a key ROS involved in Nox signaling. To address isoform-specific Nox functions, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate mutations in each zebrafish <i>nox</i> gene. We found that <i>nox2/cybb</i> chimeric mutants displayed ON thinning and decreased OT innervation. Furthermore, <i>nox2/cybb</i> homozygous mutants (<i>nox2/cybb</i><sup>–/–</sup>) showed significant GCL expansion and mistargeted retinal axons in the OT. Neurite outgrowth from cultured zebrafish retinal ganglion cells was reduced by Nox inhibitors, suggesting a cell-autonomous role for Nox in these neurons. Collectively, our results show that Nox2/Cybb is important for retinotectal development in zebrafish.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Most isoforms of NADPH oxidase (Nox) only produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) when activated by an upstream signal, making them ideal candidates for ROS signaling. Nox enzymes are present in neurons and their activity has been shown to be important for neuronal development and function largely by <i>in vitro</i> studies. However, whether Nox is involved in the development of axons and formation of neuronal connections <i>in vivo</i> has remained unclear. Using mutant zebrafish embryos, this study shows that a specific Nox isoform, Nox2/Cybb, is important for the establishment of axonal connections between retinal ganglion cells and the optic tectum.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/26/5843?rss=1">Preferential Targeting of Lateral Entorhinal Inputs onto Newly Integrated Granule Cells</a></h4>

<p>Mature dentate granule cells in the hippocampus receive input from the entorhinal cortex via the perforant path in precisely arranged lamina, with medial entorhinal axons innervating the middle molecular layer and lateral entorhinal cortex axons innervating the outer molecular layer. Although vastly outnumbered by mature granule cells, adult-generated newborn granule cells play a unique role in hippocampal function, which has largely been attributed to their enhanced excitability and plasticity (Schmidt-Hieber et al., 2004; Ge et al., 2007). Inputs from the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex carry different informational content. Thus, the distribution of inputs onto newly integrated granule cells will affect their function in the circuit. Using retroviral labeling in combination with selective optogenetic activation of medial or lateral entorhinal inputs, we examined the functional innervation and synaptic maturation of newly generated dentate granule cells in the mouse hippocampus. Our results indicate that lateral entorhinal inputs provide the majority of functional innervation of newly integrated granule cells at 21 d postmitosis. Despite preferential functional targeting, the dendritic spine density of immature granule cells was similar in the outer and middle molecular layers, which we speculate could reflect an unequal distribution of shaft synapses. However, chronic blockade of neurotransmitter release of medial entorhinal axons with tetanus toxin disrupted normal synapse development of both medial and lateral entorhinal inputs. Our results support a role for preferential lateral perforant path input onto newly generated neurons in mediating pattern separation, but also indicate that medial perforant path input is necessary for normal synaptic development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The formation of episodic memories involves the integration of contextual and spatial information. Newly integrated neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus play a critical role in this process, despite constituting only a minor fraction of the total number of granule cells. Here we demonstrate that these neurons preferentially receive information thought to convey the context of an experience. Each newly integrated granule cell plays this unique role for ~1 month before reaching maturity.</p>

Abstract<p>Optogenetic inhibition of specific neuronal types in the brain enables analysis of neural circuitry and is promising for the treatment of a number of neurological disorders. Anion channelrhodopsins from the cryptophyte alga <i>Guillardia theta</i> generate larger photocurrents than other available inhibitory optogenetic tools, but more rapid channels are needed for temporally precise inhibition, such as single-spike suppression, of high-frequency firing neurons. Faster anion channelrhodopsins have been reported, but their potential advantages for time-resolved inhibitory optogenetics have not so far been verified in neurons. We report RapACR, nicknamed so for "rapid", an anion channelrhodopsin from <i>Rhodomonas salina</i>, that exhibits channel half-closing times below 10 ms and achieves equivalent inhibition at 50-fold lower light intensity in lentivirally transduced cultured mouse hippocampal neurons as the second-generation engineered Cl<sup>-</sup>-conducting channelrhodopsin iC++. The upper limit of the time resolution of neuronal silencing with RapACR determined by measuring the dependence of spiking recovery after photoinhibition on the light intensity was calculated to be 100 Hz, whereas that with the faster of the two <i>Guillardia theta</i> anion channelrhodopsins was 13 Hz. Further acceleration of RapACR channel kinetics was achieved by site-directed mutagenesis of a single residue in transmembrane helix 3 (Thr111 to Cys). We also show that mutation of another ACR (Cys to Ala at the same position) with a greatly extended lifetime of the channel open state acts as a bistable photochromic tool in mammalian neurons. These molecules extend the time domain of optogenetic neuronal silencing while retaining the high light sensitivity of <i>Guillardia</i> ACRs.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> We report both fast and slow variants of cryptophyte anion channelrhodopsins that enable efficient neuronal silencing with light in the expanded time window of 10 ms to tens of seconds. These tools can be used at low expression levels to avoid possible detrimental effects on the physiology of recipient cells and help to minimize light intensities to prevent overheating of the tissue in optogenetic experiments. Their potential applications include analysis of neuronal circuitry, the slow closing channel variant enabling measurements requiring an open channel in the dark amenable to optical imaging, and the development of optogenetic treatments for neurologic diseases involving neuron hyperexcitability.</p>

<p>Grid cells in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC LII) generate multiple regular firing fields in response to the position and speed of an individual within the environment. They exhibit a protracted postnatal development and, in the adult, show activity differences along the dorsoventral axis (DVA). Evidence suggests parvalbumin-positive (PV<sup>+</sup>) interneurons, most of which are perisomatic-targeting cells, play a crucial role in generation of the hexagonal grid cell activity pattern. We therefore hypothesized that the development and organization of PV<sup>+</sup> perisomatic terminals in MEC LII reflect the postnatal emergence of the hexagonal firing pattern and dorsoventral differences seen in grid cell activity. We used immuno-electron microscopy to examine the development of PV<sup>+</sup> perisomatic terminals and their target somata within dorsal and ventral MEC LII in rats of postnatal day (P)10, P15, and P30. We demonstrate that in dorsal and ventral MEC LII, the cross-sectional area of somata and number and density of perisomatic PV<sup>+</sup> terminals increase between P10 and P15. A simultaneous decrease was observed in cross-sectional area of PV<sup>+</sup> terminals. Between P15 and P30, both MEC regions showed an increase in PV<sup>+</sup> terminal size and percentage of PV<sup>+</sup> terminals containing mitochondria, which may enable grid cell activity to emerge and stabilize. We also report that dorsal somata are larger and apposed by more PV<sup>+</sup> terminals than ventral somata at all stages, suggesting a protracted maturation in the ventral portion and a possible gradient in soma size and PV<sup>+</sup> basket innervation along the DVA in the adult.</p>

<p>Neuronal assemblies, loosely defined as subsets of neurons with reoccurring
spatio-temporally coordinated activation patterns, or "motifs", are thought to
be building blocks of neural representations and information processing. We
here propose LeMoNADe, a new exploratory data analysis method that facilitates
hunting for motifs in calcium imaging videos, the dominant microscopic
functional imaging modality in neurophysiology. Our nonparametric method
extracts motifs directly from videos, bypassing the difficult intermediate step
of spike extraction. Our technique augments variational autoencoders with a
discrete stochastic node, and we show in detail how a differentiable
reparametrization and relaxation can be used. An evaluation on simulated data,
with available ground truth, reveals excellent quantitative performance. In
real video data acquired from brain slices, with no ground truth available,
LeMoNADe uncovers nontrivial candidate motifs that can help generate hypotheses
for more focused biological investigation.

How is odor information organized in the brain? In this issue of Neuron, Jeanne et al. (2018) pair optogenetics with electrophysiology to map functional connections between two olfactory brain regions. They suggest that lateral horn neurons encode “odor scenes” to represent biologically relevant odor environments.

Ultrafast endocytosis is a distinct form of synaptic vesicle recovery occurring within milliseconds of vesicle fusion. Using flash-and-freeze electron microscopy, Watanabe et al. demonstrate dual roles for synaptojanin and endophilin in membrane remodeling and clathrin uncoating on rapid timescales during ultrafast endocytosis.

Does our understanding of the human brain remain incomplete without a proper understanding of how the brain processes music? Here, the author makes a passionate plea for the use of music in the investigation of human emotion and its brain correlates, arguing that music can change activity in all brain structures associated with emotions, which has important implications on how we understand human emotions and their disorders and how we can make better use of beneficial effects of music in therapy.

<p>by Fahad Alhasoun, Faisal Aleissa, May Alhazzani, Luis G. Moyano, Claudio Pinhanez, Marta C. González</p>

This paper presents a data analysis framework to uncover relationships between health conditions, age and sex for a large population of patients. We study a massive heterogeneous sample of 1.7 million patients in Brazil, containing 47 million of health records with detailed medical conditions for visits to medical facilities for a period of 17 months. The findings suggest that medical conditions can be grouped into clusters that share very distinctive densities in the ages of the patients. For each cluster, we further present the ICD-10 chapters within it. Finally, we relate the findings to comorbidity networks, uncovering the relation of the discovered clusters of age densities to comorbidity networks literature.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5diqBMl6Y-k" width="1" />

<p>In Rapela (2016) we reported traveling waves (TWs) on electrocorticographic
(ECoG) recordings from an epileptic subject over speech processing brain
regions, while the subject rhythmically produced consonant-vowel syllables
(CVSs). In Rapela (2017) we showed that TWs are precisely synchronized, in
dynamical systems terms, to these productions. Here we show that TWs do not
occur continuously, but tend to appear before the initiation of CVSs and tend
to disappear before their termination. During moments of silence, between
productions of CVSs, TWs tend to reverse direction. To our knowledge, this is
the first study showing TWs related to the production of speech and, more
generally, the first report of behavioral correlates of mesoscale TWs in
behaving humans.

<p>When it comes to the classification of brain signals in real-life
applications, the training and the prediction data are often described by
different distributions. Furthermore, diverse data sets, e.g., recorded from
various subjects or tasks, can even exhibit distinct feature spaces. The fact
that data that have to be classified are often only available in small amounts
reinforces the need for techniques to generalize learned information, as
performances of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are enhanced by increasing
quantity of disposable data. In this paper, we apply transfer learning to a
framework based on deep convolutional neural networks (deep ConvNets) to prove
the transferability of learned patterns in error-related brain signals across
different tasks. The experiments described in this paper demonstrate the
usefulness of transfer learning, especially improving performances when only
little data can be used to distinguish between erroneous and correct
realization of a task. This effect could be delimited from a transfer of merely
general brain signal characteristics, underlining the transfer of
error-specific information. Furthermore, we could extract similar patterns in
time-frequency analyses in identical channels, leading to selective high signal
correlations between the two different paradigms. Decoding on the intracranial
data without pre-transfer reaches median accuracies of $(76.94 \pm 2.17)\,\%$
and $(81.50 \pm 9.49)\,\%$, respectively.

<p>Integrated Information Theory (IIT) is a prominent theory of consciousness
that has at its centre measures that quantify the extent to which a system
generates more information than the sum of its parts. While several candidate
measures of integrated information (`$\Phi$') now exist, little is known about
how they compare, especially in terms of their behaviour on non-trivial network
models. In this article we provide clear and intuitive descriptions of six
distinct candidate measures. We then explore the properties of each of these
measures in simulation on networks consisting of eight interacting nodes,
animated with Gaussian linear autoregressive dynamics. We find a striking
diversity in the behaviour of these measures -- no two measures show consistent
agreement across all analyses. Further, only a subset of the measures appear to
genuinely reflect some form of dynamical complexity, in the sense of
simultaneous segregation and integration between system components. Our results
help guide the operationalisation of IIT and advance the development of
measures of integrated information that may have more general applicability.

<p>Brain can recognize different objects as ones that it has experienced before.
The recognition accuracy and it's processing time depends on task properties
such as viewing condition, level of noise and etc. Recognition accuracy can be
well explained by different models. However, less attention has been paid to
the processing time and the ones that do, are not biologically plausible. By
extracting features temporally as well as utilizing an accumulation to bound
decision making model, an object recognition model accounting for both
recognition time and accuracy is proposed. To temporally extract informative
features in support of possible classes of stimuli, a hierarchical spiking
neural network, called spiking HMAX is modified. In the decision making part of
the model the extracted information accumulates over time using accumulator
units. The input category is determined as soon as any of the accumulators
reaches a threshold, called decision bound. Results show that not only does the
model follow human accuracy in a psychophysics task better than the classic
spiking HMAX model, but also it predicts human response time in each choice.
Results also provide enough evidence that temporal representation of features
are informative since they can improve the accuracy over time which is in line
with the well-known idea of speed accuracy trade-off in decision making
studies.

<p>by Jennifer Lu, Steven L. Salzberg</p>

Metagenomic sequencing of patient samples is a very promising method for the diagnosis of human infections. Sequencing has the ability to capture all the DNA or RNA from pathogenic organisms in a human sample. However, complete and accurate characterization of the sequence, including identification of any pathogens, depends on the availability and quality of genomes for comparison. Thousands of genomes are now available, and as these numbers grow, the power of metagenomic sequencing for diagnosis should increase. However, recent studies have exposed the presence of contamination in published genomes, which when used for diagnosis increases the risk of falsely identifying the wrong pathogen. To address this problem, we have developed a bioinformatics system for eliminating contamination as well as low-complexity genomic sequences in the draft genomes of eukaryotic pathogens. We applied this software to identify and remove human, bacterial, archaeal, and viral sequences present in a comprehensive database of all sequenced eukaryotic pathogen genomes. We also removed low-complexity genomic sequences, another source of false positives. Using this pipeline, we have produced a database of “clean” eukaryotic pathogen genomes for use with bioinformatics classification and analysis tools. We demonstrate that when attempting to find eukaryotic pathogens in metagenomic samples, the new database provides better sensitivity than one using the original genomes while offering a dramatic reduction in false positives.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a0K1XU9oCec" width="1" />

<p>by Luke Zappia, Belinda Phipson, Alicia Oshlack</p>

As single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets have become more widespread the number of tools designed to analyse these data has dramatically increased. Navigating the vast sea of tools now available is becoming increasingly challenging for researchers. In order to better facilitate selection of appropriate analysis tools we have created the scRNA-tools database (www.scRNA-tools.org) to catalogue and curate analysis tools as they become available. Our database collects a range of information on each scRNA-seq analysis tool and categorises them according to the analysis tasks they perform. Exploration of this database gives insights into the areas of rapid development of analysis methods for scRNA-seq data. We see that many tools perform tasks specific to scRNA-seq analysis, particularly clustering and ordering of cells. We also find that the scRNA-seq community embraces an open-source and open-science approach, with most tools available under open-source licenses and preprints being extensively used as a means to describe methods. The scRNA-tools database provides a valuable resource for researchers embarking on scRNA-seq analysis and records the growth of the field over time.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k_dQmqkjXl0" width="1" />

<p>by Jonathan U. Harrison, Ruth E. Baker</p>

Imaging data has become an essential tool to explore key biological questions at various scales, for example the motile behaviour of bacteria or the transport of mRNA, and it has the potential to transform our understanding of important transport mechanisms. Often these imaging studies require us to compare biological species or mutants, and to do this we need to quantitatively characterise their behaviour. Mathematical models offer a quantitative description of a system that enables us to perform this comparison, but to relate mechanistic mathematical models to imaging data, we need to estimate their parameters. In this work we study how collecting data at different temporal resolutions impacts our ability to infer parameters of biological transport models; performing exact inference for simple velocity jump process models in a Bayesian framework. The question of how best to choose the frequency with which data is collected is prominent in a host of studies because the majority of imaging technologies place constraints on the frequency with which images can be taken, and the discrete nature of observations can introduce errors into parameter estimates. In this work, we mitigate such errors by formulating the velocity jump process model within a hidden states framework. This allows us to obtain estimates of the reorientation rate and noise amplitude for noisy observations of a simple velocity jump process. We demonstrate the sensitivity of these estimates to temporal variations in the sampling resolution and extent of measurement noise. We use our methodology to provide experimental guidelines for researchers aiming to characterise motile behaviour that can be described by a velocity jump process. In particular, we consider how experimental constraints resulting in a trade-off between temporal sampling resolution and observation noise may affect parameter estimates. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our methodology to model misspecification, and then apply our inference framework to a dataset that was generated with the aim of understanding the localization of RNA-protein complexes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bJ09RqwTbkw" width="1" />

<p>The human thalamus is a brain structure that comprises numerous, highly
specific nuclei. Since these nuclei are known to have different functions and
to be connected to different areas of the cerebral cortex, it is of great
interest for the neuroimaging community to study their volume, shape and
connectivity in vivo with MRI. In this study, we present a probabilistic atlas
of the thalamic nuclei built using ex vivo brain MRI scans and histological
data, as well as the application of the atlas to in vivo MRI segmentation. The
atlas was built using manual delineation of 26 thalamic nuclei on the serial
histology of 12 whole thalami from six autopsy samples, combined with manual
segmentations of the whole thalamus and surrounding structures (caudate,
putamen, hippocampus, etc.) made on in vivo brain MR data from 39 subjects. The
3D structure of the histological data and corresponding manual segmentations
was recovered using the ex vivo MRI as reference frame, and stacks of blockface
photographs acquired during the sectioning as intermediate target. The atlas,
which was encoded as an adaptive tetrahedral mesh, shows a good agreement with
with previous histological studies of the thalamus in terms of volumes of
representative nuclei. When applied to segmentation of in vivo scans using
Bayesian inference, the atlas shows excellent test-retest reliability,
robustness to changes in input MRI contrast, and ability to detect differential
thalamic effects in subjects with Alzheimer's disease. The probabilistic atlas
and companion segmentation tool are publicly available as part of the
neuroimaging package FreeSurfer.

Neuronal proteostasis is maintained by the dynamic integration of different processes that regulate the synthesis, folding, quality control, and localization of proteins. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) serves as a fundamental pillar of the proteostasis network, and is emerging as a key compartment to sustain normal brain function. The unfolded protein response (UPR), the main mechanism that copes with ER stress, plays a central role in the quality control of many ion channels and receptors, in addition to crosstalk with signaling pathways that regulate connectivity, synapse formation, and neuronal plasticity.

<p>by Alex D. Bird, Magnus J. E. Richardson</p>

Short-term synaptic depression, caused by depletion of releasable neurotransmitter, modulates the strength of neuronal connections in a history-dependent manner. Quantifying the statistics of synaptic transmission requires stochastic models that link probabilistic neurotransmitter release with presynaptic spike-train statistics. Common approaches are to model the presynaptic spike train as either regular or a memory-less Poisson process: few analytical results are available that describe depressing synapses when the afferent spike train has more complex, temporally correlated statistics such as bursts. Here we present a series of analytical results—from vesicle release-site occupancy statistics, via neurotransmitter release, to the post-synaptic voltage mean and variance—for depressing synapses driven by correlated presynaptic spike trains. The class of presynaptic drive considered is that fully characterised by the inter-spike-interval distribution and encompasses a broad range of models used for neuronal circuit and network analyses, such as integrate-and-fire models with a complete post-spike reset and receiving sufficiently short-time correlated drive. We further demonstrate that the derived post-synaptic voltage mean and variance allow for a simple and accurate approximation of the firing rate of the post-synaptic neuron, using the exponential integrate-and-fire model as an example. These results extend the level of biological detail included in models of synaptic transmission and will allow for the incorporation of more complex and physiologically relevant firing patterns into future studies of neuronal networks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ErLjrQIgZpU" width="1" />

Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a forefront actor in the transport of lipids and the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis, and is also strongly implicated in Alzheimer’s disease. Upon lipid-binding apoE adopts a conformational state that mediates the receptor-induced internalization of lipoproteins. Due to its inherent structural dynamics and the presence of lipids, the structure of the biologically active apoE remains so far poorly described. To address this issue, we developed an innovative hybrid method combining experimental data with molecular modeling and dynamics to generate comprehensive models of the lipidated apoE4 isoform. Chemical cross-linking combined with mass spectrometry provided distance restraints, characterizing the three-dimensional organization of apoE4 molecules at the surface of lipidic nanoparticles. The ensemble of spatial restraints was then rationalized in an original molecular modeling approach to generate monomeric models of apoE4 that advocated the existence of two alternative conformations. These two models point towards an activation mechanism of apoE4 relying on a regulation of the accessibility of its receptor binding region. Further, molecular dynamics simulations of the dimerized and lipidated apoE4 monomeric conformations revealed an elongation of the apoE N-terminal domain, whereby helix 4 is rearranged, together with Arg172, into a proper orientation essential for lipoprotein receptor association. Overall, our results show how apoE4 adapts its conformation for the recognition of the low density lipoprotein receptor and we propose a novel mechanism of activation for apoE4 that is based on accessibility and remodeling of the receptor binding region.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dL-J_TXfeus" width="1" />

<p>The principles of neural encoding and computations are inherently collective
and usually involve large populations of interacting neurons with highly
correlated activities. While theories of neural function have long recognized
the importance of collective effects in populations of neurons, only in the
past two decades has it become possible to record from many cells
simulatenously using advanced experimental techniques with single-spike
resolution, and to relate these correlations to function and behaviour. This
review focuses on the modeling and inference approaches that have been recently
developed to describe the correlated spiking activity of populations of
neurons. We cover a variety of models describing correlations between pairs of
neurons as well as between larger groups, synchronous or delayed in time, with
or without the explicit influence of the stimulus, and including or not latent
variables. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks or each method, as well as
the computational challenges related to their application to recordings of ever
larger populations.

<p>The artificial axon is a recently introduced synthetic assembly of supported
lipid bilayers and voltage gated ion channels, displaying the basic
electrophysiology of nerve cells. Here we demonstrate the use of two artificial
axons as control elements to achieve a simple task. Namely, we steer a remote
control car towards a light source, using the sensory input dependent firing
rate of the axons as the control signal for turning left or right. We present
the result in the form of the analysis of a movie of the car approaching the
light source. In general terms, with this work we pursue a constructivist
approach to exploring the nexus between machine language at the nerve cell
level and behavior.

<p>Cerebral fluid dynamics require a reverse energy mechanism to transport water
and metabolites from tissue into veins. Recent findings in active flow of
bacteria have shown that such a mechanism involving backward energy cascades,
so-called inverse cascades may exist only during spontaneously broken
mirror-symmetries. Here, we wanted to investigate whether and, if so when
symmetries break during a heart cycle. We used multiple spin echos (MSE)s in
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which can detect broken spherical symmetries.
We found MSEs in brain tissue which appeared during arterial pulsation in a
highly synchronized fashion in most parts of the brain. The timing suggests
that the reverse energy flow is initiated during the energy injection of the
heartbeat and ends with the isovolumetric vessel contraction. This interleaved
process may explain how the illusive pulse wave traveling through the brain
emerges as well as underlying principles of cerebral autoregulation and
neurovascular coupling.

<p>by Brendan A. Bicknell, Zac Pujic, Peter Dayan, Geoffrey J. Goodhill</p>

The development of a functional nervous system requires tight control of neurite growth and guidance by extracellular chemical cues. Neurite growth is astonishingly sensitive to shallow concentration gradients, but a widely observed feature of both growth and guidance regulation, with important consequences for development and regeneration, is that both are only elicited over the same relatively narrow range of concentrations. Here we show that all these phenomena can be explained within one theoretical framework. We first test long-standing explanations for the suppression of the trophic effects of nerve growth factor at high concentrations, and find they are contradicted by experiment. Instead we propose a new hypothesis involving inhibitory signalling among the cell bodies, and then extend this hypothesis to show how both growth and guidance can be understood in terms of a common underlying signalling mechanism. This new model for the first time unifies several key features of neurite growth regulation, quantitatively explains many aspects of experimental data, and makes new predictions about unknown details of developmental signalling.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_iAROQSe6Po" width="1" />

<p>by Sylvie Estrela, Sam P. Brown</p>

Polymicrobial interactions play an important role in shaping the outcome of antibiotic treatment, yet how multispecies communities respond to antibiotic assault is still little understood. Here we use an individual-based simulation model of microbial biofilms to investigate how competitive and mutualistic interactions between an antibiotic-resistant and a susceptible strain (or species) influence the two-lineage community response to antibiotic exposure. Our model predicts that while increasing competition and antibiotics leads to increasing competitive release of the antibiotic-resistant strain, hitting a mutualistic community of cross-feeding species with antibiotics leads to a mutualistic suppression effect where both susceptible and resistant species are harmed. We next show that the impact of antibiotics is further governed by emergent spatial feedbacks within communities. Mutualistic cross-feeding communities can rescue susceptible members by subsidizing their growth inside the biofilm despite lack of access to the nutrient-rich and high-antibiotic growing front. Moreover, we show that antibiotic detoxification by resistant cells can protect nearby susceptible cells, but such cross-protection is more effective in mutualistic communities because mutualism drives mixing of resistant and susceptible cells. In contrast, competition leads to segregation, which ultimately prevents susceptible cells to profit from detoxification. Understanding how the interplay between microbial metabolic interactions and community spatial structuring shapes the outcome of antibiotic treatment can be key to effectively leverage the power of antibiotics and promote microbiome health.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LJhLUT2wYlg" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/sNWGqeRtEb8/article">Solving the RNA design problem with reinforcement learning</a></h4>

<p>by Peter Eastman, Jade Shi, Bharath Ramsundar, Vijay S. Pande</p>

We use reinforcement learning to train an agent for computational RNA design: given a target secondary structure, design a sequence that folds to that structure <i>in silico</i>. Our agent uses a novel graph convolutional architecture allowing a single model to be applied to arbitrary target structures of any length. After training it on randomly generated targets, we test it on the Eterna100 benchmark and find it outperforms all previous algorithms. Analysis of its solutions shows it has successfully learned some advanced strategies identified by players of the game Eterna, allowing it to solve some very difficult structures. On the other hand, it has failed to learn other strategies, possibly because they were not required for the targets in the training set. This suggests the possibility that future improvements to the training protocol may yield further gains in performance.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sNWGqeRtEb8" width="1" />

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Attention can be attracted reflexively by sensory signals, biased by learning or reward, or focused voluntarily based on momentary goals. When voluntary attention is focused by purely internal decision processes (will), rather than instructions via external cues, we call this “willed attention.” In prior work, we reported ERP and fMRI correlates of willed spatial attention in trial-by-trial cuing tasks. Here we further investigated the oscillatory mechanisms of willed attention by contrasting the event-related EEG spectrogram between instructional and choice cues. Two experiments were conducted at 2 different sites using the same visuospatial attention paradigm. Consistent between the 2 experiments, we found increases in frontal theta power (starting at ~500 ms post cue) for willed attention relative to instructed attention. This frontal theta increase was accompanied by increased frontal–parietal theta-band coherence and bidirectional Granger causality. Additionally, the onset of attention-related posterior alpha power lateralization was delayed in willed attention relative to instructed attention, and the amount of delay was related to the timing of frontal theta increase. These results, replicated across 2 experiments, suggest that theta oscillations are the neuronal signals indexing decision-making in the frontal cortex, and mediating reciprocal communications between the frontal executive and parietal attentional control regions during willed attention.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Studies of synapses are available for different brain regions of several animal species including non-human primates, but comparatively little is known about their quantitative morphology in humans. Here, synaptic boutons in Layer 5 (L5) of the human temporal lobe (TL) neocortex were investigated in biopsy tissue, using fine-scale electron microscopy, and quantitative three-dimensional reconstructions. The size and organization of the presynaptic active zones (PreAZs), postsynaptic densities (PSDs), and that of the 3 distinct pools of synaptic vesicles (SVs) were particularly analyzed. L5 synaptic boutons were medium-sized (~6 μm<sup>2</sup>) with a single but relatively large PreAZ (~0.3 μm<sup>2</sup>). They contained a total of ~1500 SVs/bouton, ~20 constituting the putative readily releasable pool (RRP), ~180 the recycling pool (RP), and the remainder, the resting pool. The PreAZs, PSDs, and vesicle pools are ~3-fold larger than those of CNS synapses in other species. Astrocytic processes reached the synaptic cleft and may regulate the glutamate concentration. Profound differences exist between synapses in human TL neocortex and those described in various species, particularly in the size and geometry of PreAZs and PSDs, the large RRP/RP, and the astrocytic ensheathment suggesting high synaptic efficacy, strength, and modulation of synaptic transmission at human synapses.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Human brain anatomical and resting-state functional connectivity have been comprehensively portrayed using MRI, which are termed anatomical and functional connectomes. A systematic examination of tasks modulated whole brain functional connectivity, which we term as task connectome, is still lacking. We analyzed 6 block-designed and 1 event-related designed functional MRI data, and examined whole-brain task modulated connectivity in various task domains, including emotion, reward, language, relation, social cognition, working memory, and inhibition. By using psychophysiological interaction between pairs of regions from the whole brain, we identified statistically significant task modulated connectivity in 4 tasks between their experimental and respective control conditions. Task modulated connectivity was found not only between regions that were activated during the task but also regions that were not activated or deactivated, suggesting a broader involvement of brain regions in a task than indicated by simple regional activations. Decreased functional connectivity was observed in all the 4 tasks and sometimes reduced connectivity was even between regions that were both activated during the task. This suggests that brain regions that are activated together do not necessarily work together. The current study demonstrates the comprehensive task connectomes of 4 tasks, and suggested complex relationships between regional activations and connectivity changes.</span>

Attention can be “covertly” directed without eye movements; yet, even during fixation, there are microsaccades. We found that neural activity was enhanced by attention, but only following a microsaccade toward the stimulus, revealing a major link between covert attention and the oculomotor system.

<p>It is well established that brain structures and cognitive functions change across the life span. A long-standing hypothesis called "age differentiation" additionally posits that the relations between cognitive functions also change with age. To date, however, evidence for age-related differentiation is mixed, and no study has examined differentiation of the relationship between brain and cognition. Here we use multigroup structural equation models (SEMs) and SEM trees to study differences within and between brain and cognition across the adult life span (18–88 years) in a large (<i>N</i> &gt; 646, closely matched across sexes), population-derived sample of healthy human adults from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (<a href="http://www.cam-can.org">www.cam-can.org</a>). After factor analyses of gray matter volume (from T1- and T2-weighted MRI) and white matter organization (fractional anisotropy from diffusion-weighted MRI), we found evidence for the differentiation of gray and white matter, such that the covariance between brain factors decreased with age. However, we found no evidence for age differentiation among fluid intelligence, language, and memory, suggesting a relatively stable covariance pattern among cognitive factors. Finally, we observed a specific pattern of age differentiation between brain and cognitive factors, such that a white matter factor, which loaded most strongly on the hippocampal cingulum, became less correlated with memory performance in later life. These patterns are compatible with the reorganization of cognitive functions in the face of neural decline, and/or with the emergence of specific subpopulations in old age.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The theory of age differentiation posits age-related changes in the relationships among cognitive domains, either weakening (differentiation) or strengthening (dedifferentiation), but evidence for this hypothesis is mixed. Using age-varying covariance models in a large cross-sectional adult life span sample, we found age-related reductions in the covariance among both brain measures (neural differentiation), but no covariance change among cognitive factors of fluid intelligence, language, and memory. We also observed evidence of uncoupling (differentiation) between a white matter factor and cognitive factors in older age, most strongly for memory. Together, our findings support age-related differentiation as a complex, multifaceted pattern that differs for brain and cognition, and discuss several mechanisms that might explain the changing relationship between brain and cognition.</p>

<p>Cutaneous somatosensory neurons convey innocuous and noxious mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli from peripheral tissues to the CNS. Among these are nociceptive neurons that express calcitonin gene-related peptide-α (CGRPα). The role of peripheral CGRPα neurons (CANs) in acute and injury-induced pain has been studied using diphtheria toxin ablation, but their functional roles remain controversial. Because ablation permanently deletes a neuronal population, compensatory changes may ensue that mask the physiological or pathophysiological roles of CANs, particularly for injuries that occur after ablation. Therefore, we sought to define the role of intact CANs <i>in vivo</i> under baseline and injury conditions by using noninvasive transient optogenetic inhibition. We assessed pain behavior longitudinally from acute to chronic time points. We generated adult male and female mice that selectively express the outward rectifying proton pump archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch) in CANs, and inhibited their peripheral cutaneous terminals in models of neuropathic (spared nerve injury) and inflammatory (skin-muscle incision) pain using transdermal light activation of Arch. After nerve injury, brief activation of Arch reversed the chronic mechanical, cold, and heat hypersensitivity, alleviated the spontaneous pain, and reversed the sensitized mechanical currents in primary afferent somata. In contrast, Arch inhibition of CANs did not alter incision-induced hypersensitivity. Instead, incision-induced mechanical and heat hypersensitivity was alleviated by peripheral blockade of CGRPα peptide-receptor signaling. These results reveal that CANs have distinct roles in the time course of pain during neuropathic and incisional injuries and suggest that targeting peripheral CANs or CGRPα peptide-receptor signaling could selectively treat neuropathic or postoperative pain, respectively.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The contribution of sensory afferent CGRPα neurons (CANs) to neuropathic and inflammatory pain is controversial. Here, we left CANs intact during neuropathic and perioperative incision injury by using transient transdermal optogenetic inhibition of CANs. We found that peripheral CANs are required for neuropathic mechanical, cold, and heat hypersensitivity, spontaneous pain, and sensitization of mechanical currents in afferent somata. However, they are dispensable for incisional pain transmission. In contrast, peripheral pharmacological inhibition of CGRPα peptide-receptor signaling alleviated the incisional mechanical and heat hypersensitivity, but had no effect on neuropathic pain. These results show that CANs have distinct roles in neuropathic and incisional pain and suggest that their targeting via novel peripheral treatments may selectively alleviate neuropathic versus incisional pain.</p>

<p>Making healthy food choices is challenging for many people. Individuals differ greatly in their ability to follow health goals in the face of temptation, but it is unclear what underlies such differences. Using voxel-based morphometry, we investigated in healthy humans (i.e., men and women) the links between structural variation in gray matter volume and individuals' level of success in shifting toward healthier food choices. We combined MRI and choice data into a joint dataset by pooling across three independent studies that used a task prompting participants to explicitly focus on the healthiness of food items before making their food choices. Within this dataset, we found that individual differences in gray matter volume in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) predicted regulatory success. We extended and confirmed these initial findings by predicting regulatory success out of sample and across tasks in a second dataset requiring participants to apply a different regulation strategy that entailed distancing from cravings for unhealthy, appetitive foods. Our findings suggest that neuroanatomical markers in the vmPFC and dlPFC generalized to different forms of dietary regulation strategies across participant groups. They provide novel evidence that structural differences in neuroanatomy of two key regions for valuation and its control, the vmPFC and dlPFC, predict an individual's ability to exert control in dietary choices.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dieting involves regulating food choices to eat healthier foods and fewer unhealthy foods. People differ dramatically in their ability to achieve or maintain this regulation, but it is unclear why. Here, we show that individuals with more gray matter volume in the dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex are better at exercising dietary self-control. This relationship was observed across four different studies examining two different forms of dietary self-regulation, suggesting that neuroanatomical differences in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may represent a general marker for self-control abilities. These results identify candidate neuroanatomical markers for dieting success and failure, and suggest potential targets for therapies aimed at preventing or treating obesity and related eating disorders.</p>

Developing animals must begin to interact with the world before their neural development is complete. This means they must build neural codes appropriate for turning sensory inputs into motor outputs adaptively as their neural hardware matures. We review some recent progress in the understanding of the relationship between neural coding and neural circuit development. We focus particularly on neural coding in the context of topographic maps and spontaneous activity, as well as receptive field and circuit development, drawing on examples from both mammalian visual cortex and fish optic tectum.

<p>by Sung-Young Shin, Anna-Katharina Müller, Nandini Verma, Sima Lev, Lan K. Nguyen</p>

Prediction of drug combinations that effectively target cancer cells is a critical challenge for cancer therapy, in particular for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a highly aggressive breast cancer subtype with no effective targeted treatment. As signalling pathway networks critically control cancer cell behaviour, analysis of signalling network activity and crosstalk can help predict potent drug combinations and rational stratification of patients, thus bringing therapeutic and prognostic values. We have previously showed that the non-receptor tyrosine kinase PYK2 is a downstream effector of EGFR and c-Met and demonstrated their crosstalk signalling in basal-like TNBC. Here we applied a systems modelling approach and developed a mechanistic model of the integrated EGFR-PYK2-c-Met signalling network to identify and prioritize potent drug combinations for TNBC. Model predictions validated by experimental data revealed that among six potential combinations of drug pairs targeting the central nodes of the network, including EGFR, c-Met, PYK2 and STAT3, co-targeting of EGFR and PYK2 and to a lesser extent of EGFR and c-Met yielded strongest synergistic effect. Importantly, the synergy in co-targeting EGFR and PYK2 was linked to switch-like cell proliferation-associated responses. Moreover, simulations of patient-specific models using public gene expression data of TNBC patients led to predictive stratification of patients into subgroups displaying distinct susceptibility to specific drug combinations. These results suggest that mechanistic systems modelling is a powerful approach for the rational design, prediction and prioritization of potent combination therapies for individual patients, thus providing a concrete step towards personalized treatment for TNBC and other tumour types.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lYpC_ByFRf0" width="1" />

<p>by Wei-Ven Tee, Enrico Guarnera, Igor N. Berezovsky</p>

The omnipresence of allosteric regulation together with the fundamental role of structural dynamics in this phenomenon have initiated a great interest to the detection of regulatory exosites and design of corresponding effectors. However, despite a general consensus on the key role of dynamics most of the earlier efforts on the prediction of allosteric sites are heavily crippled by the static nature of the underlying methods, which are either structure-based approaches seeking for deep surface pockets typical for “traditional” orthosteric drugs or sequence-based techniques exploiting the conservation of protein sequences. Because of the critical role of global protein dynamics in allosteric signaling, we investigate the hypothesis of reversibility in allosteric communication, according to which allosteric sites can be detected via the perturbation of the functional sites. The reversibility is tested here using our structure-based perturbation model of allostery, which allows one to analyze the causality and energetics of allosteric communication. We validate the “reverse perturbation” hypothesis and its predictive power on a set of classical allosteric proteins, then, on the independent extended benchmark set. We also show that, in addition to known allosteric sites, the perturbation of the functional sites unravels rather extended protein regions, which can host latent regulatory exosites. These protein parts that are dynamically coupled with functional sites can also be used for inducing and tuning allosteric communication, and an exhaustive exploration of the per-residue contributions to allosteric effects can eventually lead to the optimal modulation of protein activity. The site-effector interactions necessary for a specific mode and level of allosteric communication can be fine-tuned by adjusting the site’s structure to an available effector molecule and by the design or selection of an appropriate ligand.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/13RpS-9zFXo" width="1" />

<p>by Bruck Taddese, Madeline Deniaud, Antoine Garnier, Asma Tiss, Hajer Guissouma, Hervé Abdi, Daniel Henrion, Marie Chabbert</p>

Chemokines and their receptors (members of the GPCR super-family) are involved in a wide variety of physiological processes and diseases; thus, understanding the specificity of the chemokine receptor family could help develop new receptor specific drugs. Here, we explore the evolutionary mechanisms that led to the emergence of the chemokine receptors. Based on GPCR hierarchical classification, we analyzed nested GPCR sets with an eigen decomposition approach of the sequence covariation matrix and determined three key residues whose mutation was crucial for the emergence of the chemokine receptors and their subsequent divergence into homeostatic and inflammatory receptors. These residues are part of the allosteric sodium binding site. Their structural and functional roles were investigated by molecular dynamics simulations of CXCR4 and CCR5 as prototypes of homeostatic and inflammatory chemokine receptors, respectively. This study indicates that the three mutations crucial for the evolution of the chemokine receptors dramatically altered the sodium binding mode. In CXCR4, the sodium ion is tightly bound by four protein atoms and one water molecule. In CCR5, the sodium ion is mobile within the binding pocket and moves between different sites involving from one to three protein atoms and two to five water molecules. Analysis of chemokine receptor evolution reveals that a highly constrained sodium binding site characterized most ancient receptors, and that the constraints were subsequently loosened during the divergence of this receptor family. We discuss the implications of these findings for the evolution of the chemokine receptor functions and mechanisms of action.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sHjAbuefwKk" width="1" />

<p>by Deena R. Schmidt, Roberto F. Galán, Peter J. Thomas</p>

Nerve cells produce electrical impulses (“spikes”) through the coordinated opening and closing of ion channels. Markov processes with voltage-dependent transition rates capture the stochasticity of spike generation at the cost of complex, time-consuming simulations. Schmandt and Galán introduced a novel method, based on the stochastic shielding approximation, as a fast, accurate method for generating approximate sample paths with excellent first and second moment agreement to exact stochastic simulations. We previously analyzed the mathematical basis for the method’s remarkable accuracy, and showed that for models with a Gaussian noise approximation, the stationary variance of the occupancy at each vertex in the ion channel state graph could be written as a sum of distinct contributions from each edge in the graph. We extend this analysis to arbitrary discrete population models with first-order kinetics. The resulting decomposition allows us to rank the “importance” of each edge’s contribution to the variance of the current under stationary conditions. In most cases, transitions between open (conducting) and closed (non-conducting) states make the greatest contributions to the variance, but there are exceptions. In a 5-state model of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, at low agonist concentration, a pair of “hidden” transitions (between two closed states) makes a greater contribution to the variance than any of the open-closed transitions. We exhaustively investigate this “edge importance reversal” phenomenon in simplified 3-state models, and obtain an exact formula for the contribution of each edge to the variance of the open state. Two conditions contribute to reversals: the opening rate should be faster than all other rates in the system, and the closed state leading to the opening rate should be sparsely occupied. When edge importance reversal occurs, current fluctuations are dominated by a slow noise component arising from the hidden transitions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/o95TRa66Blg" width="1" />

<p>by Yuji Sakai, Atsushi Mochizuki, Kazuhisa Kinoshita, Tatsuya Hirano, Masashi Tachikawa</p>

The mechanistic details underlying the assembly of rod-shaped chromosomes during mitosis and how they segregate from each other to act as individually mobile units remain largely unknown. Here, we construct a coarse-grained physical model of chromosomal DNA and condensins, a class of large protein complexes that plays key roles in these processes. We assume that condensins have two molecular activities: consecutive loop formation in DNA and inter-condensin attractions. Our simulation demonstrates that both of these activities and their balancing acts are essential for the efficient shaping and segregation of mitotic chromosomes. Our results also demonstrate that the shaping and segregation processes are strongly correlated, implying their mechanistic coupling during mitotic chromosome assembly. Our results highlight the functional importance of inter-condensin attractions in chromosome shaping and segregation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/P3LOaFhEytc" width="1" />

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Current findings suggest that accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain disrupt synaptic function in hippocampal–cortical neuronal networks leading to impairment in cognitive and affective functions in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Development of new disease-modifying AD drugs are challenging due to the lack of predictive animal models and efficacy assays. In the present study we recorded neural activity in TgF344-AD rats, a transgenic model with a full array of AD pathological features, including age-dependent Aβ accumulation, tauopathy, neuronal loss, and cognitive impairments. Under urethane anesthesia, TgF344-AD rats showed significant age-dependent decline in brainstem-elicited hippocampal theta oscillation and decreased theta-phase gamma-amplitude coupling comparing to their age-matched wild-type counterparts. In freely-behaving condition, the power of hippocampal theta oscillation and gamma power during sharp-wave ripples were significantly lower in TgF344-AD rats. Additionally, these rats showed impaired coherence in both intercortical and hippocampal–cortical network dynamics, and increased incidence of paroxysmal high-voltage spindles, which occur during awake, behaviorally quiescent state. TgF344-AD rats demonstrated impairments in sensory processing, having diminished auditory gating and 40-Hz auditory evoked steady-state response. The observed differences in neurophysiological activities in TgF344-AD rats, which mirror several abnormalities described in AD patients, may be used as promising markers to monitor disease-modifying therapies.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a key role in many high-level cognitive processes. It is densely innervated by serotonergic neurons originating from the dorsal and median raphe nuclei, which profoundly influence PFC activity. Among the 5-HT receptors abundantly expressed in PFC, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors located in dendrites of layer V pyramidal neurons control neuronal excitability and mediate the psychotropic effects of psychedelic hallucinogens, but their impact on glutamatergic transmission and synaptic plasticity remains poorly characterized. Here, we show that a 20-min exposure of mouse PFC slices to serotonin or the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) produces a long-lasting depression of evoked AMPA excitatory postsynaptic currents in layer V pyramidal neurons. DOI-elicited long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission is absent in slices from 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor-deficient mice, is rescued by viral expression of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor in pyramidal neurons and occludes electrically induced long-term depression. Furthermore, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor activation promotes phosphorylation of GluA2 AMPA receptor subunit at Ser<sup>880</sup> and AMPA receptor internalization, indicating common mechanisms with electrically induced LTD. These findings provide one of the first examples of LTD gating under the control of a G protein-coupled receptor that might lead to imbalanced synaptic plasticity and memory impairment following a nonphysiological elevation of extracellular serotonin.</span>

The precise regulation of fluid and energy homeostasis is essential for survival. It is well appreciated that ingestive behaviors are tightly regulated by both peripheral sensory inputs and central appetite signals. With recent neurogenetic technologies, considerable progress has been made in our understanding of basic taste qualities, the molecular and/or cellular basis of taste sensing, and the central circuits for thirst and hunger. In this review, we first highlight the functional similarities and differences between mammalian and invertebrate taste processing.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Emotional distraction may come from the external world and from our mind, as internal distraction. Although external emotional distraction has been extensively investigated, less is known about the mechanisms associated with the impact of internal emotional distraction on cognitive performance, and those involved in coping with such distraction. These issues were investigated using a working memory task with emotional distraction, where recollected unpleasant autobiographical memories served as internal emotional distraction. Emotion regulation was manipulated by instructing participants to focus their attention either on or away from the emotional aspects of their memories. Behaviorally, focusing away from emotion was associated with better working memory performance than focusing on the recollected emotions. Functional MRI data showed reduced response in brain regions associated with the salience network, coupled with greater recruitment of executive prefrontal and memory-related temporoparietal regions, and with increased frontoparietal connectivity, when subjects focused on nonemotional contextual details of their memories. Finally, temporal dissociations were also identified between regions involved in self-referential (showing faster responses) versus context-related processing (showing delayed responses). These findings demonstrate that focused attention is an effective regulation strategy in coping with internal distraction, and are relevant for understanding clinical conditions where coping with distressing memories is dysfunctional.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The brain has a remarkable capacity to recover after lesions. However, little is known about compensatory neural adaptations at the systems level. We addressed this question by investigating behavioral and (correlated) functional changes throughout the cortex that are induced by focal, reversible inactivations. Specifically, monkeys performed a demanding covert spatial attention task while the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) was inactivated with muscimol and whole-brain fMRI activity was recorded. The inactivation caused LIP-specific decreases in task-related fMRI activity. In addition, these local effects triggered large-scale network changes. Unlike most studies in which animals were mainly passive relative to the stimuli, we observed heterogeneous effects with more profound muscimol-induced increases of task-related fMRI activity in areas connected to LIP, especially FEF. Furthermore, in areas such as FEF and V4, muscimol-induced changes in fMRI activity correlated with changes in behavioral performance. Notably, the activity changes in remote areas did not correlate with the decreased activity at the site of the inactivation, suggesting that such changes arise via neuronal mechanisms lying in the intact portion of the functional task network, with FEF a likely key player. The excitationâ€“inhibition dynamics unmasking existing excitatory connections across the functional network might initiate these rapid adaptive changes.</span>
