                arXiv:2510.11924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing interactions between brain areas is a fundamental goal of systems neuroscience. While such analyses are possible when areas are recorded simultaneously, it is rare to observe all combinations of areas of interest within a single animal or recording session. How can we leverage multi-animal datasets to better understand multi-area interactions? Building on recent progress in large-scale, multi-animal models, we introduce NeuroPaint, a masked autoencoding approach for inferring the dynamics of unrecorded brain areas. By training across animals with overlapping subsets of recorded areas, NeuroPaint learns to reconstruct activity in missing areas based on shared structure across individuals. We train and evaluate our approach on synthetic data and two multi-animal, multi-area Neuropixels datasets. Our results demonstrate that models trained across animals with partial observations can successfully in-paint the dynamics of unrecorded areas, enabling multi-area analyses that transcend the limitations of any single experiment.

                arXiv:2510.12141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human core object recognition depends on the selective use of visual information, but the strategies guiding these choices are difficult to measure directly. We present MAPS (Masked Attribution-based Probing of Strategies), a behaviorally validated computational tool that tests whether explanations derived from artificial neural networks (ANNs) can also explain human vision. MAPS converts attribution maps into explanation-masked images (EMIs) and compares image-by-image human accuracies on these minimal images with limited pixel budgets with accuracies on the full stimuli. MAPS provides a principled way to evaluate and choose among competing ANN interpretability methods. In silico, EMI-based behavioral similarity between models reliably recovers the ground-truth similarity computed from their attribution maps, establishing which explanation methods best capture the model's strategy. When applied to humans and macaques, MAPS identifies ANN-explanation combinations whose explanations align most closely with biological vision, achieving the behavioral validity of Bubble masks while requiring far fewer behavioral trials. Because it needs only access to model attributions and a modest set of behavioral data on the original images, MAPS avoids exhaustive psychophysics while offering a scalable tool for adjudicating explanations and linking human behavior, neural activity, and model decisions under a common standard.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12228">Readout Representation: Redefining Neural Codes by Input Recovery</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.12228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensory representation is typically understood through a hierarchical-causal framework where progressively abstract features are extracted sequentially. However, this causal view fails to explain misrepresentation, a phenomenon better handled by an informational view based on decodable content. This creates a tension: how does a system that abstracts away details still preserve the fine-grained information needed for downstream functions? We propose readout representation to resolve this, defining representation by the information recoverable from features rather than their causal origin. Empirically, we show that inputs can be accurately reconstructed even from heavily perturbed mid-level features, demonstrating that a single input corresponds to a broad, redundant region of feature space, challenging the causal mapping perspective. To quantify this property, we introduce representation size, a metric linked to model robustness and representational redundancy. Our framework offers a new lens for analyzing how both biological and artificial neural systems learn complex features while maintaining robust, information-rich representations of the world.

                arXiv:2510.12751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Non-linear alterations in brain network connectivity may represent early neural signatures of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in cognitively normal older adults. Understanding these changes and their cognitive relevance could provide sensitive biomarkers for early detection. Most prior studies recruited participants from memory clinics, often with subjective memory concerns, limiting generalizability.
  Methods: We examined 14 large-scale functional brain networks in 968 cognitively normal older adults recruited from the community using resting-state functional MRI, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (amyloid-$\beta$ 1-42 [A$\beta$], total tau, phosphorylated tau 181), and neuropsychological assessments. Functional networks were identified using group independent component analysis.
  Results: Inverted U-shaped associations between CSF A$\beta$ and functional connectivity were observed in the precuneus network and ventral default mode network (DMN), but not in the dorsal DMN, indicating network-specific vulnerability to early amyloid pathology. Higher connectivity in A$\beta$-related networks, including dorsal and ventral DMN, precuneus, and posterior salience networks, was associated with better visual memory, visuospatial, and executive performance. No significant relationships were observed between CSF tau and functional connectivity.
  Conclusions: Using a large, community-based cohort, we demonstrate that non-linear alterations in functional connectivity occur in specific networks even during the asymptomatic phase of AD. Moreover, A$\beta$-related network connectivity is cognitively relevant, highlighting functional brain networks as promising imaging markers for early detection and prognosis of AD.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10300">The Algorithmic Regulator</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.10300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The regulator theorem states that, under certain conditions, any optimal controller must embody a model of the system it regulates, grounding the idea that controllers embed, explicitly or implicitly, internal models of the controlled. This principle underpins neuroscience and predictive brain theories like the Free-Energy Principle or Kolmogorov/Algorithmic Agent theory. However, the theorem is only proven in limited settings. Here, we treat the deterministic, closed, coupled world-regulator system $(W,R)$ as a single self-delimiting program $p$ via a constant-size wrapper that produces the world output string~$x$ fed to the regulator. We analyze regulation from the viewpoint of the algorithmic complexity of the output, $K(x)$. We define $R$ to be a \emph{good algorithmic regulator} if it \emph{reduces} the algorithmic complexity of the readout relative to a null (unregulated) baseline $\varnothing$, i.e., \[ \Delta = K\big(O_{W,\varnothing}\big) - K\big(O_{W,R}\big) > 0. \] We then prove that the larger $\Delta$ is, the more world-regulator pairs with high mutual algorithmic information are favored. More precisely, a complexity gap $\Delta > 0$ yields \[ \Pr\big((W,R)\mid x\big) \le C\,2^{\,M(W{:}R)}\,2^{-\Delta}, \] making low $M(W{:}R)$ exponentially unlikely as $\Delta$ grows. This is an AIT version of the idea that ``the regulator contains a model of the world.'' The framework is distribution-free, applies to individual sequences, and complements the Internal Model Principle. Beyond this necessity claim, the same coding-theorem calculus singles out a \emph{canonical scalar objective} and implicates a \emph{planner}. On the realized episode, a regulator behaves \emph{as if} it minimized the conditional description length of the readout.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12102">SpikePool: Event-driven Spiking Transformer with Pooling Attention</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.12102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the success of transformers, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have increasingly been integrated with transformer architectures, leading to spiking transformers that demonstrate promising performance on event-based vision tasks. However, despite these empirical successes, there remains limited understanding of how spiking transformers fundamentally process event-based data. Current approaches primarily focus on architectural modifications without analyzing the underlying signal processing characteristics. In this work, we analyze spiking transformers through the frequency spectrum domain and discover that they behave as high-pass filters, contrasting with Vision Transformers (ViTs) that act as low-pass filters. This frequency domain analysis reveals why certain designs work well for event-based data, which contains valuable high-frequency information but is also sparse and noisy. Based on this observation, we propose SpikePool, which replaces spike-based self-attention with max pooling attention, a low-pass filtering operation, to create a selective band-pass filtering effect. This design preserves meaningful high-frequency content while capturing critical features and suppressing noise, achieving a better balance for event-based data processing. Our approach demonstrates competitive results on event-based datasets for both classification and object detection tasks while significantly reducing training and inference time by up to 42.5% and 32.8%, respectively.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12269">Tensor Logic: The Language of AI</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.12269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the requisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic differentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python, which was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning and knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts to tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP an Prolog lack scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation, based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible, such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of symbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI.

                arXiv:2510.12293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) often faces challenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving high-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine (GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier feature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it difficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find an alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we integrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function, so there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we assign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM network to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions. Finally, we develop an innovative, straightforward initialization method for these hyperparameters by monitoring the distribution of ELM output weights. GFF-PIELM not only retains the high accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity of the PIELM framework but also inherits the ability of FFMs to effectively handle high-frequency problems. We carry out five case studies with a total of ten numerical examples to highlight the feasibility and validity of the proposed GFF-PIELM, involving high frequency, variable frequency, multi-scale behaviour, irregular boundary and inverse problems. Compared to conventional PIELM, the GFF-PIELM approach significantly improves predictive accuracy without additional cost in training time and architecture complexity. Our results confirm that that PIELM can be extended to solve high-frequency and variable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and our initialization strategy may further inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning (PIML) frameworks.

                arXiv:2505.05510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Metamorphosis (NeuMeta) is a recent paradigm for generating neural networks of varying width and depth. Based on Implicit Neural Representation (INR), NeuMeta learns a continuous weight manifold, enabling the direct generation of compressed models, including those with configurations not seen during training. While promising, the original formulation of NeuMeta proves effective only for the final layers of the undelying model, limiting its broader applicability. In this work, we propose a training algorithm that extends the capabilities of NeuMeta to enable full-network metamorphosis with minimal accuracy degradation. Our approach follows a structured recipe comprising block-wise incremental training, INR initialization, and strategies for replacing batch normalization. The resulting metamorphic networks maintain competitive accuracy across a wide range of compression ratios, offering a scalable solution for adaptable and efficient deployment of deep models. The code is available at: https://github.com/TSommariva/HTTY_NeuMeta.

Abstract: Scaffolding Large Language Models (LLMs) into multi-agent systems often improves performance on complex tasks, but the safety impact of such scaffolds has not been thoroughly explored. We introduce AgentBreeder, a framework for multi-objective self-improving evolutionary search over scaffolds. We evaluate discovered scaffolds on widely recognized reasoning, mathematics, and safety benchmarks and compare them with popular baselines. In "blue" mode, we see a 79.4% average uplift in safety benchmark performance while maintaining or improving capability scores. In "red" mode, we find adversarially weak scaffolds emerging concurrently with capability optimization. Our work demonstrates the risks of multi-agent scaffolding and provides a framework for mitigating them. Code is available at https://github.com/jrosseruk/AgentBreeder.

                arXiv:2505.13755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chaotic systems are intrinsically sensitive to small errors, challenging efforts to construct predictive data-driven models of real-world dynamical systems such as fluid flows or neuronal activity. Prior efforts comprise either specialized models trained separately on individual time series, or foundation models trained on vast time series databases with little underlying dynamical structure. Motivated by dynamical systems theory, we present Panda, Patched Attention for Nonlinear Dynamics. We train Panda on a novel synthetic, extensible dataset of $2 \times 10^4$ chaotic dynamical systems that we discover using an evolutionary algorithm. Trained purely on simulated data, Panda exhibits emergent properties: zero-shot forecasting of unseen chaotic systems preserving both short-term accuracy and long-term statistics. Despite having been trained only on low-dimensional ordinary differential equations, Panda spontaneously develops the ability to predict partial differential equations without retraining. We also demonstrate a neural scaling law for differential equations, underscoring the potential of pretrained models for probing abstract mathematical domains like nonlinear dynamics.

">Pattern-Induced Visual Discomfort and Its Temporal Summation Revealed by Pupillary Measures</a></h4>

              
                Viewing repetitive striped patterns can induce pattern glare, experienced as visual discomfort (VD). While previous studies examined either pupillary responses or VD separately, few have investigated how they covary or evolve with repeated exposure. This study tested whether pupillary dynamics could serve as an objective Aversometer - a physiological marker of individual visual sensitivity beyond subjective reports. Across four experiments (preliminary: n = 97; main: n = 70 for spatial frequency, n = 46 for central field size, n = 36 for central blank, with partial overlap), we manipulated spatial frequency, central field size, and surround field size of square-wave gratings (0.5-3 s) while measuring both discomfort and pupil size. Higher spatial frequencies and larger pattern areas elicited stronger pupillary constriction and greater discomfort, whereas repeated exposures produced cumulative increases in discomfort and decreases in baseline pupil size, consistent with visual strain rather than adaptation. To assess the potential of pupillometry as an aversometer, we examined individual differences in the main spatial-frequency experiment (controlled viewing distance, n = 42). A paradoxical pattern emerged: within participants, stronger stimuli produced greater constriction, but individuals with higher overall discomfort showed weaker constriction and stronger late redilation. Similar dissociations between subjective sensitivity and pupillary responses have been noted in studies of light-induced discomfort, suggesting that related mechanisms may contribute, although their specific physiological basis remains unclear. Overall, our findings clarify how pattern-induced discomfort evolves over time and across individuals and highlight pupillometry as a potential as a sensitive, objective tool for assessing visual sensitivity.

                Background SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Looking at the prevalence data in the world and in Indonesia, the highest mortality rate due to COVID-19 involves age, gender and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus. Severity of the condition also refers to coagulation abnormalities, such as abnormal prothrombin time values. Methods This systematic review study and meta-analysis used online literature sourced from PubMed, Science Direct, EBSCO, Cochrane and Google Scholar. This study aimed to evaluate the association between age, sex, and prothrombin time and the likelihood of hospitalization among COVID-19 patients with diabetes. The literature used here is literature that has data on age, sex and prothrombin time of COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus whose quality is assessed by the NOS (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) criteria and processing data using Review Manager 5.4. Results Out of 8711 literatures that were traced from various search sources, there were 45 literatures that were included in this study. The results of the analysis on age showed the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) value of 0.45 and P <0.0001 (95% CI: 0.23–0.68), the gender analysis showed an Odds Ratio (OR) value of 3.28 and P = 0.01 (95% CI: 1.26–8.52) and the prothrombin time analysis showed SMD values of 0.41 and P = 0.07 (95%CI = -0.03–0.85). Conclusion Patients with COVID-19 who have DM have a higher risk of hospitalization compared to those without DM. Among COVID-19 patients with DM admitted to hospitals, they were older compared to those without DM and prothrombin time values similar but slightly higher in COVID-19 patients with DM.

                Background/Aim To examine the clinical correlation of p16 expression with Epithelial–Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) markers and lymphatic invasion in OPSCC patients in terms of clinical status at presentation, subsequent progression, and survival. Methods Tissue blocks of biopsy-proven Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma were subjected to Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for evaluating the expression of p16, e-cadherin, vimentin and podoplanin. This expression pattern was correlated with the demographic details, treatment response and survival patterns. Results 60 patients were finally available for evaluation in this study. Prevalence of HPV infection in our study was found to be 11.7%. E-cadherin expression was found in all HPV-associated patients whereas vimentin was not expressed in any of these. 71.4% patients had low Podoplanin expression and 85.7% had low lymphatic vessel count. Among the HPV- associated patients, 85.8% had T3-T4 stage, 100% had N2-N3 disease and 95% had stage IV disease. It was also found that p16-positive patients had significantly higher 1-year Overall survival (OS) (80%, p=0.045), higher 1-year Progression-free survival (PFS) (60%) and higher 1-year Locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS) (75%) when compared to p16-negative patients. Conclusion Prevalence of HPV infection was found to be similar to that of previous studies conducted in India. As previous literature suggests, the HPV-positive patients in our study presented with advanced nodal disease at presentation and thereby, an advanced overall stage. Further follow-up of these patients including their treatment details, determination of possible prognostic markers, and evaluation of their survival parameters can be done which can help in modifying the existing treatment modalities as HPV-associated OPSCC are known to have better prognosis according to literature.

                Background Extemporaneous compounding preparations are a critical component of pharmacy practice inside and outside hospitals, as they customize therapy to meet each patient’s unique needs. Despite their clinical significance, data on the operational standards and prescription patterns of such products in some Iraqi hospitals are still limited. Comprehending these elements is important to ensure safe and efficient compounding and to improve pharmacy services. Objective To evaluate the nature and extent of extemporaneous compounding preparations and explore the challenges of pharmacists’ ability to practice compounding services. Methods An observational, cross-sectional, multicenter study encompassing 25 hospital pharmacies and 70 pharmacists was conducted. A five-section checklist was used (pharmacist characteristics, nature and extent of extemporaneous compounding, requirements for extemporaneous compounding, challenges against compounding practice, and pharmacists’ opinions). Results Pediatricians requested orders was (45.76%), sterile preparations (69.56%) for compound dosage forms. The primary service was the reconstitution or processing of readymade commercial formulations (71.43%). Most of compounded preparations were labeled (92%). The compounding protocols depended on physician’s order (82.5%). Only (48%) of hospitals possess laminar airflow hoods for aseptic operations, whereas (72%) were equipped with personal protective equipment. The primary challenge against pharmacists was the lack of specific equipment or supplies (91.43%), their self-confidence in preparing products was (40.0%), and professional satisfaction was (34.29%). Conclusions The findings of this study indicate that most hospital pharmacies lack standardized extemporaneous preparation services and that pharmacists’ professional judgments and perceptions are influenced by their personal and workplace facilities.

                Tracheobronchial endoluminal hamartochondroma (HC) is a rare benign tumor, most frequently diagnosed in individuals between the sixth and seventh decades of life. The clinical presentation is usually very noisy. Here, we report two interesting cases. The first patient is a 58-year-old man who was wrongly treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. HC was in the lower third of the trachea. The second patient is a 43-year-old man with a history of bronchiectasis and right lower lobectomy. HC was in the middle lobe bronchus. The resection via rigid bronchoscopy with diode laser was successful without any complications. Only one patient keeps a small stable tumor residue. The rigid bronchoscopy with laser-application in tracheobronchial endoluminal HC is safe and effective. Flexible bronchoscopy is important during the follow-up.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1114/v1?src=rss">Validation of the Arabic version of the smoking cessation motivation questionnaire among Tunisian student smokers [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Smoking remains a major public health problem, particularly among Tunisian health students, with a prevalence of 26%. Assessing motivation to quit smoking requires tools that have been validated in the local language. This study aimed to translate and validate the psychometric properties of the Motivation to Quit Smoking Questionnaire (Q-MAT) into Arabic. Method A cross-sectional methodological study was conducted among 203 smoking health science students in March 2022. The cross-cultural validation process followed Vallerand’s seven steps, including translation/back-translation, expert panel review, pre-testing, and psychometric analyses. Reliability was assessed by internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) and temporal stability (test-retest). Content validity was measured by the CVI index, and construct validity by exploratory factor analysis. Results The sample included 197 students (mean age: 18.95±1.07 years, sex ratio: 0.89). The Arabic Q-MAT demonstrated excellent reliability with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.840, a test-retest correlation of 0.831, and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.886. Content validity was satisfactory (CVI = 0.89). Principal component analysis revealed that two factors explained 89.148% of the total variance. Conclusions This initial validation of the Q-MAT in literary Arabic provides a reliable and valid tool for assessing motivation to quit smoking among Arabic-speaking populations, facilitating the development of targeted public health interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-772/v2?src=rss">Integración de tecnologías digitales en la enseñanza de competencias interculturales: mapeo sistemático de la literatura [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The development of intercultural competences mediated by digital technologies has gained prominence in higher education, driven by academic internationalization and the advancement of virtual learning environments. However, questions remain regarding the most frequently studied competence dimensions, the geographic regions involved, and the methodologies employed. Methods A systematic literature mapping was conducted following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines to analyze scientific production from 2005 to 2024, sourced from Scopus, Web of Science, and SciELO. Inclusion criteria focused on peer-reviewed, open-access articles, in English or Spanish, addressing the integration of digital technologies in the teaching of intercultural competence. After screening 176 records, 23 studies were included for analysis. Results Scientific production was primarily concentrated in the Americas and Europe (78%), with Mexico (15%) and countries such as the United States, Spain, and Russia each accounting for 11%. The most frequent competence dimensions were adaptation and management (47.83%), intercultural knowledge (39.13%), communication skills (39.13%), and intercultural attitudes (39.13%). Competences such as cultural adaptability, intercultural awareness, and intercultural communication were the most frequently addressed, reflecting the need for flexibility and communication skills in multicultural contexts. Technologies like COIL (Collaborative Online International Learning) and immersive tools are emerging as effective strategies to promote intercultural learning, although areas such as innovative leadership (4.35%) and personal development (8.70%) remain underexplored. Temporally, there has been sustained growth in research since 2019, with peaks in 2021, 2022, and 2023. Conclusion Digital technologies show significant potential for the development of intercultural competences, but their implementation requires addressing structural, pedagogical, and equity-related gaps. This study lays the groundwork for future research and policies aimed at enhancing inclusive and sustainable intercultural education in digital environments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-789/v2?src=rss">Development and psychometric validation of the Indonesian versions of the Postpartum Blues and Maternal Self-Efficacy Scales [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Postpartum blues and low maternal self-efficacy are among the most frequently encountered psychological challenges that impact both maternal well-being and infant care. Although these conditions are prevalent, Indonesia currently lacks culturally adapted and validated instruments to measure them effectively. This study aimed to adapt and validate the Indonesian versions of the Postpartum Blues Questionnaire (PBQ-32) and the Maternal Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (MSEQ-20). Methodology A cross-sectional psychometric approach was employed. The adaptation process involved forward and backwards translation, expert panel review, and cultural adjustment. A total of 30 postpartum mothers (within 3–10 days after childbirth) were selected through consecutive sampling. Content validity was examined using the Content Validity Index (CVI), while construct validity was assessed via exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Internal consistency reliability was calculated using Cronbach’s alpha, and test-retest reliability was assessed using Pearson’s correlation. Results The PBQ-32 demonstrated strong internal consistency (α = 0.89), a six-factor structure explaining 68.4% of the variance, and excellent test-retest reliability (r = 0.91). Similarly, the MSEQ-20 showed good internal consistency (α = 0.87), a four-factor structure accounting for 61.7% of the variance, and high test-retest reliability (r = 0.88). The CVI values for both instruments exceeded 0.89, indicating strong content validity. A significant negative correlation between postpartum blues and maternal self-efficacy (r = –0.72, p < 0.001) further supported the concurrent validity of the tools. Conclusion The Indonesian versions of the PBQ-32 and MSEQ-20 have demonstrated good psychometric properties and cultural relevance. Their use in clinical and community settings may support the early identification of psychological challenges during the postpartum period and inform appropriate maternal mental health interventions in Indonesia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1113/v1?src=rss">Mitigating Credit Risk through Corporate Governance: An Investigation into the Causal Pathways from Board Accountability to Reduced Non-Performing Loans in Uganda’s  Commercial Banks. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Non-performing loans (NPLs) pose a critical threat to the stability and financial performance of commercial banks globally. This study is grounded in Agency Theory, which highlights the risk of conflicts of interest between bank management (agents) and shareholders (principals). It investigates the specific role of board accountability as a governance mechanism in mitigating NPLs within the under-researched context of commercial banks in Western Uganda. Methods A mixed-methods approach was employed. Quantitative data were collected via surveys from 195 bank employees and board members, selected through a combination of stratified, purposive, and simple random sampling from a population of 550, yielding an 84.1% response rate. The quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and simple linear regression. Concurrently, qualitative data were gathered through interviews and analyzed using thematic analysis with NVivo software to provide depth and context. Results The quantitative analysis revealed a statistically significant strong positive correlation between board accountability and the reduction of NPLs, confirming that heightened board oversight is associated with improved loan performance. The qualitative findings substantiate this, identifying two key mechanisms: first, reduced improper board interference in the loan approval process, and second, proactive board engagement in resolving existing NPLs. Together, the data triangulate to show that a board functioning with high integrity and clear accountability is pivotal in controlling NPLs. Conclusions This study concludes that robust board accountability is a critical determinant of asset quality in commercial banks. It acts by aligning the interests of management and the board with those of shareholders, thereby curbing unauthorized influence and promoting prudent credit risk management. The findings underscore the importance of appointing high-integrity board members and strengthening governance structures. Future research should incorporate additional variables, such as macroeconomic conditions and regulatory frameworks, to develop a more comprehensive model of NPL determinants.

                Background Road crashes are recognized as a major public health problem in low- and middle-income countries. However, initiating and detecting a reduction in the burden of road traffic injuries require reliable statistics to implement current data capture methods, while in many countries data is not sufficiently available and reliable. Methods This study presents an implementation of a monitoring system for road traffic crashes and injuries carried out in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. The aim was to demonstrate the feasibility of a systematic capture method capable of improving estimation of the road crash rates and their characteristics. Results The number of road traffic injuries is estimated at 4,766 over one year, and the total number of deaths at 206. 90% of road crash victims are users of two-wheeled motorized vehicles. Lower limbs are the most frequently affected (49.5%) body areas, followed by the head and face (45.9%) and upper limbs (28.7%). Injuries to the chest are the most serious, followed by those to the lower limbs and the head. The spatial analysis of the density of casualties shows a concentration of road crashes on all major roads to the city especially near traffic lights and major intersections. Conclusion The action-research shows that to develop this type of monitoring system, it is essential to cross at least two sources of data collection involved in road crash management to estimate the number of collisions, injuries and fatalities.

                <p>by Nikoleta E. Glynatsi, Christian Hilbe, Yohsuke Murase</p>

Indirect reciprocity is a key mechanism for large-scale cooperation. This mechanism captures the insight that in part, people help others to build and maintain a good reputation. To enable such cooperation, appropriate social norms are essential. They specify how individuals should act based on each others’ reputations, and how reputations are updated in response to individual actions. Although previous work has identified several norms that sustain cooperation, a complete analytical characterization of all evolutionarily stable norms remains lacking, especially when assessments or actions are noisy. In this study, we provide such a characterization for the public assessment regime. This characterization reproduces known results, such as the leading eight norms, but it extends to more general cases, allowing for various types of errors and additional actions including costly punishment. We also identify norms that impose a fixed payoff on any mutant strategy, analogous to the zero-determinant strategies in direct reciprocity. These results offer a rigorous foundation for understanding the evolution of cooperation through indirect reciprocity and the critical role of social norms.

                <p>by Adolfo Alsina, Marco Fumasoni, Pablo Sartori</p>

The eukaryotic cell cycle comprises several processes that must be carefully orchestrated and completed in a timely manner. Alterations in cell cycle dynamics have been linked to the onset of various diseases, underscoring the need for quantitative methods to analyze cell cycle progression. Here we develop RepliFlow, a model-based approach to infer cell cycle dynamics from flow cytometry data of DNA content in asynchronous cell populations. We show that RepliFlow captures not only changes in the length of each cell cycle phase but also alterations in the underlying DNA replication dynamics. RepliFlow is species-agnostic and recapitulates results from more sophisticated analyses based on nucleotide incorporation. Finally, we propose a minimal DNA replication model that enables the derivation of microscopic observables from population-wide DNA content measurements. Our work presents a scalable framework for inferring cell cycle dynamics from flow cytometry data, enabling the characterization of replication programme alterations.

                <p>by Hugo Lachuer, Emmanuel Moebel, Anne-Sophie Macé, Arthur Masson, Kristine Schauer, Charles Kervrann</p>

Segmentation and detection of biological objects in fluorescence microscopy is of paramount importance in cell imaging. Deep learning approaches have recently shown promise to advance, automatize and accelerate analysis. However, most of the interest has been given to the segmentation of static objects of 2D/3D images whereas the segmentation of dynamic processes obtained from time-lapse acquisitions has been less explored. Here we adapted DeepFinder, a U-Net originally designed for 3D noisy cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) data, for the detection of rare dynamic exocytosis events (termed ExoDeepFinder) observed in temporal series of 2D Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRFM) images. ExoDeepFinder achieved good absolute performances with a relatively small training dataset of 12000 events in 60 cells. We rigorously compared deep learning performances with unsupervised conventional methods from the literature. ExoDeepFinder outcompeted the tested methods, but also exhibited a greater plasticity to the experimental conditions when tested under drug treatments and after changes in cell line or imaged reporter. This robustness to unseen experimental conditions did not require re-training demonstrating generalization capability of our deep learning model. ExoDeepFinder, as well as the annotated training datasets, were made transparent and available through an open-source software as well as a Napari plugin and can directly be applied to custom user data. The apparent plasticity and performances of ExoDeepFinder to detect dynamic events open new opportunities for future deep learning guided analysis of dynamic processes in live-cell imaging.

Neophobia, or aversion to novelty, is important for adaptability and survival as it influences the ways in which animals navigate risk and interact with their environments. Across individuals, species and other taxonomic levels, neophobia is known to vary considerably, but our understanding of the wider ecological drivers of neophobia is hampered by a lack of comparative multispecies studies using standardized methods. Here, we utilized the ManyBirds Project, a Big Team Science large-scale collaborative open science framework, to pool efforts and resources of 129 collaborators at 77 institutions from 24 countries worldwide across six continents. We examined both difference scores (between novel object test and control conditions) and raw data of latency to touch familiar food in the presence (test) and absence (control) of a novel object among 1,439 subjects from 136 bird species across 25 taxonomic orders incorporating lab, field, and zoo sites. We first demonstrated that consistent differences in neophobia existed among individuals, among species, and among other taxonomic levels in our dataset, rejecting the null hypothesis that neophobia is highly plastic at all taxonomic levels with no evidence for evolutionary divergence. We then tested for effects of ecological factors on neophobia, including diet, sociality, habitat, and range, while accounting for phylogeny. We found that (i) species with more specialist diets were more neophobic than those with more generalist diets, providing support for the Neophobia Threshold Hypothesis; (ii) migratory species were also more neophobic than nonmigratory species, which supports the Dangerous Niche Hypothesis. Our study shows that the evolution of avian neophobia has been shaped by ecological drivers and demonstrates the potential of Big Team Science to advance our understanding of animal behavior.

A salient visual object with a distinct feature from the surrounding environment automatically captures attention. While the saliency signals have been found in many brain regions, their source remains highly controversial. Here, we investigated the neural origin of visual saliency using cortical layer-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of cerebral blood volume (CBV) at 7 Tesla. Behaviorally, human observers were better at detecting salient foreground bars with a larger orientation contrast from uniformly oriented background bars. Saliency-sensitive signals were strongest in the superficial layers of the primary visual cortex (V1) and in the middle layers of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) of the parietal cortex. Layer-dependent effective connectivity revealed the transmission of saliency signals along the feedforward pathway from V1 to IPS. Furthermore, behavioral sensitivity to the foreground stimulus correlated significantly with the fMRI response in the superficial layers of V1. Our findings provide mesoscale evidence that a visual saliency map is created by iso-feature suppression through lateral inhibition in the superficial layers of V1, and then feeds forward to attentional control brain regions to guide attention and eye movements.

Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability, frequently associated with persistent motor deficits. Gamma band oscillations, generated by synchronous discharge of parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV-INs), are critically affected after stroke in humans and animals. Both gamma band and PV-INs play a key role in motor function, thus representing a promising target for poststroke neurorehabilitation. Noninvasive neuromodulatory approaches are considered a safe intervention and can be used for this purpose. Here, we present a novel, clinically relevant, noninvasive, and well-tolerated sub-acute treatment combining robotic rehabilitation with advanced neuromodulation techniques, validated in a mouse model of ischemic injury. During the sub-acute poststroke phase, we scored profound deficits in motor-related gamma band activity in the perilesional cortex. These deficits were accompanied by reduced PV-IN firing rates and increased functional connectivity, both at the perilesional and at the whole-cortex levels. Therefore, we tested the therapeutic potential of coupling robotic rehabilitation with optogenetic PV-IN-driven gamma band stimulation in a subacute poststroke phase during motor training to reinforce the efficacy of the treatment. Frequency-specific movement-related gamma band stimulation, when combined with physical training, significantly improved forelimb motor function. More importantly, by pairing robotic rehabilitation with a clinical-like noninvasive 40 Hz transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation, we achieved similar motor improvements mediated by the effective restoring of movement-related gamma band power, improvement of PV-IN maladaptive network dynamics, and increased PV-IN connections in premotor cortex. Our research introduces a new understanding of the role of parvalbumin-interneurons in poststroke impairment and recovery. These results highlight the synergistic potential of combining perilesional gamma band stimulation with robotic rehabilitation as a promising and realistic therapeutic approach for stroke patients.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Various modifiable risk factors have been identified for dementia, but it remains unclear whether these associations and importance vary according to genetic predisposition.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 182,473 dementia-free individuals from United Kingdom (UK) Biobank cohort. We calculated the hazard ratios (HRs) and population-attributable fractions (PAF) of 11 modifiable risk factors (smoking status, drinking status, diet, physical activity, hypertension, diabetes, waist-to-hip ratio, education, depression, social contact, and air pollution) for dementia in general population and across various genetic groups based on <i>APOE</i> genotypes and a weighted polygenic-risk score (PRS).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>During 12.42-year follow-up, a total of 2,065 incident all-cause dementia (ACD) cases were documented. Low social contact, diabetes, and abdominal obesity were top 3 modifiable risk factors associated with an increased risk of dementia, especially in low <i>APOE</i> risk (ε2ε2 or ε2ε3) group. The HRs associated with low social contact, diabetes, and abdominal obesity were 3.86 (95% CI: 2.08–7.17), 2.18 (95% CI: 1.43–3.32) and 1.29 (95% CI: 0.88–1.89) for dementia in the low <i>APOE</i> risk. The same patterns were also observed in PRS groups. In terms of PAFs, abdominal obesity contributed the most in low genetic risk groups (PAF: 13.68 to 15.73%). In contrast, less education was the largest contributor in high <i>APOE</i> and high PRS groups (PAF: 11.35% [95% CI: 5.32–17.38%] and 11.24% [95% CI: 4.40–18.07%], respectively), followed by hypertension (PAF: 9.09% [95% CI: 2.01–16.17%] and 5.29% [95% CI: −2.72 to 13.29%], respectively). Overall, the total PAF decreased with increasing genetic risk, particularly for metabolic risk factors.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings highlight the importance of personalized risk assessments and the development of tailored interventions based on genetic background to prevent dementia more effectively. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

[version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Since 2009, Recovery Colleges have offered co-produced educational courses by lived experience and clinical experts in the UK, focusing on mental health recovery to promote cultural change in mental health services and foster a ‘recovery culture.’ This study examines the understanding of ‘self-care’ and ‘self-management’ among Recovery College students from a phenomenological perspective. It inquires whether students learn what self-care is in the Recovery College and if attending Recovery College courses change the way they understand and practice self-care. This study will investigate, over two weeks, the impact of Recovery College self-care teaching on students’ lives by examining their self-care practices, embodied experiences, and related investments, including time, resources, and space. It will also determine if self-care practice helps students prevent mental health crises and maintain or improve their mental health. Method The Chief Investigator will recruit nine Camden & Islington Recovery College students, from the North London NHS Foundation Trust, and one clinical professional to participate in research co-production workshops and co-produce rapid ethnographic research methodology. Study Participants’ recruitment will seek diversity, including the Recovery College’s population demographics and under-represented communities. Data from study participants, the clinical co-facilitator, and the Chief Investigator will be collected. Analysis Data will be analysed using thematic analysis. Employing NVivo 14.23.3 Lumivero, data from workshops, interviews, journals, notebooks, photos, and other research outputs will be accurately transcribed, coded, and clustered by themes. The case analyses of study participants will inform the writing of research outputs. Ethics and Dissemination The Northern Ireland Research Ethics Committee (24-NI-0127 - HSC REC A) granted ethical approval for the study. The Chief Investigator is a London School of Economics PhD in Anthropology and a Camden & Islington Recovery College Senior Peer Recovery Tutor. The NIHR Mental Health for All program and the NIHR Springboard Award funds this ‘embedded research’ project. Ethical considerations include trauma-informed research methodology, the disclosure of harm or distress by study participants, power imbalances between the Chief Investigator and study participants, and the use of pseudonymity and data management. The study findings will be shared as published reports, posters, articles or applied research in the form of a Recovery College self-care course or handout for example, with Recovery College students, the Camden and Islington Recovery College, the North London Foundation Trust, UCL, the NIHR, and ImROC.

                Synapses are traditionally defined by the presence of presynaptic vesicle pools and postsynaptic densities. Dopaminergic neurons, however, frequently form bouton-like structures that lack these conventional postsynaptic specializations. Recently, high-resolution imaging techniques such as electron microscopy and correlative light and electron microscopy, along with nanosensors and in vitro models, have revealed the molecular identities and spatial organization of distinct vesicle pools in dopaminergic terminals. In this review, we discuss how recent findings have reshaped current understanding of dopamine vesicles, revealing a structural continuum that includes non-classical architectures. We highlight emerging concepts such as dopamine hub synapses and vesicle heterogeneity in dopaminergic terminals. Finally, we examine how dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease-associated proteins affects synaptic integrity and predisposes dopaminergic neurons to selective vulnerability.

                The authors review evidence that the primary function of the brain, supported by distributed neural systems, is the predictive regulation of physiology (i.e., allostasis). An example from Alzheimer’s disease illustrates how this perspective might reframe traditional psychologically centered perspectives on neurological health.

                P-Rex1 activates Rac downstream of GPCRs to regulate processes ranging from innate immunity to neuronal plasticity, its deregulation contributing to cancer. Here, Baker et al. show that P-Rex1 also controls GPCR trafficking, limiting agonist-induced GPCR internalization through an adapter function. Thus, P-Rex1 promotes GPCR responses in a dual manner.

                Loss of REV-ERB nuclear receptors shortens the free-running circadian period. Tackenberg et al. show that the period-shortening phenotype is conserved between the master circadian pacemaker, the SCN, and the peripheral clocks of the liver. The period-shortening phenotype requires the depression of Npas2, a REV-ERB target gene.

They demonstrate that the pyrenoid, the central organelle of the CCM, supplies a concentrated stream of inorganic carbon to neighboring acetyl-CoA carboxylase condensates, thereby enhancing fatty acid production.

Restoring trust requires a paradigm shift in which scientists accept that the responsibility to champion science lies with us. We propose a new model in which public communication and advocacy are considered as essential to our mission as rigor and reproducibility — critical not only for safeguarding science, but also for ensuring that its benefits reach all segments of the societies we serve.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 14 October 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63910-4">doi:10.1038/s41467-025-63910-4</a></p>The electrocatalytic oxidation of propane fuel is slow on Pt. By analyzing the rate of its individual steps, the authors show that slow propane oxidation is caused by a mismatch between the electrode potentials that promote propane adsorption, conversion of intermediates, and oxidation to CO2.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101912">HIF1A-mediated pathways promote euploid cell survival in chromosomally mosaic embryos</a></h4>

              
                Human fertility is suboptimal in part by error-prone divisions during early cleavage stages, which frequently result in chromosomal aneuploidy. Most human pre-implantation embryos are mosaics of euploid and aneuploid cells, yet those with a low proportion of aneuploid cells can develop to term at rates similar to fully euploid embryos. How embryos manage aneuploidy during early development remains poorly understood – yet this knowledge is crucial for improving fertility outcomes and reducing developmental defects. To investigate these mechanisms, we established a new mouse model of chromosome mosaicism to trace the fate of aneuploid cells during pre-implantation development. We previously used the Mps1 inhibitor reversine to induce aneuploidy. Here, we demonstrate that the more specific Mps1 inhibitor AZ3146 similarly disrupts chromosome segregation but supports higher developmental potential than reversine. AZ3146-treated embryos transiently upregulate hypoxia-inducible factor-1A (HIF1A) without triggering <i>Trp53</i> activation. Given that pre-implantation embryos develop in a hypoxic environment in vivo, we further explored the role of oxygen tension. Hypoxia exposure in vitro reduced DNA damage in response to Mps1 inhibition and increased the proportion of euploid cells in mosaic epiblast. Conversely, HIF1A inhibition decreased the proportion of aneuploid cells. Together, these findings uncover a role for hypoxia signaling in modulating the response to chromosomal errors and suggest new strategies to improve the developmental potential of mosaic human embryos.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90261">Homeostatic synaptic plasticity of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents in mouse cortical cultures requires neuronal Rab3a</a></h4>

              
                Following prolonged activity blockade, amplitudes of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) increase, a form of plasticity termed ‘homeostatic synaptic plasticity’. We previously showed that a presynaptic protein, the small GTPase <i>Rab3a</i>, is required for full expression of the increase in miniature endplate current amplitudes following prolonged blockade of action potential activity at the mouse neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in vivo, where an increase in postsynaptic receptors does not contribute. It is unknown whether this form of <i>Rab3a</i>-dependent homeostatic plasticity at the NMJ shares any characteristics with central synapses. We show here that homeostatic synaptic plasticity of mEPSCs is impaired in mouse cortical neuron cultures prepared from <i>Rab3a</i><sup>−/−</sup> and mutant mice expressing a single-point mutation of <i>Rab3a</i>, <i>Rab3a Earlybird</i> mice. To determine if <i>Rab3a</i> is involved in the well-established homeostatic increase in postsynaptic AMPA-type receptors (AMPARs), we performed a series of experiments in which electrophysiological recordings of mEPSCs and confocal imaging of synaptic AMPAR immunofluorescence were assessed within the same cultures. We found that the increase in postsynaptic AMPAR levels in wild-type cultures was more variable than that of mEPSC amplitudes, which might be explained by a presynaptic contribution, but we cannot rule out variability in the measurement. Finally, we demonstrate that <i>Rab3a</i> is acting in neurons because only selective loss of <i>Rab3a</i> in neurons, not glia, disrupted the homeostatic increase in mEPSC amplitudes. This is the first demonstration that a protein thought to function presynaptically is required for homeostatic synaptic plasticity of quantal size in central neurons.

                Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a common inherited neurodevelopmental condition, resulting from loss of Fragile X Messenger Ribonuclear Protein (FMRP). Rodent models of FXS display cellular hyperexcitability, but it is not known to what extent this is the case in intact human neurons. Depleting FMRP in human brain slice cultures reveals cyclic-AMP-dependent cellular hyperexcitability which is corrected by phosphodiesterase 4D inhibition and may be independent of neurodevelopment.

">How the Brain Distinguishes Internal and External Sounds: An fMRI Investigation of Auditory Sound Externalization</a></h4>

              
                Auditory externalization, the perception of a sound source as located outside the head, is essential for spatial hearing and auditory scene analysis. However, its neural correlates remain poorly understood. This study investigated differences in brain activation elicited by externalized versus internalized sound sources. Twenty-nine healthy participants underwent a 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan while listening to auditory stimuli presented in three spatialization conditions: reverberant externalized sounds (highest externalization), anechoic externalized sounds (intermediate externalization) and diotic anechoic sounds (internalized). Whole-brain analyses revealed greater activation for externalized compared to internalized sound sources in the left superior temporal gyrus, including the planum temporale, the cerebellum and the left posterior cingulate gyrus. Internalized sounds elicited greater relative activity in the left inferior temporal gyrus. Direct comparison between the two externalized conditions revealed stronger left superior temporal gyrus activation for reverberant sounds, while anechoic sounds preferentially activated the right middle temporal gyrus. These findings confirmed the key role of the planum temporale in auditory externalization and the involvement of higher-order brain regions, suggesting broader networks underpinning the perception of sound location.

">Noradrenergic Modulation of an Amygdalo-thalamic Circuit</a></h4>

              
                Emotional and cognitive processing rely on communication between the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The BLA regulates mPFC both directly and indirectly via the medial sub-division of the medial dorsal thalamus (MDm). Although the BLA projection to MDm has been established anatomically, less is known about the functional properties of this synapse. Here, using patch-clamp electrophysiology and optogenetics in ex vivo mouse brain slices, we found that BLA neurons make potent synaptic connections onto MDm neurons capable of evoking action potentials. The site of this BLA input overlaps with strong innervation from locus coeruleus norepinephrine (NE) axons. We found that NE acts via 2-adrenergic receptors to strongly reduce excitatory postsynaptic currents from BLA to MDm. NE also decreases the release probability of BLA axon terminals through a presynaptic mechanism. Postsynaptically, NE depolarizes MDm neurons and increases their tonic firing rates. These findings show that NE, whose levels are elevated during arousal and stress, can suppress transmission of affective information from BLA into MDm, thereby blunting this potent indirect pathway from BLA to mPFC.

">Distinct neurophysiological features and memory representations along the long axis of the developing medial temporal lobe</a></h4>

              
                The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is crucial for episodic memory, whereby posterior MTL preferentially represents visuospatial information, and anterior MTL is involved in the representation of semantic or conceptual information. The neurophysiological underpinnings of content-preferential organization in the developing MTL are largely unknown. Here we utilized rare electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings from 23 pediatric epilepsy patients who completed a visual scene recognition memory task to systematically examine the neurophysiological underpinnings of memory formation along the MTL long axis. The timing of high-frequency activity (HFA, ~70-150 Hz) differed between the posterior and anterior MTL, peaking after scene onset in the posterior MTL and around scene category response (indoor/outdoor scene categorization) in the anterior MTL. Further, in the posterior MTL, HFA was predictive of successful memory formation and positively linked to memory performance, highlighting the importance of posterior MTL HFA to memory formation. In contrast, theta frequency in the anterior MTL was linked to memory performance, and theta-HFA phase-amplitude coupling before scene category responses was predictive of successful memory formation, highlighting the importance of anterior MTL theta oscillations to memory formation. Our findings establish distinct neurophysiological features along the posterior-to-anterior axis of the developing MTL that differentially support the representation of perceptual and conceptual information during memory formation.

">4E-BP2-dependent translational control in GABAergic interneurons is required for long-term memory</a></h4>

              
                mRNA translational repression by eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs), plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity and the formation of long-term memory (LTM). Among the three 4E-BP paralogs, 4E-BP2 is the predominant form expressed in neurons, and its full-body deletion in mice causes memory deficits. Mice lacking 4E-BP2 in GABAergic inhibitory interneurons, but not excitatory neurons, display autistic-like behaviors and deficits in object location and recognition. The specific mRNAs translationally regulated by 4E-BP2 in GABAergic interneurons, and how they contribute to spatial and associative memory, are unknown. Here, we show that conditional knockout (cKO) mice lacking 4E-BP2 selectively in GABAergic interneurons exhibit impairments in long-term spatial and contextual fear memory formation. We further demonstrate that 4E-BP2 deletion controls the translation of selective mRNAs in interneurons without increasing general protein synthesis. One of the mRNAs is Gal, which encodes a neuropeptide that modulates memory. Our findings provide evidence that 4E-BP2 selectively controls the translation of a subset of mRNAs in inhibitory neurons that are required for LTM formation.

">A reference brain for the clonal raider ant</a></h4>

              
                Ants exhibit remarkable collective and social behaviors, such as alloparental care, chemical communication, homing, and cooperative group hygiene. The clonal raider ant Ooceraea biroi is especially well-suited for investigating the neuronal and genetic underpinnings of these behaviors. Unlike most ant species, O. biroi lacks a queen caste. Instead, colonies consist entirely of regular workers and slightly larger intercaste workers. All workers reproduce in synchrony via parthenogenesis, giving rise to age-matched cohorts of clonally identical offspring. This unique life history enables precise experimental control over age, genotype, and colony composition. These features have also facilitated the introduction of genetically encoded calcium indicators into O. biroi, enabling in vivo two-photon imaging to investigate the neural basis of social behaviors. Despite its promise as a neuroscience model, the structure of the clonal raider ant brain has not been systematically characterized, and a representative reference brain does not exist. To address this gap, we imaged the brains of 40 age-matched, genetically identical individuals with confocal microscopy and, using 3D groupwise registration, generated the first reference brain for the species. We introduce a registration pipeline to align brains to this reference, facilitating the comparison of anatomical features across labeling experiments with high spatial precision. Unexpectedly, despite homogeneity in genotype, age, and external morphology, we discovered extensive interindividual variability across our collection of brain samples. This raises the possibility that behavioral division of labor in O. biroi is linked to individual differences in brain structure. This work provides a powerful resource for the emerging clonal raider ant neuroscience community and reveals novel features of the species' neurobiology that may influence social behaviors and colony function.

The study sample included 171 midlife postmenopausal women from the MsBrain I study (mean age = 59.3 years, mean education= 15.7 years, 87.7% white). All participants were cognitively normal, native English speakers, not taking menopausal hormone therapy. Participants completed neuropsychological (California Verbal Learning Test [CVLT]) and neuroimaging assessments, including an fMRI task of verbal encoding and recognition. Findings indicated that during verbal encoding, greater activation of bilateral prefrontal and medial temporal regions, as well as the precuneus, cuneus, caudate, and cerebellar regions, was associated with better performance on CVLT measures, including learning, short- and long-delay recall, and semantic clustering. Functional connectivity from both hippocampi to primarily right prefrontal regions during verbal encoding associated with better CVLT performance. In-scanner word recognition accuracy was more strongly associated with activation of parietal and occipital regions, and with functional connectivity between the right hippocampus and bilateral parietal and temporal regions. Our findings characterize the patterns underlying verbal memory abilities in midlife postmenopausal women. The patterns identified here may act as a foundation for better interpreting the effects of hormonal changes and menopausal symptoms on cognition at midlife, and for identifying neural targets for pharmacological and lifestyle interventions aimed at sustaining women's memory function.

">WFS1E864K in humans and mice causes Wolfram-like syndrome optic atrophy via early axonal mitochondrial dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Wolfram-like syndrome leads to retinal ganglion cell degeneration and vision loss. Wolfram-like syndrome is primarily caused by variants in the WFS1 gene, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum resident transmembrane protein, Wolframin. To date, the disease mechanism remains unclear, and no therapies are available. Here, we generated a mouse model carrying the pathogenic WFS1E864K allele that recapitulated key features of human Wolfram-like syndrome, including bilateral optic atrophy, retinal nerve fiber thinning and lamination of the outer plexiform layer. We demonstrated, using the Wfs1E864K mouse model, that alteration of the protein leads to impairments of retinal ganglion cell function, associated with a thinning of the inner retina layer and nerve fibers. These alterations are associated with myelin disorganization, axonal death, mitochondrial alterations in the axons, and impairment of endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria communication in the soma. Our data showed that primary deficits are localized in the optic nerve before progressing towards the retinal ganglion cell soma. RNAseq analysis identified several altered signaling pathways such as in lipid metabolism, glia activation response, metabolic stress, organelle transport and quality control. These findings highlighted the critical role of Wolframin in optic nerve mitochondrial physiology, providing us with a pertinent model to develop novel innovative therapeutic strategies.

">Slow Intrinsic Oscillations in the Ventrolateral Preoptic nucleus</a></h4>

              
                The ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) of the hypothalamus plays a major role in the induction and consolidation of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. While VLPO neurons are heterogeneous, they often display low-threshold spikes (LTS), a feature that supports rhythmic activity. Nevertheless, rhythmic bursting in these VLPO neurons has never been observed. Here, we report that ~12% of VLPO neurons in a large database of ex vivo patch-clamp recordings display spontaneous rhythmic bursting of action potentials. This activity occurred in putative sleep-promoting neurons, identified by inhibitory responses to noradrenaline (NA), as well as wake-active neurons that were activated by NA. Unsupervised clustering of 24 neurons based on burst properties, electrophysiological, and morphological features revealed three distinct groups: one corresponding to putative sleep-promoting neurons and two wake-active neurons with fast and slow bursting dynamics. Strikingly, membrane potential oscillations persisted in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), indicating that rhythmic bursting is driven by intrinsic mechanisms rather than network activity. These findings suggest that rhythmic bursting is an intrinsic and functionally relevant mode of activity in VLPO neurons, which may contribute to sleep regulation.

">The SNCA A53T mutation sensitizes human neurons and microglia to ferroptosis</a></h4>

              
                The major pathological hallmarks of sporadic and familial forms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are the targeted and progressive loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons (mDA), associated with systemic iron accumulation, a-synuclein (asyn) accumulation and aggregation, and lipid peroxidation amongst other reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Therapeutic strategies aimed towards dopamine restoration, asyn removal and iron chelation have provided symptomatic relief but failed to prevent or slow disease progression. This is in part due to the lack of understanding of the exact pathways leading to neuronal death in PD. In this study, we investigate ferroptosis, a unique cell death mechanism sharing multiple features with PD pathology, as a relevant pathway with implications in disease pathogenesis. We identified an enrichment of ferroptosis genes dysregulated throughout PD postmortem brain samples and several neuronal and glial PD models. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated a rapid iPSC-derived synucleinopathy neuronal model harbouring the SNCA A53T mutation and report increased ROS generation, reduced levels of antioxidant glutathione (GSH), impaired mitophagy and a heightened vulnerability to ferroptosis-induced lipid peroxidation and cell death. Critically, inhibition of the key lipid peroxidation enzyme and driver of ferroptosis, 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO), rescued synucleinopathy associated pathologies and prevented pathological asyn oligomerisation in SNCA A53T neurons. Furthermore, we report enhanced microglial ferroptosis susceptibility in models of synucleinopathy. In summary, we highlight a new mechanism by which the familial PD-associated SNCA A53T mutation causes cell death and propose 15-LO inhibition as a tractable therapeutic opportunity in PD.

">PERINATAL ORGANOPHOSPHATE FLAME RETARDANT EXPOSURE ALTERS ADULT HPA AXIS FUNCTION AND AVOIDANCE BEHAVIOR IN A SEX-SPECIFIC MANNER IN MICE</a></h4>

              
                Organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) are ubiquitous flame-retardant additives with endocrine-disrupting properties. Despite increasing evidence that OPFRs impact neurodevelopment, their effects on the neuroendocrine stress response remain poorly understood. To examine their long-term impact on stress regulation, we treated pregnant C57Bl/6J dams to a mixture of tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP), triphenyl phosphate (TPP), and tricresyl phosphate (TCP; 1 mg/kg each) from gestational day (GD) 7 through postnatal day (PND) 14. Adult offspring (8-9 weeks of age) were then challenged with acute stressors, including 1 h restraint or a 6-day acute variable stress (AVS) paradigm. Perinatal OPFR exposure produced persistent, sex-specific alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and stress-related neurocircuitry. Following 1 h restraint, OPFR-treated females showed heightened serum corticosterone. In addition, gene expression analysis revealed sex-dependent disruptions in key stress-regulatory pathways after OPFR treatment and 1 h restraint in the hypothalamus (Crhr1, Crhr2, Ptpn5) and pituitary (Crhr1, Pomc, Nr3c1). Females demonstrated more differences in adrenal gene expression related to steroidogenesis (Mc2r, Cyp11b2) and catecholamine biosynthesis (Dbh, Pnmt), with OPFR-treated groups having blunted responses. OPFR AVS females displayed reduced corticosterone and downregulated Pacap/Pac1r expression in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), accompanied by increased behavioral avoidance and immobility. In males, OPFR exposure led to increased BNST Pacap and Pac1r, expression, along with hyperactivity and avoidance behaviors. Together, these findings demonstrate that early-life OPFR exposure induces lasting, sex-specific dysregulation of the HPA axis and associated stress circuits, highlighting OPFRs as developmental neuroendocrine disruptors with implications for mood and stress-related disorders.

">Towards decoding inner speech from EEG and MEG</a></h4>

              
                Despite the prevalence of inner speech in everyday life, research on this has been limited, particularly when it comes to non-invasive methods. This preprint aims to fill this gap by using EEG and MEG to collect data from three different inner speech paradigms, and by conducting an initial decoding analysis. Specifically, we tested silent reading, repetitive inner speech, and generative inner speech tasks. We collect a high number of inner speech trials from a few participants. Besides comparing across recording modalities we also compare across inner speech types. Our aim is to analyse the decodability of inner speech within each task and between tasks by the use of transfer learning. We find that in both EEG and MEG, silent reading can be decoded relatively well with 30-40% accuracy across 5 words. However, the decoding performance of both types of inner speech is mostly at chance level. This prohibited further transfer learning investigations between tasks. While the inner speech results are primarily negative, we believe our exploration of data size and various decoding methods is valuable. The dataset itself is useful for the research community as it contains a much larger number of trials within one participant than any other inner speech dataset. Having multiple sessions also allows for testing across-session performance. Finally, we systematically compare silent reading decoding performance within 3 participants across four non-invasive modalities. These are EEG, 2 types of MEG machines, Elekta and CTF, and optically-pumped magnetometers (OPMs). We also compare the spatiotemporal dynamics of silent reading between these modalities. This is especially aimed at validating OPMs as a new kind of non-invasive brain recording technology. We find comparable performance to EEG, but OPM performance did not reach traditional MEG.

">Transposable Element-Mediated Epigenomic Remodeling Drives Erythropoietin-Induced Neurogenesis in the Adult Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which erythropoietin (EPO) is associated with neurogenesis is essential to harness its therapeutic potential for cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we employed single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (snATAC-seq), combined with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), to map the epigenomic and transcriptional landscapes of adult mouse hippocampus under recombinant human EPO (rhEPO) treatment. We discovered significant lineage-specific remodelling of chromatin accessibility predominantly in newly formed pyramidal neurons, highlighting a robust EPO-driven neurogenic response. Notably, transposable elements (TEs), particularly ancient LINEs and SINEs, emerged as critical cis-regulatory elements extensively bound by key neurogenic transcription factors such as NEUROD1/2, FOXG1, and ASCL1. Integrative analyses revealed that these TE-derived regulatory elements orchestrate gene networks involved in neuronal differentiation, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. Our findings highlight a previously unrecognised role of TEs as dynamic regulators in EPO-induced hippocampal re-wiring of gene regulatory networks associated with neurogenesis, establishing a valuable epigenomic resource for advancing therapeutic strategies targeting cognitive deficits and neurodegenerative conditions.

">Harry Potter meets Markov: Neural event representation in the reading network during narrative processing</a></h4>

              
                People segment ongoing information into meaningful mental representations known as events. Recent studies have found a spatio-temporal hierarchy in the event structure during movie watching and story listening. How the human brain segments stories while reading remains unclear. We examined event segmentation while reading Harry Potter using publicly available 3T fMRI data. To identify neural events, we employed a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) within six regions of interest (ROI) in the reading network. The ROIs included the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), angular gyrus (AG), inferior frontal gyrus orbital (IFGorb), anterior temporal lobe (ATL), and posterior temporal lobe (PTL). These regions are also associated with DMN. The results revealed multiple timescales of events, with the IFG and AG representing shorter events, while the IFGorb, ATL, PTL and MFG represent relatively longer events. Boundaries of longer events were partially aligned within short events, suggesting a nested hierarchical event structure. Further comparisons identified associations between neural events and annotations from humans and ChatGPT (automated and less subjective segmentation) in the inferior frontal, temporal and parietal areas. Notably, the AG (a core region of the DMN and memory processing) and the IFG (relevant for language processing) exhibited stronger alignment with both sets of annotations. The findings suggest an important role of AG and IFG in event segmentation in reading. They also confirm the connection between the reading network and the DMN in event segmentation. This connection seems to be linked to the hierarchical processing of context-dependent semantic information during reading.

">Single cell transcriptomics reveals enrichment of aggregation-prone alpha-synuclein isoforms across synucleinopathies</a></h4>

              
                Alpha-synuclein (a-Syn) is the primary component of Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative synucleinopathies, including Parkinsons disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Dysregulated expression of its encoding gene, SNCA, has been identified in association with both PD and DLB in short-read sequencing studies. However, such studies do not capture variation in transcript isoforms expressed. Here we combine for the first time SNCA-targeted long-read multiplexed arrays isoform sequencing (MAS-Iso-seq) with unbiased short-read single nucleus (sn) RNA-seq for simultaneous characterization of the SNCA transcript isoform landscape and mapping of isoform expression to specific cell types and subtypes in PD, DLB, and control sample cortical tissues. This approach enabled discovery of numerous SNCA transcript isoforms displaying novel splicing patterns and incorporating novel exons. We further identified an abundant class of transcript isoforms encoding a previously unreported a-Syn protein variant (a-Syn-115) and displaying increased proportional detection in excitatory neurons of PD and DLB tissues in comparison to controls. The proportion of these isoforms was found to be especially high within several specific glutamatergic neuron subtypes. In-depth characterization of the predicted structural and biochemical properties of a-Syn-115 using an in silico modeling approach revealed a greater aggregative affinity compared with canonical a-Syn-140, suggesting the potential for increased cytosolic a-Syn-115 abundance to induce aggregation between heterogeneous a-Syn isoforms, potentially driving fibril formation and disease progression. Together, our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying a-Syn involvement in multiple synucleinopathies and have translational implications for the development of new precision medicine strategies to combat these diseases, indicating the potential for treatments targeting both specific transcript and protein isoforms, as well as disease-driving cell subtypes.

">Peripheral Inflammation Limits Serotonin Neuron Signaling Capacity via Serotonergic IL-1R1 to Reduce Neuronal Excitability and Enhance Serotonin Clearance</a></h4>

              
                Neurobehavioral disorders, ranging from depression to schizophrenia, have been found to display immune system alterations. The high incidence of comorbidity of these disorders, particularly depression, with chronic inflammatory conditions suggests shared mechanisms contributing to the manifestation of these conditions. We have previously shown that peripheral modulation of the innate immune system in mice rapidly triggers enhanced serotonin (5-HT) clearance in vivo associated with increased anxiety- and despair-like behaviors that can be suppressed by serotonergic elimination of p38 MAPK. Forebrain-projecting 5-HT synthesizing neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN5-HT) play a key role in regulating behaviors related to mood and anxiety and whose perturbations are observed in multiple affective disorders. Here we identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms that can translate peripheral innate immune system activation into changes in 5-HT signaling capacity. Using whole cell patch clamp recordings from acute midbrain slices, we demonstrate that the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1{beta}, acts cell autonomously through its receptor, IL-1R1, via the p38 MAPK signaling pathway to rapidly inhibit firing of DRN5-HT neurons. In the dorsal hippocampus, we found that as with acute, peripheral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration, local injections of IL-1{beta} rapidly enhance 5-HT clearance as assessed by in vivo chronoamperometry. Like IL-1{beta}, TNF also acts via a serotonergic p38 MAPK dependent pathway to reduce excitability of DRN5-HT neurons. Immunocytochemical studies reveal that, IL-1R1, is nonuniformly expressed by DRN5-HT neurons and is required for LPS-induced inhibition of these cells as detected by cFos activation, with sex-dependent patterns evident. Moreover, we detected both DRN5-HT IL-1R1-dependent and -independent LPS-mediated changes in cFos changes in forbrain projection areas. Our findings support a growing appreciation that serotoninergic neurons contribute to changes in CNS physiology and behavior following peripheral immune activation. More specifically, our studies attest to a functional role of serotonergic IL-1R1 in mediating IL-1{beta} following peripheral innate immune activation, effects likely to arise both from changes in diminished 5-HT neuron excitability and elevated 5-HT clearance.

">Age differences in electrocortical dynamics during uneven terrain walking</a></h4>

              
                Walking on uneven terrain becomes more difficult as we age, and gait becomes less automatic. Using mobile brain imaging via high-density electroencephalography (EEG) can provide insight into the neural mechanisms contributing to reduced mobility capability with aging. The objective of this study was to quantify age differences in electrocortical dynamics during uneven terrain walking, both averaged across many strides and variations within a stride. We included 31 young adults and 71 older adults for analysis. All participants walked on an uneven terrain treadmill with four levels of terrain difficulty at their self-selected speed. Compared to younger adults, older adults exhibited a greater increase in step duration variability and mediolateral sacral excursion variability as the terrain became more uneven. We identified multiple brain regions involved during walking on uneven terrain. Regardless of age group, walking on uneven terrain compared to flat terrain led to a widespread change of electrocortical dynamics in the brain, especially in the alpha (8-13Hz) and beta (13-30Hz) band power. In the parieto-occipital region, younger adults experienced a greater reduction in alpha and beta power with increasing terrain unevenness compared to older adults. We also assessed how intra-stride power fluctuations changed with terrain unevenness and age group. Greater intra-stride power spectral fluctuations in the occipital area were associated with greater terrain unevenness for younger adults, but not for older adults. In summary, older adults showed a greater increase in gait variability than younger adults as the terrain became more uneven, but exhibited a lack of modulation of parieto-occipital activity in response to terrain unevenness. The lack of task-related power modulation may suggest reduced cortical network flexibility in older adults. The absence of increased parieto-occipital activity when walking on uneven versus flat surfaces in older adults may also indicate that, unlike younger adults, older adults already heavily rely on visual processes during flat surface walking and may therefore have reduced occipital modulation range remaining to cope with the visuomotor processing demands of walking on uneven surfaces.

">Mesoscale developmental rivalry in human extrastriate visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                In humans and non-human primates, the extrastriate visual cortex contains fine-scale columns selectively responsive to motion, disparity, and color. However, the developmental interplay between these functional modules remains poorly understood. Using high-resolution fMRI, we compared the mesoscale organization of extrastriate cortex in 16 individuals with normal vision and 15 participants with amblyopia (PwA) caused by strabismus (n=8) or anisometropia (n=7). In controls, the cortical territory occupied by disparity-selective columns exhibited a competitive relationship with that of motion- and color-selective columns. Consistent with this pattern, PwA showed a reduction in disparity-selective responses accompanied by enhanced motion- and color-selective activity, as well as expansion of the cortical territory allocated to them. Our results show that the mesoscale modules of the human visual system are rivals in development allowing intact functions to usurp those that are compromised.

">Refining RDoC Using Individual-Level Task fMRI Factor Models Reveals Reproducible Brain-wide Motifs</a></h4>

              
                The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework was introduced to guide psychiatric research using biologically grounded, dimensional constructs of mental function. However, its current hierarchical domain structure remains largely unvalidated against individual-level brain imaging data. Building on our prior group-level work showing that data-driven bifactor models outperform RDoC-based models, we applied a multi-stage validation framework to Human Connectome Project (HCP) task fMRI data to test whether individual-level, empirically derived models more accurately reflect the intrinsic organization and behavioral relevance of brain activity. Using confirmatory factor analysis in two independent cohorts, we found that individual-level, data-driven bifactor models consistently outperformed RDoC-based models across multiple fit indices in both training and validation sets. The general factor derived from these models revealed a reproducible macroscale gradient spanning visual-attentional to auditory-default mode networks, aligning with canonical resting-state gradients and supporting its interpretation as a domain-general axis of large-scale brain organization. Applying community detection to subject-specific factor representations revealed four spatial motifs whose centroids corresponded to interpretable brain systems and were robustly reproduced across cohorts. Similarity to these centroids predicted individual task performance in working memory and relational reasoning, as measured by both raw accuracy and latent performance factors. To further assess organizational validity, we applied Mapper-a topological data analysis method-to contrast maps, generating unsupervised graph representations of task-evoked brain activity. Mapper graphs annotated with data-driven centroids showed greater modularity than those annotated with RDoC domains, suggesting that the data-driven framework better captures the topological structure of individual functional brain states. Together, these findings demonstrate that individual-level, data-driven factor models provide a more accurate, interpretable, and behaviorally relevant account of brain organization than the current RDoC framework. By modeling inter-individual variability directly from neuroimaging data, this approach advances precision neuroscience and supports the empirical refinement of dimensional psychiatric frameworks such as RDoC.

">Error-Related Memory Biases Are Specific to Social Stimuli for Socially Anxious Individuals</a></h4>

              
                Social anxiety (SA) is associated with enhanced error monitoring, yet underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Consistent with cognitive models of SA, we propose that stronger error monitoring contributes to SA by strengthening memory encoding of errors (including relevant social cues), negatively biasing what is remembered. Supporting this hypothesis, our prior work demonstrated that high SA individuals exhibit better memory for faces presented during error (vs. correct) trials. To test whether this Memory Bias for Error Events is specific to social stimuli, 140 participants completed a Flanker task with trial-unique faces (social) or objects (non-social) as background images, followed by a surprise memory test. Results revealed that higher SA symptoms were associated with enhanced memory for faces on error (vs. correct) trials, but not for objects. These findings replicate and extend our prior work, demonstrating that SA-related memory biases for errors are specific to social stimuli, rather than reflecting general encoding biases.

">HIF1α-dependent induction of the T-Type calcium channel CaV3.2 mediates hypoxia-induced neuronal hyperexcitability</a></h4>

              
                Post-stroke epilepsy (PSE) is a major cause of acquired epilepsy in adults, yet the molecular mechanisms linking post-ischemic hypoxia to neuronal hyperexcitability remain poorly understood. The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) is a central mediator of the cellular response to hypoxia and may contribute to epileptogenesis by regulating ion channel expression. Here, we identify the T-type calcium channel CaV3.2 (encoded by Cacna1h) as a direct transcriptional target of HIF1 and demonstrate its role in hypoxia-induced network hyperexcitability. Using neuronal cell lines, primary cortical neurons, and organotypic brain slice cultures (OTCs) from mouse and human tissue, we show that HIF1 activation, either through hypoxia or HIF1 overexpression, consistently increases Cacna1h expression. In NS20Y cells, overexpression of a normoxia-stable HIF1 variant increased Cacna1h promoter activity in both fluorescent and dual-luciferase reporter assays. The same effect was observed in primary cortical neurons, where HIF1 overexpression also elevated network activity measured by multielectrode array recordings. In murine and human OTCs, hypoxia led to marked increase of HIF1 and Cacna1h expression at both transcript and protein levels. Furthermore, oxygen-glucose deprivation followed by reoxygenation (OGD/R) induced a persistent increase in neuronal firing rate, which was recapitulated by HIF1 overexpression alone. Together, these results establish HIF1 as a key transcriptional regulator of CaV3.2 in neurons and reveal a conserved hypoxia-HIF1-CaV3.2 pathway that enhances neuronal excitability. This mechanism may underlie hypoxia-induced network hyperactivity and contribute to the pathogenesis of post-ischemic epileptogenesis.

">Functional MRI signals as fast as 1Hz are coupled to brain states and predict spontaneous neural activity</a></h4>

              
                fMRI signals were traditionally seen as slow and sampled in the order of seconds, but recent technological advances have enabled much faster sampling rates. We hypothesized that high-frequency fMRI signals can capture spontaneous neural activity that index brain states. Using fast fMRI (TR=378ms) and simultaneous EEG in 27 humans drifting between sleep and wakefulness, we found that fMRI spectral power increased during NREM sleep (compared to wakefulness) across several frequency ranges as fast as 1Hz. This fast fMRI power was correlated with canonical arousal-linked EEG rhythms (alpha and delta), with spatiotemporal correlation patterns for each rhythm reflecting a combination of shared arousal dynamics and rhythm-specific neural signatures. Using machine learning, we found that alpha and delta EEG rhythms can be decoded from fast fMRI signals, in subjects held-out from the training set, showing that fMRI as fast as 0.9Hz (alpha) and 0.7Hz (delta) contains reliable neurally-coupled information that generalizes across individuals. Finally, we demonstrate that this fast fMRI acquisition allows for EEG rhythms to be decoded from 3.8s windows of fMRI data. These results reveal that high-frequency fMRI signals are coupled to dynamically varying brain states, and that fast fMRI sampling allows for more temporally precise quantification of spontaneous neural activity than previously thought possible.

">Comparison of T1- and T2-weighted MRI contrasts of ex vivo ex situ brains fixed with solutions used in gross anatomy laboratories</a></h4>

              
                Post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers high resolution and histological correlation, so protocols have been developed by brain banks using hemispheres fixed by immersion in Neutral-buffered formalin (NBF), but they provide limited tissue samples. Conversely, anatomy laboratories could supply complete brains perfused either with a salt-saturated (SSS) or an alcohol-formaldehyde (AFS) solution. These fixation methods alter the brain's molecular properties, potentially affecting MRI quality and structural characteristics. T1- and T2-weighted (T1w, T2w) contrasts change with NBF fixation, but the effects of SSS or AFS remain unknown. We compared T1w and T2w intensities of different regions of interest (ROIs), including subcortical white matter (WM), cortical and deep gray matter (GM), in brains fixed with NBF, SSS and AFS. We scanned 20 ex situ hemispheres (NBF-immersed=7; SSS-perfused=7; AFS-perfused=6) in a 3T MRI scanner using T1w (0.7mm3) and T2w (0.64mm3) sequences overnight. Mean intensities of 29 ROIs in T1w and T2w MRIs and GM-WM ratios were calculated and compared in brains fixed with the three solutions. We found that T1w images were more affected by the fixation process, inverting the contrast of in vivo T1w and reducing the GM-WM contrast in AFS-fixed brains. T2w images resembled in vivo scans and maintained a sharp contrast in brains fixed with the three solutions, although the GM-WM intensity ratios were lowered in SSS-fixed brains. In conclusion, brains fixed with SSS and AFS from anatomy laboratories could be used for MRI studies, especially with the T2w sequence that seems more appropriate for structural analyses in different ROIs.

">Pragmatic representations of self- and others action in the monkey putamen</a></h4>

              
                Social coordination in primates relies on parieto-frontal networks encoding self- and others actions. These areas send convergent projections to the putamen, but its role in representing self- and others actions remains unknown. We recorded neuronal activity from anatomically characterized putamen regions during a Mutual Action Task (MAT), where a monkey and a human took turns grasping a multi-affordance object based on sensory cues. Cortico-striatal synaptic input, indexed by local field potentials, mirrored known cortical dynamics during sensory instructions and movement, while single neurons selectively encoded the monkey s action, the human s action, or both. Grip type was encoded only during the monkey s trials. Viewing the partner s action was neither necessary nor sufficient: neurons fired even when the partner s action occurred in darkness, but not when viewed through a transparent barrier. These findings support a pragmatic role for the putamen in gating cortical representations of self- and other s actions in social contexts

">Dynamic electrocortical states and paradoxical complexity during desflurane anesthesia</a></h4>

              
                Background: How general anesthesia alters the dynamics of electrocortical activity is crucial to understand the neural mechanisms of unconsciousness. Local cortical activity undergoes spontaneous transitions at constant anesthetic concentration. The spatial organization and temporal dynamics of state transitions in large-scale electrocortical activity is incompletely understood. Methods: Epidural electrocorticogram was recorded from the right hemisphere in 8 rats (14 experiments) using chronically implanted 32-channel flexible electrode arrays during desflurane anesthesia at 6%, 4%, 2%, 0% inhaled concentrations, each maintained for 1 hour. Cortical states were identified by principal component analysis of power spectrograms followed by density-based clustering simultaneously across all anesthetic conditions. State-specific spatiotemporal complexity was quantified by the normalized Lempel-Ziv algorithm to capture signal variability beyond spectral effects. Temporal dynamics were assessed by state occurrence, dwell times, and transition probabilities. Results: Seven cortical states were identified. Six states generally tracked anesthetic depth with an increase in delta power and decrease in complexity, but their occurrence was not tied to any anesthetic level (p<0.001). The 7th state was a paradoxical, activated state that mostly occurred during deep anesthesia and was marked by reduced delta (p<0.001) and elevated complexity (p<0.001). Cortical activity was more likely to remain in a given state than to switch (mean dwell time of 136.55 s, persistence likelihood of 99.36%). When transitions occurred, they followed structured, non-random dynamics, primarily within light- or deep-anesthesia states (FDR-corrected p<0.05), with a mild tendency to exit deep states and enter light states (p=0.0039), consistent with anesthetic emergence. Conclusions: Electrocortical activity is not a unitary function of anesthetic concentration but involves spontaneous dynamics and paradoxically activated states with increased global complexity during deep anesthesia. The results suggest ongoing spontaneous reorganization of cortical activity during prolonged anesthetic challenge and provide new insight into anesthesia-induced brain dynamics that may inform future strategies for monitoring and manipulating the state of consciousness and facilitating recovery from general anesthesia.

">Data-Driven Reduced Modeling of Recurrent Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                Artificial Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are widely used in neuroscience to model the collective activity of neurons during behavioral tasks. The high dimensionality of their parameter and activity spaces, however, often make it challenging to infer and interpret the fundamental features of their dynamics. In this study, we employ recent nonlinear dynamical system techniques to uncover the core dynamics of several RNNs used in contemporary neuroscience. Specifically, using a data-driven approach, we identify Spectral Submanifolds (SSMs), i.e., low-dimensional attracting invariant manifolds tangent to the eigenspaces of fixed points. The internal dynamics of SSMs serve as nonlinear models that reduce the dimensionality of the full RNNs by orders of magnitude. Through low-dimensional, SSM-reduced models, we give mathematically precise definitions of line and ring attractors, which are intuitive concepts commonly used to explain decision-making and working memory. The new level of understanding of RNNs obtained from SSM reduction enables the interpretation of mathematically well-defined and robust structures in neuronal dynamics, leading to novel predictions about the neural computations underlying behavior.

">Preclinical Development of a Vectorized Artificial miRNA Gene Therapy for Tauopathies</a></h4>

              
                Tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease, are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation of microtubule-associated protein tau, which is closely linked to cognitive decline. Reduction of tau is a potential and promising strategy for addressing tau-linked brain disorders. We report the development of a therapeutic approach using adeno-associated virus mediated delivery of an artificial microRNA targeting human tau. In a tauopathy mouse model, we demonstrate that a one-time intra-cisterna magna administration of vector resulted in reduced total tau, decreased pathological tau seeds, fewer tau inclusions, and amelioration of tau-related neuropathology. Notably, intervention at late disease stages, after onset of tau deposition and neurodegeneration, improved quality of life and extended survival. We further demonstrated the durability of therapeutic benefit and defined the minimally effective dose in tauopathy mice. These findings provide preclinical support for the advancement of a vectorized tau-lowering strategy as a disease-modifying approach for tauopathies and enable progression towards an investigational new drug application.

">Designing a Model to Detect Beta Burst in EEG Using Nonlinear Dynamic Features Based on Machine Learning</a></h4>

              
                Background: Beta bursts are brief, transient increases in beta-band (13 to 30 Hz) EEG activity that play a key role in motor control, particularly in processes like movement initiation and inhibition. While most existing methods detect these bursts using simple amplitude thresholds, they often ignore variability in burst duration and task context. More advanced techniques exist but are computationally demanding, often opaque, and dependent on large datasets and strong modeling assumptions. Objectives: This study aims to develop an automated, machine learning based approach to classify beta bursts using nonlinear dynamic features, considering both burst duration and task condition. Method: EEG data were collected from 26 healthy, right-handed participants during three motor tasks: (1) a right-hand isometric pinch grip at 10% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), (2) rhythmic right-hand finger opening closing in response to auditory cues (3 4 seconds), and (3) the same right-hand opening closing task and concurrent with a steady left-hand isometric pinch grip at 10% MVC. Beta bursts were extracted from the left motor cortex, categorized by duration (short, medium, long), and time-locked to task events. From each burst, four nonlinear features, Fractal Dimension (FD), Wavelet Entropy (WE), Sample Entropy (SE), and Nonlinear Energy Operator (NEO) were calculated to train machine learning (ML) models. Results: Statistical tests and feature selection revealed that FD, SE, and WE varied significantly with burst duration and task type, while NEO was more limited in sensitivity. ML models trained on these features achieved up to 91.1% validation and 85.7% test accuracy, especially when distinguishing bursts of different durations within the same task. Conclusions: These findings suggest that beta bursts reflect structured, task-specific neural dynamics rather than random fluctuations. By using nonlinear features and ML, we introduce a scalable, interpretable framework for burst classification that outperforms traditional methods. This approach advances the understanding of transient beta activity and holds promise for real-time neural decoding in neuroscience and neurotechnology.

">Examining oculomotor behavior in central vision loss with a gaze-contingent display</a></h4>

              
                Patients with central vision loss due to macular degeneration (MD) must rely on their peripheral vision for tasks normally performed by the fovea. Many patients develop a preferred retinal locus (PRL), an eccentric retinal location used as a substitute for the damaged fovea in tasks such as face recognition, navigation, and reading. However, the mechanisms underlying PRL development remain elusive, and no single hypothesis fully explains its characteristics. Investigations into PRL development are hindered by oculomotor assessments, which often focus on fixation ability while neglecting other eye movement characteristics and potentially conflating different behaviors over time. In previous work, we introduced a series of oculomotor metrics in cases of simulated central vision loss, demonstrating that complex profiles of eye movement behavior can be extracted from a simple visual task. Here we present longitudinal data from 10 patients with MD as evidence of the feasibility of using these metrics to characterize different profiles of eye movements following central vision loss. Consistent with findings in healthy individuals using artificial scotoma, the metrics reveal substantial individual differences in behavior, both at baseline and after visual training. Overall, patients exhibit significantly higher saccadic re-referencing than controls, despite larger inter-individual differences. These metrics provide a detailed evaluation of oculomotor behavior in patients with central vision loss and offer a valuable tool for assessing progress in training protocols.

We tested the hypothesis that exercise-induced changes in cardiorespiratory fitness and leg strength would improve WM-related brain activity, which subsequently would improve WM performance. This study was based on the Umeå HIT study, a randomized controlled trial assessing the effects of watt-controlled supramaximal high-intensity interval training (HIT) versus moderate-intensity training for nonexercising older adults (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span> = 68). A subsample (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 43, 66 to 79 years, 56% females) underwent task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging, testing WM. The outcomes of interest were change in WM performance, WM task activation, cardiorespiratory fitness, and leg strength. For WM performance, we found no significant between-group difference in change; however, there was a significant within-group increase for HIT in WM composites. For HIT, changes in leg strength significantly predicted increased right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation, which in turn predicted improved in-scanner WM task performance. Cardiorespiratory fitness did not predict WM-related functional change. These results indicate a specific physiological ingredient, namely leg strength gains, that is a potential mechanism in exercise-induced prefrontal activation and WM performance increases.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Retrieval-induced forgetting is a phenomenon whereby retrieving certain memories can impair the recall of related information. We tested the hypothesis that inhibitory mechanisms play a pivotal role in retrieval-induced forgetting, applying transcranial magnetic stimulation to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, an area involved in inhibitory control, while participants retrieved memory associations. Participants learned a series of word pairs, then completed an interference task where they learned directly conflicting associations, or semantically related associates. A train of transcranial magnetic stimulation pulses was applied to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Experiment 1) or the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Experiment 2) during retrieval of the interfering pairs, beginning 200 ms after stimulus onset. Participants showed robust retrieval-induced forgetting for the original pairs after retrieving conflicting associations, which was reduced when transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared with a control brain site. This effect was specific to conflicting memories and did not extend to semantically related interference, indicating the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex’s critical role in inhibitory processes during retrieval. Transcranial magnetic stimulation administered to the homologous left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex had no effect on forgetting. These findings provide strong evidence for the involvement of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in managing retrieval competition within an early time window (200 to 533 ms) and highlight its importance in memory control.</span>

                <p>Perception is shaped by both the physical properties of stimuli and their contextual presentation, often leading to systematic biases such as the central tendency effect, where perceptual judgments shift toward the average of the stimulus set. This study explored the central tendency bias in vibrotactile perception, an area that has received limited attention while also replicating its well-documented occurrence in color perception to validate previous findings. Using a within-subject design, participants (5 males, 15 females) completed color and vibrotactile discrimination tasks, each consisting of three blocks, which comprised systematically shifted stimulus sets. In an established virtual reality color task, stimuli ranged from yellow&ndash;green to blue&ndash;green, while in the vibrotactile task, stimuli varied in vibration intensity around a baseline distribution. As predicted, the point of subjective equality shifted toward the mean of the stimulus sets in both tasks, confirming the presence of a central tendency bias. These findings demonstrate that perception of both color and vibrotactile intensity is not determined solely based on the physical properties of the stimulus per se, but it is rather influenced by the distribution of the presented stimuli, underscoring the pervasive role of contextual factors in shaping sensory judgments.</p>

                Background Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) can occur in patients with tuberculosis. The purpose of this research was to develop an early detection system for MDD and conduct an accuracy test. Methods The MOODMIND application uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) with sentiment analysis techniques. MOODMIND offers both speech and text options and is available in Indonesian/English. The screening results were compared with those of the doctor’s autoanamnesis test. Single blinding is used so that doctors are unaware of the application test. Results The app asks open- and closed-ended questions for MDD identification based on the DSM-5. The test results were divided into non-depressive (none or at-risk) and suspected depression groups. MOODMIND showed 67% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Conclusions Ease is advantageous because the steps are simple. MOODMIND has sufficient accuracy, but it can be improved by adding words related to depression in the lexicon adjustment.

                Introduction Hospital staff’s perception of oral health directly impacts their overall oral health-related well-being (OHRQoL) and their job performance. This study seeks to analyze the relationship between these two dimensions, providing information for designing strategies that promote a healthier work environment. Aim To determine the relationship between oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and oral health perceptions in the staff of a level II-1 hospital located in northern Peru. Methods The study had a quantitative approach, with a cross-sectional, applied, and correlational design. Seventy-two participants participated. The validated OHIP-14 and HU-DBI questionnaires were used, with reliability coefficients of 0.847 and 0.804, respectively. Spearman’s correlation coefficient, appropriate for ordinal variables, was used for data analysis. Results A statistically significant association was found between health-related quality of life and subjective perception of oral status (Rho = 0.391, p < 0.05), with an explained variance of 19.8% according to Nagelkerke’s pseudo R-squared. The most frequently associated quality of life dimensions were physical disability (Rho = 0.319; p < 0.05) and social disability (Rho = 0.242; p < 0.05). Excellent quality of life was the most prevalent (38.9%), while poor oral health was the most common (52.8%). Conclusion The findings show a significant relationship between self-perceived oral health and oral health-related quality of life in this group of professionals. Promoting oral health strategies tailored to the hospital setting is recommended to improve workplace well-being.

                Introduction During the postmenopausal period, hyperandrogenic manifestations include hirsutism and variable degrees of virilization. Metabolic syndrome is often associated. True hirsutism and acne should not be considered normal as they may reveal tumorous sources of excessive androgen secretion originating from either the adrenals or the ovaries. Once adrenal causes are excluded, virilizing ovarian tumors must be considered, with Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor being the most common histological subtype. Cases presentations We report the observations of three female patients who presented with post-menopausal hyperandrogenism of ovarian origin during the year 2023, with details on clinical presentation, lab results, and aspects found both on ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. They all underwent surgery and two of them were diagnosed with Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors. Conclusion Postmenopausal hyperandrogenism, though rare, requires thorough assessment to avoid misdiagnosis of underlying androgen-secreting tumors, with Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors being the predominant subtype. Surgical intervention is the primary treatment modality, often resulting in complete postoperative recovery.

                Background The major component of patchouli oil, patchouli alcohol, is used as fixative and has antimicrobial activity. The function of other components, such as α-guaiene, remains unknown. Therefore, this study reports the antifungal activity of α-guaiene isolated from patchouli oil against for pathogenic fungi: Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans ATCC 7102, Microsporum gypseum ATCC 14683, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes ATCC 16404. Methods The material from fraction (249°C-254°C) had the highest α-guaiene. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) were determined using the microdilution technique to evaluate antifungal activity, with n-hexane and medium serving as negative controls, and ketoconazole and fluconazole serving as positive controls. Results The results showed that the MIC and MFC value were determined at 45%, 50% for C. albicans, 55%, 60% for A. niger, 50%, 60% for M. gypseum, and 95%, 100% for T. mentagrophytes, respectively. Positive and medium controls demonstrated no microbial growth, whereas negative and growth controls revealed the presence of microorganisms. Fungus resistance to α-guaiene T. mentagrophytes exhibited the highest MIC value. Conclusions Overall, this study reveals that α-guaiene is a promising agent effective against the studied pathogenic fungi.

                Background Plectranthus amboinicus is an aromatic herb known for its medicinal properties and is increasingly explored for cosmetic applications. Its bioactive compounds possess antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a promising candidate for multifunctional skincare formulations. Methods This study investigated the extraction of bioactive compounds from P. amboinicus leaves using microwave-assisted ethanol extraction. Two drying techniques—tray drying and freeze-drying—were compared to evaluate their impact on the extraction efficiency. The optimal extract (PF15), prepared using 15-minute microwave extraction and freeze-drying, was selected for further analysis. Bioactive content was assessed through quantification of caffeic acid, total phenolic content, and antioxidant activity via the DPPH assay. The antimicrobial activity of PF15 was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Cutibacterium acnes. Anti-inflammatory potential of PF15 was evaluated in LPS-stimulated human THP-1 macrophages by measuring cytokine production. Results The PF15 extract yielded the highest levels of bioactive compounds and demonstrated strong antioxidant activity. It exhibited significant antimicrobial effects against all tested skin pathogens. In the anti-inflammatory assay, PF15 significantly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) while upregulating the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The extract was formulated into a topical cream, which underwent accelerated stability testing over six heat-cool cycles. The cream remained stable with no signs of phase separation, discoloration, odor change, or microbial contamination, and maintained a pH of 5.5. Conclusions The PF15 extract of P. amboinicus demonstrates potent antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties. Its successful incorporation into a stable cream formulation supports its potential as a multifunctional active ingredient in skincare products. These findings highlight P. amboinicus as a valuable natural source for the development of cosmetic formulations targeting oxidative stress, microbial infection, and inflammation.

                <p>by Feng Fu, Ran Zhuo, Xingru Chen</p>

Declines in vaccination coverage for vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles and chickenpox, have enabled their surprising comebacks and pose significant public health challenges in the wake of growing vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine opt-outs and refusals are often fueled by beliefs concerning perceptions of vaccine effectiveness and exaggerated risks. Here, we quantify the impact of competing beliefs – vaccine-averse versus vaccine-neutral – on social imitation dynamics of vaccination, alongside the epidemiological dynamics of disease transmission. These beliefs may be pre-existing and fixed, or coevolving attitudes. This interplay among beliefs, behaviors, and disease dynamics demonstrates that individuals are not perfectly rational; rather, they base their vaccine uptake decisions on beliefs, personal experiences, and social influences. We find that the presence of a small proportion of fixed vaccine-averse beliefs can significantly exacerbate the vaccination dilemma, making the tipping point in the hysteresis loop more sensitive to changes in individuals’ perceived costs of vaccination and vaccine effectiveness. However, in scenarios where competing beliefs spread concurrently with vaccination behavior, their double-edged impact can lead to self-correction and alignment between vaccine beliefs and behaviors. The results show that coevolution of vaccine beliefs and behaviors makes populations more sensitive to abrupt changes in perceptions of vaccine cost and effectiveness compared to scenarios without beliefs. Our work provides valuable insights into harnessing the social contagion of even vaccine-neutral attitudes to overcome vaccine hesitancy.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013585">Social inequalities in vaccine coverage and their effects on epidemic spreading</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Adriana Manna, Marton Karsai, Nicola Perra</p>

Vaccinations are fundamental public health interventions. Yet, inequalities in vaccine uptake across socioeconomic groups can significantly undermine their impact. Moreover, heterogeneities in vaccination coverage across socioeconomic strata are typically neglected by epidemic models and considered, if at all, only at posteriori. This limitation reduces their ability to predict and assess the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns. Here, we study the impact of socioeconomic inequalities in vaccination uptake on disease burden, measured as attack rate. We consider a modeling framework based on generalized contact matrices that extend traditional age-stratified approaches to incorporate socioeconomic status (SES) variables. We simulate epidemic dynamics under two scenarios. In the first, vaccination campaigns are concurrent with epidemics. In the second, instead, vaccinations are completed before the onset of infection waves. By using both synthetic and empirical generalized contact matrices, we find that inequalities in vaccine uptake can lead to non-linear effects on disease outcomes and exacerbate disease burden in disadvantaged groups of the population. We demonstrate that simpler models ignoring SES heterogeneity produce incomplete or biased predictions of attack rates. Additionally, we show how inequalities in vaccine coverage interact with non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), compounding differences across subgroups. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of integrating SES dimensions, alongside age, into epidemic models to inform more equitable and effective public health interventions and vaccination strategies.

Antibodies are indispensable components of the immune system, known for their specific binding to antigens. Beyond their natural immunological functions, they are fundamental in developing vaccines and therapeutic interventions for infectious diseases. The complex architecture of antibodies, particularly their variable regions responsible for antigen recognition, presents significant challenges for computational modeling. Recent advancements in deep learning have markedly improved protein structure prediction; however, accurately modeling antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) interactions remains challenging due to the inherent flexibility of antibodies and the dynamic nature of binding processes. In this study, we examine the use of predicted Local Distance Difference Test (pLDDT) scores as indicators of residue and side-chain flexibility to model Ab-Ag interactions through a fingerprint-based approach. We demonstrate the significance of flexibility in different antibody-specific tasks, enhancing the predictive accuracy of Ab-Ag interaction models by 4%, resulting in an AUC-ROC of 92%. In addition, we showcase state-of-the-art performance in paratope prediction. These results emphasize the importance of accounting for conformational flexibility in modeling antibody-antigen interactions and show that pLDDT can serve as a coarse proxy for these dynamic features. By optimizing antibody flexibility using pLDDT, they can be engineered to improve affinity or breadth for a specific target. This approach is particularly beneficial for addressing highly variable pathogens like HIV and SARS-CoV-2, as greater flexibility enhances tolerance to sequence variations in target antigens.

Metabolic models condense biochemical knowledge about organisms in a structured and standardised way. As large-scale network reconstructions are readily available for many organisms, genome-scale models are being widely used among modellers and engineers. However, these large models can be difficult to analyse and visualise, and occasionally generate predictions that are hard to interpret or even biologically unrealistic. Of the thousands of enzymatic reactions in a typical bacterial metabolism, only a few hundred form the metabolic pathways essential to produce energy carriers and biosynthetic precursors. These pathways carry relatively high flux, are central to maintaining and reproducing the cell, and provide precursors and energy to engineered metabolic pathways. Focusing on these central metabolic subsystems, we present <i>i</i>CH360, a manually curated medium-scale model of energy and biosynthesis metabolism for the well-studied bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12 MG1655. The model is a sub-network of the most recent genome-scale reconstruction, <i>i</i>ML1515, and comes with an updated layer of database annotations and a range of metabolic maps for visualisation. We enriched the stoichiometric network with extensive biological information and quantitative data, including thermodynamic and kinetic constants, enhancing the scope and applicability of the model. In addition, we assess the properties of this model in comparison to its genome-scale parent and demonstrate the use of the network and supporting data in various scenarios, including enzyme-constrained flux balance analysis, elementary flux mode analysis, and thermodynamic analysis. Overall, this model holds the potential to become a reference medium-scale metabolic model for <i>E. coli</i>.

Characterizing protein families’ structural and functional diversity is essential for understanding their biological roles. Traditional analyses often focus on primary and secondary structures, which may not fully capture complex protein interactions. Here we introduce InteracTor, a novel toolkit that extracts multimodal features from protein three-dimensional (3D) structures, including interatomic interactions like hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic contacts. By integrating eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, we quantified the importance of the extracted features in the classification of protein structural and functional families. InteracTor’s interpref features enable mechanistic insights into the determinants of protein structure, function, and dynamics, offering a transparent means to assess their predictive power within machine learning models. Interatomic interaction features extracted by InteracTor demonstrated superior predictive power for protein family classification compared to features based solely on primary or secondary structure, revealing the importance of considering specific tertiary contacts in computational protein analysis. This work provides a robust framework for future studies aiming to enhance the capabilities of models for protein function prediction and drug discovery.

                <p>by Anindya Ghosh, Sarah Nicholas, Karin Nordstrom, Thomas Nowotny, James Knight</p>

Many animals use visual motion cues to track and pursue small, fast-moving targets, such as prey or conspecifics. In target-pursuing insects, including dragonflies and hoverflies, Small Target Motion Detector (STMD) neurons are found in the optic lobes and are believed to be presynaptic to Target Selective Descending Neurons (TSDNs) that project to motor command centres. While STMDs respond robustly to target motion – even when displayed against moving backgrounds – TSDN target responses are modulated by background motion. Depending on whether the background motion is syn- or contra-directional to the target motion, the response of the TSDNs is either suppressed or facilitated (amplified). This suggests that TSDNs not only receive input from STMDs but also from neurons sensitive to background motion, but this neural circuit is not clearly understood. To explore the underlying neural mechanisms, we developed three candidate TSDN circuit models – which combine input from bio-plausible STMDs and optic flow-sensitive Lobula Plate Tangential Cells (LPTCs) in different ways – and fitted them to published electrophysiology data from hoverfly TSDNs. We then tested the best-fitting models against new electrophysiological data using different background patterns. We found that the overall best model suggests simple inhibition from LPTCs with the same preferred direction as the STMDs feeding into the TSDN. This parsimonious mechanism can explain the facilitation and suppression of TSDN responses to small targets, and may inform similar studies in other animals.

Background and aim <p>To prevent the spread of infectious diseases, successful interventions require early detection. The timing of implementation of preventive measures is crucial, but as outbreaks are hard to anticipate, control efforts often start too late. This applies to mosquito-borne diseases, for which the multifaceted nature of transmission complicates surveillance. Resilience indicators have been studied as a generic, model-free early warning method. However, the large data requirements limit their use in practice. In the present study, we compare the performance of multivariate indicators of resilience, combining the information contained in multiple data sources, to the performance of univariate ones focusing on one single time series. Additionally, by comparing various monitoring scenarios, we aim to find which data sources are the most informative as early warnings.</p> Methods and results <p>West Nile virus was used as a case study due to its complex transmission cycle with different hosts and vectors interacting. A synthetic dataset was generated using a compartmental model under different monitoring scenarios, including data-poor scenarios. Multivariate indicators of resilience relied on different data reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and Max Autocorrelation Factor analysis (MAF). Multivariate indicators outperformed univariate ones, especially in data-poor scenarios such as reduced resolution or observation probabilities. This finding held across the different monitoring scenarios investigated. In the explored system, species that were more involved in the transmission cycle or preferred by the mosquitoes were not more informative for early warnings.</p> Implications <p>Overall, these results indicate that combining multiple data sources into multivariate indicators can help overcome the challenges of data requirements for resilience indicators. The final decision should be based on whether the additional effort is worth the gain in prediction performance. Future studies should confirm these findings in real-world data and estimate the sensitivity, specificity, and lead time of multivariate resilience indicators.</p>

The prefrontal—hippocampal—entorhinal system is perhaps the most widely-studied circuit in cognitive and systems neuroscience, due to its role in supporting cognitive functions such as working memory and decision-making. Disrupted communication within this circuit is a key feature of disorders such as schizophrenia and dementia. Nucleus reuniens (NRe) is a midline thalamic nucleus that sits at the nexus of this circuit, linking these regions together. As there are no direct projections from prefrontal cortex to hippocampus (HPC), the accepted model is that the NRe mediates prefrontal drive of hippocampal activity, although these connections are poorly defined at the cellular and synaptic level. Using <i>ex vivo</i> optogenetics and electrophysiology in both mice and rats, alongside monosynaptic circuit-tracing, we sought to test the mechanisms through which NRe could drive hippocampal activity. Unexpectedly, we found no evidence that pyramidal cells in CA1 receive input from NRe, with midline thalamic input to HPC proper appearing selective for GABAergic interneurons. In other regions targeted by NRe, we found that pyramidal cells in prosubiculum and subiculum received synaptic inputs from NRe that were at least an order of magnitude weaker than those in prefrontal or entorhinal cortices. We conclude that, contrary to widely-held assumptions in the field, the hippocampal pyramidal cells are not a major target of NRe.

Genome-wide association studies have revealed that the genetic architectures of complex traits vary widely, including in terms of the numbers, effect sizes, and allele frequencies of significant hits. However, at present we lack a principled way of understanding the similarities and differences among traits. Here, we describe a probabilistic model that combines the effects of mutation, drift, and stabilizing selection at individual sites with a genome-scale model of phenotypic variation. In this model, the architecture of a trait arises from the distribution of selection coefficients of mutations and from two scaling parameters. We fit this model for 95 highly polygenic quantitative traits of different kinds from the UK Biobank. Notably, we infer that all these traits have fairly similar, though not identical, distributions of selection coefficients. This similarity suggests that differences in architectures of highly polygenic traits arise mainly from the two scaling parameters: the mutational target size and heritability per site, which vary by orders of magnitude among traits. When these two scale factors are accounted for, we find that the architectures of all 95 traits are very similar.

Astrocytes comprise ~50% of all brain cells and present distinct morphological, molecular and functional properties in different brain regions. In glioblastoma (GBM), an aggressive primary brain tumor, astrocytes become activated and tumor-associated astrocytes (TAAs) exhibit different transcriptomic profiles, morphology, and functions supporting disease progression. Heterogeneity and specific roles of TAAs within various regions of tumors are poorly known. Advancements of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics allow to profile tumors at unprecedented resolution revealing cell phenotypes, hidden functionalities, and spatial architecture in disease-specific context. We combined spatial transcriptomics and multiple immunofluorescent staining to visualize TAAs heterogeneity and location of various subpopulations in three intracranial murine glioma models. Using distinct gene expression profiles, we identified subtypes of TAAs with distinct localization and inferred their specialized functionalities. Gene signatures associated with TAAs reflected their reprograming in the tumor microenvironment (TME), revealed their multiple roles and potential contributing factors shaping the local milieu. Using spatial correlation analysis of the spots, we inferred the interactome of <i>Slc1a2</i> (encoding a glutamate transporter) with the other markers of TAAs based on segregated areas of the tumor. The designer RGD peptide that blocked tumor-microglia communications, altered the spatial distribution of TAAs in GL261 gliomas providing new insights into cell-to-cell communication. Spatial transcriptomics combined with multiple staining unveils multiple functional phenotypes of TAAs and interactions within TME. We demonstrate distinct morphology of TAAs and different roles in various regions of the tumor. Glioma-induced heterogeneity of TAAs allows adaptation to the pharmacologically induced modification of the immunosuppressive TME.

<p>
Gene homologs of vertebrate RGLC markers are present in echinoderm transcriptomes.
Holothurian RGLCs express vertebrate glia markers.
<i>SOXB1</i>, <i>EAAT1/2</i>, and <i>PAX6</i> signals increase after injury in the holothurian RGLCs.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Radial glia-like cells (RGLCs) are recognized as cells with morphological and molecular similarities to embryonic radial glia but present in the nervous system of adult organisms. They are well known for playing key roles in neurogenesis and regeneration. The characterization of RGLCs in invertebrates has faced serious challenges due to interspecies limitations in identifying markers common to the vertebrate radial glia or RGLCs. This study investigates RGLCs in the echinoderm <i>Holothuria glaberrima</i>, combining transcriptomics, immunofluorescence, and advanced RNA visualization techniques (hybridization chain reaction fluorescence in situ hybridization [HCR-FISH]). Our results reveal the expression and localization of nine RGLC markers in the echinoderm central nervous system. These markers (<i>GS</i>, <i>PAX6</i>, <i>SOXB1</i>, Prominin, <i>GLAST</i>, SCO-spondin, Netrin, <i>EAAT2</i>, <i>UNC5C</i>) have been previously associated with vertebrate glial cells and/or their neurogenetic functions. Additionally, using an in vitro injury model, we tested the RGLC ability to respond to injury. This showed significant changes in the expression of key markers such as <i>PAX6</i> and Prominin, indicating the RGLC ability to react to injury. Our work provides insights into the phylogenetic relationships between vertebrate and invertebrate glial cells. This work advances our understanding of echinoderm RGLCs, challenging traditional views of glial cell homology and expanding the framework for studying neuroregenerative processes in nontraditional organisms.</p>
<h2>Significance Statement</h2>
<p>This article extensively characterizes the presence of glial markers in the adult radial glia-like cell (RGLC) population of <i>H. glaberrima</i>, aiming to provide a deeper understanding of glial cells in invertebrate deuterostomes, specifically echinoderms. Our work proves that holothurian RGLCs share several known molecular markers of vertebrate RGLCs and that this glial population is molecularly diverse, suggesting some degree of heterogeneity. We also evaluate changes in the RGLCs using an in vitro injury model, providing insight into cellular changes that are relevant to understanding in vivo nervous system regeneration and establishing its comparability to in vivo RNCs. In summary, this article provides strong evidence that echinoderm RGLCs are cellular homologs of vertebrate RGLCs, offering insights into the evolution of the vertebrate nervous system.</p>

                Background Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTNB) is a frequently encountered respiratory condition that affects term and late preterm infants. While standard oxygen therapy (SOT) remains the first-line intervention, emerging modalities, such as heated humidified high-flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC), may be more efficacious with fewer complications. However, evidence from randomized trials is scarce. Methods This was an open-label, non-blinded, randomized controlled trial conducted in a tertiary-care neonatal unit. Neonates with gestational age (GA) ≥ 34 weeks who were diagnosed with TTNB and satisfied the inclusion criteria were randomized to receive either HHHFNC or SOT. The primary outcomes included the duration of respiratory support and respiratory distress score (Downe Score). Secondary outcomes included the need for escalation of respiratory support, need for higher modes of respiratory support, length of hospital stay, and incidence of complications. Results Sixty neonates were randomized equally to HHHFNC (GA: 36.79 ± 2.46 weeks; BW: 2.50 ± 0.71 kg) and SOT (GA: 37.68 ± 1.04 weeks; BW: 2.79 ± 0.53 kg) groups. The need for escalation of respiratory support was significantly lower in the HHHFNC arm (46.7% vs. 96.7%, p=0.001), with a significant improvement in the Downe score at one hour (1.97±1.42 vs. 2.73±1.14, p=0.03). Neonates on HHHFNC required a shorter duration of respiratory support and had notably reduced length of hospital stay as compared to the SOT group (2.77±6.32 hours vs 3.87±7.20 hours, p=0.53 and 4.67±1.65 days vs 5.83±3.42 days, p=0.10, respectively). Nasal crusting occurred exclusively in the standard oxygen group (20% vs. 0%; p=0.011). Conclusions HHHFNC is an effective early treatment modality for TTNB, offering greater comfort and fewer complications than the standard oxygen therapy.

                Forensic anthropology is the study of skeletal remains for the identification of individuals, and anthropology more broadly deals with the study of humans. Many studies have been conducted to estimate stature from different body parts, such as the foot, extremities, hand, and vertebrae. However, in some cases, recovering all body parts and bones in their entirety can be difficult at the crime scene for forensic examination. In such cases, it becomes necessary to use another region, such as the head and facial region, for the estimation of height. Determination of height is a crucial aspect of forensic examination for the identification of the individual. This study was done to find the correlation between the stature and the morphological variations of the external auricular region for the estimation of stature for the purpose of forensic investigation. The study was conducted on 385 male individuals a total of four ear parameters were measured from both ears using the digital caliper. The data was analysed using Jamovi version 2.4.11. The result showed that there was a positive correlation between all the dimensions with stature. The linear regression analysis revealed a statistically significant relationship, with the most predicted variable in males being the left ear length (p<0.001). This study concludes that the external auricular morphometry can be an additional tool for the estimation of stature in forensic investigation.

                Background Depression, anxiety, and insomnia significantly impact global health and impose substantial health burdens worldwide. Conventional treatments including pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy face limitations in efficacy, side effects, and accessibility. Despite preliminary evidence suggesting the potential of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in managing these conditions, large-scale evaluations are lacking. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of CHM for the treatment of adults experiencing mild-to-moderate symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Methods This study will be a multicenter, pragmatic stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial. Districts will be randomized to receive the CHM intervention sequentially in four steps based on a computer-generated number, while control districts remain unexposed until their respective intervention phase. The intervention consists of a three-level stepped-care approach: Level 1 involves herbal tisane for mild symptoms, Level 2 offers standardized CHM for moderate symptoms or non-responders to Level 1, and Level 3 combines personalized CHM with psychotherapy for those not improved by Level 2. Symptom severity will be assessed using validated scales, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 for anxiety, and Insomnia Severity Index for insomnia, with primary outcomes measured at baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up. The study was approved by the Hong Kong Baptist University Research Ethics Committee (Approval No.: REC/22-23/0709). Discussion This study will provide significant insights into the effectiveness of a stepped-care CHM intervention for alleviating depression, anxiety, and insomnia. The results could guide future decision-making regarding the integration of CHM into mainstream healthcare systems in Hong Kong and beyond.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Exercise has been reported to improve outcomes in patients with Parkinson's disease, but the exact biological mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study was conducted to determine whether chronic moderate treadmill exercise prevents dopaminergic neuron loss and Lewy body-like inclusion burden in a preclinical model of PD. This study also sought to identify plasma exosome bound “exerkines” with potential to induce neuroprotective brain adaptations. Benefits of exercise are thought to be achieved in part through nucleic acids, lipids, and peptides termed exerkines abundant during exercise. These exerkines can induce cell-specific exercise adaptations culminating in neuroprotection. Membrane-free exerkines are subject to degradation in blood and may not effectively cross the blood-brain barrier to induce brain adaptations to exercise, limiting their inter-organ signaling potential. This led us to hypothesize that exerkines, bioactive RNAs in particular, may be selectively packaged into exosomes and released into plasma during exercise. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles, selectively packaged and released by cells, with likely important differences in composition at rest, during injury and disease, and in response to exercise. Exosomes have been demonstrated to play a major role in inter-organ communication. Chronic exercise was found to provide neuroprotection to dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, without affecting Lewy body-like inclusion burden in the nigra or the striatum. Plasma exosomal RNA was isolated from age-matched exercising and sedentary non-PD rats and sequenced. We report 27 unique RNAs upregulated in the exosomes of exercisers, 3 mRNAs with clear neuroprotective potential.</p>

                In a recent article, Légaré and colleagues demonstrate that key mammalian brain network organizational features, which have been extensively mapped in human functional connectivity studies, are conserved in the tiny vertebrate brain of the larval zebrafish. Using whole-brain calcium imaging, single-cell reconstructions, and network analyses, the authors reveal how features from structural connectomes and genetic markers predict sensorimotor functional correlations.

                Tang et al. provide a comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic characterization of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in glioblastoma. They reveal that EGFR ecDNA shapes transcriptional subtypes and reprograms the tumor microenvironment by stabilizing metabolically active tumor-associated macrophages. These findings uncover mechanistic links between ecDNA architecture and glioblastoma progression, highlighting potential therapeutic vulnerabilities.

                T cell activation requires increased biosynthesis, which depends on mitochondrial function. Galloway et al. demonstrate that mitochondrial function is regulated by cap methyltransferase CMTR1 during T cell activation. By methylating RNA Pol II-transcribed RNAs, including the spliceosomal U2 snRNA, CMTR1 controls a splicing program that impacts mitochondrial dynamics.

Mutants lacking VIA1 show delayed chloroplast development in newly emerging leaf tissue. This study establishes VIA1 as a critical regulator of thylakoid membrane formation in coordination with VIPP1.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106249">KDM5 demethylases suppress R-loop-mediated ‘viral mimicry’ and DNA damage in breast cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                Tumors with low expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) and antigen presentation (AP) genes respond relatively poorly to current immunotherapies. One of the early hallmarks of cancer is DNA hypomethylation in genomic repeat regions that can result in the expression of normally silenced endogenous ‘viral’ elements. Such epigenetic changes have the potential to augment anti-tumor immune responses as well as reduce tumor cell fitness through the generation of aberrant nucleic acid species (NAS) and consequent activation of NAS-sensing pathways. Therefore, tumor evolution should favor additional selective events that suppress NAS generation, possibly yielding specific therapeutic vulnerabilities. Here, we show that the lysine demethylase 5 (KDM5) family of epigenetic regulatory enzymes suppresses R-loop formation in genomic repeat regions specifically in cancer cells. We find that KDM5 inhibition in luminal breast cancer cells results in R-loop-mediated DNA damage, reduced cell fitness, and an increase in ISG and AP signatures as well as cell surface major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, mediated by RNA:DNA hybrid activation of the CGAS/STING pathway. KDM5 inhibition does not result in DNA damage or activation of the CGAS/STING pathway in normal breast epithelial cells, suggesting that KDM5 inhibitors may enable a wide therapeutic window in this setting, compared to STING agonists or type I interferons. These findings provide new insights into the interplay between epigenetic regulation of genomic repeats, R-loop formation, innate immunity, and cell fitness in the context of cancer evolution and therapeutic vulnerability.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101688">Transcranial direct current stimulation modulates primate brain dynamics across states of consciousness</a></h4>

              
                The resting primate brain is traversed by spontaneous functional connectivity patterns that show striking differences between conscious and unconscious states. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive neuromodulatory technique, can improve signs of consciousness in disorders of consciousness (DOCs); however, can it influence both conscious and unconscious dynamic functional connectivity? We investigated the modulatory effect of prefrontal cortex (PFC) tDCS on brain dynamics in awake and anesthetized non-human primates using functional MRI. In awake macaques receiving either anodal or cathodal tDCS, we found that cathodal stimulation robustly disrupted the repertoire of functional connectivity patterns, increased structure–function correlation (SFC), decreased Shannon entropy, and favored transitions toward anatomically based patterns. Under deep sedation, anodal tDCS significantly altered brain pattern distribution and reduced SFC. The prefrontal stimulation also modified dynamic connectivity arrangements typically associated with consciousness and unconsciousness. Our findings offer compelling evidence that PFC tDCS induces striking modifications in the fMRI-based dynamic organization of the brain across different states of consciousness. This study contributes to an enhanced understanding of tDCS neuromodulation mechanisms and has important clinical implications for DOCs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100937">Shared functional organization between pulvinar-cortical and cortico-cortical connectivity and its structural and molecular imaging correlates</a></h4>

              
                The pulvinar, the largest thalamic nucleus, is a highly interconnected structure supporting perception, visuospatial attention, and emotional processing. Such a central role relies on a precise topographical organization reflected in anatomical connectivity and neurochemical markers. Traditionally subdivided into distinct subnuclei, recent work shows that these divisions only partially explain its organization, which is better captured by continuous gradients of cortical connections along dorso-ventral and medio-lateral axes. While well studied in primates, this gradient-based architecture remains less explored in humans. The present work combines high-quality, multimodal structural and functional imaging with a whole-brain, large-scale, PET atlas mapping 19 neurotransmitter systems. By applying diffusion embedding to tractography, functional connectivity, and receptor coexpression, we identify multiple gradients of structural connections, functional coactivation, and molecular binding patterns. These converge on a shared representation along the dorso-ventral and medio-lateral axes of the human pulvinar, aligning with connectivity transitions from lower-level to higher-order cortical regions. Moreover, this is paralleled by gradual changes in the expression of molecular markers associated with key neuromodulator systems, including serotoninergic, noradrenergic, dopaminergic, and opioid systems. Our findings advance the understanding of pulvinar anatomy and function, offering an exploratory framework to investigate the role of this structure in both health and disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106387">Age and learning shapes sound representations in auditory cortex during adolescence</a></h4>

              
                Adolescence is a developmental period characterized by heightened plasticity. Yet, how ongoing development affects sensory processing and cognitive function is unclear. We investigated how adolescent (postnatal day 20–42) and adult (postnatal day 60–82) mice differ in performance on a pure tone Go/No-Go auditory discrimination task of varying difficulty. Using dense electrophysiological recordings, we measured spiking activity at single neuron resolution in the auditory cortex while mice were engaged in the task. As compared to adults, adolescent mice showed lower auditory discrimination performance in a difficult task. This difference in performance was due to higher response variability and weaker cognitive control expressed as higher lick bias. Adolescent and adult neuronal responses differed only slightly in representations of pure tones when measured outside the context of learning and the task. However, cortical representations after learning within the context of the task were markedly different. We found differences in stimulus- and choice-related activity at the single neuron level representations, as well as lower population-level decoding of the difficult task in adolescents. Overall, cortical decoding in adolescents was lower and slower, especially for difficult sound discrimination, reflecting immature cortical representations of sounds and choices. Notably, we found age-related differences, which were more pronounced after learning, reflecting the combined impact of age and learning. Our findings highlight distinct neurophysiological and behavioral profiles in adolescence, underscoring the ongoing development of cognitive control mechanisms and cortical plasticity during this sensitive developmental period.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96718">Synchronous ensembles of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons during novel exploration</a></h4>

              
                Synchronous neuronal ensembles play a pivotal role in the consolidation of long-term memory in the hippocampus. However, their organization during the acquisition of spatial memory remains less clear. In this study, we used neuronal population voltage imaging to investigate the synchronization patterns of mice CA1 pyramidal neuronal ensembles during the exploration of a new environment, a critical phase for spatial memory acquisition. We found synchronous ensembles comprising approximately 40% of CA1 pyramidal neurons, firing simultaneously in brief windows (~25ms) during immobility and locomotion in novel exploration. Notably, these synchronous ensembles were not associated with contralateral ripple oscillations but were instead phase-locked to theta waves recorded in the contralateral CA1 region. Moreover, the subthreshold membrane potentials of neurons exhibited coherent intracellular theta oscillations with a depolarizing peak at the moment of synchrony. Among newly formed place cells, pairs with more robust synchronization during locomotion displayed more distinct place-specific activities. These findings underscore the role of synchronous ensembles in coordinating place cells of different place fields.

However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not been elucidated. We aimed to identify structural covariance network alterations in depressed adolescents with suicidal behaviors to provide novel neuroimaging evidence for this condition. 64 first-episode, treatment-naïve depressed adolescent patients with suicidal behaviors and 48 healthy controls were enrolled. Nonnegative matrix factorization was used to identify the structural covariance networks. The Kullback–Leibler divergence method was applied to estimate the interregional relationships between the altered brain networks. Correlation analyses were conducted between altered brain networks and clinical characteristics. Patients had lower gray matter volumes in the anterior default mode network (DMN), visual network, sensorimotor network, and right executive control network than healthy controls. Morphological connections were altered in the anterior DMN, visual network, and right executive control network in patients. Correlation analyses revealed negative associations between morphological connections in anterior DMN-visual networks and illness duration in the patient group. This study revealed abnormal gray matter attributes in the anterior DMN, visual network, sensorimotor network, and executive control network in first-episode and treatment-naïve adolescent depression with suicide, which might reflect disease traits and provide essential neurobiological evidence for behavioral disturbances in depression.</span>

Implicit MI performance was assessed using a hand laterality judgment task. Regional volumes of frontal-motor, parietal, and cerebellar regions were derived from T1-weighted neuroimaging data. Relative to typically developing children, children with DCD showed less efficient MI performance on the hand laterality judgment task and had smaller cortical volumes in frontal and cerebellar regions. Partial correlations demonstrated that smaller gray matter volumes in frontal and parietal regions were associated with less efficient MI performance in children with and without DCD.

A total of 127 adults (33 with generalized anxiety disorder, 26 with panic disorder, 36 with social anxiety disorder, and 32 healthy controls) were recruited. We found that all individuals with generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder showed abnormal activity in the prefrontal–limbic–cerebellar circuit and default mode network regions. Patients with panic disorder showed unique hypoconnectivity between the default mode network and sensory-motor network, whereas patients with social anxiety disorder showed unique extensive hyperconnectivity between the default mode network and other networks. In addition, increased activity in the left orbital inferior frontal gyrus was associated with depression and anxiety symptom severity, decreased activity in the left superior temporal gyrus was associated with panic symptom severity, and decreased activity in the right fusiform gyrus was correlated with social anxiety symptom severity.

After reaching complete blindness confirmed by the lack of optomotor responses, activity in V1 and superior colliculus (SC) was recorded using Neuropixels probes. While we could not find any significant differences in tactile or auditory responses compared to wildtype mice, the local field potential revealed distinct oscillatory events (0.5–6 Hz) in V1 and SC resembling previously observed aberrant activity in the retina of <span style="font-style:italic;">rd10</span> mice. We therefore propose that aberrant retinal activity is transmitted to higher visual areas where it prevents cross-modal changes.

<p>Single-cell RNA-seq of the aged mouse hippocampus, integrated with CellChat, pseudotime analysis, hdWGCNA, and machine learning, reveals astrocyte-specific molecular alterations in perioperative neurocognitive disorders. Four key genes linked to neuroinflammation and cognitive decline were identified, offering promising biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for PND disease.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is common in older patients after anesthesia and surgery, significantly increasing morbidity and mortality. However, the role of astrocytes in its pathogenesis remains limitedly understood. Here, we analyzed 9976 and 9484 single-cell transcriptomes from hippocampal cells of aged mice undergoing PND surgery or sham operation, focusing on astrocytes. We identified 13 distinct clusters corresponding to nine cell types, including astrocytes, microglia, neurons, oligodendrocytes, and other relevant cell populations. Specifically, five astrocyte subclusters were identified, with cluster 0 being the most abundant. Its proportion decreased by 5.51% in the PND surgery condition, showing the largest difference between the groups. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that astrocytes are involved in crucial neurodevelopmental processes and pathways associated with nervous system development and synaptic regulation. Pseudotime analysis placed cluster 0 at the early stage of differentiation, suggesting it as a key responsive population. Gene co-expression network further identified modules with peak activity in cluster 0. By intersecting cluster 0 markers with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and applying machine learning methods, including LASSO, XGBoost, and Random Forest, we pinpointed four feature genes <i>Dbp</i>, <i>PISD</i>, <i>Id4</i>, and <i>Tsc22d3</i> with differential expression patterns between surgery and control conditions. Transcription factor activity analysis highlighted distinct regulatory networks in astrocytes, providing insights into their functional differences in response to PND surgery. These findings offer a detailed aged hippocampal landscape of astrocyte dynamics and intercellular communication, contributing to our understanding of neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction following surgical stress.</p>

                <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) has traditionally been associated with amyloid-&beta; plaques, but growing evidence underscores the role of neuroinflammation in disease progression. The autoinflammatory hypothesis of AD suggests chronic immune dysfunction contributes to neuronal damage, making immune modulation a promising therapeutic strategy. Cannabidiol (CBD), a phytocannabinoid with anti-inflammatory properties, may offer therapeutic potential. This study investigates how CBD independently influences two key neuroinflammatory regulators in AD: the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway and the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) pathway. Though mechanistically distinct, both shape CNS immune responses. Targeting these immune-metabolic axes provides a mechanistic alternative to amyloid- or tau-based approaches by addressing upstream drivers of neuroinflammation and immune dysregulation. Using the male 5XFAD transgenic AD mouse model, we administered CBD via inhalation and assessed IDO and cGAS expression using flow cytometry, immunofluorescence (IF), and gene expression analysis. We evaluated cytokine levels and used STRING-based bioinformatics to identify CBD-target interactions. CBD treatment significantly reduced IDO and cGAS expression, correlating with decreased proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-&alpha;, IL-1&beta;, and IFN-. Bioinformatics identified potential interactions between CBD and immune targets such as AKT1, TRPV1, and GPR55. These targets were prioritized based on their roles in neuroinflammatory signaling and high-confidence interactions with CBD. AKT1 regulates inflammatory signaling and cell survival, TRPV1 modulates nociception and neuroinflammation, and GPR55 influences immune cell activation. These findings support CBD as a potential monotherapy or adjunctive treatment for AD by targeting distinct neuroinflammatory pathways, including IDO and cGAS. Further studies are warranted to fully explore its therapeutic potential.</p>

                <p>Reaching movements, while seemingly simple, involve complex motor control mechanisms that select specific trajectories from infinite possibilities. Despite inherent variability in volitional movements, both humans and monkeys frequently exhibit stereotyped trajectories. The literature has offered numerous explanations for invariant trajectory shapes, including a common planning space in hand space or joint space, as well as factors like kinetic energy (KE) minimization and sensory feedback. However, since most studies have relied on single-session data, crucial insights into the motor principles guiding trajectory selection and their evolution through extended practice remain underexplored. This study fills this gap by investigating how specific trajectories are selected and evolve with practice across multiple sessions, using data from two rhesus monkeys (one male, one female) performing a reaching task in a biomechanically constrained 2D setup. Our behavioral study challenges the idea of a common planning space, revealing instead a significant influence of KE on trajectory shapes. Through a novel biomechanical modeling, we quantified KE for a wide range of trajectory shapes. We discovered that trajectory selection and evolution are not simply about minimizing KE or achieving straight paths. Instead, the monkeys&rsquo; motor systems appear to prioritize maintaining a "safe KE range," where slight changes in trajectory shapes have minimal impact on energy expenditure. These findings provide new insights into the adaptive motor control strategies, suggesting that trajectory selection involves balancing energy efficiency and flexibility. Our study enhances the understanding of trajectory selection principles, with implications for rehabilitation strategies, robotics, and broader study of motor control mechanisms.</p>

                Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and often immune-mediated demyelinating disease with no definitive treatment. Transposable elements (TEs) are receiving increasing attention as potential contributors to neurodegenerative diseases. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have examined the possible association of TE expression and its potential role in MS pathogenesis at the single-cell level. Results In this study, we reanalyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data from human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Our results revealed that TEs are overexpressed in a cluster of cells annotated as innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). Furthermore, enrichment analysis of the associated transcription factors (TFs) with highly upregulated TEs in ILCs revealed the relevance of these TFs to immune pathways and cis-regulatory regions in DNA. Conclusions We propose that upregulated TEs in ILCs are consistent with the plasticity of these cells, as TEs can insert themselves in coding or regulatory regions of immune-related genes and represent themselves as immune-related TF binding sites. We also hypothesize that ILCs with overexpressed TEs could present TE-derived antigens, potentially reactivating T cell-mediated immunity in the central nervous system (CNS) of MS patients. Therefore, this study indicates a possible mechanism involving TEs in ILC plasticity and their potential role in MS pathogenicity. Additionally, we suggest that repurposing nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) or developing new high-efficacy NRTIs could be a feasible approach to treating MS.

                Background and Objectives Hand and wrist fractures are among the most frequently encountered injuries in emergency departments and are often misdiagnosed, particularly when interpreted by non-specialist clinicians. These diagnostic errors can lead to treatment delays and long-term complications. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning algorithms, is emerging as a promising adjunct to improve diagnostic accuracy in radiographic fracture detection. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in detecting hand and wrist fractures compared to manual radiographic interpretation by clinicians. Materials and Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess the diagnostic performance of AI models in detecting hand and wrist fractures compared to conventional radiographic interpretation by clinicians. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Wiley Online Library was performed. Eligible studies included those utilizing AI for fracture detection with sensitivity and specificity data. Pooled estimates were calculated using fixed- and random-effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed via I2 statistics, and publication bias was examined using funnel plots and Egger’s test. Results Eighteen studies met inclusion criteria. The pooled sensitivity and specificity under the random-effects model were 0.910 and 0.912, respectively, indicating high diagnostic accuracy of AI models. However, substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 99.09% for sensitivity; 96.43% for specificity) and publication bias were observed, likely due to variations in AI algorithms, sample sizes, and study designs. Conclusions Most AI models demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy, with high sensitivity and specificity scores (≥90%). However, some models fell short in sensitivity and specificity (≤90%), indicating performance variations across different AI models or algorithms. From a clinical perspective, AI models with lower sensitivity scores may fail to detect hand and wrist fractures, potentially delaying treatment, while those with lower specificity scores could lead to unnecessary interventions—treating hands and wrists that are not fractured.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-800/v3?src=rss">Hypoglycemic effect of the aqueous extract from Acalypha argomuelleri Briq. (Euphorbiaceae) 'Sweet stick' leaves in Rattus rattus var. albinus [version 3; peer review: 2 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disease representing a global public health concern and is associated with severe complications such as cardiovascular and renal diseases. Although several species of the genus Acalypha have demonstrated biological activity, no prior studies have evaluated the hypoglycemic effect of Acalypha argomuelleri Briq., making this study relevant. Method The hypoglycemic effect of the aqueous leaf extract of A. argomuelleri Briq. (AAAE) was evaluated in an experimental model using Rattus rattus var. albinus (males). A randomized, prospective design was employed, consisting of a control group and three treatment groups receiving doses of 100, 150, and 300 mg/kg of the extract, respectively. Hyperglycemia was induced via oral glucose administration. Results The qualitative phytochemical analysis of AAAE revealed the presence of flavonoids, phenols, cardiotonic glycosides, and diterpenes, with no reducing sugars. The 300 mg/kg dose produced a significant and sustained reduction in blood glucose levels, reaching near-normal values at 90 minutes, demonstrating a dose- and time-dependent hypoglycemic effect. Discussion The study confirmed that AAAE has a dose-dependent hypoglycemic effect, with optimal efficacy at 300 mg/kg. This dose showed a faster and more sustained reduction in glucose levels compared to 100 and 150 mg/kg, suggesting higher efficacy at elevated concentrations. The identified flavonoids and phenols, associated with glucose metabolism modulation and pancreatic β-cell protection, likely explain the observed effect. The absence of reducing sugars indicates the hypoglycemic effect is linked to secondary metabolites. Conclusions The AAAE exhibited a significant dose- and time-dependent hypoglycemic effect, with optimal efficacy at 300 mg/kg after 90 minutes. These findings support the potential of A. argomuelleri Briq. as a natural alternative for blood glucose control, though further studies are needed to assess its safety and efficacy in clinical models.
