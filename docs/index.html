                Background We are considering the statistical analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. As demonstrated in previous work, grouping voxels into regions (of interest) and carrying out a multiple test for signal detection on the basis of these regions typically leads to a higher sensitivity when compared with voxel-wise multiple testing approaches. Methods In the case of a multi-subject study, we propose to define the regions for each subject separately based on their individual brain anatomy, represented, e.g., by regional labels. The aggregation of the subject-specific evidence for the presence of signals in the different regions is then performed by means of a combination function for p-values. We validate the proposed methodology with simulated data and apply it to real fMRI data of a hypothesis-driven approach towards identifying brain regions involved in understanding software code. Results The results of our simulated data show that our proposed method demonstrated significantly higher power in detecting true activation. Testing our method on real fMRI data, we found that our approach yields overlapping results with a two-stage approach for which two independent experiments are needed, one for defining the regions and one for actual signal detection. Conclusions In this paper, we overall demonstrate that our method of utilizing anatomical information is a candidate to provide a more sensitive analysis of fMRI data.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1018/v1?src=rss">Application of Modified Flanders Interaction Analysis During Mathematics Lessons in Lagos State Senior Secondary Schools [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objective This study examined the application of Modified Flanders Interaction Analysis during mathematics lessons in senior secondary schools in the Festac area of Lagos State, Nigeria. Methods The study employed a descriptive survey design to observe and analyse classroom interactions between teachers and students, focusing on verbal and non-verbal communication. Researchers used a structured observation schedule to collect data from a purposively selected sample of 10 mathematics teachers and 725 students across five schools. The researchers designed the instrument to collect information on teachers’ and students’ interaction patterns in the classroom. They analysed the data using mean scores, standard deviation, percentages, and t-test statistics, applying a 0.05 significance level for hypothesis testing. Findings The results of the analysis revealed that teachers dominate all the activities in the classroom; that is, the teachers were the active people in the classes, while the students were just passive listeners and moderate engagement through non-verbal behaviours. Statistical analysis showed significant differences between teacher and student patterns, particularly verbal behaviours. The study underscores that mathematics classes in senior secondary schools in the Festac area of Lagos State were teachers-centered. Conclusion Based on the study findings, the researchers recommended that mathematics teachers adopt more student-centered teaching approaches to enhance active student participation and engagement during lessons. Also, they should not be too strict, but they should be approachable, friendly, and accommodating so that the students will not be afraid to ask questions during or after the lesson, enhancing their performance. Hence, the government should ensure that teacher training programs incorporate observation techniques to effectively equip teachers with the skills to assess and improve classroom interaction.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25453">Neural Receptive Fields, Stimulus Space Embedding and Effective Geometry of Scale-Free Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.25453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how neuronal dynamics couple with stimuli space and how receptive fields emerge and organize within brain networks remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Several models attempted to explain these phenomena, often by adjusting the network to empirical manifestations, but struggled to achieve biological plausibility. Here, we propose a physiologically grounded model in which receptive fields and population-level attractor dynamics emerge naturally from the effective hyperbolic geometry of scale-free networks. In particular, we associate stimulus space with the boundary of a hyperbolic embedding, and study the resulting neural dynamics in both rate-based and spiking implementations. The resulting localized attractors faithfully reflect the structure of the stimulus space and capture key properties of the receptive fields without fine-tuning of local connectivity, exhibiting a direct relation between a neuron's connectivity degree and the corresponding receptive field size. The model generalizes to stimulus spaces of arbitrary dimensionality and scale, encompassing various modalities, such as orientation and place selectivity. We also provide direct experimental evidence in support of these results, based on analyses of hippocampal place fields recorded on a linear track. Overall, our framework offers a novel organizing principle for receptive field formation and establishes a direct link between network structure, stimulus space encoding, and neural dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26019">Structural Heterogeneity of the Drosophila Brain Network</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.26019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding the heterogeneity of biological neural systems is key to understanding the nervous system's complex dynamical behaviors. This study analyzes the comprehensive Drosophila brain connectome, which is the most recent data set, containing over 130,000 neurons and 50 million synapses. We conducted meticulous analyses of both network and spatial structure. Our findings reveal significant heterogeneity in network properties and distinct spatial clustering across functional regions. Besides, our analysis revealed a modular organizational pattern within the neural network, wherein regions with similar functions exhibited higher connection densities, forming distinct community structures. Moreover, we observed spatial clustering within functional regions but was not statistically significant. Additionally, we identify pervasive bilateral symmetry in network topology and spatial organization. Simulations based on the Kuramoto model demonstrate that the functional asymmetry between cerebral hemispheres arises from disparities in the intrinsic frequencies of neurons rather than from structural asymmetry within the neural network itself. Finally, we develop a 3D connectome visualization tool for detailed mapping of neuronal morphology. These insights advance our understanding of neural network organization and complexity in biological systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26083">Bibliometric-enhanced Systematic Literature Review of EEG in Education: Learning Concepts, Computational Methods, and Research Opportunities</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.26083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Application of electroencephalography (EEG) in educational research has grown substantially, yet a comprehensive integration of methodological frameworks, educational constructs, computational methods, and research gaps remains limited. This study applies a Bibliometric-enhanced Systematic Literature Review (BenSLR) to provide a systematic overview of EEG in education. Literature was extracted from Scopus, screened, and analyzed, with keyword co-occurrence evaluated using VOSviewer and emerging trends visualized through an Enhanced Strategic Diagram via BiblioPlot. Key findings include engagement, attention, and learning style as prominent constructs, with machine learning and deep learning frequently employed for modeling complex cognitive states. EEG signal processing, feature extraction, and assessment of cognitive and affective states were recurrent across studies. Innovative interventions such as virtual reality and neurofeedback demonstrate EEG's role in supporting adaptive and individualized learning experiences. Challenges remain in linking neural markers with observable learning behaviors, extending measurements beyond attention and working memory, and enhancing predictive model generalizability. The study demonstrates BenSLR's potential to integrate qualitative and quantitative perspectives and offers a transferable approach for other research areas to develop methodologies and evidence-based educational interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26085">A Chaotic Dynamics Framework Inspired by Dorsal Stream for Event Signal Processing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.26085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensor that encode visual information with high dynamic range, high temporal resolution, and low latency.Current state-of-the-art event stream processing methods rely on end-to-end deep learning techniques. However, these models are heavily dependent on data structures, limiting their stability and generalization capabilities across tasks, thereby hindering their deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a chaotic dynamics event signal processing framework inspired by the dorsal visual pathway of the brain. Specifically, we utilize Continuous-coupled Neural Network (CCNN) to encode the event stream. CCNN encodes polarity-invariant event sequences as periodic signals and polarity=changing event sequences as chaotic signals. We then use continuous wavelet transforms to analyze the dynamical states of CCNN neurons and establish the high-order mappings of the event stream. The effectiveness of our method is validated through integration with conventional classification networks, achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy on the N-Caltech101 and N-CARS datasets, with results of 84.3% and 99.9%, respectively. Our method improves the accuracy of event camera-based object classification while significantly enhancing the generalization and stability of event representation. Our code is available in https://github.com/chenyu0193/ACDF.

                arXiv:2509.26090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motor adaptation is a learning process that enables humans to regain proficiency when sensorimotor conditions are sustainably altered. Many studies have documented the properties of motor adaptation, yet the underlying mechanisms of motor adaptation remain imperfectly understood. In this study, we propose a computational analysis of adaptation to a visuomotor rotation task and examine it through an experiment. Our analysis suggests that two distinct processes contribute to produce adaptation: one which straightens trajectories, and another which redirects trajectories. We designed a visuomotor rotation task in a 3D virtual environment where human participants performed a pointing task using a head-mounted display controller represented by a cursor that was visually rotated by an angular deviation relative to its actual position. We observed that: (1) the trajectories were initially curved and misdirected, and became straighter and better directed with learning; (2) the straightening process occurred faster than the redirection process. These findings are consistent with our computational analysis and disclose a new and different perspective on motor adaptation.

                arXiv:2509.26606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early theories of perception as probabilistic inference propose that uncertainty about the interpretation of sensory input is represented as a probability distribution over many interpretations -- a relatively complex representation. However, critics argue that persistent demonstrations of suboptimal perceptual decision-making indicate limits in representational complexity. We contend that suboptimality arises not from genuine limits, but participants' resource-rational adaptations to task demands. For example, when tasks are solvable with minimal attention to stimuli, participants may neglect information needed for complex representations, relying instead on simpler ones that engender suboptimality. Across three experiments, we progressively reduced the efficacy of resource-rational strategies on a carefully controlled decision task. Model fits favored simple representations when resource-rational strategies were effective, and favored complex representations when ineffective, suggesting that perceptual representations can be simple or complex depending on task demands. We conclude that resource-rationality is an epistemic constraint for experimental design and essential to a complete theory of perception.

                arXiv:2509.26560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global dimensionality of a neural representation manifold provides rich insight into the computational process underlying both artificial and biological neural networks. However, all existing measures of global dimensionality are sensitive to the number of samples, i.e., the number of rows and columns of the sample matrix. We show that, in particular, the participation ratio of eigenvalues, a popular measure of global dimensionality, is highly biased with small sample sizes, and propose a bias-corrected estimator that is more accurate with finite samples and with noise. On synthetic data examples, we demonstrate that our estimator can recover the true known dimensionality. We apply our estimator to neural brain recordings, including calcium imaging, electrophysiological recordings, and fMRI data, and to the neural activations in a large language model and show our estimator is invariant to the sample size. Finally, our estimators can additionally be used to measure the local dimensionalities of curved neural manifolds by weighting the finite samples appropriately.

Abstract: Chronic stress is a risk factor for cognitive decline and illness, yet reliable individual markers remain limited. We tested whether two single channel high dynamic range EEG biomarkers, ST4 and T2, index stress responses by linking neural activity to validated physiological and subjective measures.
  Study 1 included 101 adults between 22 and 82 years of age who completed questionnaires on stress, resilience, and burnout, provided salivary cortisol, and performed resting, cognitive load, emotional, and startle conditions. Study 2 included 82 adults between 19 and 42 years who completed the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, underwent heart rate variability monitoring, and performed auditory, stress inducing, and emotional conditions. Correlations were considered meaningful when r was at least 0.30. Results showed that ST4 reflected physiological arousal and cognitive strain. In Study 1, resting ST4 was positively related to cortisol and lower in more resilient participants. In Study 2, ST4 correlated negatively with heart rate variability during stress and recovery. T2 reflected emotional and autonomic regulation. In Study 1, T2 tracked higher cortisol and was lower with greater resilience. In Study 2, T2 was higher with trait anxiety and correlated negatively with heart rate variability during stress and emotional conditions. Together, ST4 and T2 provide complementary portable markers of stress, supporting individualized assessment in clinical and real world contexts.

Abstract: I propose that qualia are physical because they are directly observable, and revisit the contentious link between consciousness and quantum measurements from a new perspective -- one that does not rely on observers or wave function collapse but instead treats physical measurements as fundamental in a sense resonant with Wheeler's it-from-bit. Building on a mathematical definition of measurement space in physics, I reinterpret it as a model of qualia, effectively equating the measurement problem of quantum mechanics with the hard problem of consciousness. The resulting framework falls within panpsychism, and offers potential solutions to the combination problem. Moreover, some of the mathematical structure of measurement spaces, taken for granted in physics, needs justification for qualia, suggesting that the apparent solidity of physical reality is deeply rooted in how humans process information.

Abstract: The brain-body-environment framework studies adaptive be- havior through embodied and situated agents, emphasizing interactions between brains, biomechanics, and environmen- tal dynamics. However, many models often treat the brain as a network of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), neglecting finer spatial properties which can not only increase model complexity but also constrain observable neural dy- namics. To address this limitation, we propose a spatially ex- tended approach using partial differential equations (PDEs) for both the brain and body. As a case study, we revisit a pre- viously developed model of a child swinging, now incorpo- rating spatial dynamics. By considering the spatio-temporal properties of the brain and body, we analyze how input loca- tion and propagation along a PDE influence behavior. This approach offers new insights into the role of spatial organiza- tion in adaptive behavior, bridging the gap between abstract neural models and the physical constraints of embodied sys- tems. Our results highlight the importance of spatial dynam- ics in understanding brain-body-environment interactions.

                arXiv:2509.26003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equilibrium propagation has been proposed as a biologically plausible alternative to the backpropagation algorithm. The local nature of gradient computations, combined with the use of convergent RNNs to reach equilibrium states, make this approach well-suited for implementation on neuromorphic hardware. However, previous studies on equilibrium propagation have been restricted to networks containing only dense layers or relatively small architectures with a few convolutional layers followed by a final dense layer. These networks have a significant gap in accuracy compared to similarly sized feedforward networks trained with backpropagation. In this work, we introduce the Hopfield-Resnet architecture, which incorporates residual (or skip) connections in Hopfield networks with clipped $\mathrm{ReLU}$ as the activation function. The proposed architectural enhancements enable the training of networks with nearly twice the number of layers reported in prior works. For example, Hopfield-Resnet13 achieves 93.92\% accuracy on CIFAR-10, which is $\approx$3.5\% higher than the previous best result and comparable to that provided by Resnet13 trained using backpropagation.

                arXiv:2509.26507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between computing systems and the brain has served as motivation for pioneering theoreticians since John von Neumann and Alan Turing. Uniform, scale-free biological networks, such as the brain, have powerful properties, including generalizing over time, which is the main barrier for Machine Learning on the path to Universal Reasoning Models.
  We introduce `Dragon Hatchling' (BDH), a new Large Language Model architecture based on a scale-free biologically inspired network of \$n\$ locally-interacting neuron particles. BDH couples strong theoretical foundations and inherent interpretability without sacrificing Transformer-like performance.
  BDH is a practical, performant state-of-the-art attention-based state space sequence learning architecture. In addition to being a graph model, BDH admits a GPU-friendly formulation. It exhibits Transformer-like scaling laws: empirically BDH rivals GPT2 performance on language and translation tasks, at the same number of parameters (10M to 1B), for the same training data.
  BDH can be represented as a brain model. The working memory of BDH during inference entirely relies on synaptic plasticity with Hebbian learning using spiking neurons. We confirm empirically that specific, individual synapses strengthen connection whenever BDH hears or reasons about a specific concept while processing language inputs. The neuron interaction network of BDH is a graph of high modularity with heavy-tailed degree distribution. The BDH model is biologically plausible, explaining one possible mechanism which human neurons could use to achieve speech.
  BDH is designed for interpretability. Activation vectors of BDH are sparse and positive. We demonstrate monosemanticity in BDH on language tasks. Interpretability of state, which goes beyond interpretability of neurons and model parameters, is an inherent feature of the BDH architecture.

                arXiv:2509.25439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMM) are commonly used in generation tasks and have demonstrated strong capabilities in neuro-symbolic applications for the Markov property. These applications leverage the strengths of neural networks and symbolic reasoning to create robust and interpretable AI systems. However, they may inherit and amplify the shortcomings of both approaches. Both components require dense computation and data transfer, and their communication further hinders performance. This paper proposes Norm-Q, a normalized linear quantization approach for compressing probabilistic symbolic models, such as HMMs. We reduce the bit width of the data with minimal impact, thereby alleviating memory and bandwidth stress and enabling deployment on potential custom hardware. Our method introduces a normalized quantization-aware expectation maximization process for probabilistic model training. The experimental results show that Norm-Q achieves a higher compression rate with reasonable score loss compared to traditional quantization methods. In the case of the constrained generation task of large language models, we successfully quantize an HMM of 4096 hidden states to 8 bits without loss and, at most, 3 bits with acceptable loss. Notably, the Norm-Q method can achieve a compression rate of 99% for the weights of the HMM. The code is open source at https://github.com/superstarghy/Norm-Q.

                arXiv:2509.25862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To maximize hardware efficiency and performance accuracy in Compute-In-Memory (CIM)-based neural network accelerators for Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, co-optimizing both software and hardware design parameters is essential. Manual tuning is impractical due to the vast number of parameters and their complex interdependencies. To effectively automate the design and optimization of CIM-based neural network accelerators, hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) techniques can be applied. This work introduces CIMNAS, a joint model-quantization-hardware optimization framework for CIM architectures. CIMNAS simultaneously searches across software parameters, quantization policies, and a broad range of hardware parameters, incorporating device-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations. CIMNAS experiments were conducted over a search space of 9.9x10^85 potential parameter combinations with the MobileNet model as a baseline and RRAM-based CIM architecture. Evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved a reduction in energy-delay-area product (EDAP) ranging from 90.1x to 104.5x, an improvement in TOPS/W between 4.68x and 4.82x, and an enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 from 11.3x to 12.78x relative to various baselines, all while maintaining an accuracy of 73.81%. The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending the framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to an 819.5x reduction in EDAP. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, CIMNAS achieves EDAP-focused optimization without any accuracy loss, generating diverse software-hardware parameter combinations for high-performance CIM-based neural network designs. The source code of CIMNAS is available at https://github.com/OlgaKrestinskaya/CIMNAS.

                arXiv:2509.26058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) artifact detection in real-world settings faces significant challenges such as computational inefficiency in multi-channel methods, poor robustness to simultaneous noise, and trade-offs between accuracy and complexity in deep learning models. We propose a hybrid spectral-temporal framework for real-time detection and classification of ocular (EOG), muscular (EMG), and white noise artifacts in single-channel EEG. This method, in contrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering (targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD) analysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature fusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This feature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at low SNRs (SNR -7) dB and >90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB). Additionally, this framework addresses the unexplored problem of simultaneous multi-source contamination(EMG+EOG+white noise), where it maintains 96% classification accuracy despite overlapping artifacts. With 30-second training times (97% faster than CNNs) and robust performance across SNR levels, this framework bridges the gap between clinical applicability and computational efficiency, which enables real-time use in wearable brain-computer interfaces. This work also challenges the ubiquitous dependence on model depth for EEG artifact detection by demonstrating that domain-informed feature fusion surpasses complex architecture in noisy scenarios.

                arXiv:2509.26269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how complex systems transition between states requires mapping the energy landscape that governs these changes. Local transition-state networks reveal the barrier architecture that explains observed behaviour and enables mechanism-based prediction across computational chemistry, biology, and physics, yet current practice either prescribes endpoints or randomly samples only a few saddles around an initial guess. We present a general optimization framework that systematically expands local coverage by coupling a multi-objective explorer with a bilayer minimum-mode kernel. The inner layer uses Hessian-vector products to recover the lowest-curvature subspace (smallest k eigenpairs), the outer layer optimizes on a reflected force to reach index-1 saddles, then a two-sided descent certifies connectivity. The GPU-based pipeline is portable across autodiff backends and eigensolvers and, on large atomistic-spin tests, matches explicit-Hessian accuracy while cutting peak memory and wall time by orders of magnitude. Applied to a DFT-parameterized N\'eel-type skyrmionic model, it recovers known routes and reveals previously unreported mechanisms, including meron-antimeron-mediated N\'eel-type skyrmionic duplication, annihilation, and chiral-droplet formation, enabling up to 32 pathways between biskyrmion (Q=2) and biantiskyrmion (Q=-2). The same core transfers to Cartesian atoms, automatically mapping canonical rearrangements of a Ni(111) heptamer, underscoring the framework's generality.

Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers, ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory, silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity. Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families. These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.

Abstract: When different objectives conflict with each other in multi-task learning, gradients begin to interfere and slow convergence, thereby potentially reducing the final model's performance. To address this, we introduce SON-GOKU, a scheduler that computes gradient interference, constructs an interference graph, and then applies greedy graph-coloring to partition tasks into groups that align well with each other. At each training step, only one group (color class) of tasks are activated, and the grouping partition is constantly recomputed as task relationships evolve throughout training. By ensuring that each mini-batch contains only tasks that pull the model in the same direction, our method improves the effectiveness of any underlying multi-task learning optimizer without additional tuning. Since tasks within these groups will update in compatible directions, multi-task learning will improve model performance rather than impede it. Empirical results on six different datasets show that this interference-aware graph-coloring approach consistently outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art multi-task optimizers. We provide extensive theory showing why grouping and sequential updates improve multi-task learning, with guarantees on descent, convergence, and accurately identifying what tasks conflict or align.

">Dynamic Meta-Networking Identifies Distinct Network Correlates of Positive and Negative Formal Thought Disorder in Schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Formal thought disorder (FTD) is a core symptom of schizophrenia, yet the neural network mechanisms underlying this phenotype remain poorly understood. In this study, we applied a dynamic meta-networking framework, which captures temporally recurring functional network states, to investigate alterations in the language and executive control networks and their associations with positive and negative FTD. Resting-state fMRI data were collected from three independent cohorts: a discovery cohort comprising 150 first-episode, drug-naive patients with schizophrenia and 175 healthy controls (HCs); a replication cohort including 183 first-episode, drug-naive patients and 109 HCs; and a third cohort consisting of 71 patients who had received two weeks of antipsychotic treatment and 71 HCs. Meta-networking analysis identified four distinct resting-state meta-states within both the language and executive control networks. Connectivity-behavior correlation analyses and machine-learning regression models revealed that positive FTD was associated with aberrant connectivity across specific meta-states in both networks. In contrast, negative FTD was linked exclusively to dysfunction within two meta-states of the executive control network. Notably, these polarity-specific, multi-state connectivity disruptions normalized following short-term antipsychotic treatment, highlighting their potential as clinically relevant neuroimaging biomarkers.

">Brain injury reactivates a developmental program driving genesis and integration of transient LGE-class interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Brain lesions can unlock a latent neurogenic potential in parenchymal astrocytes. However, the identity of their neuronal progeny has remained unclear. Here, we show that neurons generated by striatal astrocytes following excitotoxic lesions are transient, yet they reach advanced stages of morphological and functional maturation and integrate into cortico-striatal-thalamic circuits. Single-cell RNA-seq mapping onto an embryonic reference revealed that these cells are not related to adult striatal neuron types but instead belong to the LGE-MEIS2/PAX6 interneuron class. Notch abrogation, which mimics neurogenic activation, drives both cortical and striatal astrocytes toward this same interneuron class, revealing a shared intrinsic commitment. In primates, LGE-MEIS2/PAX6 cells transiently populate the embryonic striatum and cortex, and through spatial transcriptomics, we reveal that in mice these cells are also present and widely distributed throughout the telencephalon during embryonic and postnatal development. Thus, unlike other vertebrates in which adult telencephalic astroglia preserve the potential to generate constitutive region-specific neurons, the homologous cells in mammals converge on the generation of a specific transient neuron class, possibly representing a reservoir for circuit plasticity in adult life.

">Gestational psychedelic exposure disrupts brain development and offspring behavior in mice</a></h4>

              
                Despite increasing non-medical use and clinical investigation of psychedelics, the consequences of prenatal exposure remain unknown. In mice, maternal lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD; 0.3 mg/kg) crossed the placenta, appearing in embryonic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within minutes at E12.5 and E16.5. Within 30 minutes, LSD and other serotonergic psychedelics activated the embryonic choroid plexus via 5-HT2C, triggered apical remodeling, and increased CSF protein. A single E12.5 exposure altered cerebral cortical laminar organization and composition at postnatal day 8, and repeated dosing (E12.5 - E16.5) amplified male-biased shifts from SATB2+ to CTIP2+ neuronal identities and increased microglia. Adult offspring showed reduced prepulse inhibition (male-predominant) and rotational stereotypy. These data identify an embryo-facing interface that detects maternal psychedelics and link CSF access to enduring neurodevelopmental and behavioral consequences.

">Schizophrenia, variability, and the Anna Karenina principle</a></h4>

              
                In neuroimaging studies of people with schizophrenia there is often higher within group variancein the patient group compared to the control group. This is counterintuitive - why would asubset of people selected because they all have the same disease be more varied than the generalpopulation? We used simulated data and real neuroimaging data to identify a potential cause ofelevated variance in populations of patients with schizophrenia. We demonstrated that elevatedvariance can arise within variables that are unrelated to disease status simply because peoplewith a set of neurological perturbations that cause schizophrenia are more likely to have highernumbers of perturbations overall. Additionally, we showed that observed elevated variances inpeople with schizophrenia can be reproduced by models that only rely on perturbation count.These results highlight an important barrier in our attempts to understand the pathophysiology ofschizophrenia. Standard statistical practices in schizophrenia research do not account for the factthat schizophrenia is, at every level of analysis that has been studied, highly heterogeneous. Thisheterogeneity by itself is sufficient to produce elevated variances. Our work suggests that themost effective way to prevent schizophrenia may not be to identify and mitigate specificpathologies but rather to reduce the impact of broadly damaging factors such as those associatedwith poverty.

">Modulation of hippocampal synaptic transmission by mast cells at the hippocampal-thalamic border during early brain development</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic development is a highly structured process and can be modulated by the biogenic amine, histamine, whose dysregulation during brain development can be part of the aetiology of the neurodevelopmental disorders Tourettes syndrome and OCD. Well documented in the literature is the extensive histaminergic axonal innervation originating from neurons in tuberomammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus, however, less is known about non-neuronal sources of histamine, such as mast cells, and their potential functional importance in development. Here we set out to investigate the spatiotemporal localisation of mast cells in the developing C57Bl/6 mouse brain and the potential impact of their degranulation on developing synapses. Firstly, we find that the mouse brain contains relatively larger numbers of mast cells during the first and second postnatal week. Secondly, that in this period the highest density of mast cells is found just below the hippocampus at the hippocampal-thalamic border with lower numbers found in other brain regions. Thirdly, using the mast cell degranulator C48/80 we observe that their degranulation can facilitate synaptic transmission at the perforant pathway inputs to the ventral portion of the dentate gyrus which could not be blocked by co-application of the histamine H3 receptor antagonist thioperamide. In contrast histamine superfusion tended to decrease synaptic transmission at this pathway which was sensitive to thioperamide co-application. In conclusion, these results suggest that mast cells are present in the developing C57Bl/6 mouse brain and in particular at the hippocampal-thalamic border where upon degranulation they appear to modulate hippocampal synaptic transmission.

">Synaptic and potential fluctuations drive representational drift with differential effects on discrimination learning</a></h4>

              
                Large-scale neuronal measurements have revealed continual drift of neural representations without explicit learning, raising fundamental questions about how the brain maintains reliable perception. While representational drift has been studied both experimentally and theoretically, the underlying mechanisms and computational consequences remain unclear. Here, we systematically compare two drift mechanisms -fluctuations in synaptic weights versus membrane potential -using an analytically tractable neural network model with aligned drift magnitude and timescale. We found that both mechanisms preserve representational structure across time regardless of the drift magnitude. However, only synaptic fluctuations maintain discriminability between representations under large drift magnitude. We use a selectivity space to explain how these similar and differential effects on representational drift emerge from the dynamics of individual neuronal tuning. We further examine functional consequences of drift using reversal learning tasks where stimulus-reward associations switch. Both mechanisms enhance single stimulus learning by gradually removing the old associations, but only synaptic fluctuations substantially improved learning of multiple stimuli by preserving the representational structure during drift. Our results reveal distinct computations performed by specific fluctuation mechanisms and explain how representational drift can support both stable and adaptive behavior.

">Diagnosis-Optimized Dynamic Feature Learning Reveals Altered Default Mode Network Connectivity in Schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia (SZ) is characterized by widespread neural dysconnectivity, with particularly pronounced alterations in the default mode network (DMN)- a set of brain regions involved in self-referential thought and mind-wandering. We investigated dynamic functional connectivity within the DMN in SZ by analyzing resting-state fMRI data from two independent cohorts (FBIRN and COBRE). Using a novel iterative feature-removal clustering approach focusing on DMN independent components, we identified distinct recurring connectivity states while iteratively removing dominant connectivity features to reveal subtler network patterns. This approach iteratively refines the set of features considered, ensuring a more balanced representation and facilitating the identification of significant interactions that would otherwise be overlooked. Cluster centroids for the four connectivity states were highly similar across both datasets, reflecting stable shared DMN patterns. State occupancy was compared between participants with SZ and healthy controls, and associations with clinical symptom severity were examined. The SZ group exhibited significant alterations in DMN connectivity dynamics, spending more time than controls in certain connectivity states characterized by atypical DMN coupling and less time in a state reflecting a normative DMN configuration. A comparison between the FBIRN and COBRE datasets reveals both similarities and differences in occupancy rate (OCR) states. Overall, the pattern of group effects converged while state-specific divergences likely reflected protocol/sample differences rather than conflicting biology. Crucially, the explainability pipeline yielded a highly similar feature-removal order across datasets, indicating that the same DMN edges drive the diagnostic signal in both cohorts. Several OCR effects also tracked symptom ratings, linking abnormal DMN dynamics to clinical expression. Our findings suggest that SZ is characterized by reproducible disturbances in the temporal organization of DMN connectivity. These dynamic DMN features may serve as potential biomarkers for SZ, offering diagnostic and clinical utility by capturing network dysfunction that static connectivity measures could overlook.

">Cholinergic-dependent dopamine signals in mouse dorsal striatum are regulated by frontal but not sensory cortices</a></h4>

              
                Everyday decisions depend on linking sensory stimuli with actions and outcomes. The striatum supports these sensorimotor associations through dopamine-dependent plasticity. Thus, the timing and magnitude of dopamine release is critical for learning. Recent work has characterized a local striatal microcircuit in which cholinergic interneurons (CINs) modulate dopamine release via acetylcholine activation of nicotinic receptors on dopamine axons. Here, we show that visual stimuli evoke dopamine responses in the dorsomedial striatum through this cholinergic-dependent mechanism. Using anatomical and functional methods to identify which pathways elicit these signals, we found that primary visual cortex and early sensory areas that project to the striatum exhibited only weak connectivity to CINs, despite robust connectivity to projection neurons, and were unable to drive dopamine release. In contrast, frontal cortical regions, including the prelimbic and anterior cingulate cortices, strongly recruited CINs and acetylcholine, producing robust dopamine release both ex vivo and in vivo. These findings reveal a fundamental distinction between sensory and frontal cortical inputs to the striatum, demonstrating that only the latter provide effective access to cholinergic-dependent dopamine signaling. This work establishes a framework for understanding how cortical circuits shape striatal dopamine to support reinforcement learning.

">Theta and gamma transcranial alternating current stimulation modulate Mandarin consonant and lexical tone perception</a></h4>

              
                A theta/gamma oscillatory neural mechanism has been postulated to explain the auditory sampling of hierarchical syllable-phoneme structure with corresponding speech rates or linguistic hierarchies (theta for syllable and gamma for phoneme). Yet, whether such a mechanism is generalizable to Mandarin Chinese, a language that both has suprasegmental phonemes in the form of lexical tones and contains more monosyllabic words, which may lead to higher reliance on either phonemic-level or syllabic-level perceptual representations, is unclear. In this study, we applied transcranial electric stimulation with either theta or gamma alternating currents (tACS) to bilateral auditory cortices in healthy Mandarin-speaking participants during a consonant or tone identification task in quiet or noisy environments. Results showed that theta tACS impaired consonant identification in quiet, specifically, and generally prolonged reaction times across tasks and environments. Gamma tACS, however, only delayed tone identification in quiet. Besides, both theta and gamma tACS modulated perceptual decision-making parameters, leading to increased boundary thresholds (cautiousness of decision) and altered response biases in the perceptual decision of both consonants and tones, as evidenced by the hierarchical drift-diffusion model (HDDM). These findings indicate that theta oscillations causally support the perception of Mandarin syllables, with consonants and lexical tones presumably embedded in syllable-level representations, regardless of task difficulty. Gamma activity, however, is presumably engaged in supporting fast-changing and fine-grained acoustic features in a modulatory manner.

">Persistent chromatin loops shape gene expression plasticity upon stimulation and restimulation of human neurons</a></h4>

              
                Persistent molecular correlates of long-term memory storage remain an open question. Here, we stimulate and re-stimulate human neurons and use multi-modal single-nucleus technologies to query DNA methylation, higher-order chromatin folding, and gene expression. We find enduring traces of activity-gained and activity-lost chromatin loops. Genes anchoring persistent activity-gained loops exhibit activity-upregulated expression, whereas persistent activity-lost loops anchor activity-downregulated genes that remain repressed five days post-stimulation. CTCF-bound looped enhancers and promoters are refractory to activity-dynamic DNA methylation. Looped enhancers bound by CTCF can exhibit memory of activity-induced histone modifications and persistent expression of activity-upregulated genes. Upon second stimulation, activity-upregulated genes are robustly re-induced when unlooped but remain nonresponsive at persistent loops akin to habituation. Activity-independent gene expression can be downregulated when unlooped but protected from homeostatic downscaling when anchored in persistent loops. Our data reveal long-term genome folding persistence linked to plasticity of activity-dependent gene expression during recall in human neurons.

">Evolutionarily Conserved and Divergent Mechanisms of Dual Ca2+ Sensors in Synaptic Vesicle Exocytosis</a></h4>

              
                Neurotransmitter release at the C. elegans neuromuscular junction is governed by a dual Ca2+ sensor system composed of SNT-1 and SNT-3, which are functional analogs of synaptotagmin-1 and -7 (Syt1/Syt7) in mammalian central synapses. In this study, we investigated how SNT-1 and SNT-3 mediate fast and slow neurotransmitter release through their potential interactions with the SNARE complex and their polybasic motifs. AlphaFold 3 models of SNT-1--SNARE and SNT-3--SNARE complexes accurately recapitulated the canonical Syt1 C2B--SNARE primary interface (Zhou et al., 2015, Nature) and precisely identified conserved binding residues within the C2B domains, as well as in SNAP-25 and Syntaxin, highlighting the evolutionary conservation of this interaction. Electrophysiological analyses using targeted mutagenesis demonstrated that both SNT-1 and SNT-3 require C2B--SNARE interactions and polybasic motifs within their C2 domains to drive evoked fast and slow neurotransmitter release. Notably, SNT-1 and SNT-3 exhibited differential dependence on distinct regions of the C2B--SNARE interface and their respective polybasic motifs, suggesting that Ca2+-triggered fast and slow release operate via distinct mechanistic strategies. Furthermore, we found that SNT-1 mediates spontaneous neurotransmitter release through multiple pathways, involving not only the primary C2B--SNARE interface but also additional putative SNARE-binding interactions. Together, our findings uncover both conserved and divergent mechanisms for synaptic exocytosis regulated by the dual Ca2+ sensors in C. elegans.

                Background Tuberculosis remains a significant public health issue in Tunisia. This study aimed to describe the epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic characteristics of cervical lymph node tuberculosis and identify factors influencing outcomes. Methods A retrospective study was conducted over a 3-year period in the ENT department at La Rabta Hospital, Tunis. Diagnosis was based on histopathological evidence, and disease progression was categorized as favorable (treatment <9 months, no additional surgery) or unfavorable (treatment >9 months and/or supplementary surgery). The study population was divided into two groups based on the outcome nature, and analytical analysis was performed to assess factors influencing outcomes Results The study included 102 patients (32 men and 70 women), with a median age of 34.5 years (range: 8-83 years). Most patients (78.4%) had no significant medical history or known HIV infection. Thirty-nine patients (38.2%) had a history of consuming raw milk. In 65 cases (63.7%), lymph node size exceeded 3 cm. Hypoechogenicity (53.9%) and necrosis (40.1%) were the most common findings on ultrasound and CT scan, respectively. The initial diagnostic approach included adenectomy (56.8%), lymph node dissection (8.9%), and drainage of cold abscesses (34.3%). All patients received an initial four-drug antituberculosis regimen. Ethambutol treatment was extended beyond 2 months in 65 cases (63.7%). Fifty-six patients (54.9%) had a favorable outcome. Factors associated with a favorable outcome included intact skin, complete initial lymph node dissection, favorable progress at 2 months, and prolonged ethambutol therapy. Conclusions The management of lymph node tuberculosis remains challenging, especially with insufficient bacteriological confirmation. Regional epidemiological factors should be considered. The role of surgery is crucial; however, further standardization is needed to optimize patient outcomes.

Recent advancements of spatial sequencing technologies enable measurements of transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles within the same tissue slice, providing an unprecedented opportunity to understand cellular microenvironments. However, effective approaches for the integrative analysis of such spatial multi-omics data are lacking. Here, we propose SpaMI, a graph neural network-based model which extract features by contrastive learning strategy for each omics and integrate different omics by an attention mechanism to integrate spatial multi-omics data. We applied SpaMI to both simulated data and three real spatial multi-omics datasets derived from the same tissue slices, including spatial epigenome–transcriptome and transcriptome–proteome data. By comparing SpaMI with the state-of-the-art methods on simulation and real datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of SpaMI in identifying spatial domain and data denoising.

Large-scale single-cell projects generate rapidly growing datasets, but downstream analysis is often confounded by data sources, requiring data integration methods to do correction. Existing data integration methods typically require data centralization, raising privacy and security concerns. Here, we introduce Federated Harmony, a novel method combining properties of federated learning with Harmony algorithm to integrate decentralized omics data. This approach preserves privacy by avoiding raw data sharing while maintaining integration performance comparable to Harmony. Experiments on various types of single-cell data showcase superior results, highlighting a novel data integration approach for distributed multi-omics data without compromising data privacy or analytical performance.

                <p>by Hilaire Yam Fung Cheung, Chukiat Tantiwong, Dipali Kale, Jonathan M. Gibbins, Steve P. Watson, Johan W. M. Heemskerk, Albert Sickmann, Robert Ahrends, Joanne L. Dunster</p>

Phosphoinositides are a group of interconvertible lipids that are located in the membrane of eukaryotic cells. They turnover via complex network of reactions (called the phosphoinositide pathway) that respond rapidly to regulate many aspects of a cell’s response to their environment. Given their low-abundance they are difficult to characterise experimentally. Here we utilise a new experimental method to generate an unusually large dataset that characterises the time-dependent changes in five membrane bound phospoinositides and a soluble inositide in platelet, downstream of its GPVI receptor, where we know the phosphoinositide pathway is particularly active. To shed light on regulatotory steps that are often opaque to experimentation we use this data within a mathematical and computational framework. We construct and assess eleven mathematical models that represent competing interpretations of the dominant mechanisms that regulate the pathway. We find that while four of the models can generate the available data only one model, that incorporates an additional pool of PtdIns, is consistent with the data and is able to successfully predict the effects of an inhibitor. We publish all models openly in a form that is easily usable and adaptable for other researchers to use alongside our or their own data. We studied how changes in the shape and magnitude of events that stimulate the phosphoinositide pathway affect its dynamics. Despite these perturbations, the abundance of Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) remained stable, consistent with findings reported in the literature.

This study aimed to provide strategies to optimize the prevention and control measures of echinococcosis in Gansu Province. Based on the transmission mechanism of echinococcosis, a System Dynamics (SD) model of echinococcosis in Gansu Province was established using Vensim software. Through this model, parameters such as vaccination coverage, domestic dog deworming coverage, slaughter management level, and health education level were adjusted to predict the changing trends in the number of human cases and infected sheep. The results showed that the number of human cases was most sensitive to the adjustment of health education level, followed by changes to vaccination coverage. The number of infected sheep was most sensitive to the adjustment of vaccination coverage, followed by the adjustment of slaughter management level. Based on these simulation results, the prevention and control measures for echinococcosis in Gansu Province were further optimized. The results showed that if the health education level and the vaccination coverage were increased by 50% and 40%, respectively, based on the current prevention and control levels, the number of human cases would approach zero by approximately 2026. When the vaccination coverage and slaughter management level increased by 60% and 45%, respectively, based on current prevention and control levels, the number of infected sheep would approach zero by approximately 2027. This study applied the SD method to the prevention and control of echinococcosis for the first time, and the results can provide key decision-making recommendations to optimize the prevention and control measures of echinococcosis in Gansu province.

Recent studies have highlighted axonal myelination as a common feature of parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons throughout the cerebral cortex. However, the precise function of PV interneuron myelination remains incompletely understood. In this study, we used the cuprizone model of demyelination in mice to investigate how PV interneuron myelination might influence their neuronal physiology. Specifically, we examined whether impairing myelination from postnatal day 21 onwards, during a critical neurodevelopmental period of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), can affect PV interneuron maturation and function. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to examine intrinsic properties of PV interneurons in the PFC, we found that juvenile demyelination in mice induced robust alterations of PV interneuron firing patterns. Specifically, we observed that demyelination caused an impairment in the ability of PV interneurons to sustain high-frequency firing associated with a substantial decrease in Kv3-specific currents. We also found a significant impairment in PV interneuron autaptic self-inhibitory transmission, a feature implicated in temporal control of PV interneuron firing during cortical network activity. Following a remyelination period of 5 weeks, PV interneuron properties were only partially recovered, suggesting that transient juvenile demyelination leads to long-lasting impairments of PV interneuron function. In contrast, adult demyelination had no significant effects on PV interneuron firing properties. Together, our data uncovers a critical period for juvenile myelination as an important factor in PFC PV interneuron development and brain maturation.

                <p>by Julia von Knoerzer-Suckow, Eva-Helena Aden, Romuald Haase, Andreas Klingl, Ignasi Forné, Simon Gras</p>

During intracellular development, apicomplexan parasites reside within a parasitophorous vacuole largely derived from the host plasma membrane (PM) and rendered nonfusogenic with the host endolysosomal system. Yet, the parasite is capable of protein uptake from the host cell via endocytosis, which occurs via a conserved structure, the micropore. Recently the composition of the micropore was characterized and its stability was shown to depend on the presence of the kelch-domain protein K13 which is also central to malarial drug-resistance to artemisinin. Interestingly, depletion of K13 also resulted in an impressive accumulation of PM attached to or between individual parasites, suggesting that the micropore plays a critical role in PM homoeostasis. Here, we characterized the dynamics and recycling of the PM in <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>. In intracellular parasites, the PM is shared between individual parasites and undergoes a cycle of endocytosis and exocytosis during replication, similar to what has been previously demonstrated for extracellular parasites. This cycle appears to depend on Rab5b and MyoF. Interestingly, in contrast to <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, Rab5b is dispensable for the lytic cycle of <i>T. gondii</i>. During replication, parasites establish an extracellular plasma membrane reservoir (PMR) prior to daughter cell formation. The PMR is a dynamic membranous structure that varies in size and position throughout replication and disappears after daughter cell budding. Perturbation of the endo-exocytic balance disrupts PMR formation, leading to increased number and size of PMRs and, ultimately, to a complete loss of membrane organization directly linking endocytosis to the regulation of PMR formation.

                <p>by Ruiling Zhong, Claire E. Richardson</p>

Lysosomes are essential for neuronal homeostasis, providing degradation and recycling functions necessary to support neurons’ complex operations and long lifespans. However, the regulation of lysosomal degradative capacity in healthy neurons is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of HLH-30, the sole <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> homolog of Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosome biogenesis and autophagy that is thought to predominantly function in the context of starvation or stress. We demonstrate that HLH-30 is dispensable for neuronal development but acts cell-intrinsically to expand lysosomal degradative capacity during early adulthood. Loss of HLH-30 leads to lysosomal dysfunction and delayed turnover of synaptic vesicle proteins from the synapse. Notably, we show that basal HLH-30 activity is sufficient to expand neuronal lysosomal capacity without nuclear enrichment, in contrast to the nuclear translocation associated with starvation- and stress-induced activation of TFEB and HLH-30. Furthermore, we show that neuronal lysosomal function declines with age in wild-type animals, and this corresponds to a decrease in basal HLH-30-mediated transcription. We further demonstrate that basal HLH-30 activity is crucial for neuron maintenance: lysosomal dysfunction due to inadequate HLH-30 activity leads to dendrite degeneration and aberrant outgrowths. In summary, our study establishes a critical role for HLH-30/TFEB in promoting lysosomal capacity to preserve neuronal homeostasis and structural integrity of mature neurons in vivo.

     alt="Glutamatergic and GABAergic Synapses in the Human Spinal Dorsal Horn Revealed With Immunohistochemistry"/>
<p>Immunohistochemical analysis of synaptic proteins in the dorsal horn of the human spinal cord reveals the presence of the AMPA receptor subunit GluR2 and the GABAA-alpha 2 receptor subunit at most excitatory and inhibitory synapses in lamina II, respectively.

</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Primary afferent neurons detect sensory stimuli in the periphery and transmit this information to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, where it is processed by excitatory and inhibitory controls before being sent to the brain. Our understanding of the synaptic architecture of these spinal circuits in the rodent has been massively advanced using antibodies raised against scaffolding proteins Homer1 and gephyrin, which anchor glutamate and GABA receptors to the membrane, respectively. Few studies have attempted to visualize spinal cord synapses in human tissue, partly due to a lack of high-quality tissue with low postmortem intervals. In this study, we reveal both excitatory and inhibitory synapses at a high resolution in human lumbar spinal cord tissue using Homer1 and gephyrin immunolabeling and show that the basic organization of these proteins within the dorsal horn is similar to that in the rodent. Homer1+ puncta are highly colocalized with ionotropic glutamate receptors, and over 75% are in contact with a presynaptic axon terminal containing the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2). Similarly, most gephyrin+ profiles are coextensive with the GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>2</sub> subunit but fewer than 10% colocalize with Homer1+ puncta, confirming the specificity of these markers. Finally, we use Homer1 immunolabeling to demonstrate that primary afferents can form complex synaptic arrangements in human spinal cord. We conclude that these antibodies can be used as reliable tools for the study of human synaptic circuitry, and we have used them to reveal insight into the spinal connections underlying somatosensation that can be expanded upon in future studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70037?af=R">Changes in Naturalistic Viewing in Healthy Aging and Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Visual exploration—where the eyes move and when—is guided by prior experiences. Memory-guided viewing behavior is altered in healthy aging and is further disrupted in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a condition in which there is accelerated structural and functional decline of the hippocampus and associated medial temporal lobe structures (HC/MTL). Computational modeling has demonstrated the potential for rapid information flow from the HC/MTL to regions responsible for the cognitive control of eye movements, such that visual exploration behavior could be impacted in the moment and on an ongoing fashion. It was predicted here, then, that older adults and individuals with aMCI would show changes in naturalistic viewing compared to younger adults, even in the absence of any memory task. Multivariate analyses revealed that viewing for younger adults was characterized by larger saccade amplitudes and a larger area of exploration; the opposite pattern was reliably expressed by individuals with aMCI. Viewing patterns of healthy older adults were associated with shorter gaze durations. The entropy of viewing in older adults was associated with overall cognitive status, as determined by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, highlighting the top-down influence of cognitive function on active vision. Lower scores on the memory subtest were reliably associated with a pattern of viewing characterized by fewer fixations (with longer durations), saccades, regions explored, smaller area of exploration, and lower entropy, mimicking some of the viewing features of the aMCI group and suggesting that increasing HC/MTL decline results in less exploratory viewing patterns. These findings reveal the ongoing influence of the hippocampus and its extended system on moment-to-moment naturalistic viewing.</p>

                In a recent study, Spencer and colleagues demonstrated that high-frequency microsimulation of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) in individuals with Parkinson’s disease induces long-term potentiation (LTP)-like effects in the inhibitory pathways, leading to transient improvements in bradykinesia that can persist beyond stimulation cessation. Their results highlight the potential of leveraging synaptic plasticity mechanisms in deep brain stimulation (DBS) to optimize therapy.

                Using phenotypic and scRNA-seq comparative analyses, Dolgos et al. show that prostate cancer patient-derived organoids (PDOs) cultured in a Matrigel-free culture system exhibit cellular heterogeneity and preserve PCa patient-specific cell populations. An integrated prostate PDO single-cell atlas (PPScA) captures a spectrum of cellular identities and reveals pathways altered in vitro.

                Cao et al. identify DUSP14 as a molecule that influences tumor progression in triple-negative breast cancer in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the DUSP14-PTPN12-PPARα/SCD axis modulates ferroptosis in these cancer cells. The study suggests small-molecule inhibitors of DUSP14 as treatment options for patients with triple-negative breast cancer.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 30 September 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63809-0">doi:10.1038/s41467-025-63809-0</a></p>Recently there has been interest in using the orbital Hall effect to drive the magnetization of an adjacent ferromagnet. One metal, Tantalum, has been proposed a strong source of orbital current. Here, Liu and Zhu argue that the claimed orbital torques in Tantalum arise instead from self-induced spin-orbit torques in the adjacent ferromagnet.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87361">Viral genome sequence datasets display pervasive evidence of strand-specific substitution biases that are best described using non-reversible nucleotide substitution models</a></h4>

              
                Most phylogenetic trees are inferred using time-reversible evolutionary models that assume that the relative rates of substitution for any given pair of nucleotides are the same regardless of the direction of the substitutions. However, there is no reason to assume that the underlying biochemical mutational processes that cause substitutions are similarly symmetrical. We consider two non-reversible nucleotide substitution models: (1) a 6-rate non-reversible model (NREV6) that is applicable to analysing mutational processes in double-stranded genomes, in that complementary substitutions occur at identical rates and (2) a 12-rate non-reversible model (NREV12) that is applicable to analysing mutational processes in single-stranded (ss) genomes, in that all substitution types are free to occur at different rates. Using likelihood ratio and Akaike information criterion-based model tests, we show that, surprisingly, NREV12 provided a significantly better fit than the general time reversible (GTR) and NREV6 models to 21/31 dsRNA and 20/30 dsDNA datasets. As expected, however, NREV12 provided a significantly better fit to 24/33 ssDNA and 40/47 ssRNA datasets. We tested how non-reversibility impacts the accuracy with which phylogenetic trees are inferred. As simulated degrees of non-reversibility (DNRs) increased, the tree topology inferences using both NREV12 and GTR became more accurate, whereas inferred tree branch lengths became less accurate. We conclude that while non-reversible models should be helpful in the analysis of mutational processes in most virus species, there is no pressing need to use these models for routine phylogenetic inference.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104956">Design principles of transcription factors with intrinsically disordered regions</a></h4>

              
                Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins crucial for regulating gene expression. Effective regulation requires the TFs to rapidly bind to their correct target, enabling the cell to respond efficiently to stimuli such as nutrient availability or the presence of toxins. However, the search process is hindered by slow diffusive movement and the presence of ‘false’ targets – DNA segments that are similar to the true target. In eukaryotic cells, most TFs contain an intrinsically disordered region (IDR), which is commonly assumed to behave as a long, flexible polymeric tail composed of hundreds of amino acids. Recent experimental findings indicate that the IDR of certain TFs plays a pivotal role in the search process. However, the principles underlying the IDR’s role remain unclear. Here, we reveal key design principles of the IDR related to TF binding affinity and search time. Our results demonstrate that the IDR significantly enhances both of these aspects. Furthermore, our model shows good agreement with experimental results, and we propose further experiments to validate the model’s predictions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90375">Matrix-associated extracellular vesicles modulate human smooth muscle cell adhesion and directionality by presenting collagen VI</a></h4>

              
                The extracellular matrix (ECM) supports blood vessel architecture and functionality and undergoes active remodelling during vascular repair and atherogenesis. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are essential for vessel repair and, via their secretome, can invade from the vessel media into the intima to mediate ECM remodelling. Accumulation of fibronectin (FN) is a hallmark of early vascular repair and atherosclerosis. Here, we show that FN stimulates human VSMCs to secrete small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) by activating the β1 integrin/FAK/Src pathway as well as Arp2/3-dependent branching of the actin cytoskeleton. We found that sEVs are trapped by the ECM in vitro and colocalise with FN in symptomatic atherosclerotic plaques in vivo. Functionally, ECM-trapped sEVs induced the formation of focal adhesions (FA) with enhanced pulling forces at the cellular periphery preventing cellular spreading and adhesion. Proteomic and GO pathway analysis revealed that VSMC-derived sEVs display a cell adhesion signature and are specifically enriched with collagen VI on the sEV surface. In vitro assays identified collagen VI as playing a key role in cell adhesion and invasion directionality. Taken together, our data suggests that the accumulation of FN is a key early event in vessel repair acting to promote secretion of collagen VI enriched sEVs by VSMCs. These sEVs stimulate directional invasion, most likely by triggering peripheral focal adhesion formation and actomyosin contraction to exert sufficient traction force to enable VSMC movement within the complex vascular ECM network.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107157">Nuclear and cytosolic J-domain proteins provide synergistic control of Hsf1 at distinct phases of the heat shock response</a></h4>

              
                The heat shock response (HSR) is the major defense mechanism against proteotoxic stress in the cytosol and nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Initiation and attenuation of the response are mediated by stress-dependent regulation of heat shock transcription factors (HSFs). <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> encodes a single HSF (Hsf1), facilitating the analysis of HSR regulation. Hsf1 is repressed by Hsp70 chaperones under non-stress conditions and becomes activated under proteotoxic stress, directly linking protein damage and its repair to the HSR. J-domain proteins (JDPs) are essential for targeting of Hsp70s to their substrates, yet the specific JDP(s) regulating Hsf1 and connecting protein damage to HSR activation remain unclear. Here, we show that the yeast nuclear JDP Apj1 primarily controls the attenuation phase of the HSR by promoting Hsf1’s displacement from heat shock elements in target DNA. In <i>apj1Δ</i> cells, HSR attenuation is significantly impaired. Additionally, yeast cells lacking both Apj1 and the major JDP Ydj1 exhibit increased HSR activation even in non-stress conditions, indicating their distinct regulatory roles. Apj1’s role in both nuclear protein quality control and Hsf1 regulation underscores its role in directly linking nuclear proteostasis to HSR regulation. Together, these findings establish the nucleus as key stress-sensing signaling hub.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103676">Diverse calcium dynamics underlie place field formation in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells</a></h4>

              
                Every explored environment is represented in the hippocampus by the activity of distinct populations of pyramidal cells (PCs) that typically fire at specific locations called their place fields (PFs). New PFs are constantly born even in familiar surroundings (during representational drift), and many rapidly emerge when the animal explores a new or altered environment (during global or partial remapping). Behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity (BTSP), a plasticity mechanism based on prolonged somatic action potential (AP) bursts induced by dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup>/NMDA plateau potentials, was recently proposed as the main cellular mechanism underlying new PF formations (PFFs), but it is unclear whether burst-associated large somatic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transients are always necessary and/or sufficient for PFF. To address this issue, here we performed in vivo two-photon [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] imaging of hippocampal CA1 PCs in head-restrained mice to investigate somatic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] dynamics underlying PFFs in familiar and novel virtual environments. Our results demonstrate that although many PFs are formed by BTSP-like events, PFs also emerge with initial [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] dynamics that do not match any of the characteristics of BTSP. BTSP- and non-BTSP-like new PFFs occur spontaneously in familiar environments, during neuronal representational switches, and instantaneously in new environments. Our data also reveal that solitary [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transients with larger amplitudes than those evoking BTSP-like PFFs frequently occur without inducing PFs, demonstrating that large [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transients per se are not sufficient for PFF.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97839">Adaptations in wing morphology rather than wingbeat kinematics enable flight in small hoverfly species</a></h4>

              
                Due to physical scaling laws, size greatly affects animal locomotor ability and performance. Whether morphological and kinematic traits always jointly respond to size variation remains poorly known. Here, we examine the relative importance of morphological and kinematic changes in mitigating the consequence of size reduction on aerodynamic force production for weight support, focusing on the flight of hoverflies (Syrphidae). We compared the morphology of 28 hoverfly species, and the flight biomechanics and aerodynamics of eight species with body masses ranging from 5 to 100 mg. Our study reveals no significant effect of body mass on wingbeat kinematics among species, suggesting that morphological rather than kinematics changes compensate for the reduction in weight support associated with an isometric reduction in wing size. Computational fluid dynamics simulations confirmed that adaptations in wing morphology drive the ability of small hoverfly species to generate weight support, although variations in wingbeat kinematics among species cannot be entirely ignored. We show that smaller hoverflies have evolved relatively larger wings and aerodynamically more effective wing shapes, mitigating the reduction in aerodynamic weight support associated with isometric size reduction. Altogether, these results suggest that hoverfly flight underpins highly specialised wingbeat kinematics, largely conserved throughout evolution; instead, evolutionary adaptations in wing morphology enabled flight of small hoverflies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97341">Direct modulation of TRPM8 ion channels by rapamycin and analog macrolide immunosuppressants</a></h4>

              
                Rapamycin (sirolimus), a macrolide compound isolated from the bacterium <i>Streptomyces hygroscopicus</i>, is widely used as oral medication for the prevention of transplant rejection and the treatment of lymphangioleiomyomatosis. It is also incorporated in coronary stent coatings to prevent restenosis and in topical preparations for the treatment of skin disorders. Rapamycin’s in vivo activities are generally ascribed to its binding to the protein FKBP12, leading to potent inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) by the FKBP12-rapamycin complex. The specific rapamycin-induced interaction between domains from mTOR and FKBP12 is also frequently employed in cell biological research, for rapid chemically-induced protein dimerization strategies. Here, we show that rapamycin activates TRPM8, a cation channel expressed in sensory nerve endings that serves as the primary cold sensor in mammals. Using a combination of electrophysiology, Saturation Transfer Triple-Difference (STTD) NMR spectroscopy, and molecular docking-based targeted mutagenesis, we demonstrate that rapamycin directly binds to human TRPM8. We identify a rapamycin-binding site in the groove between voltage sensor-like domain and the pore domain, distinct from the interaction sites of cooling agents and known TRPM8 agonists menthol and icilin. Related macrolide immunosuppressants act as partial TRPM8 agonists, competing with rapamycin for the same binding site. These findings identify a novel molecular target for rapamycin and provide new insights into the mechanisms of TRPM8 activation, which may assist in the development of therapies targeting this ion channel. Moreover, our findings also indicate that caution is needed when using molecular approaches based on rapamycin-induced dimerization to study ion channel regulation.

                Astrocytes, which are increasingly recognized as pivotal constituents of brain circuits governing a wide range of functions, express GABA transporter 3 (Gat3), an astrocyte-specific GABA transporter responsible for maintenance of extra-synaptic GABA levels. Here, we examined the functional role of Gat3 in astrocyte-mediated modulation of neuronal activity and information encoding. First, we developed a multiplexed CRISPR construct applicable for effective genetic ablation of Gat3 in the visual cortex of adult mice. Using <i>in vivo</i> two-photon calcium imaging of visual cortex neurons in Gat3 knockout mice, we observed changes in spontaneous and visually driven single neuronal response properties such as response magnitudes and trial-to-trial variability. Gat3 knockout exerted a pronounced influence on population-level neuronal activity, altering the response dynamics of neuronal populations and impairing their ability to accurately represent stimulus information. These findings demonstrate that Gat3 in astrocytes profoundly shapes the sensory information encoding capacity of neurons and networks within the visual cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96402">Nonlinear feedback modulation contributes to the optimization of flexible decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity in the primate brain correlates with both sensory evaluation and action selection aspects of decision-making. However, the intricate interaction between these distinct neural processes and their impact on decision behaviors remains unexplored. Here, we examined the interplay of these decision processes in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) when monkeys performed a flexible decision task. We found that the PPC activity related to monkeys’ abstract decisions about visual stimuli was nonlinearly modulated by monkeys’ following saccade choices directed outside each neuron’s response field. Recurrent neural network modeling indicated that the feedback connections, matching the learned stimuli-response associations during the task, might mediate such feedback modulation. Further analysis on network dynamics revealed that selectivity-specific feedback connectivity intensified the attractor basins of population activity underlying saccade choices, thereby increasing the reliability of flexible decisions. These results highlight an iterative computation between different decision processes, mediated primarily by precise feedback connectivity, contributing to the optimization of flexible decision-making.

                Social learning enables a subject to make decisions by observing the actions of another. How neural circuits acquire relevant information during observation to guide subsequent behavior is unknown. Utilizing an observational spatial working memory task, we show that neurons in the rat anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) associated with spatial trajectories during self-running in a maze are reactivated when observing another rat running the same maze. The observation-induced ACC activities are reduced in error trials and are correlated with activities of hippocampal place cells representing the same trajectories. The ACC activities during observation also predict subsequent hippocampal place cell activities during sharp-wave ripples and spatial contents of hippocampal replay prior to self-running. The results support that ACC neurons involved in decisions during self-running are reactivated during observation and interact with hippocampal replay to guide subsequent spatial navigation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98221">A drug repurposing approach reveals targetable epigenetic pathways in Plasmodium vivax hypnozoites</a></h4>

              
                Radical cure of <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> malaria must include elimination of quiescent ‘hypnozoite’ forms in the liver; however, the only FDA-approved treatments are contraindicated in many vulnerable populations. To identify new drugs and drug targets for hypnozoites, we screened the Repurposing, Focused Rescue, and Accelerated Medchem (ReFRAME) library and a collection of epigenetic inhibitors against <i>P. vivax</i> liver stages. From both libraries, we identified inhibitors targeting epigenetics pathways as selectively active against <i>P. vivax</i> and <i>P. cynomolgi</i> hypnozoites. These include DNA methyltransferase inhibitors as well as several inhibitors targeting histone post-translational modifications. Immunofluorescence staining of <i>Plasmodium</i> liver forms showed strong nuclear 5-methylcystosine signal, indicating liver stage parasite DNA is methylated. Using bisulfite sequencing, we mapped genomic DNA methylation in sporozoites, revealing DNA methylation signals in most coding genes. We also demonstrated that methylation level in proximal promoter regions as well as in the first exon of the genes may affect, at least partially, gene expression in <i>P. vivax</i>. The importance of selective inhibitors targeting epigenetic features on hypnozoites was validated using MMV019721, an acetyl-CoA synthetase inhibitor that affects histone acetylation and was previously reported as active against <i>P. falciparum</i> blood stages. In summary, our data indicate that several epigenetic mechanisms are likely modulating hypnozoite formation or persistence and provide an avenue for the discovery and development of improved radical cure antimalarials.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90607">Non-cognate immunity proteins provide broader defenses against interbacterial effectors in microbial communities</a></h4>

              
                Dense microbial communities, like the gut and soil microbiomes, are dynamic societies. Bacteria can navigate these environments by deploying proteins that alter foreign cells’ behavior, such as interbacterial effectors. Current models suggest that adjacent sibling cells are protected by an immunity protein, as compared to toxin-antitoxin systems that act only within the effector-producing cell. A prevailing hypothesis is that immunity proteins binding to specific (cognate) protein partners is sufficient to disrupt effector function. Further, there is little-to-no crosstalk with other non-cognate effectors. In this research, we build on sporadic reports challenging these hypotheses. We show that immunity proteins from a newly defined protein family can bind and protect against non-cognate PD-(D/E)XK-containing effectors from diverse phyla. We describe the domains essential for binding and function and show that binding alone is insufficient for protective activity in <i>Proteus mirabilis</i>. Moreover, we found that these effector and immunity genes co-occur in individual human microbiomes. These results expand the growing repertoire of bacterial protection mechanisms and the models on how non-cognate interactions impact community structure within complex ecosystems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91774">Pesticide-induced resurgence in brown planthoppers is mediated by action on a suite of genes that promote juvenile hormone biosynthesis and female fecundity</a></h4>

              
                Pesticide-induced resurgence, increases in pest insect populations following pesticide application, is a serious threat to the sustainable control of many highly damaging crop pests. Resurgence can result from pesticide-enhanced pest reproduction; however, the molecular mechanisms mediating this process remain unresolved. Here we show that brown planthopper (BPH) resurgence in rice crops following exposure to sublethal doses of the pesticide emamectin benzoate (EB) results from the coordinated action of a suite of genes that regulate juvenile hormone (JH) levels, resulting in increased JH titer in adult females and enhanced fecundity. We demonstrate that EB treatment at sublethal levels results in profound changes in female BPH fitness, including increased egg maturation and oviposition. This enhanced reproductive fitness results from the EB-mediated upregulation of key genes involved in the regulation of JH, including <i>JHAMT and Kr-h1</i> and the downregulation of allatostatin (<i>AstA</i>) and allatostatin receptor (<i>AstAR</i>) expression. AstA signaling is known to inhibit the production of JH in the corpora allata and hence EB exposure diminishes this inhibitory action. We find that the changes in gene expression following EB exposure are caused by the allosteric action of this insecticide on its molecular target, the glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluClα). Collectively, these results provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of negative pesticide-induced responses in insects and reveal some key actors involved in the JH-signaling pathway that underpin pesticide resurgence.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106621">Sparse innervation and local heterogeneity in the vibrissal corticostriatal projection</a></h4>

              
                The density and overlap of cortical axons in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) have suggested that striatal neurons integrate widespread information from cortical regions that are functionally related. However, in vivo, DLS neuronal responses to sensory stimuli have shown unexpectedly high selectivity, raising questions about the actual degree of convergence of functional corticostriatal projections on individual striatal cells. Here, we investigated this question by focusing on the projections from different whisker cortical columns in mice, as they overlap in the striatum and are co-active during behavior. Using ex vivo patch-clamp recordings in the DLS and glutamate uncaging for focal stimulations in the barrel cortex, we were able to map the location of presynaptic neurons to individual striatal projection neurons (SPNs). We found that each SPN was innervated by cells located in a small number of whisker cortical columns scattered across the barrel field in the slice. Connectivity of single SPNs with cortical neurons was thus highly discontinuous horizontally, despite the presence of more potential connections. Moreover, connectivity patterns were specific to each cell, with neighboring SPNs sharing few common clusters of presynaptic cells in the cortex. Despite this sparse and distinct innervation of individual SPNs, the projection was topographically organized at the population level. Finally, we found similar innervation patterns for D1- and D2-type SPNs, but observed differences in synaptic strength in their connections with certain cortical layers, notably the associative layer 2/3. Our results suggest that the high convergence of somatosensory inputs to the striatum, enabled by diffuse and overlapping cortical innervation, is accomplished through sparse yet complementary connectivity to individual SPNs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103959">Representation of male features in the female mouse accessory olfactory bulb, and their stability during the estrus cycle</a></h4>

              
                Most behaviors result from integration of external and internal inputs. For example, social behavior requires information about conspecifics and internal physiological states. Like many other mammals, female mice undergo a reproductive cycle during which their physiology and behavioral responses to males change dramatically: during estrus, they are more receptive to male mating attempts. A critical element in reproductive behavior is the investigative stage, which in mice and many other species, strongly relies on chemosensation. While the initial approach mostly involves the main olfactory system (MOS), once physical contact is established, the vomeronasal system (VNS) is engaged to provide information about potential partners’ characteristics. Given the estrus-stage-dependent behavioral response, we asked whether representations of male features in the first brain relay of the VNS, namely, the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), change during the cycle. To this end, we used a stimulus set comprising urine samples from males of different strains and virility levels, as well as from estrus and non-estrus females. The stimulus set was designed to reveal if response patterns of AOB neurons conform to ethologically relevant dimensions such as sex, strain, and particularly, male virility state. Using extracellular recordings in anesthetized female mice, we find that most ethological categories contained in our dataset are not overrepresented by AOB neurons, suggesting that early stages of VNS processing encode conspecific information efficiently. Then, comparing neuronal activity in estrus and non-estrus females, we found that overall, response characteristics at the single neuron and population levels remain stable during the reproductive cycle. The few changes that do occur are not consistent with a systematic modulation of responses to male features. Our findings imply that the AOB presents a stable account of conspecific features to more advanced processing stages.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104045">Telomeres control human telomerase (TERT) expression through non-telomeric TRF2</a></h4>

              
                The function of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (referred hereafter as <i>TERT</i>) in the synthesis and maintenance of chromosome ends, or telomeres, is widely understood. Whether and how telomeres, on the other hand, influence <i>TERT</i> regulation is relatively less studied. We found <i>TERT</i> was transcriptionally altered depending on telomere length (TL). This resulted from TL-dependent binding of TRF2 between telomeres and the <i>TERT</i> promoter. <i>TERT</i> promoter-bound TRF2 was non-telomeric and did not involve the looping of telomeres to the <i>TERT</i> promoter. Cell lines from different tissue types fibrosarcoma (HT1080), colon cancer (HCT116), and breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), engineered for either telomere elongation/shortening, gave an increase/decrease in <i>TERT</i>, respectively. Mechanistically, we show <i>TERT</i> promoter-bound non-telomeric TRF2 recruits the canonical PRC2-complex, inducing repressor histone H3K27-trimethylation in a TL-dependent fashion. This was further supported by TL-dependent promoter activity from an exogenously inserted <i>TERT</i> reporter. Increase in TL over days followed by a gradual decline, resulted in activation followed by repression of <i>TERT</i> in a concerted manner, further implicating TL as a key factor for <i>TERT</i> regulation. Notably, on reprogramming primary fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), TRF2 loss from the <i>TERT</i> promoter was evident along with telomere elongation and <i>TERT</i> upregulation. Conversely, on telomere shortening in iPSCs, <i>TERT</i> promoter-bound TRF2 was restored with a marked reduction in <i>TERT,</i> further supporting the causal role of TL in <i>TERT</i> transcription. Mechanisms of tight control of <i>TERT</i> by TL shown here are likely to have major implications in telomere-related physiologies, particularly, cancer, ageing, and pluripotency.

">Mena-dependent local translation of PI3K-p85 coordinates the axonal regenerative program upon injury</a></h4>

              
                Local translation (LT) is one of the first processes activated after nerve injury and is critically coupled with the intrinsic ability of axons to grow and regenerate. However, regulation of LT in adult axons remains highly unexplored. Here we identify the actin regulator Mena, as a key mediator of adult axon regeneration, via its control of local protein synthesis. We show that Mena directly associates with PI3K-p85 mRNA and regulates its LT in injured sciatic nerve axons, thereby activating the downstream AKT/mTOR pathway. Genetic ablation of Mena disrupts this intrinsic response, resulting in impaired axonal LT and diminished axon regeneration in vivo. Our findings identify a Mena-dependent mechanism that remodels the local axonal proteome and reveal a critical link between mRNA regulation and metabolic signaling during axon regeneration.

">Anesthesia Induces Shifts in Spatial Frequency Preference in the Primary Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                General anesthesia markedly reduces overall brain responsiveness to external stimuli. Animal studies reveal that in individual neurons of the primary visual cortex (V1), anesthesia modulates the gain of neural responses while leaving orientation and direction tuning unaltered. However, the impact of anesthesia on spatial frequency (SF) tuning is largely unexplored despite it being a fundamental characteristic of visual perception. Furthermore, compared to excitatory neurons, the effects of anesthesia on the visual responsiveness of specific inhibitory neuron subtypes are poorly understood. Here, we directly compared visual responses from the same V1 neurons in mice under both anesthetized and awake states. We found that isoflurane anesthesia significantly shifts the preferred SFs of excitatory neurons to lower values. This downward shift was even more pronounced in inhibitory neurons. These downshifts selectively impaired the neural coding of high-SF information while leaving low-SF coding unaffected. We observed distinct patterns of anesthesia-induced downward shifts of preferred SFs between two major cortical inhibitory neuron subtypes: somatostatin-expressing (SOM) and parvalbumin-expressing (PV) neurons. Furthermore, anesthesia-induced changes in response gain and tuning sharpness were evident in SOM neurons but not in PV neurons. These results highlight the diverse effects of anesthesia on sensory responses, varying significantly based on both the visual feature processed and the specific neuron subtype involved. The consistent decrease in preferred SFs during anesthesia not only suggests a potential mechanism for anesthesia-induced alterations in sensory experience but also emphasizes the critical role of heightened SF preference during wakefulness for fine object perception.

">A Syntaxin1A protein mutation drives sleep reduction in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Syntaxin1A is a key component in the regulation of the vesicle fusion nanomachine and, together with VAMP/synaptobrevin and SNAP-25, forms the core of the SNARE complex, that is the molecular nanomachine regulating neurotransmitter release. Syntaxin1A is localized on the cytosolic face of the presynaptic membrane and with Munc-18-1 is thought to be the starting point for the SNARE complex assembly. In flies, aspartic-to-arginine amino acid substitution at position 253 of the protein sequence reduces synaptic release by affecting the assembly of multiple SNARE complexes into a super-complex without interfering with the single complex formation per se. In this study, we analyzed sleep behavior in flies expressing this mutated isoform of Syntaxin1A pan-neuronally. According to the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis, the overall decrease of synaptic activity during the previous period of wakefulness should reduce the need for sleep. We observed a reduction in the total amount of sleep in flies expressing the mutated isoform compared to controls. Moreover, the sleep pattern of the Syntaxina1A mutant flies was more fragmented compared to controls. Video-tracking analysis of free walking flies in an open-field arena showed that these changes were not caused by higher locomotor activity during the daytime relative to controls. Our results suggest that the widespread effect of Syntaxin1A mutation on synapses may lead to a dampening of the information load among neurons and, consequently, impact the regulation of sleep at the cellular level.

">REDUCED ALPHA-BAND PHASE COHERENCE AND CORTICAL COMPLEXITY IN FIBROMYALGIA: A TMS-EEG EXPLORATORY STUDY</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Cortico-spinal excitability of the primary motor cortex (M1) is reduced in fibromyalgia, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) targeting M1 normalizes these changes and relieves symptoms. TMS combined with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) allows the measurement of M1 excitability and its connectivity to other regions, which may help clarify neurophysiological effects in fibromyalgia. We assessed cortical excitability, oscillatory activity, and complexity in individuals with fibromyalgia compared to pain-free healthy controls. Methods: Global and local mean field power, peak-to-peak amplitude, event-related spectral perturbation, intertrial coherence (ITC), natural frequency, and perturbational complexity index (PCIst) of the EEG response after left-M1 TMS were compared between groups (n=18 fibromyalgia; n=15 controls). Pain intensity, interference, relief of current therapy, mood, and quality of life were assessed in individuals with fibromyalgia. Results: Compared with controls, individuals with fibromyalgia showed a reduction in the alpha-band ITC in middle and right parieto-occipital areas (P<0.05). Middle-parieto-occipital ITC negatively correlated with reported pain relief (rho=-0.552, p=0.019). The PCIst was lower in fibromyalgia compared with controls (P<0.01) and correlated with higher pain interference in general activity (rho=-0.486, p=0.042). Conclusion: Individuals with fibromyalgia showed abnormal cortical connectivity compared with asymptomatic controls. Significance: TMS-EEG measurements may provide insights on brain connectivity relevant for therapy.

">Integrative multiomic analysis links TDP-43-driven splicing defects to cascading proteomic disruption of ALS/FTD pathways</a></h4>

              
                Loss of nuclear TDP-43 is a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Although TDP-43 is known to regulate RNA processing, including repression of cryptic exons, we currently lack a systems-level understanding of the consequences of TDP-43 loss. To address this, we generated multiomic datasets, including RNA-seq and proteomics, from human iPSC-derived neurons depleted of TDP-43. We found that differentially spliced genes, many expressing cryptic exons, had the greatest protein reductions. Surprisingly, nearly half of differentially expressed proteins were neither mis-spliced, nor differentially expressed genes; most of these also had no reported mis-splicing in seven additional post-mortem and iPSC-derived neuron datasets. Integrative network analysis identified a high-confidence disease-specific subnetwork of over 700 interacting proteins, enriched for mRNA processing, synaptic function, and autophagy. Comparison with post-mortem ALS and FTD samples revealed convergent protein and pathway disruptions. We experimentally validated network-predicted effects of cryptic splicing in ATG4B, STMN2, and DAPK1. Our analyses reveal new TDP-43-dependent molecular cascades and nominate central genes as potential ALS/FTD therapeutic targets.

">Learning induces persistent chromatin loops underlying robust gene expression during memory recall</a></h4>

              
                Long-term memories are stored in neuronal ensembles called engrams, but the existence of persistent molecular traces in nuclei of engram neurons remain unknown. Using activity-dependent nuclear tagging in vivo, we profiled higher-order chromatin folding and DNA methylation in thousands of single hippocampal neurons up to a month after contextual fear conditioning (CFC). We find CFC-induced chromatin loop plasticity genome-wide, including persistently gained and lost loops with enduring traces in vivo. DNA methylation showed minimal CFC-induced persistence at promoters and enhancers. Persistently gained and lost loops connect distinct enhancers and promoters in excitatory and inhibitory subtypes and correlate with robust CFC-upregulated and -downregulated gene expression, respectively, upon recall. Synaptic genes associated with post-traumatic stress disorder and autism anchor neuronal subtype-specific persistent loops, suggesting relevance to neuropsychiatric dysfunction. We harness the power and sensitivity of multi-modal single-cell measurements to find enduring chromatin traces linked to robust gene expression during fear memory recall.

">Mutations in antimicrobial peptides differently affect sleep and plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Molecules implicated in host defense can, independent of their roles as immune mediators, regulate sleep. In mammals, cytokines such as Tumor Necrosis Factor  (TNF ) and Interleukin 1{beta} (IL1 {beta}) promote sleep. In Drosophila, infection stimulates the systemic release of a battery of anti-microbial peptides (AMPs). These fly immune effectors have been understudied as sleep modulators. We obtained mutants in different AMPs and characterized their functions in sleep and sleep dependent outputs. AMP mutants sleep less with a longer sleep latency, and low-ered arousal thresholds. Group C mutant flies, doubly mutant for the anti-fungal peptides Metchinikowin (Mtk) and Drosomycin (Drs), showed the greatest impairments. These Group C mutants also showed an exaggerated sleep rebound. Sleep rebound was unaltered in other mutants. Different sets of AMP mutants exhibited specific disrup-tions in socialization and rocking induced sleep. These data are a detailed characterization of sleep regulation in AMP mutants. We also evaluated sleep functions. Group C mutants uniquely exhibited normal learning and memory, and lower synapse abundance, despite sleeping the least. Group C mutants are thus able to carry out some sleep functions without sleeping very much. Glial knockdown of Metchnikowin and Drosomycin mimicked the sleep phenotypes of the null mutants, these genes thus act from glia. Sleep and memory defects in AMP mutants was reversible - enhancing sleep of Bomanin mutants pharmacologically or behaviorally improved learning and memory. Together, these data suggest that AMPs are potent sleep modulators and that different classes of AMPs differently affect sleep and sleep dependent outcomes.

">The central complex of the larval fruit fly brain</a></h4>

              
                In holometabolous insects such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the brain central complex (CX) develops during metamorphosis and serves the adult stage. Whether a form of the CX exists in the brain of the evolutionarily novel larval stages is not known. Here, we analyzed the connectome of the larval brain and, on the basis of neuronal lineages, synaptic connectivity patterns, and anatomy, identified a putative larval CX, comprising 4 key neuropils: the protocerebral bridge (PB), the ellipsoid body (EB), the fan-shaped body (FB) and the noduli (NO). Consistent with our interpretation, we found in the larval brain synaptic connectivity patterns characteristic of the adult, including (i) visual input into the PB and EB; (ii) modulation of CX neuropil inputs by the mushroom body (MB); (iii) reciprocal connectivity between CX neuropils and select MB compartments; and (iv) strong connectivity between CX neuropils. While some neuronal lineages contributing to the larval CX do not contribute to the adult CX, many others are conserved. The characterization of a larval CX brings structure to largely unexamined larval brain circuits, linking with a vast body of literature, and will inform the design of experiments to probe larval brain function.

">miR155 triplicated in Down syndrome regulates hippocampal GABAergic neurogenesis in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                MicroRNA dysregulation is implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The role of neuronal microRNA155 (miR155), elevated in both AD and Down syndrome (DS), remains unknown. We found that MIR155HG (miR155 host gene) colocalizes with APP (amyloid-beta precursor protein) in a neuron-specific, topologically-associated domain (TAD) within a regulatory network, in the obligate portion of chromosome 21 triplicated in DS which causes AD neuropathology and in most cases, dementia. We investigated miR155 role during neuron development and then validated these findings in an amyloidopathy model. In human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neural stem cells (NSCs), cortical neurons and cortical organoids, MIR155 deletion enhanced NSC proliferation, ventral patterning and GABAergic interneuron generation. However, MIR155 overexpression inhibited NSC marker expression and GABAergic interneuron generation. MIR155 upregulates its mRNA targets, NR2F1/2, key modulators of hippocampal GABAergic interneuron development. In an amyloidopathy mouse model, miR155 deletion induced the expansion of hippocampal NSCs and increased hippocampal GABAergic interneurons. These findings reveal previously unrecognized miR155 roles in NSC dynamics and GABAergic interneuron development which directionally diverge from extensively studied microglial miR155 in their beneficial vs negative impact on AD mouse models, suggesting that approaching miR155 therapeutically may require balancing the effects in neurons and microglia.

">Descending neurons integrate learnt information from mushroom body with context to promote escape behaviour</a></h4>

              
                To behave adaptively in the environment and select appropriate responses to sensory stimuli, animals integrate learnt information about the valences of stimuli with contextual information. While significant progress has been made in understanding how animals learn which stimuli predict positive and negative outcomes, how the outputs of associative learning circuits flexibly promote different behaviours, depending on context, is not well understood. Addressing this question requires mapping the pathways from learning circuits to nerve cord command neurons that promote specific actions, and understanding where and how contextual information converges with these pathways to modulate their activity. These are daunting tasks in larger brains where synaptic-resolution connectivity maps are not available. We, therefore, addressed this question in the tractable Drosophila larva using a combination of connectomic analyses, imaging and manipulation of neural activity and behavioural analysis. We characterised, with synaptic-resolution, the pathways from the higher-order learning circuit (the mushroom body, MB) all the way to a specific cord command neuron (Goro) in the nerve cord that promotes the most vigorous escape response, rolling. Rolling is the fastest, but also the most energetically costly escape response and is activated by multisensory cues in the context of predator attack. We identify a pair of brain descending neurons, Ipsigoro, that integrate learnt information (via input from MBONs) and nociceptive context (via input from ascending neurons) to facilitate rolling via direct inputs to Goro. Our study reveals the circuit mechanism by which context and learnt information are integrated by brain descending neurons to activate specific nerve cord command neurons and promote specific actions.

">GABAA receptor gating imaged on the millisecond timescale</a></h4>

              
                Type-A {gamma}-aminobutyric receptors (GABAARs) are fast pentameric ligand gated ion channels (pLGICs). Within a millisecond, saturating agonist concentrations trigger activity bursts consisting of high-frequency fluctuations between conductive and non-conductive states. These can last for tens to hundreds of milliseconds until, stochastically, receptors adopt stable, long-lived, desensitised conformations. This highly dynamic process, known as gating, controls transient passages of chloride ions across plasma membranes to enable neurotransmission and other fundamental processes in animal physiology. The conformational transitions inside activity bursts, inferred from electrophysiology, have remained inaccessible to structural biology investigation. Here we describe the gating motions of three GABAA receptor variants imaged within the first 10 milliseconds of agonist application by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). We illustrate how activation and desensitisation proceed through multiple asymmetric states, supported by major secondary, tertiary and quaternary structural rearrangements, and demonstrate that the same gating principles apply to both homomeric and heteromeric GABAARs. Furthermore, we show that cholesterol and phospholipids stabilise newly formed inter-subunit interfaces and obstruct channel pores in short-lived desensitised states, while phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) precludes the opening of both 1{beta}3 and 1{beta}3{gamma}2 GABAAR channels. Our results provide a novel framework to interpret decades of electrophysiology observations and suggest a broadly applicable approach to investigate mechanistically the vast arrays of physiological and pharmacological modulators of GABAARs and other fast neurotransmitter receptors. Moreover, the subunit interfaces and lipid-binding pockets that form and disappear during GABAAR gating provide new opportunities to discover modulators with improved specificity and therapeutic properties.

                Complete synaptic wiring diagrams, or connectomes, of whole brains open new opportunities for studying the structure-function relationship of neural circuits. However, the large number of nodes and edges in the graphs makes the analysis challenging. Here, we present the Connectome Interpreter (https://github.com/YijieYin/connectome_interpreter), an open-source software toolkit for efficient graph traversal to find polysynaptic pathways, compute the effective connectivity and receptive fields for arbitrarily deep neurons, slice out subcircuits, and non-linear but differentiable circuit modeling, implemented using efficient approaches tailored to the high density and size of connectomes such as that of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Our approach delivers results orders of magnitude faster than conventional methods in consumer computer hardware. We demonstrate the capabilities of our toolkit with select applications, including quantifying the density of polysynaptic connections in the whole adult fruit fly brain, exploring the necessity for non-linearities in circuit modeling, and combining known function of neurons with the connectome to aid in formulating hypotheses of circuit function.

">Sex differences in latent inhibition and their implications for psychotic disorders</a></h4>

              
                Latent inhibition (LI) has been extensively studied to investigate associative learning and memory processes as well as modelling aberrant attribution of salience to irrelevant stimuli in both humans and animals, a process which is thought to underpin hallucinations and delusions in psychosis. Despite sex differences observed in numerous aspects of psychosis, few studies have attempted to characterise sex differences in LI. This systematic review outlines the current evidence of sex differences in LI in both human and rodent studies, showing predominantly inconclusive and conflicting evidence for sex differences. We present data demonstrating sex differences in latent inhibition of contextual fear conditioning and associated gene expression in the hippocampus in rodents, supporting sex differences in latent inhibition at the behavioural and neurobiological levels. The systematic review suggests that although there have been relatively few studies of sex differences in LI, the data suggest that in hippocampally dependent forms of LI, sex differences may be more apparent, which may be of relevance in relation to sex differences in the presentation of psychosis.

">Lifespan Trajectories of Asymmetry in White Matter Tracts</a></h4>

              
                Asymmetry in white matter is believed to give rise to the brain's capacity for specialized processing and is involved in the lateralization of various cognitive processes, such as language and visuo-spatial reasoning. Although studies of white matter asymmetry have been previously documented, they have often been constrained by limited age ranges, sample sizes, or the scope of the tracts and structural features examined. While normative lifespan charts for brain structures are emerging, comprehensive charts detailing white matter asymmetries across numerous pathways and diverse structural measures have been notably absent. This study addresses this gap by leveraging a large-scale dataset of 26,199 typically developing and aging individuals, ranging from 0 to 100 years of age, from 42 primary neuroimaging studies. We generated comprehensive lifespan trajectories for 30 lateralized association and projection white matter tracts, examining 14 distinct microstructural and macrostructural features of these pathways. Our findings reveal that: (1) asymmetries are widespread across the brain's white matter and are present in all 30 pathways; (2) for a given pathway, the degree and direction of asymmetry differ between features of tissue microstructure and pathway macrostructure; (3) asymmetries vary across and within pathway types (association and projection tracts); and (4) these asymmetries are not static, following unique trajectories across the lifespan, with distinct changes during development, and a general trend of becoming more asymmetric with increasing age (particularly in later adulthood) across pathways. This study represents the most extensive characterization of white matter asymmetry across the lifespan to date, charting how lateralization patterns emerge, mature, and change throughout life. It provides a foundational resource for understanding the principles of white matter organization from early to late life, its relation to functional specialization and inter-individual variability, and offers a key reference for interpreting deviations during healthy development and aging as well as those associated with clinical populations.

">Edge communities in functional brain networks reveal heterogeneous, overlapping organization across the human lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Understanding changes in functional brain organization and their implications in development and aging is one of the central questions in neuroscience. In this study, we used an edge-centric approach to examine cross-sectional differences in functional brain network organization across the human lifespan using resting state functional MRI data from the Nathan Kline Institute - Rockland Sample dataset. By creating edge time series - a framewise multiplication of nodal time series - and clustering them based on their temporal similarities, we were able to identify clusters of edges instead of nodes. This method naturally allows multiple community affiliations per node (brain region), providing a nuanced perspective on network participation compared to conventional hard-partition approaches. To do so, we created age-neutral templates of edge communities - or "eFC lures" - that, when applied, yielded consistent edge communities across non-overlapping subsamples of data. The communities of edges revealed a trajectory of desegregation with aging, suggested to be linked to neural dedifferentiation of activity and cognitive decline in older adults. Additionally, age group-specific lures significantly enhanced the detection of edge community organization compared to the age-neutral version. Combined, these results offer new insights into the heterogeneous, event cluster-level shifts in brain functional organization as well as underscore the importance of age-targeted analytical frameworks throughout the human lifespan.

">Single-Neuron Encoding of Learnability in the Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex</a></h4>

              
                In natural environments, associations that indicate true learnable regularities are intermixed with those that arise from random and ultimately unlearnable relationships between events. To efficiently allocate cognitive resources and avoid inferring spurious patterns, organisms must distinguish learnable from unlearnable associations, but the mechanisms underlying this ability are not understood. We recently showed that monkeys performing a transitive inference task, while discovering the true hidden order in learnable image sets, also behaved to varying degrees as if they inferred subjective order in objectively random (unlearnable) image sets. Here, we show that the ability to detect learnability is encoded by neurons in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC, area 24c). dACC neurons responded strongly after a decision outcome as reported in previous studies and, additionally, signaled whether a trial was from a learnable vs unlearnable set before outcome delivery, and showed interactions whereby their selectivity for the outcome (reward vs lack of reward) was stronger for learnable versus unlearnable sets. Learnability and interaction responses were independent of sensory or reward cues (which were equated for learnable and unlearnable sets) but their strength correlated with the monkeys ability to avoid inferring false order in unlearnable sets. The findings suggest that the dACC is part of a network that monitors learnability and enables animals to appropriately focus learning on true patterns while avoiding false inferences about spurious and random associations.

">Neural dynamics reveal foraging-like computations in the frontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The prefrontal cortex has a central role in flexible behavior. Computations for weighing alternatives, committing to an option, integrating evidence, and abandoning an option are dominantly formalized in reinforcement learning (RL). Yet, ecological considerations showcase foraging as a competing account. Identifying how the brain actually solves efficient weighing of options requires the identification of the neural representation of this abstract yet precise computation. We recorded neural populations from three areas of the primate frontal cortex involved in decision making to characterize neural dynamics while animals performed a standard RL task. By combining behavioral and neuron population analysis, we found a neural subspace in midcingulate (MCC) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vLPFC) that precisely tracked value computations. We demonstrated that MCC dynamics showed signatures of foraging-like computation but conflicted with RL requirements. Our study thus provides a detailed neural account of foraging-like flexibility in the primate frontal cortex.

">Sensorimotor beta burst dynamics and interhemispheric connectivity in children with developmental coordination disorder</a></h4>

              
                Activity in the beta frequency band appears to play a critical role in various sensorimotor processes, with transient "bursts" of beta displaying distinct waveform motifs reflecting different neural processes. However, much remains unknown about how beta bursts develop, and hence the role they may play in sensorimotor difficulties associated with neurodevelopmental conditions. Here, we used EEG to investigate sensorimotor beta bursts in children with and without developmental coordination disorder (DCD), which is associated with impaired motor control and atypical brain connectivity. However, the neural dynamics underlying these differences remain unclear. We characterized beta bursts during action execution and observation of gross and fine motor actions. Although overall burst features were similar across groups in the spectral domain, children with DCD showed disrupted rate modulation of specific burst waveform motifs, characterized by atypical lateralization and altered interhemispheric connectivity. These disruptions were strongest for a subset of burst types identified by principal component analysis, and individual differences in motif-specific burst rates correlated with motor ability. Our findings suggest that selective recruitment of distinct beta burst motifs and related disruption of interhemispheric communication may represent an important mechanism underlying motor difficulties in DCD. This work highlights the importance of burst waveform diversity for understanding typical and atypical motor development.

">Working memory expands shared task representations in cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cognition is thought to emerge from the flexible organization of neural activity, yet how this organization reconfigures across behaviors varying in cognitive load remains unclear. We investigated how the structure of working-memory representations in the cortex compares to task representations that do not involve working memory. We used a task-switching paradigm in virtual reality, where mice alternated between a navigation-based working-memory task and a simpler task with matched sensorimotor demands. During behavior, we simultaneously imaged three cortical areas: higher visual area AM, and two association areas-premotor (M2) and retrosplenial cortex. At the single-neuron level, trial-averaged activity appeared similar across tasks. However, pairwise correlations decreased during the working-memory task, particularly in association areas. In addition, the corresponding linear task subspace explained the variance of both tasks equally well, whereas the simpler task subspace failed to do so, suggesting an asymmetric relationship between them. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction revealed a shared low-dimensional structure across tasks. Yet, the organization of neuronal firing fields along this shared structure accounted for the difference in pairwise correlations: in the working-memory task, firing fields were more disjoint, especially among neurons in association areas that formed sequences along the memory dimension. Moreover, the degree of overlap between these firing fields predicted the mice's behavioral reliance on working memory. We conclude that behaviors varying in cognitive demands are supported by a single low-dimensional neural structure, which can expand or contract depending on cognitive load. We thus provide a framework for how task representations across the cortex reconfigure to support cognitive processes.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Humans and animals are able to rapidly, and with reasonable accuracy, estimate the number of objects in a visual scene. Visual-evoked potential studies have described a sequence of functionally distinct stages associated with numerosity perception. Recently, a specialized cognitive-perceptual system for the numerosity estimation for human stimuli (NEH), distinct from that for non-social stimuli, was revealed using virtual reality, revealing a stable NEH overestimation bias (ie perceiving more people than were shown). This bias was further increased when a social hallucination characterized by the false perception of another invisible person (presence hallucination) was induced robotically and repeatedly prior to NEH trials. However, little is known about the brain mechanisms of NEH and robot-induced presence hallucination. Here we combined virtual reality and robotically-induced presence hallucination with visual-evoked potentials to investigate the neural mechanisms and processing steps of NEH. We report that NEH induces numerosity-related components as observed for non-human numerosity stimuli and, critically that experimentally-induced presence hallucination selectively modulated the P2p component, whose amplitude correlated with NEH overestimation magnitude. This effect was localized in left extrastriate cortex, showing that robot-induced presence hallucination are integrated with NEH processing during the P2p time period and relying on social numerosity mechanisms in extrastriate cortex.</span>

                Background Academic staff performance plays a critical role in the success of higher education institutions. In Uganda’s private university sector, understanding how demographic characteristics affect academic staff performance can inform more equitable and effective human resource practices. This study investigated the extent to which demographic factors influence academic performance among academic staff in private universities in Uganda. Methods A cross-sectional quantitative research design was used, involving 386 academic staff members from selected private universities. Data were collected through structured questionnaires and analyzed using Pearson product-moment correlation to assess the relationships between demographic characteristics (gender, age, education level, position, years of teaching experience, and field of specialty) and indicators of academic performance. Results The analysis revealed several statistically significant correlations. The highest level of education attained was positively associated with years of teaching experience (r = .504, p < .01) and academic position (r = .619, p < .01). Years of teaching experience also showed a positive correlation with academic performance (r = .230, p < .01). Gender exhibited a weak but significant negative relationship with education level (r = –.123, p < .05) and teaching experience (r = –.115, p < .05), suggesting gender-related disparities in academic progression. Additionally, age group correlated moderately with education level (r = .292, p < .01) and academic position (r = .295, p < .01), reflecting career advancement over time. Beyond these statistical associations, the findings show that demographic characteristics such as gender, qualifications, academic rank, and field of specialty actively shape academic staff performance through access to opportunities, research engagement, and teaching responsibilities. Conclusions The study demonstrates that demographic factors particularly education level, experience, and academic rank significantly influence academic staff performance in private universities in Uganda. These findings highlight the need for universities to develop staff management and development policies that account for demographic diversity. Tailored interventions in recruitment, promotion, and retention can enhance institutional effectiveness and equity in academic staff development.

                Background Higher education at the university level is essential for advanced learning, enhancing academic knowledge, and precipitating significant life changes. These include lifestyle adjustments, relocation from one’s primary residence, and the acquisition of autonomy in decision-making. Numerous students opt to reside in dormitories, resulting in notable alterations in dietary habits. Campus cuisine differs substantially from their previous domestic diets, potentially influencing their overall growth and development during their academic tenure. Method The study uses the theory of planned behavior to conceptualize and understand university students’ food choices, employing qualitative research and a phenomenological approach. Snowball sampling selected 26 undergraduate and postgraduate students in technical and health science programs from a private university in Udupi who were residing on campus for two to four years. Online interviews were audio-recorded with participants’ consent. Results Transcribed interviews were coded and categorized to identify themes, which were subsequently conceptualized to develop a model based on the theory of planned behavior. The duration of students’ campus residence provided insight into their perspectives on food events and consumption at the university dining facility (UDF), influenced by factors such as palatal preferences, cost considerations, temporal constraints (during academic activities), accessibility of nutritious options, academic-related stress, and insufficient nutritional knowledge. Two primary findings emerged: first, there was an absence of nutritional information displayed in the dining facility; second, students exhibited a preference for consuming less healthy food options off-campus due to their lower monetary cost. Conclusion The investigation provides insights into the role of UDF in offering nutritionally balanced meals to students, potentially contributing to improved health outcomes and enhanced academic performance. This research elucidates the relationship between students’ dietary choices and their subsequent impact on scholastic achievement.

                Infant nutrition, especially during the first 1000 days of life, is an important determinant of future health outcomes. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) in the first six months of life, though the prevalence of EBF varies greatly in the sub-Saharan African (SSA) region. The aim of this study is to determine how infant nutrition and feeding practices may be linked to cardiovascular risk in South Africa and Tanzania. This cross-sectional study will recruit 3-9-month-old infants. Data collected will include sociodemographic and nutrition information, weight, height, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), head circumference, blood pressure and spot urine samples for determination of urine-creatinine ratio, 8-Hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine and nitric oxide concentrations. Home-made food samples will be collected from the mothers of infants for macronutrient content analysis. SPSS will be used for statistical analysis, such as frequency, proportion, means, t-tests, ANOVA, and logistic regression, to assess associations and regional variations. This will be the first prospective study to assess the impact of infant nutrition and feeding habits on cardiovascular risk in infants in two SSA countries, which will be useful for advising policy on infant nutrition.

                Background Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a complex disease with multiple phenotypes varying between individuals, as well as by age and sex. Males are diagnosed with PD at a much higher rate than females, and females experience later onset yet faster disease progression than males; the sexes also differ in PD by neuron composition, gene expression, and symptom progression. Because only a fraction of PD cases can be tied to genetic variants, it is likely that a complicated interaction between gene expression, hormones, the environment, and modifications to RNA transcripts plays a role in PD pathology and progression. Methods Here we explored changes in RNA editing through analysis of RNAseq between 243 healthy controls and PD patients aged 65 years or older enrolled in the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative. Specifically, we analyzed editing through the actions of the adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs), which may cause nonsynonymous alterations to gene expression products including those that result in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Results We observe differences in ADAR expression, number of putative ADAR edits, and the number of high/moderate impact edits between comparison groups and PD samples, which often show higher levels of ADAR expression and edits. PD males and females also differ in ADAR expression, number of edits, and the number of high and moderate impact edits with males exhibiting elevations compared to females in all three categories except in those edits associated with NMD, particularly in edits affecting SLC11A2, a gene coding for a transmembrane iron transporter. Likewise, differentially expressed genes between comparison groups were tied to NMD-related pathways Conclusion Our findings suggest that the dysregulation of ADAR editing may play a role in PD and that ADAR editing associated with NMD and genes functioning in NMD-related pathways may be integral to PD pathophysiology, particularly when comparing the sexes.

                Hospitals pose a high level of hazard and risks, particularly ones related to occupational health, whose overarching objective is to ensure both healthy workers and a healthy workplace, which can be achieved through effective risk management. This research aims to develop an assessment instrument tailored to hospital occupational safety and health units and their stakeholders across Indonesia to assess hospitals’ efforts to protect workers, with a focus on occupational health services programmes based on identified hazards. It is a qualitative exploratory study. Data collection was made through an in-depth literature review to identify occupational health risk factors in hospitals, focusing primarily on studies involving health risk assessment and/or reports of occupational disease or suspected cases of diseases. This was supported by in-depth interviews and field observations in three hospitals: a government hospital, a private hospital and a teaching hospital. The identified risk factors contributing to hospital workers’ mortality and morbidity were then analysed and formed into measurable indicators. These indicators serve as the basis for developing an instrument prototype to semi quantitatively assess the implementation of occupational health services in the hospitals. The prototype was developed by adapting and modifying the Hospital Safety and Health Management System Self-Assessment Questionnaire from OSHA and then subjected to validation through a 2-day FGD involving experts, practitioners, professional organisations, and other authorities in similar fields of study. The instrument consists of seven main sections; 53 statements with a maximum total score of 159; in addition to guidance. In conclusion, the instrument is a strategic tool that can be used by hospitals to improve the effectiveness of occupational health service implementation in a sustainable manner. Regulatory support, management commitment, and involvement of all elements in a hospital are the keys to realising a healthy, safe, productive workplace for the whole hospital community.

                Background Globally, declining teacher performance has been associated with absenteeism, inadequate preparation, and low motivation, often driven by poor remuneration and unfavorable working conditions. In Uganda, teachers in rural government-aided secondary schools face additional challenges such as inadequate housing, which may negatively impact their commitment and instructional quality. This study investigated the effect of teachers’ housing conditions on their attitudes toward work in Kyeizooba Sub-County, Bushenyi District, Uganda. Methods The study was guided by Taylor’s Scientific Management Theory and employed a cross-sectional design integrating both quantitative and qualitative approaches. The target population comprised 202 participants (199 teachers and 3 headteachers). Using the Cochran formula, the entire population (n = 202) was included for statistical robustness. Data were collected through structured questionnaires and interviews, with responses measured on a four-point Likert scale. Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied, with significance set at p < 0.05. Results The findings showed that housing conditions had a statistically significant effect on teachers’ attitudes toward their work (p < 0.05). Poor housing was associated with increased health problems (mean = 3.67), reduced motivation (mean = 3.62), and limited professional growth opportunities (mean = 3.56). Conversely, adequate housing promoted stronger teacher–student relationships (mean = 3.41) and moderate community engagement (mean = 3.01). Teacher performance records also revealed declining student outcomes, with failure rates of 17% in 2021 and 11.4% in 2022, partly linked to inadequate teacher housing and welfare. Qualitative data from headteachers further highlighted overcrowding, poor ventilation, and high commuting costs as major barriers to teacher effectiveness. Conclusion Housing stability is a critical determinant of teacher motivation, professional commitment, and instructional quality. The study recommends that policymakers invest in affordable and proximate housing for teachers, alongside supportive measures such as meal provision and medical care. Addressing these welfare needs would enhance teacher retention, strengthen classroom engagement, and improve educational outcomes in Uganda’s rural secondary schools.

                Patient education on appropriate self-care has the potential to play a crucial role in preventing foot complications. No current reviews explored the evidence of foot care interventions (FCIs) for diabetic patients who are at low risk for diabetic foot ulcers (LR-DFUs). This mapping review aimed to identify existing evidence of the core components of FCI for diabetic patients who are LR-DFUs and without DFUs. Methods: This review was undertaken using the Joanne Briggs Institute (JBI) guidance. The following electronic databases were searched for articles from data first indicated date through to June 2021: CINAHL, EMBASE, Medline, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Science Direct, and ASSIA. APA PsycArticles, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, and institutional websites by using search terms related to foot care and diabetes mellitus. A narrative synthesis was used to summarize the data. Results: In total, 18 studies were included in this review. Of these, there were 12 comparative studies, six observational studies and 12 reports of footcare education. The review included studies representing low- and high-resource settings and presented the core components of FCI for patients who are LR-DFUs and without DFUs. Conclusion: Core components of FCIs can be applied to develop targeted FCIs for education.

                Background This study develops and validates an Advanced Optimized Adaptive Differential Conductance (AOADC) algorithm for Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) in photovoltaic (PV) systems, aiming to improve tracking efficiency, responsiveness, and resilience under varying environmental conditions. Methods The AOADC algorithm was implemented in MATLAB 2020b using a nonlinear single-diode PV model governed by Kirchhoff’s law. Performance evaluation was conducted under two conditions: (i) irradiance levels of 500 W/m2, 750 W/m2, and 1000 W/m2 at a constant temperature of 298 K, and (ii) temperatures of 250 K, 298 K, and 350 K at a constant irradiance of 1000 W/m2 to examine the impact of temperature-induced variations in module saturation current (MSC). Results AOADC consistently tracked the Maximum Power Point, identified when differential conductance approached zero (σ ≈ 0 mho). At 298 K and 1000 W/m2, it achieved 139.80 W at 17.406 V, validating the theoretical dP/dV = 0 condition as conductance shifted from positive to negative around the MPP. A temperature rise from 250 K to 350 K reduced peak power by 54.4% (204.42 W to 93.19 W) and current by 48.3% (14.05 A to 7.27 A). Strong negative correlations were observed between temperature and power (r = –0.89, p < 0.01) as well as current (r = –0.91, p < 0.01), with a regression coefficient of R2 = 0.94 for power–temperature dependence. Conversely, increasing irradiance from 500 W/m2 to 1000 W/m2 raised power by 120% (63.89 W to 139.80 W) and current by 45% (5.48 A to 10.04 A), supported by strong P–V curve fitting (R2 > 0.98). Comparative analysis confirmed AOADC’s superiority over the conventional Optimized Adaptive Differential Conductance (OADC) technique. At 750 W/m2 and 298 K, AOADC delivered 100.17 W compared to 83.33 W by OADC (20.2% improvement), while at 500 W/m2 it produced 65.03 W versus 50.08 W (29.9% enhancement), yielding an average of 20.21% higher power output across all test cases. Conclusion AOADC demonstrated enhanced efficiency, faster dynamic response, and superior thermal resilience compared to OADC. These results establish AOADC as a reliable next-generation MPPT solution suitable for both standalone and grid-connected PV systems.

                <p>Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss of expression of the maternal <I>UBE3A</I> allele and is characterized by a constellation of impactful neurologic symptoms. While previous work has uncovered outsized contributions of GABAergic neuron-selective <I>Ube3a</I> deletion to seizure susceptibility and electroencephalography (EEG) phenotypes in a mouse model of AS, the neuronal populations governing a broader range of behaviors have not been studied. Here, we used male and female mice to test the consequences of <I>Ube3a</I> deletion from GABAergic or glutamatergic neurons across a well-characterized battery of AS-relevant behaviors. Surprisingly, we observed deficits in numerous motor and innate behaviors in mice with glutamatergic <I>Ube3a</I> deletion and relatively few consequences of GABAergic <I>Ube3a</I> deletion. Furthermore, genetic <I>Ube3a</I> reinstatement in glutamatergic neurons rescued multiple motor and innate behaviors. When tested for sleep&ndash;wake behaviors, the selective loss of <I>Ube3a</I> from glutamatergic neurons disrupted sleep similarly to that of AS model mice (<I>Ube3a<sup>m&ndash;/p+</sup></I>), and glutamatergic <I>Ube3a</I> reinstatement overcame the lack of active cycle "siesta" and decreased REM phenotypes observed in AS model mice. Altogether, this work demonstrates a major role of glutamatergic neuron UBE3A loss in mediating multiple AS behavioral features, suggesting a divergence from the circuitry underlying enhanced seizure susceptibility. Our findings imply that neuronal cell type-agnostic UBE3A reinstatement is likely required for successful AS genetic therapies&mdash;with reinstatement of UBE3A in GABAergic neurons necessary for overcoming epileptic and EEG phenotypes, and reinstatement in glutamatergic neurons necessary for overcoming most other behavioral phenotypes.</p>

                <p>Current models of motor control emphasize the critical role of sensory feedback, as demonstrated by movement coordination deficits following sensory impairment. When both vision and touch are available for object-oriented manual behaviors, they serve distinct roles; vision guides the execution of planned movements, while touch provides more direct feedback on hand&ndash;object interactions. The impact of losing somatosensory feedback on eye&ndash;hand coordination during dexterous object manipulation tasks has not been thoroughly studied. Conceivably, vision is recruited to compensate for the feedback lost when touch is abolished based on the dexterity demands of the behavior. To investigate this, we tested healthy participants of either sex on a manual dexterity task requiring the movement of small metal pegs, both before and after the administration of digital anesthesia, which selectively abolished cutaneous sensations in the fingertips while preserving motor function. We recorded participants' gaze and hand positions. Despite loss of cutaneous feedback, participants successfully completed the pegboard task. However, they exhibited significantly longer trial times and altered force profiles. Notably, acute somatosensory loss triggered a rapid shift in visual behavior, characterized by a tighter coupling between gaze and hand positions across all task actions, even those not directly involving object manipulation. These changes, which occurred with anesthesia of the dominant and nondominant hands, were not evident with sham (saline) injections. Our findings underscore the contributions of sensory feedback to force control in service of dexterous object manipulation and reveal the nonselective nature of compensatory gaze&ndash;hand coordination processes.</p>

                <p>The sense of body ownership, a core aspect of self-recognition, has been studied using illusions such as the full-body illusion. Although the premotor cortex is considered central to body ownership in first-person full&ndash;body illusions, the occipitotemporal cortex&mdash;including the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and the extrastriate body area (EBA)&mdash;also plays a critical role in third-person full&ndash;body illusions. However, their distinct contributions to the full-body illusion remain unclear, partly due to the challenges of applying neuroimaging in such experiments. This study employed functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate brain activity during a third-person full&ndash;body illusion in virtual reality. Eighteen healthy human adult males participated in the study. The experiment consisted of two sessions. In Session 1, participants observed an avatar's back receiving either synchronous or asynchronous visual&ndash;tactile stimulation. In Session 2, visual stimuli alone were presented to participants after they experienced the full-body illusion to induce visuotactile discrepancies. In the synchronous condition of Session 1, we found significant deactivation in the superior and middle temporal gyri (partially including the TPJ), followed by higher activity than in the asynchronous condition in the left middle occipital gyrus (likely EBA). The left premotor cortex also showed significant activation (uncorrected), although this did not survive multiple-comparison adjustment. In Session 2, the visuotactile discrepancy induced significant left premotor activation only in the synchronous condition (FDR-corrected). These findings suggest that the occipitotemporal cortex supports receptivity to third-person full&ndash;body illusions, whereas the premotor cortex contributes to maintaining illusory body ownership by reconciling multisensory conflicts.</p>

                Background With growing focus on the environmental and social impacts of the food industry, sustainability has become a central topic in scientific research. Understanding the dynamics of this scientific production motivated a bibliometric analysis to identify trends, key themes, and emerging topics in this field. Methods A bibliometric analysis was conducted using Scopus and Web of Science to examine the evolution of scientific output related to sustainability in the food industry. Techniques such as keyword co-occurrence analysis, evaluation of country and author productivity, and thematic evolution analysis were applied. Additionally, a Cartesian system was used to classify the relevance and recency of identified key terms. Results An exponential growth pattern in scientific output was identified, particularly in 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023, with a statistical significance of 99.65%. Three main country clusters were observed, with the United Kingdom, United States, and Italy standing out for their productivity and impact. At the author level, Mangla and Luthra were notable for productivity, while Land, Beske, and Van Der Vorst stood out for their impact on the discipline. Thematic evolution analysis revealed a shift from early research on “soil erosion” to current themes like “circular economy,” “supply chain management,” “food safety,” and “wastewater treatment.” The keyword co-occurrence network showed seven thematic clusters, with the purple cluster—comprising “sustainability,” “waste management,” and “short supply chain”—being most prominent. Emerging topics such as “Covid-19,” “blockchain,” and the “agri-food sector” were found in the emerging topics quadrant. Conclusions This study highlights the evolution and diversification of sustainability research in the food industry, emphasizing the relevance of emerging topics and international collaboration. A multidisciplinary agenda is proposed to address critical areas such as food security, sustainable agriculture, and supply chain management, stressing the need to incorporate innovative technologies to meet current environmental, economic, and social challenges.

                Background Class imbalance is a frequent and severe problem in medical datasets, where instances from the minority class are usually high risk or disease positive. Most traditional classifiers suffer from a biasness towards the majority class, resulting in a poor detection rate of the minority class and, therefore, decreased confidence in prediction systems in medical applications. Methods In this paper, we present an optimized ensemble by differential evolution (OEDE), a novel ensemble learning framework, to address this problem. OEDE harmonizes three dissimilar base learners (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost) and trains each using class-balancing techniques. Next, the model utilized Differential Evolution (DE) to discover the most appropriate ensemble weights to maximize the area under the ROC curve (AUC) on a validation dataset. Result We conducted experiments on four real-world medical datasets, whose imbalance ratios vary from 1.89 to 14.6, using OEDE in the original, SMOTE, and ADASYN balanced conditions. The results indicate that the proposed OEDE consistently outperforms or is competitive with traditional ensemble models in terms of AUC, F1-score, and Recall. ROC curve analysis also approved the OEDE’s superior discriminative capabilities. Conclusion The proposed OEDE framework effectively improves minority class detection in imbalance medical datasets. Its robust and flexible design makes it a promising tool for healthcare risk prediction tasks where minority class groups need to be well identified.

                Background Immunization is a cornerstone of global health and preventive efforts. However, persistent barriers and inequalities in healthcare access continue to delay the eradication of preventable diseases through vaccination, increase the burden of infantile diseases and mortality rates, and contributes to the emergence of epidemics. This scoping review seeks to understand how the intensity of armed conflicts as a societal determinant influences vaccination rate. By exploring existing literature, it intends to provide insights into the complex relationship between armed conflict intensity and vaccination coverage. Methods This study follows the methodological framework outlined by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews. A comprehensive search strategy was established using electronic databases. Keywords related to armed conflict and vaccination coverage were used to retrieve articles within a specified population, timeframe, and geographical location. Online research was conducted to identify grey literature. Articles undergo a single reviewer screening process based on titles and abstracts to assess eligibility for full-text review based on predefined criteria. Data extraction captures key findings, including the association between armed conflict intensity and vaccination rates, and the mechanisms underlying this relationship. A narrative synthesis approach is employed to analyze and interpret the findings. Results The search identified 35 articles published from 2014 to 2023 and several other documents. It reveals factors linked to conflict intensity intertwined with other factors, which are challenging to measure and reproduce. It summarizes future study suggestions to elucidate the context-specific impact of conflict intensity on routine immunization coverage and potential strategies to overcome these barriers. Conclusion This study provides valuable insights into the impact of armed conflict intensity on vaccination coverage rates, highlighting the complex interplay of factors influencing immunization outcomes. The evidence synthesized underscores the challenges faced by vaccination programs and the necessity for context-specific strategies and evidence-informed policies.

                Background Orthognathic surgery corrects severe skeletal discrepancies that cannot be addressed by orthodontics alone. With advancements in digital workflows and CAD/CAM technologies, clear aligner therapy (CAT) has emerged as a potential adjunct in surgical cases. However, its clinical application remains under-researched. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, experience, and attitudes of orthodontists and oral and maxillofacial surgeons in Saudi Arabia regarding CAT in orthognathic surgery patients. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted from April 1 to May 31, 2023, using a closed-ended online questionnaire distributed to specialists across Saudi Arabia. The survey gathered demographic and clinical data. Statistical analysis included descriptive methods, chi-square testing (p < 0.05), and univariate regression to identify demographic predictors of CAT use. Results Out of 278 expected responses, 46 were received. Most participants were aged 31–40 years (p < 0.05) and had 6–10 years of experience (p = 0.03). Orthodontists accounted for 65.2% of the respondents, with oral and maxillofacial surgeons at 34.8% (p = 0.03). While most treated 1–4 orthognathic patients monthly, 80% had no experience using CAT in these cases. Although general CAT usage was significant (p < 0.05), its clinical application in orthognathic surgery was minimal. Challenges included pre-surgical alignment, intraoperative fixation, and post-operative occlusion control. Regression analysis showed that age was significantly associated with CAT use (p < 0.05; R2 = 0.38), while gender and experience were not. Conclusion The study indicates limited clinical experience with CAT in orthognathic surgery in Saudi Arabia. Age may influence CAT adoption, but further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to validate these findings and inform future integration of aligner protocols in surgical orthodontics.

                Background The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) crosses the blood-brain barrier, compromising cortical networks and cognition. Neuropharmacological intervention in the form of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) does not reverse cognitive decline in pediatric and adolescent HIV. In search of options to enhance cognition in affected adolescents, we evaluated the effectiveness of attention training. Methods The training was evaluated by pairing participants’ outcomes on the Stroop Colour Word Test (SCWT), a test of attention and inhibitory control, to brain hemodynamic responses measured by functional near-infrared spectrometry (fNIRS) both prior to, and after, the training. Changes in oxygenated haemoglobin in the prefrontal cortex during the SCWT were compared in 15 HIV+ participants who received attention training with that of 13 HIV+ participants who did not receive the intervention. Results Intragroup analyses showed differences in oxygenated haemoglobin levels between congruent and incongruent conditions of the SCWT only for participants who received the attention training. Specifically, there was a significant decrease in oxygenated haemoglobin in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and frontopolar brain areas in the training group. Conclusions Findings suggest that customised attention training maybe an effective complementary adjunct to cART for children and adolescents living with HIV.

                Hyperspectral band selection has become a key focus in hyperspectral image processing as it reduces the spectral redundancy and computational overhead, thereby improving classification performance. However, optimal band selection remains challenging due to its combinatorial nature. Although numerous metaheuristic algorithms have been introduced in recent years to address this problem, achieving an effective balance between exploration and exploitation continues to pose a major challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines a parameter-free binary Jaya algorithm with a mutation operator to enhance exploration and maintain solution diversity within the search space. We employ Opposition-based Leaning (OBL) for population initialization and Quasi-Reflection reinitialization strategy to add diversity whenever fitness stagnation occurs. To simultaneously improve classification performance and band reduction we adopt weighted sum multi-objective fitness function that minimizes redundancy and enhances model generalization. Our proposed method is evaluated using three benchmark datasets, namely Indian Pines, Pavia University, and Salinas. Experimental results demonstrate that the pro-posed method outperforms recent metaheuristic-based band selection techniques. Its superior performance makes it well suited for various HSI applications.

                <p>by Richard Schweitzer, Thomas Seel, Jörg Raisch, Martin Rolfs</p>

Eye movements routinely induce motion streaks as they shift visual projections across the retina at high speeds. To investigate the visual consequences of intra-saccadic motion streaks, we co-registered eye tracking and EEG while gaze-contingently shifting target objects during saccades, presenting either continuous, ‘streaky’ or apparent, step-like motion in four directions. We found significant reductions of secondary saccade latency, as well as improved decoding of the post-saccadic target location from the EEG signal when motion streaks were available. These signals arose as early as 50 ms after saccade offset and had a clear occipital topography. Using a physiologically plausible visual processing model, we provide evidence that the target’s motion trajectory is coded in orientation-selective channels and that speed of gaze correction was linked to the visual dynamics arising from the combination of saccadic and target motion, providing a parsimonious explanation of the behavioral benefits of intra-saccadic motion streaks.

                <p>by Yun Lin, James A. Hay, Yu Meng, Benjamin J. Cowling, Bingyi Yang</p>

Population-level viral load distributions, measured by RT-qPCR or qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) values from surveillance testing, can be used to estimate the time-varying reproductive number (Rt) in real-time during COVID-19 outbreaks. However, it remains unclear whether this approach can be broadly applied to other pathogens, sources of virologic test data, or surveillance strategies beyond those specifically implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong. We systematically evaluated the accuracy of Ct-based Rt estimates using simulated epidemics under different surveillance testing systems and pathogen viral kinetics. Using area under the ROC curve (AUC) to assess accuracy in detecting epidemic growth or decline, we found that case ascertainment rates minimally impacted estimation accuracy, except when detection was heavily biased towards severe patients (AUC: 0.64, 95% CIs: 0.59 - 0.71) or during prolonged waves with stable Rt near one (AUC: 0.54, 0.48 - 0.64), compared to stable detection patterns over time (AUC 0.76, 0.66 - 0.82). By comparing model accuracies across different viral shedding patterns and by parameterizing our model using data from six respiratory pathogens, we found that model performance largely depends on a monotonic viral shedding trajectory following case detection. A pathogen that lacks such shedding pattern – for example, those with a viral peak after onset – exhibited lower accuracy (AUC: 0.58, 0.49 - 0.65). Overall, our findings demonstrate that Ct-based Rt estimation methods are generally accurate across diverse surveillance conditions and pathogen shedding patterns, supporting their practical use as a supplementary tool for timely transmission monitoring while highlighting limitations that warrant further consideration.

                <p>by Biplab Maity, Swarnendu Banerjee, Abhishek Senapati, Jon Pitchford, Joydev Chattopadhyay</p>

Despite extensive control efforts over the centuries, cholera remains a globally significant health issue. Seasonal emergence of cholera cases has been reported, particularly in the Bengal delta region, which is often synchronized with plankton blooms. This phenomenon has been widely attributed to the commensal interaction between <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> and zooplankton in aquatic environments. The role of plankton dynamics in cholera epidemiology has been acknowledged but remains poorly understood, and consequently, its importance in effective policymaking is largely overlooked. To this end, we propose and analyze a novel compartment-based transmission model that integrates phytoplankton-zooplankton interactions into a human-bacteria cholera framework. Our study shows that, beyond the reproduction number, the relative contribution of bacterial versus zooplankton-mediated transmission plays a crucial role in shaping epidemic progression and severity. In presence of zooplankton-mediated transmission, an outbreak with a delayed and lower peak may still result in a larger overall outbreak size. Additionally, contrary to common intuition, even for a large and early outbreak, the epidemic overshoot may intensify due to the maintenance of lower-level infections during the post-peak phase. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the timing of filtration-like interventions can be strategically guided by ecological indicators, such as phytoplankton blooms. Our study underscores the importance of incorporating ecological aspects in epidemiological research to better predict and manage disease outbreaks.

                <p>by Théotime Grohens, Sam Meyer, Guillaume Beslon</p>

DNA supercoiling—the level of twisting and writhing of the DNA molecule around itself—plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression in bacteria by modulating promoter activity. The level of DNA supercoiling is a dynamic property of the chromosome which varies both at local and global scales, in response to both external factors such as environmental perturbations and internal factors including gene transcription. As such, local variations in supercoiling could in theory couple the expression levels of neighboring genes by creating feedback loops at the transcriptional level. However, the impact of such supercoiling-mediated interactions on the regulation of gene expression still remains uncertain. In this work, we study how this coupling between transcription and supercoiling could shape genome organization and help regulate gene transcription. We present a model of genome evolution in which individuals whose gene transcription rates are coupled to local supercoiling must adapt to two environments that induce different global supercoiling levels. In this model, we observe the evolution of whole-genome regulatory networks that provide control over gene expression by leveraging the transcription-supercoiling coupling, and show that the structure of these networks is underpinned by the organization of genes along the chromosome at several scales. Local variations in DNA supercoiling could therefore help jointly shape both gene regulation and genome organization during evolution.

                <p>by Laurent Loiseau, Nathan De Visch, Alexandra Vergnes, Jean Armengaud, Maxence S. Vincent, Benjamin Ezraty</p>

The bacterial cell envelope is exposed to various stresses, including oxidative stress caused by different types of oxidants, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive chlorine species (RCS). In Escherichia <i>coli,</i> the reduction of chlorate into chlorite, a toxic RCS compound, induces the expression of the MsrPQ system, which repairs periplasmic proteins oxidized at methionine residues (methionine sulfoxide, Met-O). In this study, using a proteomic-based approach, we show that chlorite stress also triggers the overproduction of the periplasmic molecular chaperone Spheroplast Protein Y (Spy). This response is mediated by the activation of the BaeSR two-component system. Furthermore, both in vivo and in vitro evidence reveal that Spy’s susceptibility to oxidation is critical for its chaperone activity. We demonstrate that the MsrPQ repair system ensures Spy’s functionality by reducing its Met-O, thereby safeguarding its role in periplasmic protein homeostasis. Overall, this work reveals Spy as a key target of chlorite-induced oxidative damage and underscores the essential role of MsrPQ in preserving periplasmic protein quality control.

                <p>by Enrico Ferrea, Pierre Morel, Alexander Gail</p>

Perturbing visual feedback is a powerful tool for studying visuomotor adaptation. However, unperturbed proprioceptive signals in common paradigms inherently co-varies with physical movements and causes incongruency with the visual input. This can create challenges when interpreting underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. We employed a brain–computer interface (BCI) in rhesus monkeys to investigate spatial encoding in frontal and parietal areas during a 3D visuomotor rotation task where only visual feedback was movement-contingent. We found that both brain regions better reflected the adapted motor commands than the perturbed visual feedback during movement preparation and execution. This adaptive response was observed in both local and remote neurons, even when they did not directly contribute to the BCI input signals. The transfer of adaptive changes in planning activity to corresponding movement corrections was stronger in the frontal than in the parietal cortex. Our results suggest an integrated large-scale visuomotor adaptation mechanism in a motor-reference frame spanning across frontoparietal cortices.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) consensus diagnostic criteria and functional rating scale (PLSFRS) were recently established to facilitate and optimize future PLS clinical trials. We examined the trajectory of the PLSFRS and other functional outcome measures and biomarkers in the PLS Natural History Study (PLS NHS) to understand their performance in this prospective cohort.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The PLS NHS is a prospective, longitudinal, multicenter study of people living with PLS in different diagnostic categories: early (disease duration &lt;2 years); probable (2–4 years); and definite PLS (4–15 years). PLSFRS scores and other functional outcome measures were collected at baseline, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up visits. Baseline characteristics were compared between the groups. The slopes of the PLSFRS and other functional outcome measures over 12 months were examined in the overall cohort and subgroups using linear mixed-effect models. The associations between baseline characteristics and the rate of PLSFRS decline were analyzed with linear regression models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 76 participants were included: early (n = 6); probable (n = 26); and definite (n = 44) PLS. Baseline PLSFRS total scores were highest in the early PLS group, followed by the probable and definite PLS groups. In the overall cohort, the PLSFRS total score declined by 0.33 points/month (95% confidence interval [0.27–0.39], adjusted <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The rate of decline was steepest in the early PLS group, followed by the probable and definite PLS groups. Baseline neurofilament light chain level was associated with the rate of PLSFRS decline over 1 year (<i>p</i> = 0.001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In PLS, the rate of functional decline, as measured by the PLSFRS total score, is faster during the early phase of the disease. Neurofilament light might serve as a prognostic biomarker in PLS. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Biomarkers with clear contexts of use are important tools for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) therapy development. Understanding their longitudinal trajectory in the untreated state is key to their use as potential markers of pharmacodynamic response. To this end, we undertook a large-scale proteomic study in well-phenotyped cohorts to identify biomarker candidates of ALS disease state and disease progression.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical phenotypic data and biofluid samples, collected from patients with ALS and healthy controls through multiple longitudinal natural history studies, were used to identify biomarker candidates. Slow off-rate modified aptamer (SOMAmer)-based relatively quantitative measurement of ~7,000 proteins was performed in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with immunoassay validation of candidates of interest.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 329 plasma proteins significantly differentially regulated between ALS and controls (adjusted <i>p</i>-value &lt;0.05), with 25 showing &gt;40% relative abundance. PDLIM3, TNNT2, and MYL11 had the greatest log-fold elevation, whereas ANTXR2 and ART3 had the greatest log-fold reduction. A similar set of plasma proteins was found to increase (eg, PDLIM3, TNNT2, and MYL11) or decrease (eg, ANTXR2, ART3, and MSTN) with disease progression. CSF proteins with the greatest log-fold elevation included NEFL, NEFH, CHIT1, CA3, MYL11, and GPNMB. These results were confirmed in an independent replication cohort. Moreover, tissue-specific signature enrichment suggests a significant contribution of muscle as a source of these biomarkers. Plasma KCNIP3 was elevated by ~60% in those on riluzole. Immunoassays provided orthogonal validation of plasma TNNT2 and CSF GPNMB.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Growing evidence suggests that hippocampal gray matter microstructure, assessed through diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), is a sensitive marker of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). While hippocampal atrophy is a characteristic feature of AD, microstructural changes likely precede macrostructural changes such as volumetric loss, offering important insights into the early phases of the disease. This study assessed the relationships between hippocampal microstructure (assessed with mean diffusivity [MD] from DWI) and Braak-staged tau burden (measured by positron emission tomography [PET]) with performance on an episodic memory composite score, among individuals with and without amyloid burden, assessed by PET imaging. The study included 192 participants without dementia (14 with mild cognitive impairment [MCI]) from the BIOCARD cohort (mean age = 68), of which 52 (27%) were amyloid positive. In multiple linear regression analyses, increased hippocampal MD was associated with worse memory and greater tau PET burden in Braak stages II–IV, but only in individuals who were amyloid positive (e.g., significant amyloid × hippocampal MD interactions). Building on prior findings linking early Braak-staged tau to memory, we further assessed whether tau PET burden statistically mediated the relationship between elevated hippocampal MD and poorer memory performance. Tau PET burden in Braak stages II–IV was found to statistically mediate the relationship between elevated hippocampal MD and poorer memory performance, independent of hippocampal volume, but only in amyloid-positive participants. These associations were only significant when MCI participants were included in the analysis. These findings suggest hippocampal microstructure may be sensitive to AD-related pathological burden and associated neurodegeneration, particularly in the early symptomatic phase, and is associated with tau PET and cognitive decline, even after accounting for hippocampal volume.</p>

                Qin et al. reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics, clonality, and transcriptomic characteristics of SCI-associated Treg cells, identifying their crucial role in SCI functional recovery. Mechanistically, microglia act as essential MHC II antigen-presenting cells that sustain neuroprotective Treg cells, which in turn modulate microglial inflammation and cholesterol metabolism via CTLA-4 and Abcg1 upregulation.

                <p>Nature Neuroscience, Published online: 29 September 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02070-6">doi:10.1038/s41593-025-02070-6</a></p>The promise of genomics-focused neuroscience to improve health outcomes for Indigenous Peoples depends on ensuring more equitable data relationships though culturally appropriate data governance and the technical infrastructure to enable its implementation. Although ethical frameworks and legal policy mechanisms affirm Indigenous rights, there is a persistent gap in translating these commitments into practice. Here we discuss how embedding Indigenous data governance across research infrastructures and data ecosystems is needed to strengthen the field’s capacity to deliver beneficial outcomes for all.

                    correspondence in human brain connectivity</a></h4>

              
                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Brain structure-function coupling has been studied in health and disease by many
                    different researchers in recent years. Most of the studies have estimated
                    functional connectivity matrices as correlation coefficients between different
                    brain areas, despite well-known disadvantages compared with partial correlation
                    connectivity matrices. Indeed, partial correlation represents a more sensible
                    model for structural connectivity since, under a Gaussian approximation, it
                    accounts only for direct dependencies between brain areas. Motivated by this and
                    following previous results by different authors, we investigate
                    structure-function coupling using partial correlation matrices of functional
                    magnetic resonance imaging brain activity time series under various
                    regularization (also known as noise-cleaning) algorithms. We find that, across
                    different algorithms and conditions, partial correlation provides a higher match
                    with structural connectivity retrieved from density-weighted imaging data than
                    standard correlation, and this occurs at both subject and population levels.
                    Importantly, we also show that regularization and thresholding are crucial for
                    this match to emerge. Finally, we assess neurogenetic associations in relation
                    to structure-function coupling, which presents promising opportunities to
                    further advance research in the field of network neuroscience, particularly
                    concerning brain disorders.</span>

                    augmenting structural connectivity matrices for connectivity-based
                    prediction</a></h4>

              
                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Recent machine learning techniques have improved connectome-based predictions by
                    modeling complex dependencies between brain connectivity and cognitive traits.
                    However, they typically require large datasets that are costly and
                    time-consuming to collect. To address this, we propose Task-guided generative
                    adversarial network (GAN) II, a novel data augmentation method that uses GANs to
                    expand sample sizes in connectome-based prediction tasks. Our method
                    incorporates a task-guided branch within the Wasserstein GAN framework,
                    specifically designed to synthesize structural connectivity matrices and improve
                    prediction accuracy by capturing task-relevant features. We evaluated
                    Task-guided GAN II on the prediction of fluid intelligence using the NIMH Health
                    Research Volunteer Dataset. Results showed that data augmentation improved
                    prediction accuracy. To further assess whether augmentation can substitute for
                    increasing actual collected sample sizes, we conducted additional validation
                    using the Human Connectome Project WU-Minn S1200 dataset. Task-guided GAN II
                    improved prediction performance with limited real data, with gains of up to
                    twofold augmentation observed. However, excessive augmentation did not result in
                    further improvements, suggesting that augmentation complements, but does not
                    fully replace, real data augmentation. These results suggest that Task-guided
                    GAN II is a promising tool for harnessing small datasets in human connectomics
                    research, improving predictive modeling where large-scale data collection is
                    impractical.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods are the most widely applied
                    tools in the network neurosciences, but their reliability remains an active area
                    of study. We use back-to-back 10-min resting-state scans in a healthy aging
                        (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 41) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) sample
                        (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 45) composed of older adults to assess the
                    replicability of RSFC using a “mini” multiverse approach. The goal
                    was to evaluate the reproducibility of commonly used graph metrics and determine
                    if aging and moderate-severe TBI influences RSFC reliability using intraclass
                    correlation coefficients (ICCs). There is clear evidence for reliable results in
                    aging and TBI. Global network metrics such as within-network connectivity and
                    segregation were most reliable whereas other whole-brain connectivity estimates
                    (e.g., clustering coefficient, eigenvector centrality) were least reliable.
                    Analysis of canonical networks revealed the default mode and salience networks
                    as most reliable. There was a notable influence of motion scrubbing on ICCs,
                    with diminished reliability proportional to the number of volumes removed.
                    Choice of brain atlas had a modest effect on findings. Overall, RSFC
                    reproducibility is preserved in older adults and after significant neurological
                    compromise. We also identify a subset of graph metrics and canonical networks
                    with promising reliability.</span>
