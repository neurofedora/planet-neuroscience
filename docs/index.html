	<p>Recommended treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) includes stimulant medication. While these medicines are effective for most ADHD patients, benefits may wear off, suggesting tolerance. This paper reviews the published literature on tolerance to stimulant medication treatment for ADHD. As there are relatively few studies published, pivotal studies and ADHD treatment guidelines were also reviewed. Research demonstrates physiological changes related to continued stimulant usage in neurons and certain brain regions, suggesting a mechanism for tolerance development. One clinical study showed that 24.7% of patients developed tolerance to stimulants in the time of days to weeks; another showed 2.7% developed tolerance over 10 years. Long term follow-up studies demonstrate that medication response may lessen over longer durations of treatment in a high percentage of patients. Strategies to manage tolerance include switching stimulant medicines, drug holidays, or clinical reassessment. Three cases illustrate challenges with treating patients who develop tolerance to stimulant medication. The paucity of research and lack of guidance to clinicians may contribute to significant under recognition of tolerance to stimulant medication. Further research is required to define clinical tolerance for stimulants in ADHD and to provide guidance on identifying and managing tolerance in clinical practice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: posterior approach with sub-laminar wiring as management of comminuted fracture of the odontoid process of the axis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Odontoid fractures (OF) account for 5-18% and 10-19% of all injuries at C2 and in the cervical region, respectively. According to the Anderson and D'Alonzo classification, there are three main types of OF: Type I, II and III. Most cases involving OF of the axis by high impact trauma result in death. Case presentation: A 21-year-old male patient, with comminuted OF caused by a high impact traffic accident. On admission, the patient reported moderate to severe pain in the posterior craniocervical junction, with significant limitation to lateral rotation of the head and severe cervical muscle spasm. There was evidence of comminuted OF of C2 without apparent displacement in the cervical region. The patient underwent surgery via a posterior approach with double sub-laminar wiring between C1 and C2. The procedure was considered to be completely resolutive with no postoperative complications or sequelae, with total recovery of the patient's functionality. Discussion: The posterior approach is a viable option when the anterior approach is not possible due to the nature of the comminuted fracture and risks of complications, even when it involves a degree of compromise in the rotation of the C1-C2 joint. OF is a medical emergency, requiring individualized treatment tailored to the characteristics of the patient. There are currently no standardized treatment guidelines for OF.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Haisu: Hierarchically supervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kevin Christopher VanHorn, Murat Can Çobanoğlu</p>

We propose a novel strategy for incorporating hierarchical supervised label information into nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques. Specifically, we extend t-SNE, UMAP, and PHATE to include known or predicted class labels and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on multiple single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Our approach, “Haisu,” is applicable across domains and methods of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. In general, the mathematical effect of Haisu can be summarized as a variable perturbation of the high dimensional space in which the original data is observed. We thereby preserve the core characteristics of the visualization method and only change the manifold to respect known or assumed class labels when provided. Our strategy is designed to aid in the discovery and understanding of underlying patterns in a dataset that is heavily influenced by parent-child relationships. We show that using our approach can also help in semi-supervised settings where labels are known for only some datapoints (for instance when only a fraction of the cells are labeled). In summary, Haisu extends existing popular visualization methods to enable a user to incorporate labels known <i>a priori</i> into a visualization, including their hierarchical relationships as defined by a user input graph.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Asymmetric and adaptive reward coding via normalized reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kenway Louie</p>

Learning is widely modeled in psychology, neuroscience, and computer science by prediction error-guided reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. While standard RL assumes linear reward functions, reward-related neural activity is a saturating, nonlinear function of reward; however, the computational and behavioral implications of nonlinear RL are unknown. Here, we show that nonlinear RL incorporating the canonical divisive normalization computation introduces an intrinsic and tunable asymmetry in prediction error coding. At the behavioral level, this asymmetry explains empirical variability in risk preferences typically attributed to asymmetric learning rates. At the neural level, diversity in asymmetries provides a computational mechanism for recently proposed theories of distributional RL, allowing the brain to learn the full probability distribution of future rewards. This behavioral and computational flexibility argues for an incorporation of biologically valid value functions in computational models of learning and decision-making.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The spectrum of covariance matrices of randomly connected recurrent neuronal networks with linear dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yu Hu, Haim Sompolinsky</p>

A key question in theoretical neuroscience is the relation between the connectivity structure and the collective dynamics of a network of neurons. Here we study the connectivity-dynamics relation as reflected in the distribution of eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the dynamic fluctuations of the neuronal activities, which is closely related to the network dynamics’ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the associated effective dimensionality. We consider the spontaneous fluctuations around a steady state in a randomly connected recurrent network of stochastic neurons. An exact analytical expression for the covariance eigenvalue distribution in the large-network limit can be obtained using results from random matrices. The distribution has a finitely supported smooth bulk spectrum and exhibits an approximate power-law tail for coupling matrices near the critical edge. We generalize the results to include second-order connectivity motifs and discuss extensions to excitatory-inhibitory networks. The theoretical results are compared with those from finite-size networks and the effects of temporal and spatial sampling are studied. Preliminary application to whole-brain imaging data is presented. Using simple connectivity models, our work provides theoretical predictions for the covariance spectrum, a fundamental property of recurrent neuronal dynamics, that can be compared with experimental data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Stochastic fluctuations promote ordered pattern formation of cells in the Notch-Delta signaling pathway</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Madeline Galbraith, Federico Bocci, José N. Onuchic</p>

The Notch-Delta signaling pathway mediates cell differentiation implicated in many regulatory processes including spatiotemporal patterning in tissues by promoting alternate cell fates between neighboring cells. At the multicellular level, this "lateral inhibition” principle leads to checkerboard patterns with alternation of Sender and Receiver cells. While it is well known that stochasticity modulates cell fate specification, little is known about how stochastic fluctuations at the cellular level propagate during multicell pattern formation. Here, we model stochastic fluctuations in the Notch-Delta pathway in the presence of two different noise types–shot and white–for a multicell system. Our results show that intermediate fluctuations reduce disorder and guide the multicell lattice toward checkerboard-like patterns. By further analyzing cell fate transition events, we demonstrate that intermediate noise amplitudes provide enough perturbation to facilitate “proofreading” of disordered patterns and cause cells to switch to the correct ordered state (Sender surrounded by Receivers, and vice versa). Conversely, high noise can override environmental signals coming from neighboring cells and lead to switching between ordered and disordered patterns. Therefore, in analogy with spin glass systems, intermediate noise levels allow the multicell Notch system to escape frustrated patterns and relax towards the lower energy checkerboard pattern while at large noise levels the system is unable to find this ordered base of attraction.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling the modulation of cortical Up-Down state switching by astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lisa Blum Moyse, Hugues Berry</p>

Up-Down synchronization in neuronal networks refers to spontaneous switches between periods of high collective firing activity (Up state) and periods of silence (Down state). Recent experimental reports have shown that astrocytes can control the emergence of such Up-Down regimes in neural networks, although the molecular or cellular mechanisms that are involved are still uncertain. Here we propose neural network models made of three populations of cells: excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons and astrocytes, interconnected by synaptic and gliotransmission events, to explore how astrocytes can control this phenomenon. The presence of astrocytes in the models is indeed observed to promote the emergence of Up-Down regimes with realistic characteristics. Our models show that the difference of signalling timescales between astrocytes and neurons (seconds versus milliseconds) can induce a regime where the frequency of gliotransmission events released by the astrocytes does not synchronize with the Up and Down phases of the neurons, but remains essentially stable. However, these gliotransmission events are found to change the localization of the bifurcations in the parameter space so that with the addition of astrocytes, the network enters a bistability region of the dynamics that corresponds to Up-Down synchronization. Taken together, our work provides a theoretical framework to test scenarios and hypotheses on the modulation of Up-Down dynamics by gliotransmission from astrocytes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Pooling strategies in V1 can account for the functional and structural diversity across species</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Victor Boutin, Angelo Franciosini, Frédéric Chavane, Laurent U. Perrinet</p>

Neurons in the primary visual cortex are selective to orientation with various degrees of selectivity to the spatial phase, from high selectivity in simple cells to low selectivity in complex cells. Various computational models have suggested a possible link between the presence of phase invariant cells and the existence of orientation maps in higher mammals’ V1. These models, however, do not explain the emergence of complex cells in animals that do not show orientation maps. In this study, we build a theoretical model based on a convolutional network called Sparse Deep Predictive Coding (SDPC) and show that a single computational mechanism, pooling, allows the SDPC model to account for the emergence in V1 of complex cells with or without that of orientation maps, as observed in distinct species of mammals. In particular, we observed that pooling in the feature space is directly related to the orientation map formation while pooling in the retinotopic space is responsible for the emergence of a complex cells population. Introducing different forms of pooling in a predictive model of early visual processing as implemented in SDPC can therefore be viewed as a theoretical framework that explains the diversity of structural and functional phenomena observed in V1.

Conferences are spaces to meet and network within and across academic and technical fields, learn about new advances, and share our work. They can help define career paths and create long-lasting collaborations and opportunities. However, these opportunities are not equal for all. This article introduces 10 simple rules to host an inclusive conference based on the authors’ recent experience organizing the 2021 edition of the useR! statistical computing conference, which attracted a broad range of participants from academia, industry, government, and the nonprofit sector. Coming from different backgrounds, career stages, and even continents, we embraced the challenge of organizing a high-quality virtual conference in the context of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and making it a kind, inclusive, and accessible experience for as many people as possible. The rules result from our lessons learned before, during, and after the organization of the conference. They have been written mainly for potential organizers and selection committees of conferences and contain multiple practical tips to help a variety of events become more accessible and inclusive. We see this as a starting point for conversations and efforts towards building more inclusive conferences across the world. * Translated versions of the English abstract and the list of rules are available in 10 languages in S1 Text: Arabic, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Tamil, and Thai.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Helix 8 in chemotactic receptors of the complement system</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Szymon Wisniewski, Paulina Dragan, Anna Makal, Dorota Latek</p>

Host response to infection involves the activation of the complement system leading to the production of anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a. Complement factor C5a exerts its effect through the activation of C5aR1, chemotactic receptor 1, and triggers the G protein-coupled signaling cascade. Orthosteric and allosteric antagonists of C5aR1 are a novel strategy for anti-inflammatory therapies. Here, we discuss recent crystal structures of inactive C5aR1 in terms of an inverted orientation of helix H8, unobserved in other GPCR structures. An analysis of mutual interactions of subunits in the C5aR1—G protein complex has provided new insights into the activation mechanism of this distinct receptor. By comparing two C5aR receptors C5aR1 and C5aR2 we explained differences between their signaling pathways on the molecular level. By means of molecular dynamics we explained why C5aR2 cannot transduce signal through the G protein pathway but instead recruits beta-arrestin. A comparison of microsecond MD trajectories started from active and inactive C5aR1 receptor conformations has provided insights into details of local and global changes in the transmembrane domain induced by interactions with the Gα subunit and explained the impact of inverted H8 on the C5aR1 activation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The Gr64 cluster of gustatory receptors promotes survival and proteostasis of epithelial cells in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michael E. Baumgartner, Alex Mastrogiannopoulos, Iwo Kucinski, Paul F. Langton, Eugenia Piddini</p>

Gustatory Receptor 64 (Gr64) genes are a cluster of 6 neuronally expressed receptors involved in sweet taste sensation in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Gr64s modulate calcium signalling and excitatory responses to several different sugars. Here, we discover an unexpected nonneuronal function of Gr64 receptors and show that they promote proteostasis in epithelial cells affected by proteotoxic stress. Using heterozygous mutations in ribosome proteins (<i>Rp</i>), which have recently been shown to induce proteotoxic stress and protein aggregates in cells, we show that <i>Rp/+</i> cells in <i>Drosophila</i> imaginal discs up-regulate expression of the entire Gr64 cluster and depend on these receptors for survival. We further show that loss of Gr64 in <i>Rp/+</i> cells exacerbates stress pathway activation and proteotoxic stress by negatively affecting autophagy and proteasome function. This work identifies a noncanonical role in proteostasis maintenance for a family of gustatory receptors known for their function in neuronal sensation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">If amyloid drives Alzheimer disease, why have anti-amyloid therapies not yet slowed cognitive decline?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christian Haass, Dennis Selkoe</p>

Strong genetic evidence supports an imbalance between production and clearance of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) in people with Alzheimer disease (AD). Microglia that are potentially involved in alternative mechanisms are actually integral to the amyloid cascade. Fluid biomarkers and brain imaging place accumulation of Aβ at the beginning of molecular and clinical changes in the disease. So why have clinical trials of anti-amyloid therapies not provided clear-cut benefits to patients with AD? Can anti-amyloid therapies robustly decrease Aβ in the human brain, and if so, could this lowering be too little, too late? These central questions in research on AD are being urgently addressed.

                Introduction: This study aimed to produce community-level geo-spatial mapping of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Ontario Canada in near real-time to support decision-making. This was accomplished by area-to-area geostatistical analysis, space-time integration, and spatial interpolation of COVID-19 positive individuals. Methods: COVID-19 cases and locations were curated for geostatistical analyses from March 2020 through June 2021, corresponding to the first, second, and third waves of infections. Daily cases were aggregated according to designated forward sortation area (FSA), and postal codes (PC) in municipal regions Hamilton, Kitchener/Waterloo, London, Ottawa, Toronto, and Windsor/Essex county. Hotspots were identified with area-to-area tests including Getis-Ord Gi*, Global Moran’s I spatial autocorrelation, and Local Moran’s I asymmetric clustering and outlier analyses. Case counts were also interpolated across geographic regions by Empirical Bayesian Kriging, which localizes high concentrations of COVID-19 positive tests, independent of FSA or PC boundaries. The Geostatistical Disease Epidemiology Toolbox, which is freely-available software, automates the identification of these regions and produces digital maps for public health professionals to assist in pandemic management of contact tracing and distribution of other resources.  Results: This study provided indicators in real-time of likely, community-level disease transmission through innovative geospatial analyses of COVID-19 incidence data. Municipal and provincial results were validated by comparisons with known outbreaks at long-term care and other high density residences and on farms. PC-level analyses revealed hotspots at higher geospatial resolution than public reports of FSAs, and often sooner. Results of different tests and kriging were compared to determine consistency among hotspot assignments. Concurrent or consecutive hotspots in close proximity suggested potential community transmission of COVID-19 from cluster and outlier analysis of neighboring PCs and by kriging. Results were also stratified by population based-categories (sex, age, and presence/absence of comorbidities). Conclusions: Earlier recognition of hotspots could reduce public health burdens of COVID-19 and expedite contact tracing.

                Historically, oral sex is part of human sexual behaviour even though some consider it taboo, and its expression is deemed inappropriate. Human rights also stand out as technology becomes more sophisticated, leading to its practice disclosure in the 21st century. The large-scale oral sex discussion in media encourages people to express it, and there is feedback on whether it is right or not. It all depends on each person’s values. We found this sexual behaviour occurs everywhere regardless of religion, culture and race. Pop culture influences this behaviour considerably. It can be seen in music, movies and television programmes that allude to oral sex. Numerous motivations underlying this behaviour include sexual pleasure for the sake of psychological well-being. It is undeniable that this behaviour is still controversial. There is a risk of it causing disease, but it reportedly provides many benefits. Oral sex is not a new behaviour crossing boundaries, according to our theory. It is an old behaviour that has been highlighted because of the factors that support it. This behaviour, still considered taboo, has its disadvantages, such as sexually transmitted disease and oral cancer, but also has benefits, such as preventing preeclampsia.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Astrocytes are the main homeostatic cell of the brain involved in many processes related to cognition, immune response, and energy expenditure. It has been suggested that the distribution of astrocytes is associated with brain size, and that they are specialized in humans. To evaluate these, we quantified astrocyte density, soma volume, and total glia density in layer I and white matter in Brodmann's area 9 of humans, chimpanzees, baboons, and macaques. We found that layer I astrocyte density, soma volume, and ratio of astrocytes to total glia cells were highest in humans and increased with brain size. Overall glia density in layer I and white matter were relatively invariant across brain sizes, potentially due to their important metabolic functions on a per volume basis. We also quantified two transporters involved in metabolism through the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle, excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). We expected these transporters would be increased in human brains due to their high rate of metabolic consumption and associated gene activity. While humans have higher EAAT2 cell density, GLUT1 vessel volume, and GLUT1 area fraction compared to baboons and chimpanzees, they did not differ from macaques. Therefore, EAAT2 and GLUT1 are not related to increased energetic demands of the human brain. Taken together, these data provide evidence that astrocytes play a unique role in both brain expansion and evolution among primates, with an emphasis on layer I astrocytes having a potentially significant role in human-specific metabolic processing and cognition.</p>

                CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells use T cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 complexes, and CD4, to respond to peptide antigens within MHCII molecules (pMHCII). We report here that, through ~435 million years of evolution in jawed vertebrates, purifying selection has shaped motifs in the extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular domains of eutherian CD4 that enhance pMHCII responses, and covary with residues in an intracellular motif that inhibits responses. Importantly, while CD4 interactions with the Src kinase, Lck, are viewed as key to pMHCII responses, our data indicate that CD4-Lck interactions derive their importance from the counterbalancing activity of the inhibitory motif, as well as motifs that direct CD4-Lck pairs to specific membrane compartments. These results have implications for the evolution and function of complex transmembrane receptors and for biomimetic engineering.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mapping odorant sensitivities reveals a sparse but structured representation of olfactory chemical space by sensory input to the mouse olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                In olfactory systems, convergence of sensory neurons onto glomeruli generates a map of odorant receptor identity. How glomerular maps relate to sensory space remains unclear. We sought to better characterize this relationship in the mouse olfactory system by defining glomeruli in terms of the odorants to which they are most sensitive. Using high-throughput odorant delivery and ultrasensitive imaging of sensory inputs, we imaged responses to 185 odorants presented at concentrations determined to activate only one or a few glomeruli across the dorsal olfactory bulb. The resulting datasets defined the tuning properties of glomeruli - and, by inference, their cognate odorant receptors - in a low-concentration regime, and yielded consensus maps of glomerular sensitivity across a wide range of chemical space. Glomeruli were extremely narrowly tuned, with ~25% responding to only one odorant, and extremely sensitive, responding to their effective odorants at sub-picomolar to nanomolar concentrations. Such narrow tuning in this concentration regime allowed for reliable functional identification of many glomeruli based on a single diagnostic odorant. At the same time, the response spectra of glomeruli responding to multiple odorants was best predicted by straightforward odorant structural features, and glomeruli sensitive to distinct odorants with common structural features were spatially clustered. These results define an underlying structure to the primary representation of sensory space by the mouse olfactory system.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Claudin5 protects the peripheral endothelial barrier in an organ and vessel type-specific manner</a></h4>

              
                Dysfunctional and leaky blood vessels resulting from disruption of the endothelial cell (EC) barrier accompanies numerous diseases. The EC barrier is established through endothelial cell tight and adherens junctions. However, the expression patterning and precise contribution of different junctional proteins to the EC barrier is poorly understood. Here, we focus on organs with continuous endothelium to identify structural and functional <i>in vivo</i> characteristics of the EC barrier. Assembly of multiple single-cell RNAseq datasets into a single integrated database revealed the variability and commonalities of EC barrier patterning. Across tissues, Claudin5 exhibited diminishing expression along the arteriovenous axis, correlating with EC barrier integrity. Functional analysis identified tissue-specific differences in leakage patterning and response to the leakage agonist histamine. Loss of Claudin5 enhanced histamine-induced leakage in an organotypic and vessel type-specific manner in an inducible, EC-specific, knock-out mouse. Mechanistically, Claudin5 loss left junction ultrastructure unaffected but altered its composition, with concomitant loss of zonula occludens-1 and upregulation of VE-Cadherin expression. These findings uncover the organ-specific organisation of the EC barrier and distinct importance of Claudin5 in different vascular beds, providing insights to modify EC barrier stability in a targeted, organ-specific manner.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Targeted depletion of uterine glandular Foxa2 induces embryonic diapause in mice</a></h4>

              
                Embryonic diapause is a reproductive strategy in which embryo development and growth is temporarily arrested within the uterus to ensure the survival of neonates and mothers during unfavorable conditions. Pregnancy is reinitiated when conditions become favorable for neonatal survival. The mechanism of how the uterus enters diapause in various species remains unclear. Mice with uterine depletion of <i>Foxa2</i>, a transcription factor, are infertile. In this study, we show that dormant blastocysts are recovered from these mice on day 8 of pregnancy with persistent expression of uterine <i>Msx1</i>, a gene critical to maintaining the uterine quiescent state, suggesting that these mice enter embryonic diapause. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) can resume implantation in these mice. Although estrogen is critical for implantation in progesterone-primed uterus, our current model reveals that FOXA2-independent estrogenic effects are detrimental to sustaining uterine quiescence. Interestingly, P<sub>4</sub> and anti-estrogen can prolong uterine quiescence in the absence of FOXA2. Although we find that <i>Msx1</i> expression persists in the uterus deficient in <i>Foxa2</i>, the complex relationship of FOXA2 with <i>Msx</i> genes and estrogen receptors remains to be explored.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single nuclei analyses reveal transcriptional profiles and marker genes for diverse supraspinal populations</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian brain contains numerous neurons distributed across forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain that project axons to the lower spinal cord and work in concert to control movement and achieve homeostasis. Extensive work has mapped the anatomical location of supraspinal cell types and continues to establish specific physiological functions. The patterns of gene expression that typify and distinguish these disparate populations, however, are mostly unknown. Here we combined retrograde labeling of supraspinal cell nuclei with fluorescence activated nuclei sorting and single nuclei RNA sequencing analyses to transcriptionally profile neurons that project axons from the mouse brain to lumbar spinal cord. We identified fourteen transcriptionally distinct cell types and used a combination of established and newly identified marker genes to assign an anatomical location to each. To validate the putative marker genes, we visualized selected transcripts and confirmed selective expression within lumbar-projecting neurons in discrete supraspinal regions. Finally, we illustrate the potential utility of these data by examining the expression of transcription factors that distinguish different supraspinal cell types and by surveying the expression of receptors for growth and guidance cues that may be present in the spinal cord. Collectively these data establish transcriptional differences between anatomically defined supraspinal populations, identify a new set of marker genes of use in future experiments, and provide insight into potential differences in cellular and physiological activity across the supraspinal connectome.

                Oxytocin-expressing paraventricular hypothalamic neurons (PVN-OT neurons) integrate afferent signals from the gut including cholecystokinin (CCK) to adjust whole-body energy homeostasis. However, the molecular underpinnings by which PVN-OT neurons orchestrate gut-to-brain feeding control remain unclear. Here, we show that mice undergoing selective ablation of PVN-OT neurons fail to reduce food intake in response to CCK and develop hyperphagic obesity on chow diet. Notably, exposing wildtype mice to a high-fat/high-sugar (HFHS) diet recapitulates this insensitivity towards CCK, which is linked to diet-induced transcriptional and electrophysiological aberrations specifically in PVN-OT neurons. Restoring OT pathways in DIO mice via chemogenetics or polypharmacology sufficiently re-establishes CCKs anorexigenic effects. Lastly, by single-cell profiling, we identify a specialized PVN-OT neuronal subpopulation with increased {kappa}-opioid signaling under HFHS diet, which restrains their CCK-evoked activation. In sum, we here document a novel (patho)mechanism by which PVN-OT signaling uncouples a gut-brain satiation pathway under obesogenic conditions.

                Predictive processing postulates the existence of prediction error neurons in cortex. Functionally, both negative and positive prediction error neurons have been identified in layer 2/3 of visual cortex, but whether they correspond to transcriptionally defined subpopulations is unclear. Here we used the activity-dependent, photoconvertible marker CaMPARI2 to tag neurons in layer 2/3 of visual cortex during stimuli and behaviors designed to trigger prediction errors. We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing on these populations and found that previously annotated Adamts2 and Rrad layer 2/3 cell types were enriched when photolabeling for negative or positive prediction error responses respectively. Finally, we validated these results functionally by designing artificial promoters for use in AAV vectors to express genetically encoded calcium indicators. Thus, positive and negative prediction error responses mapped onto transcriptionally distinct cell types in layer 2/3 that can be targeted using AAV vectors.

                Over the past few decades, daily exposure to radiofrequency (RF) fields has been increasing due to the rapid development of wireless and medical imaging technologies. Under extreme circumstances, exposure to very strong RF energy can lead to heating of body tissue, even resulting in tissue injury. The presence of implanted devices, moreover, can amplify RF effects on surrounding tissue. Therefore, it is important to understand the interactions of RF fields with tissue in the presence of implants, in order to establish appropriate wireless safety protocols, and also to extend the benefits of medical imaging to increasing numbers of people with implanted medical devices. This study explored the neurological effects of RF exposure in rodents implanted with neuronal recording electrodes. We exposed freely moving and anesthetized rats and mice to 950 MHz RF energy while monitoring their brain activity, temperature, and behavior. We found that RF exposure could induce fast onset firing of single neurons without heat injury. In addition, brain implants enhanced the effect of RF stimulation resulting in reversible behavioral changes. Using an optical temperature measurement system, we found greater than tenfold increase in brain temperature in the vicinity of the implant. On the one hand, our results underline the importance of careful safety assessment for brain implanted devices, but on the other hand, we also show that metal implants may be used for neurostimulation if brain temperature can be kept within safe limits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Superficial white matter across the lifespan: volume, thickness, change, and relationship with cortical features</a></h4>

              
                Superficial white matter (SWM) represents a significantly understudied part of the human brain, despite comprising a large portion of brain volume and making up a majority of cortical structural connections. Using multiple, high-quality, datasets with large sample sizes (N=2421, age range 5-100) in combination with methodological advances in tractography, we quantified features of SWM volume and thickness across the brain and across the lifespan. We address four questions: (1) How does U-fiber volume change with age? (2) What does U-fiber thickness look like across the brain? (3) How does SWM thickness change with age? (4) Are there relationships between SWM thickness and cortical features? Our main findings are that (1) SWM volume shows unique volumetric trajectories with age that are distinct from gray matter and other white matter trajectories; (2) SWM thickness varies across the brain, with patterns robust across individuals and across the population at the region-level and vertex-level; (3) SWM shows nonlinear changes across the lifespan that vary across regions; and (4) SWM thickness is associated with cortical thickness and curvature. For the first time, we show that SWM volume follows a similar trend as overall white matter volume, peaking at a similar time in adolescence, leveling off throughout adulthood, and decreasing with age thereafter. Notably, the relative fraction of total brain volume of SWM continuously increases with age, and consequently takes up a larger proportion of total white matter volume, unlike the other tissue types that decrease with respect to total brain volume. This study represents the first characterization of SWM features across the lifespan and provides the background for characterizing normal aging and insight into the mechanisms associated with SWM development and decline.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Endogenous Retroviruses and TDP-43 Proteinopathy Form a Sustaining Feedback to Drive the Intercellular Spread of Neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative disorders are thought to initiate focally and then spread over time through neural circuits. A mechanism that has been proposed to explain this is the inter-cellular movement of misfolded prion-like proteins that then recruit normally folded proteins in recipient cells to also adopt pathological conformations. Such a mechanism has been proposed, for example, to explain the propagation of abnormally phosphorylated cytoplasmic inclusions of TAR-DNA-Binding protein (TDP-43) during the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). But unlike transmissible prion diseases such as mad cow disease, which can be caused by ingestion or by injection into animal brains of misfolded PrP, ALS and FTD are not infectious and the injection of phosphorylated and aggregated TDP-43 protein into rodent brains is not sufficient to cause disease phenotypes unless those animals also express high levels of transgenic TDP-43 protein. This suggests a missing component of a positive feedback that is necessary to sustain disease progression. We provide evidence that endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are that missing component. We demonstrate that ERV expression and TDP-43 proteinopathy are mutually reinforcing. Expression of either the Drosophila ERV, gypsy (mdg4) or the human ERV, HERV-K (HML-2) are each sufficient to stimulate cytoplasmic aggregation of human TDP-43. Importantly. We also demonstrate that viral ERV transmission causes propagation of such TDP-43 pathology to cells that express physiological levels of TDP-43, whether they are in contact or at a distance. This mechanism underlies the toxicity of glial cells to neurons and other glia in a Drosophila in vivo model.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Epigenetic age acceleration is associated with oligodendrocyte proportions in MSA and control brain tissue</a></h4>

              
                Aims: Epigenetic clocks are widely applied as surrogates for biological age in different tissues and/or diseases, including several neurodegenerative diseases. Despite white matter (WM) changes often being observed in neurodegenerative diseases, no study has investigated epigenetic ageing in white matter. Methods: We analysed the performances of two DNA methylation-based clocks, DNAmClockMulti and DNAmClockCortical, in post-mortem WM tissue from multiple subcortical regions and the cerebellum, and in oligodendrocyte-enriched nuclei. We also examined epigenetic ageing in control and multiple system atrophy (MSA) (WM and mixed WM and grey matter), as MSA is a neurodegenerative disease comprising pronounced WM changes and alpha-synuclein aggregates in oligodendrocytes. Results: Estimated DNA methylation (DNAm) ages showed strong correlations with chronological ages, even in WM (e.g., DNAmClockCortical, r = [0.80-0.97], p<0.05). However, performances and DNAm age estimates differed between clocks and brain regions. DNAmClockMulti significantly underestimated ages in all cohorts except in the MSA prefrontal cortex mixed tissue, whereas DNAmClockCortical tended towards age overestimations. Pronounced age overestimations in the oligodendrocyte-enriched cohorts (e.g., oligodendrocyte-enriched nuclei, p=6.1x10-5) suggested that this cell-type ages faster. Indeed, significant positive correlations were observed between estimated oligodendrocyte proportions and DNAm age acceleration estimated by DNAmClockCortical (r>0.31, p<0.05), and similar trends with DNAmClockMulti. Although increased age acceleration was observed in MSA compared to controls, no significant differences were observed upon adjustment for possible confounders (e.g., cell-type proportions). Conclusions: Our findings show that oligodendrocyte proportions positively influence epigenetic age acceleration across brain regions and highlight the need to further investigate this in ageing and neurodegeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Artifacts can be deceiving: The actual location of deep brain stimulation electrodes differs from the artifact seen on magnetic resonance images</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a common treatment for a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Recent studies have highlighted the role of neuroimaging in localizing the position of electrode contacts relative to target brain areas in order to optimize DBS programming. Among different imaging methods, postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been widely used for DBS electrode localization; however, the geometrical distortion induced by the lead limits its accuracy. In this work, we investigated to what degree the difference between the actual location of the lead's tip and the location of the tip estimated from the MRI artifact varies depending on the MRI sequence parameters such as acquisition plane and phase encoding direction, as well as the lead's extracranial configuration. Accordingly, an imaging technique to increase the accuracy of lead localization was devised and discussed. Methods: We designed and constructed an anthropomorphic phantom with an implanted DBS system following 18 clinically relevant configurations. The phantom was scanned at a Siemens 1.5 Tesla Aera scanner using a T1MPRAGE sequence optimized for clinical use and a T1TSE sequence optimized for research purposes. We varied slice acquisition plane and phase encoding direction and calculated the distance between the caudal tip of the DBS lead MRI artifact and the actual tip of the lead, as estimated from MRI reference markers. Results: Imaging parameters and lead configuration substantially altered the difference in the depth of the lead within its MRI artifact on the scale of several millimeters - with a difference as large as 4.99 millimeters. The actual tip of the DBS lead was found to be consistently more rostral than the tip estimated from the MR image artifact. The smallest difference between the tip of the DBS lead and the tip of the MRI artifact using the clinically relevant sequence (i.e., T1MPRAGE) was found with the sagittal acquisition plane and anterior-posterior phase encoding direction. Discussion/Conclusion: The actual tip of an implanted DBS lead is located up to several millimeters rostral to the tip of the lead's artifact on postoperative MR images. This distance depends on the MRI sequence parameters and the DBS system's extracranial trajectory. MRI parameters may be altered to improve this localization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">NeuronBridge: an intuitive web application for neuronal morphology search across large data sets</a></h4>

              
                Neuroscience research in Drosophila is benefiting from large-scale connectomics efforts using electron microscopy (EM) to reveal all the neurons in a brain and their connections. In order to exploit this knowledge base, researchers target individual neurons and study their function. Therefore, vast libraries of fly driver lines expressing fluorescent reporter genes in sets of neurons have been created and imaged using confocal light microscopy (LM). However, creating a fly line for driving gene expression within a single neuron found in the EM connectome remains a challenge, as it typically requires identifying a pair of fly lines where only the neuron of interest is expressed in both. This task and other emerging scientific workflows require finding similar neurons across large data sets imaged using different modalities. Here, we present NeuronBridge, a web application for easily and rapidly finding putative morphological matches between large datasets of neurons imaged using different modalities. We describe the functionality and construction of the NeuronBridge service, including its user-friendly GUI, data model, serverless cloud architecture, and massively parallel image search engine. NeuronBridge is openly accessible at http://neuronbridge.janelia.org/.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Estimating functional EEG sources using topographical templates</a></h4>

              
                Electroencephalography (EEG) is a common and inexpensive method to record neural activity in humans. However, it lacks spatial resolution making it difficult to determine which areas of the brain are responsible for the observed EEG response. Here we present a new easy-to-use method that relies on EEG topographical templates. Using MRI and fMRI scans of 50 participants, we simulated how the activity in each visual area appears on the scalp and averaged this signal to produce functionally defined EEG templates. Once created, these templates can be used to estimate how much each visual area contributes to the observed EEG activity. We tested this method on extensive simulations and on real data. The proposed procedure is as good as bespoke individual source localization methods and has several strengths. First, because it does not rely on individual brain scans, it is inexpensive and can be used on any EEG dataset, past or present. Second, the results are readily interpretable in terms of functional brain regions and can be compared across neuroimaging techniques. Finally, this method is easy to understand, simple to use, and expandable to other brain sources. We thus expect it to be of wide interest to EEG users.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Establishment of Transgenic Fluorescent Mice for Screening Synaptogenic Adhesion Molecules</a></h4>

              
                Synapse is the fundamental structure for neurons to transmit information between cells. The proper synapse formation is crucial for developing neural circuits and cognitive functions of the brain. The aberrant synapse formation has been proved to cause many neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability. Synaptic cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are thought to play a major role in achieving mechanistic cell-cell recognition and initiating synapse formation via trans-synaptic interactions. Although several synaptic CAMs, such as neurexins, neuroligins, SynCAMs, and LRRTMs, have been identified as synaptogenic molecules, these molecules so far as we know cannot fully explain the mechanism of synapse formation. There should be other synaptogenic adhesion molecules that remain undiscovered. Artificial synapse formation (ASF) assays, the commonly used method for screening synaptogenesis molecules, is time-consuming and labor-intensive due to the long-lasting immunostaining step. To skip this step, we generated synaptotagmin 1-tdTomato (Syt1-TDT) transgenic mice by inserting the tdTomato-fused synaptotagmin 1 coding sequence into the genome of C57BL/6J mice. In the brain of Syt1-TDT transgenic mice, the Syt1-TDT signals were widely observed in different areas. In the cultured hippocampal neurons, the Syt1-TDT signals merged with several synaptic markers, suggesting the well synaptic localization of Syt1-TDT. Compared to the wild-type (WT) mouse neurons, cultured hippocampal neurons from Syt1-TDT transgenic mice presented normal synaptic neurotransmission. In ASF assays, neurons from Syt1-TDT transgenic mice could form synaptic connections with HEK293T cells expressing neuroligin2, LRRTM2, and Slitrk2 without immunostaining. Therefore, our work suggested that the Syt1-TDT transgenic mice with the ability to label synapses by tdTomato will be a convenient tool for screening synaptogenic molecules.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Apicosome: newly identified cell-type-specific organelle in mouse cochlear and vestibular hair cells</a></h4>

              
                Cochlear and vestibular hair cells in the inner ear are highly specialized sensory receptors for sound waves and acceleration of body movements; these cells can perform their specialized functions because of their distinctive morphology and some unique organelles that they harbor. Here, we report a serendipitous identification in the mouse of a hair-cell-specific organelle, which we name "apicosome." The apicosome was recognized by anti-FLRT1 antibodies but contains no FLRT1, and the organelle presents several distinctive characteristics: (1) the apicosome typically appears as a single entity (~500 nm in diameter), but occasionally as two entities, in hair cells; (2) it first appears in the subapical region at the neural side at embryonic day (E) 17-18 in cochlear hair cells, subsequently descends to the perinuclear region during the first postnatal week, and completely disappears around postnatal day (P) 10; (3) in vestibular hair cells, it can be detected in the subapical region of neonatal (P3) cells and persists in adult hair cells although it becomes smaller and more distant from the subapical region; (4) the timing of apicosome translocation and disappearance during development is correlated in kinocilium maintenance; (5) the organelle is potentially associated with microtubules; and (6) the appearance of the apicosome is irregular in supernumerary hair cells and this is likely linked to anomalous lateral inhibition. Thus, our study identifies a previously undescribed organelle in sensory hair cells and lays the foundation for further characterization of this specialized structure potentially linked to hair-cell development and morphogenesis

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-dependent NMDA receptor function is regulated by the Amyloid Precursor Protein</a></h4>

              
                N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are critical for the maturation and plasticity of glutamatergic synapses. In the hippocampus, NMDARs mainly contain GluN2A and/or GluN2B regulatory subunits. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) has emerged as a putative regulator of NMDARs, but the impact of this interaction to their function is largely unknown. By combining patch-clamp electrophysiology and molecular approaches, we unravel a dual mechanism by which APP controls GluN2B-NMDARs, depending on the life stage. We show that APP is highly abundant specifically at the postnatal postsynapse. It interacts with GluN2B-NMDARs, controlling its synaptic content and mediated currents, both in infant mice and primary neuronal cultures. Upon aging, the APP amyloidogenic derived C-terminal fragments, rather than APP full length, contribute to aberrant GluN2B-NMDAR currents. Accordingly, we found that the APP processing is increased upon aging, both in mice and human brain, and interfering with this mechanism normalized the aberrant currents. While the first mechanism might be essential for synaptic maturation during development, the latter could contribute to age-related synaptic impairments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Agency and Expectations in Pain Treatment: An Investigation of the Active Inference Model</a></h4>

              
                The fact that we cannot tickle ourselves is traditionally explained by the attenuation of somatosensation by predictions from a forward model of self-generated movements. Alternatively, it has been suggested within the framework of active inference that Bayes-optimal reduction of sensory precision can explain this phenomenon. Combining a pain paradigm with stimulus-related expectations allows to compare both models through predictions from the Bayesian account of expectation-based hypoalgesia, where pain is influenced by the precisions of somatosensation and expectation. In two experiments, heat pain was sham-treated either externally or by the subject, while a cue created higher or lower treatment expectations. Both experiments revealed greater pain relief under self-treatment and high treatment expectations. Electroencephalography revealed a modulation of theta-to-beta frequencies linked to agency and top-down modulations of pain perception. Computational modeling showed that this is better explained by an attenuation of somatosensation than a downregulation of somatosensation precision, favoring the forward model.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">mTORC1 hyperactivation causes sensory integration deficits due to habenula impairment</a></h4>

              
                Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is an integration hub for extracellular and intracellular signals necessary for proper brain development. Hyperactivation of mTORC1 is found in many developmental diseases, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Atypical reactivity to sensory stimuli is often found in patients with ASD. The most frequent hereditary cause of ASD is Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), in which inactivating mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes result in hyperactivation of the mTORC1 pathway. We have discovered that the zebrafish model of TSC, tsc2vu242/vu242 mutants lack light preference, a behavior requiring integration of multiple sensory inputs. Here, we show that the lack of light preference in tsc2vu242/vu242 zebrafish is caused by aberrant sensory integration of light stimuli in the left dorsal habenula. Single-cell calcium imaging analysis revealed that tsc2vu242/vu242 fish showed impaired function of the left dorsal habenula, in which neurons exhibited higher activity and lacked habituation to the light stimuli resulting in atypical response to light. Lack of light-preference behavior and abnormal neuronal activity in the left dorsal habenula were rescued by rapamycin, indicating that hyperactive mTorC1 causes aberrant habenula function and impaired sensory integration resulting in a lack of light preference. Our results link sensory integration deficits seen in TSC patients suffering from ASD with hyperactive mTORC1 and suggest that mTORC1 hyperactivity contributes to atypical reactivity to sensory stimuli in ASD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visuomotor phase-locked loop reproduces elliptic hand trajectories across different rhythms</a></h4>

              
                A well-known phenomenon in human hand movement is the correlation between speed and curvature, also known as the speed-curvature power law (V{approx}kC{beta}). In drawing elliptic shapes, the exponent is often found to be {beta} {approx} -1/3, however it is not clear why the power law appears and why the exponent is near -1/3. More fundamentally, it is not clear how do people track elliptic targets. In answering these questions, I've analyzed trajectories of participants' cursors while they tracked visual targets moving along elliptical paths, across different target speed profiles and cycle frequencies. The speed-curvature power law emerged when drawing ellipses at about 1 Hz or faster, regardless of the target speed profile, and it did not emerge for lower frequency movements. Analysis of the position frequency spectrum shows that the target-cursor trajectory transformation may be seen as a low-pass filter. Comparison of different hypothetical salient features of the visual field shows that phase difference (angular difference between the cursor and the target) and size difference (difference in the sizes of the elliptic paths) are the features most likely used in the task. The next experiment confirmed that phase and size difference could be controlled variables because participants kept them stable even under direct pseudorandom disturbances. A numerical model simulating the sensorimotor processes of the participant, similar to a phase-locked loop, using the visual features of phase and size difference as controlled variables, performed the same target tracking tasks as the participants. When fitted, the model closely replicated position and speed profiles of the participants across all trials, as well as the emergence of the power law at high frequencies. The model also reproduced the trajectories of participants in the experiment with direct pseudorandom disturbances. In conclusion (1) the speed-curvature power law emerges as a side effect of movement system properties, namely low-pass filtering in the sensorimotor loop; (2) people could be tracking elliptical targets by varying the frequency and amplitude of an internal pattern generator until the produced phase and shape size match the target's phase and shape size. The model generates new hypotheses about the neural mechanisms of rhythmic movement control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cannabinoids Activate the Insulin Pathway to Modulate Mobilization of Cholesterol in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans requires exogenous cholesterol to survive and its depletion leads to early development arrest. Thus, tight regulation of cholesterol storage and distribution within the organism is critical. Previously, we demonstrated that the endocannabinoid (eCB) 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) plays a key role in C. elegans modulating sterol mobilization, but the mechanism is unknown. Here we show that mutations in the ocr-2 and osm-9 genes coding for transient receptors potential V (TRPV) ion channels, dramatically reduces the effect of 2-AG in cholesterol mobilization. Through genetic analysis combined with the rescuing of larval arrest induced by sterol starvation we found that the insulin/IGF-1signaling (IIS) pathway and UNC-31/CAPS, a calcium-activated regulator of neural dense-core vesicles release, are essential for 2-AG-mediated stimulation of cholesterol mobilization. These findings indicate that 2-AG-dependent cholesterol trafficking requires the release of insulin peptides and signaling through the DAF-2 insulin receptor. These results suggest that 2-AG acts as an endogenous modulator of TRPV signal transduction to control intracellular sterol traffic through modulation of the IGF-1 signaling pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">When mechanical engineering inspired from physiology improves postural-related somatosensory processes</a></h4>

              
                Being the first stimulated by the relative movement of foot skin and the underneath moving support surface, the plantar tactile receptors (i.e., mechanoreceptors) play an important role in the sensorimotor transformation giving rise to a postural reaction. In this light, a surface (i.e., biomimetic) complying with the characteristics of the mechanoreceptors and the skin dermatoglyphs (i.e., pattern of the ridges) should facilitate the cortical processes in response to the somatosensory stimulation involved in the balance recovery motor control. Healthy young adults (n = 21) were standing still either on a biomimetic surface or on two control surfaces (i.e., grooved or smooth), when a sudden but low acceleration of the supporting surface along the lateral direction was triggered. A shorter and greater robust evoked somatosensory response (i.e., SEP) was observed when participants were standing on the biomimetic surface. As well, a lower oscillatory response in the time-frequency domain, including a theta response (5-7 Hz) in the left posterior parietal cortex (PPC), was recorded with the biomimetic surface. The observed higher shear forces induced by the interaction between the feet and the biomimetic surface, during the displacement, was likely at the origin of the increased SEP. Besides, the decrease of theta power suggests that the balance task became less challenging. This interpretation was tested in a second experiment by adding a cognitive task, which should be less detrimental for the postural reaction in participants standing on a biomimetic surface. According to that hypothesis, an efficient postural reaction (i.e., shorter latency and greater amplitude) was observed for the biomimetic surface.

	<p>(1) Background: The brainstem plays an essential role in the early stage of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), but it is not widely tested in clinical examinations of PD. Vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) are recognized as fundamental tools in the assessment of brainstem function. The aim of our meta-analysis was to assess the abnormal findings of VEMPs in patients with PD. (2) Methods: Up to 14 February 2022, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched to evaluate VEMPs in patients with PD in comparison with respective controls. The study protocol was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42022311103). (3) Results: A total of 15 studies were finally included in our meta-analysis. The absence rates of VEMPs in patients with PD were significantly higher than those of control groups (cVEMP: OR = 6.77; oVEMP: OR = 13.9; mVEMP: OR = 7.52). A delayed P13 latency, a decreased peak-to-peak amplitude, and an increased AAR of cVEMP, and a delayed oVEMP P15 latency were also found in patients with PD. (4) Conclusions: Our meta-analysis indicates abnormal VEMP findings in patients with PD, revealing the dysfunction of the brainstem in PD. VEMP tests, especially cVEMP tests, could be a helpful method for the early detection of PD.</p>

	<p>Background: Obesity is a condition that affects humans both physically and mentally. Moreover, many psychopathological conditions can be observed in obese patients that may threaten the positive outcomes of bariatric surgery. Purpose: The aim of this study was to identify the main psychopathological correlates of obese candidates for bariatric surgery, with particular attention on the relationship between psychopathology and gender. Methods: In total, 273 candidates for bariatric surgery for obesity underwent a psychiatric evaluation using a compilation of psychometric scales: the Revised Symptom Checklist 90-R (SCL-90-R), the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), the Binge Eating Scale (BES), the Body Uneasiness Test (BUT) and the Obesity-Related Well-Being (ORWELL 97). The sample was divided on the basis of gender and binge eating disorder (BED) severity. Comparisons between the groups were performed using an analysis of variance model (ANOVA) or a Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s chi-squared test. Further, we also divided our sample into a severe binge eating group (score &amp;amp;gt; 27), a mild to moderate group (18 &amp;amp;lt; score &amp;amp;lt; 26) and a low/no symptoms group (score &amp;amp;lt; 17). Results: Male and female subjects showed different results for the BES, with higher scores reported among women (17.50 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.59) compared to men (14.08 &amp;amp;plusmn; 8.64). Women also showed higher scores across most of the SCL-90-R domains and worse outcomes in terms of quality of life. Both women and men in the severe binge eating group reported higher scores for the SCL-90-R. Conclusion: The symptoms of BED, along with body image dissatisfaction (BID), are among the most important to investigate for candidates for bariatric surgery in order to improve the surgery outcomes. Level of evidence: Level III as the evidence came from a cohort analytic study.</p>

	<p>Histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is a rare neoplasm composed of cells with immunohistochemical characteristics of mature histiocytes. It can be disseminated or localized and usually involves the skin, spleen, and gastrointestinal tract. Primary involvement of the vertebral column is extremely rare. We report a 29-year-old female who presented with neck pain and had a destructive 35*43*48 mm lesion in C2 with a paravertebral extension. The initial biopsy did not lead to the correct diagnosis. She later developed dysphagia, and the anterior approach was used for tumor decompression. The diagnosis of cervical histiocytic sarcoma was made, and she underwent radiotherapy. The follow-up MRI showed a marked response to radiotherapy. Here, we report the first case of cervical HS, review all cases of vertebral HS, compare patients&amp;amp;rsquo; characteristics and clinical courses, and discuss diagnostic nuances and treatment options.</p>

	<p>Patients with severe substance use disorders are often characterized by neurocognitive impairments and elevated mental health symptom load, typically associated with craving intensity and substance use relapse. There is a need to improve the predictive capabilities of when relapse occurs in order to improve substance use treatment. The current paper contains data from 19 patients (seven females) in a long-term inpatient substance use treatment setting over the course of several weeks, with up to three weekly data collections. We collected data from 252 sessions, ranging from 1 to 24 sessions per subject. The subjects reported craving, self-control, and mental health on each occasion. Before starting the repeated data collection, a baseline neuropsychological screening was performed. In this repeated-measures prospective study, the mixed-effects models with time-lagged predictors support a model of substance use craving and relapse being predicted by the baseline reaction time as well as the temporal changes and variability in mental health symptom load, self-control, and craving intensity with moderate to high effect sizes. This knowledge may contribute to more personalized risk assessments and treatments for this group of patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Definition of ‘close contacts’ in leprosy studies: protocol for a scoping review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Despite difficulties to document transmission pathways (assumed to be airborne), increased risk of leprosy infection has been shown for individuals living in close contact with patients. However, variations in the concept of ‘close contacts’ are used in different settings and studies. We conduct this review to identify criteria of space (location, geographical variables, distance, indoor vs outdoor), time (including frequency and duration), physical exposure (skin to skin, sexual), and relationship (familial, occupational, social) involved in the definition of ‘close contacts’ in leprosy studies. We expect this review to provide an overview of the (lack of) conceptualization of this term and its variations across settings. Primary studies and reviews are eligible for inclusion in this review. The main source of records will be the PubMed interface. Secondary searches will be conducted in Google Scholar, as well as through the reference lists of selected publications. The search strategy is based on the combination of the condition of interest (leprosy) and the concept under study (‘contact’). The findings of this review will be presented using thematic narrative synthesis, tables, and figures. The protocol is written in line with the Prisma Extension for Scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR).

                <p>Cochlear sensitivity, essential for communication and exploiting the acoustic environment, results from sensory-motor outer hair cells (OHCs) operating in a structural scaffold of supporting cells and extracellular cortilymph within the organ of Corti (OoC). Cochlear sensitivity control is hypothesized to involve interaction between the OHCs and OoC supporting cells (e.g., Deiters' cells [DCs] and outer pillar cells [OPCs]), but this has never been established <I>in vivo</I>. Here, we conditionally expressed channelrhodopsins (ChR2) specifically in male and female mouse DCs and OPCs. Illumination of the OoC activated the nonselective ChR2 cation conductance and depolarized DCs when measured <I>in vivo</I> and in isolated OoC. Measurements of sound-induced cochlear mechanical and electrical responses revealed that OoC illumination suppressed the normal functions of OoC supporting cells transiently and reversibly. OoC illumination blocked normally occurring continuous minor adjustments of tone-evoked basilar membrane displacements over their entire dynamic range and OHC voltage responses to tones at levels and frequencies subject to cochlear amplification. OoC illumination altered the OHC mechanoelectrical transduction conductance operating point, which reversed the asymmetry of OHC voltage responses to high level tones. OoC illumination accelerated recovery from temporary loud sound-induced acoustic desensitization. We concluded that DCs and OPCs are involved in both the control of cochlear responses (which are essential for normal hearing) and the recovery from temporary acoustic desensitization. This is the first direct <I>in vivo</I> evidence for the interdependency of the structural, mechanical, and electrochemical arrangements of OHCs and OoC supporting cells that together provide fine control of cochlear responses.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A striking feature of the mammalian cochlear sensory epithelium, the organ of Corti, is the cellular architecture and supporting cell arrangement that provides a structural scaffold for the sensory-motor outer hair cells. The role of the supporting cell scaffold, however, has never been elucidated <I>in vivo</I>, although <I>in vitro</I> and modeling studies indicate the scaffold is involved in exchange of forces between the outer hair cells and the organ of Corti. We used <I>in vivo</I> techniques, including optogenetics, that do not disrupt arrangements between the outer hair cells and supporting cells, but selectively, transiently, and reversibly interfere with supporting cell normal function. We revealed the supporting cells provide continuous adjustment of cochlear sensitivity, which is instrumental in normal hearing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Membrane Stretch Gates NMDA Receptors</a></h4>

              
                <p>NMDARs are ionotropic glutamate receptors widely expressed in the CNS, where they mediate phenomena as diverse as neurotransmission, information processing, synaptogenesis, and cellular toxicity. They function as glutamate-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels, which require glycine as coagonist, and can be modulated by many diffusible ligands and cellular cues, including mechanical stimuli. Previously, we found that, in cultured astrocytes, shear stress initiates NMDAR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in the absence of added agonists, suggesting that more than being mechanosensitive, NMDARs may be mechanically activated. Here, we used controlled expression of rat recombinant receptors and noninvasive on-cell single-channel current recordings to show that mild membrane stretch can substitute for the neurotransmitter glutamate in gating NMDAR currents. Notably, stretch-activated currents maintained the hallmark features of the glutamate-gated currents, including glycine-requirement, large unitary conductance, high Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability, and voltage-dependent Mg<sup>2+</sup> blockade. Further, we found that the stretch-gated current required the receptor's intracellular domain. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that mechanical forces can gate endogenous NMDAR currents even in the absence of synaptic glutamate release, which has important implications for understanding mechanotransduction and the physiological and pathologic effects of mechanical forces on cells of the CNS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show that, in addition to enhancing currents elicited with low agonist concentrations, membrane stretch can gate NMDARs in the absence of the neurotransmitter glutamate. Stretch-gated currents have the principal hallmarks of the glutamate-gated currents, including requirement for glycine, large Na<sup>+</sup> conductance, high Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability, and voltage-dependent Mg<sup>2+</sup> block. Therefore, results suggest that mechanical forces can initiate cellular processes presently attributed to glutamatergic neurotransmission, such as synaptic plasticity and cytotoxicity. Given the ubiquitous presence of mechanical forces in the CNS, this discovery identifies NMDARs as possibly important mechanotransducers during development and across the lifespan, and during pathologic processes, such as those associated with traumatic brain injuries, shaken infant syndrome, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Graded Variation in T1w/T2w Ratio during Adolescence: Measurement, Caveats, and Implications for Development of Cortical Myelin</a></h4>

              
                <p>Adolescence is characterized by the maturation of cortical microstructure and connectivity supporting complex cognition and behavior. Axonal myelination influences brain connectivity during development by enhancing neural signaling speed and inhibiting plasticity. However, the maturational timing of cortical myelination during human adolescence remains poorly understood. Here, we take advantage of recent advances in high-resolution cortical T1w/T2w mapping methods, including principled correction of B1+ transmit field effects, using data from the Human Connectome Project in Development (HCP-D; <I>N</I> = 628, ages 8&ndash;21). We characterize microstructural changes relevant to myelination by estimating age-related differences in T1w/T2w throughout the cerebral neocortex from childhood to early adulthood. We apply Bayesian spline models and clustering analysis to demonstrate graded variation in age-dependent cortical T1w/T2w differences that are correlated with the sensorimotor-association (S-A) axis of cortical organization reported by others. In sensorimotor areas, T1w/T2w ratio measures start at high levels at early ages, increase at a fast pace, and decelerate at later ages (18&ndash;21). In intermediate multimodal areas along the S-A axis, T1w/T2w starts at intermediate levels and increases linearly at an intermediate pace. In transmodal/paralimbic association areas, T1w/T2w starts at low levels and increases linearly at the slowest pace. These data provide evidence for graded variation of the T1w/T2w ratio along the S-A axis that may reflect cortical myelination changes during adolescence underlying the development of complex information processing and psychological functioning. We discuss the implications of these results as well as caveats in interpreting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based estimates of myelination.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Myelin is a lipid membrane that is essential to healthy brain function. Myelin wraps axons to increase neural signaling speed, enabling complex neuronal functioning underlying learning and cognition. Here, we characterize the developmental timing of myelination across the cerebral cortex during adolescence using a noninvasive proxy measure, T1w/T2w mapping. Our results provide new evidence demonstrating graded variation across the cortex in the timing of T1w/T2w changes during adolescence, with rapid T1w/T2w increases in lower-order sensory areas and gradual T1w/T2w increases in higher-order association areas. This spatial pattern of microstructural brain development closely parallels the sensorimotor-to-association axis of cortical organization and plasticity during ontogeny.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Inputs to the Sleep Homeostat Originate Outside the Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>The need to sleep is sensed and discharged in a poorly understood process that is homeostatically controlled over time. In flies, different contributions to this process have been attributed to peripheral ppk and central brain neurons, with the former serving as hypothetical inputs to the sleep homeostat and the latter reportedly serving as the homeostat itself. Here we re-evaluate these distinctions in light of new findings using female flies. First, activating neurons targeted by published ppk and brain drivers elicits similar phenotypes, namely, sleep deprivation followed by rebound sleep. Second, inhibiting activity or synaptic output with one type of driver suppresses sleep homeostasis induced using the other type of driver. Third, drivers previously used to implicate central neurons in sleep homeostasis unexpectedly also label ppk neurons. Fourth, activating only this subset of colabeled neurons is sufficient to elicit sleep homeostasis. Thus, many published contributions of central neurons to sleep homeostasis can be explained by previously unrecognized expression of brain drivers in peripheral ppk neurons, most likely those in the legs, which promote walking. Last, we show that activation of certain non-ppk neurons can also induce sleep homeostasis. Notably, axons of these as well as ppk neurons terminate in the same ventral brain region, suggesting that a previously undefined neural circuit element of a sleep homeostat may lie nearby.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The biological needs that sleep fulfills are unknown, but they are reflected by the ability of an animal to compensate for prior sleep loss in a process called sleep homeostasis. Researchers have searched for the neural circuitry that comprises the sleep homeostat so that the information it conveys can shed light on the nature of sleep need. Here we demonstrate that neurons originating outside of the brain are responsible for phenotypes previously attributed to the proposed central brain sleep homeostat in flies. Our results support a revised neural circuit model for sensing and discharging sleep need in which peripheral inputs connect to a sleep homeostat through previously unrecognized neural circuit elements in the ventral brain.</p>

                <p>Chemogenetic techniques, such as designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs), enable transient, reversible, and minimally invasive manipulation of neural activity <I>in vivo</I>. Their development in nonhuman primates is essential for uncovering neural circuits contributing to cognitive functions and their translation to humans. One key issue that has delayed the development of chemogenetic techniques in primates is the lack of an accessible drug-screening method. Here, we use resting-state fMRI, a noninvasive neuroimaging tool, to assess the impact of deschloroclozapine (DCZ) on brainwide resting-state functional connectivity in 7 rhesus macaques (6 males and 1 female) without DREADDs. We found that systemic administration of 0.1 mg/kg DCZ did not alter the resting-state functional connectivity. Conversely, 0.3 mg/kg of DCZ was associated with a prominent increase in functional connectivity that was mainly confined to the connections of frontal regions. Additional behavioral tests confirmed a negligible impact of 0.1 mg/kg DCZ on socio-emotional behaviors as well as on reaction time in a probabilistic learning task; 0.3 mg/kg DCZ did, however, slow responses in the probabilistic learning task, suggesting attentional or motivational deficits associated with hyperconnectivity in fronto-temporo-parietal networks. Our study highlights both the excellent selectivity of DCZ as a DREADD actuator, and the side effects of its excess dosage. The results demonstrate the translational value of resting-state fMRI as a drug-screening tool to accelerate the development of chemogenetics in primates.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chemogenetics, such as designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs), can afford control over neural activity with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. Accelerating the translation of chemogenetic neuromodulation from rodents to primates requires an approach to screen novel DREADD actuators <I>in vivo</I>. Here, we assessed brainwide activity in response to a DREADD actuator deschloroclozapine (DCZ) using resting-state fMRI in macaque monkeys. We demonstrated that low-dose DCZ (0.1 mg/kg) did not change whole-brain functional connectivity or affective behaviors, while a higher dose (0.3 mg/kg) altered frontal functional connectivity and slowed response in a learning task. Our study highlights the excellent selectivity of DCZ at proper dosing, and demonstrates the utility of resting-state fMRI to screen novel chemogenetic actuators in primates.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Rewarded Extinction Increases Amygdalar Connectivity and Stabilizes Long-Term Memory Traces in the vmPFC</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neurobiological evidence in rodents indicates that threat extinction incorporates reward neurocircuitry. Consequently, incorporating reward associations with an extinction memory may be an effective strategy to persistently attenuate threat responses. Moreover, while there is considerable research on the short-term effects of extinction strategies in humans, the long-term effects of extinction are rarely considered. In a within-subjects fMRI study with both female and male participants, we compared counterconditioning (CC; a form of rewarded-extinction) to standard extinction at recent (24 h) and remote (approximately one month) retrieval tests. Relative to standard extinction, rewarded extinction diminished 24-h relapse of arousal and threat expectancy, and reduced activity in brain regions associated with the appraisal and expression of threat (e.g., thalamus, insula, periaqueductal gray). The retrieval of reward-associated extinction memory was accompanied by functional connectivity between the amygdala and the ventral striatum, whereas the retrieval of standard-extinction memories was associated with connectivity between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). One month later, the retrieval of both standard-extinction and rewarded-extinction was associated with amygdala-vmPFC connectivity. However, only rewarded extinction created a stable memory trace in the vmPFC, identified through overlapping multivariate patterns of fMRI activity from extinction to 24-h and one-month retrieval. These findings provide new evidence that reward may generate a more stable and enduring memory trace of attenuated threat in humans.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Prevalent treatments for pathologic fear and anxiety are based on the principles of Pavlovian extinction. Unfortunately, extinction forms weak memories that only temporarily inhibit the retrieval of threat associations. Thus, to increase the translational relevance of extinction research, it is critical to investigate whether extinction can be augmented to form a more enduring memory, especially after long intervals. Here, we used a multiday fMRI paradigm in humans to compare the short-term and long-term neurobehavioral effects of aversive-to-appetitive counterconditioning (CC), a form of augmented extinction. Our results provide novel evidence that including an appetitive stimulus during extinction can reduce short-term threat relapse and stabilize the memory trace of extinction in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), for at least one month after learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Rat Anterior Cingulate Cortex Continuously Signals Decision Variables in a Patch Foraging Task</a></h4>

              
                <p>In patch foraging tasks, animals must decide whether to remain with a depleting resource or to leave it in search of a potentially better source of reward. In such tasks, animals consistently follow the general predictions of optimal foraging theory (the marginal value theorem; MVT): to leave a patch when the reward rate in the current patch depletes to the average reward rate across patches. Prior studies implicate an important role for the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in foraging decisions based on MVT: within single trials, ACC activity increases immediately preceding foraging decisions, and across trials, these dynamics are modulated as the value of staying in the patch depletes to the average reward rate. Here, we test whether these activity patterns reflect dynamic encoding of decision-variables and whether these signals are directly involved in decision-making. We developed a leaky accumulator model based on the MVT that generates estimates of decision variables within and across trials, and tested model predictions against ACC activity recorded from male rats performing a patch foraging task. Model predicted changes in MVT decision variables closely matched rat ACC activity. Next, we pharmacologically inactivated ACC in male rats to test the contribution of these signals to decision-making. ACC inactivation had a profound effect on rats' foraging decisions and response times (RTs) yet rats still followed the MVT decision rule. These findings indicate that the ACC encodes foraging-related variables for reasons unrelated to patch-leaving decisions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ability to make adaptive patch-foraging decisions, to remain with a depleting resource or search for better alternatives, is critical to animal well-being. Previous studies have found that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity is modulated at different points in the foraging decision process, raising questions about whether the ACC guides ongoing decisions or serves a more general purpose of regulating cognitive control. To investigate the function of the ACC in foraging, the present study developed a dynamic model of behavior and neural activity, and tested model predictions using recordings and inactivation of ACC. Findings revealed that ACC continuously signals decision variables but that these signals are more likely used to monitor and regulate ongoing processes than to guide foraging decisions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Time Course of Language Production as Revealed by Pattern Classification of MEG Sensor Data</a></h4>

              
                <p>Language production involves a complex set of computations, from conceptualization to articulation, which are thought to engage cascading neural events in the language network. However, recent neuromagnetic evidence suggests simultaneous meaning-to-speech mapping in picture naming tasks, as indexed by early parallel activation of frontotemporal regions to lexical semantic, phonological, and articulatory information. Here we investigate the time course of word production, asking to what extent such "earliness" is a distinctive property of the associated spatiotemporal dynamics. Using MEG, we recorded the neural signals of 34 human subjects (26 males) overtly naming 134 images from four semantic object categories (animals, foods, tools, clothes). Within each category, we covaried word length, as quantified by the number of syllables contained in a word, and phonological neighborhood density to target lexical and post-lexical phonological/phonetic processes. Multivariate pattern analyses searchlights in sensor space distinguished the stimulus-locked spatiotemporal responses to object categories early on, from 150 to 250 ms after picture onset, whereas word length was decoded in left frontotemporal sensors at 250-350 ms, followed by the latency of phonological neighborhood density (350-450 ms). Our results suggest a progression of neural activity from posterior to anterior language regions for the semantic and phonological/phonetic computations preparing overt speech, thus supporting serial cascading models of word production.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Current psycholinguistic models make divergent predictions on how a preverbal message is mapped onto articulatory output during the language planning. Serial models predict a cascading sequence of hierarchically organized neural computations from conceptualization to articulation. In contrast, parallel models posit early simultaneous activation of multiple conceptual, phonological, and articulatory information in the language system. Here we asked whether such earliness is a distinctive property of the neural dynamics of word production. The combination of the millisecond precision of MEG with multivariate pattern analyses revealed subsequent onset times for the neural events supporting semantic and phonological/phonetic operations, progressing from posterior occipitotemporal to frontal sensor areas. The findings bring new insights for refining current theories of language production.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Prefrontal GABAA({delta})R Promotes Fear Extinction through Enabling the Plastic Regulation of Neuronal Intrinsic Excitability</a></h4>

              
                <p>Extinguishing the previously acquired fear is critical for the adaptation of an organism to the ever-changing environment, a process requiring the engagement of GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs). GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs consist of tens of structurally, pharmacologically, and functionally heterogeneous subtypes. However, the specific roles of these subtypes in fear extinction remain largely unexplored. Here, we observed that in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a core region for mood regulation, the extrasynaptically situated, -subunit-containing GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs [GABA<SUB>A</SUB>()Rs], had a permissive role in tuning fear extinction in male mice, an effect sharply contrasting to the established but suppressive role by the whole GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R family. First, the fear extinction in individual mice was positively correlated with the level of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>()R expression and function in their mPFC. Second, knockdown of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>()R in mPFC, specifically in its infralimbic (IL) subregion, sufficed to impair the fear extinction in mice. Third, GABA<SUB>A</SUB>()R-deficient mice also showed fear extinction deficits, and re-expressing GABA<SUB>A</SUB>()Rs in the IL of these mice rescued the impaired extinction. Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that the permissive effect of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>()R was associated with its role in enabling the extinction-evoked plastic regulation of neuronal excitability in IL projection neurons. By contrast, GABA<SUB>A</SUB>()R had little influence on the extinction-evoked plasticity of glutamatergic transmission in these cells. Altogether, our findings revealed an unconventional and permissive role of extrasynaptic GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors in fear extinction through a route relying on nonsynaptic plasticity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is one of the kernel brain regions engaged in fear extinction. Previous studies have repetitively shown that the GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R) family in this region act to suppress fear extinction. However, the roles of specific GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R subtypes in mPFC are largely unknown. We observed that the GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R-containing -subunit [GABA<SUB>A</SUB>()R], a subtype of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs exclusively situated in the extrasynaptic membrane and mediating the tonic neuronal inhibition, works oppositely to the whole GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R family and promotes (but does not suppress) fear extinction. More interestingly, in striking contrast to the synaptic GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs that suppress fear extinction by breaking the extinction-evoked plasticity of glutamatergic transmission, the GABA<SUB>A</SUB>()R promotes fear extinction through enabling the plastic regulation of neuronal excitability in the infralimbic subregion of mPFC. Our findings thus reveal an unconventional role of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>()R in promoting fear extinction through a route relying on nonsynaptic plasticity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Voluntary Motor Command Release Coincides with Restricted Sensorimotor Beta Rhythm Phases</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sensory perception and memory are enhanced during restricted phases of ongoing brain rhythms, but whether voluntary movement is constrained by brain rhythm phase is not known. Voluntary movement requires motor commands to be released from motor cortex (M1) and transmitted to spinal motoneurons and effector muscles. Here, we tested the hypothesis that motor commands are preferentially released from M1 during circumscribed phases of ongoing sensorimotor rhythms. Healthy humans of both sexes performed a self-paced finger movement task during electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) recordings. We first estimated the time of motor command release preceding each finger movement by subtracting individually measured corticomuscular transmission latencies from EMG-determined movement onset times. Then, we determined the phase of ipsilateral and contralateral sensorimotor mu (8&ndash;12 Hz) and beta (13&ndash;35 Hz) rhythms during release of each motor command. We report that motor commands were most often released between 120 and 140&deg; along the contralateral beta cycle but were released uniformly along the contralateral mu cycle. Motor commands were also released uniformly along ipsilateral mu and beta cycles. Results demonstrate that motor command release coincides with restricted phases of the contralateral sensorimotor beta rhythm, suggesting that sensorimotor beta rhythm phase may sculpt the timing of voluntary human movement.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Perceptual and cognitive function is optimal during specific brain rhythm phases. Although brain rhythm phase influences motor cortical neuronal activity and communication between the motor cortex and spinal cord, its role in voluntary movement is poorly understood. Here, we show that the motor commands needed to produce voluntary movements are preferentially released from the motor cortex during contralateral sensorimotor beta rhythm phases. Our findings are consistent with the notion that sensorimotor rhythm phase influences the timing of voluntary human movement.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">APPs{alpha} Rescues Tau-Induced Synaptic Pathology</a></h4>

              
                <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is histopathologically characterized by A&beta; plaques and the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated Tau species, the latter also constituting key hallmarks of primary tauopathies. Whereas A&beta; is produced by amyloidogenic APP processing, APP processing along the competing nonamyloidogenic pathway results in the secretion of neurotrophic and synaptotrophic APPs&alpha;. Recently, we demonstrated that APPs&alpha; has therapeutic effects in transgenic AD model mice and rescues A&beta;-dependent impairments. Here, we examined the potential of APPs&alpha; to mitigate Tau-induced synaptic deficits in <I>P301S</I> mice (both sexes), a widely used mouse model of tauopathy. Analysis of synaptic plasticity revealed an aberrantly increased LTP in <I>P301S</I> mice that could be normalized by acute application of nanomolar amounts of APPs&alpha; to hippocampal slices, indicating a homeostatic function of APPs&alpha; on a rapid time scale. Further, AAV-mediated <I>in vivo</I> expression of APPs&alpha; restored normal spine density of CA1 neurons even at stages of advanced Tau pathology not only in <I>P301S</I> mice, but also in independent <I>THY-Tau22</I> mice. Strikingly, when searching for the mechanism underlying aberrantly increased LTP in <I>P301S</I> mice, we identified an early and progressive loss of major GABAergic interneuron subtypes in the hippocampus of <I>P301S</I> mice, which may lead to reduced GABAergic inhibition of principal cells. Interneuron loss was paralleled by deficits in nest building, an innate behavior highly sensitive to hippocampal impairments. Together, our findings indicate that APPs&alpha; has therapeutic potential for Tau-mediated synaptic dysfunction and suggest that loss of interneurons leads to disturbed neuronal circuits that compromise synaptic plasticity as well as behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our findings indicate, for the first time, that APPs&alpha; has the potential to rescue Tau-induced spine loss and abnormal synaptic plasticity. Thus, APPs&alpha; might have therapeutic potential not only because of its synaptotrophic functions, but also its homeostatic capacity for neuronal network activity. Hence, APPs&alpha; is one of the few molecules which has proven therapeutic effects in mice, both for A&beta;- and Tau-dependent synaptic impairments and might therefore have therapeutic potential for patients suffering from AD or primary tauopathies. Furthermore, we found in <I>P301S</I> mice a pronounced reduction of inhibitory interneurons as the earliest pathologic event preceding the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated Tau species. This loss of interneurons most likely disturbs neuronal circuits that are important for synaptic plasticity and behavior.</p>

                <p>Mature protoplasmic astroglia in the mammalian CNS uniquely possess a large number of fine processes that have been considered primary sites to mediate astroglia to neuron synaptic signaling. However, localized mechanisms for regulating interactions between astroglial processes and synapses, especially for regulating the expression of functional surface proteins at these fine processes, are largely unknown. Previously, we showed that the loss of the RNA binding protein FMRP in astroglia disrupts astroglial mGluR5 signaling and reduces expression of the major astroglial glutamate transporter GLT1 and glutamate uptake in the cortex of Fmr1 conditional deletion mice. In the current study, by examining ribosome localization using electron microscopy and identifying mRNAs enriched at cortical astroglial processes using synaptoneurosome/translating ribosome affinity purification and RNA-Seq in WT and FMRP-deficient male mice, our results reveal interesting localization-dependent functional clusters of mRNAs at astroglial processes. We further showed that the lack of FMRP preferentially alters the subcellular localization and expression of process-localized mRNAs. Together, we defined the role of FMRP in altering mRNA localization and expression at astroglial processes at the postnatal development (P30-P40) and provided new candidate mRNAs that are potentially regulated by FMRP in cortical astroglia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Lack of Causal Roles of Cannabinoid and Dopamine Neurotransmitter Systems in Orbitofrontal and Piriform Cortex in Fentanyl Relapse in Rats</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and piriform cortex (Pir) play a role in fentanyl relapse after food choice-induced voluntary abstinence, a procedure mimicking abstinence because of availability of alternative nondrug rewards. We used <I>in situ</I> hybridization and pharmacology to determine the role of OFC and Pir cannabinoid and dopamine receptors in fentanyl relapse. We trained male and female rats to self-administer food pellets for 6 d (6 h/d) and intravenous fentanyl (2.5 &micro;g/kg/infusion) for 12 d (6 h/d). We assessed fentanyl relapse after 12 discrete choice sessions between fentanyl and food (20 trials/d), in which rats voluntarily reduced fentanyl self-administration. We used RNAscope to determine whether fentanyl relapse is associated with activity (indicated by <I>Fos</I>) in OFC and Pir cells expressing <I>Cnr1</I> [which encodes cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptors] or <I>Drd1</I> and <I>Drd2</I> (which encode dopamine D1 and D2 receptors). We injected a CB1 receptor antagonist or agonist (0.3 or 1.0 &micro;g AM251 or WIN55,212-2/hemisphere) into OFC or a dopamine D1 receptor antagonist (1.0 or 3.0 &micro;g SCH39166/hemisphere) into Pir to determine the effect on fentanyl relapse. Fentanyl relapse was associated with OFC cells co-expressing <I>Fos</I> and <I>Cnr1</I> and Pir cells co-expressing <I>Fos</I> and <I>Drd1</I>. However, injections of the CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 or agonist WIN55,212-2 into OFC or the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH39166 into Pir had no effect on fentanyl relapse. Fentanyl relapse is associated with activation of <I>Cnr1</I>-expressing OFC cells and <I>Drd1</I>-expressing Pir cells, but pharmacological manipulations do not support causal roles of OFC CB1 receptors or Pir dopamine D1 receptors in fentanyl relapse.</p>

                Human and animal cell lines serve as model systems in a wide range of life sciences such as cancer and infection research or drug screening. Reproducible data are highly dependent on authenticated, contaminant-free cell lines, no better delivered than by the official and certified biorepositories. Offering a web portal to high-throughput information on these model systems will facilitate working with and comparing to these references by data otherwise dispersed at different sources. We here provide DSMZCellDive to access a comprehensive data source on human and animal cell lines, freely available at celldive.dsmz.de. A wide variety of data sources are generated such as RNA-seq transcriptome data and STR (short tandem repeats) profiles. Several starting points ease entering the database via browsing, searching or visualising. This web tool is designed for further expansion on meta and high-throughput data to be generated in future. Explicated examples for the power of this novel tool include analysis of B-cell differentiation markers, homeo-oncogene expression, and measurement of genomic loss of heterozygosities by an enlarged STR panel of 17 loci. Sharing the data on cell lines by the biorepository itself will be of benefit to the scientific community  since it (1) supports the selection of appropriate model cell lines, (2) ensures reliability, (3) avoids misleading data, (4) saves on additional experimentals, and (5) serves as reference for genomic and gene expression data.

                Background: Because of yellow fever’s serious impact on health, vaccination is the principal strategy to control the disease. Administration of the yellow fever vaccine to breastfeeding women should be before they complete 9 months post-delivery, in order to prevent transmission of the yellow fever vaccine virus to their infants through breast feeding. This study aimed to confirm whether the excretion of yellow fever vaccine virus is in milk of vaccinated breastfeeding mothers and to confirm the probable transmission to their infants through breast milk. Methods: Samples were taken as follows: one serum specimen was taken 3-14 days after the date of the vaccination, and breast milk specimens were taken at four different time points between 3-4 days apart. Specimens were obtained from eight nursing mothers, who received the YVF vaccine (17DD). Mothers were asymptomatic before and after the vaccine administration but their infants developed symptoms after administration. Maternal serum samples were tested for YFV specific IgM antibodies through immuno-fluorescent assay (IFA). RNA was extracted from serum and breast milk specimens and YFV RNA screened using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: In total, five mothers (62.5%) were positive for YFV IgM and two mothers (25%) had YFV RNA in serum. Among milk specimens, YFV RNA was detected during the four different mentioned collection times as follows (positive milk specimens/total milk specimens): 3/8 (37.5 %), 4/6 (66.6%) and 1/4(25%). RNA was completely undetectable in the last collection time. Conclusions: YFV transmission from mothers to their babies through breast-feeding was highly probable indicated by the temporal relationship to mother’s YF vaccination.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A comparative study of red brick powder and lime as soft soil stabilizer [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The role of soil in building construction is to support the loads above it. Different types of soil with poor mechanical properties require more attention. Therefore, more effort is needed to stabilize the soil by improving its properties. These improvements are intended to modify soil properties to improve engineering performance, such as strength, decrease in compressibility and permeability. This study aimed to compare the potential of lime and brick powder as stabilizers based on the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) values. Soil stabilization can be defined as modifying the soil properties by chemical or physical means to improve its engineering efficiency. The main objectives of stabilizing soil are increasing its bearing capacity, resistance to weathering processes, and permeability. Methods: This work did laboratory tests with disturbed and undisturbed soil samples. The proportions of lime or red brick powder additives are 0%, 5%, 10%, and 15% of the soil sample. From the results of the laboratory tests, the soil type obtained is MH (low plasticity silt) as per the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS). Results: This study showed that soft soil could be improved by adding lime and red brick powder as a soil stabilizer. In both soaked and unsoaked CBR tests, there was an increase in the CBR value for each proportion of the mixed additives. However, the red brick powder addition (15%) has significantly increased the CBR value. Conclusions: The soil sample mixed with 15% red brick powder had the highest Maximum Dry Density (MDD), about 5.5% over untreated soil. The increment of lime to 15% has increased the CBR soaked by 61% in relation to untreated soil. The increment of red brick powder to 15% has increased the CBR unsoaked by 73% in relation to untreated soil.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">To what extent naringenin binding and membrane depolarization shape mitoBK channel gating—A machine learning approach</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Monika Richter-Laskowska, Paulina Trybek, Piotr Bednarczyk, Agata Wawrzkiewicz-Jałowiecka</p>

The large conductance voltage- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels from the inner mitochondrial membrane (mitoBK) are modulated by a number of factors. Among them flavanones, including naringenin (Nar), arise as a promising group of mitoBK channel regulators from a pharmacological point of view. It is well known that in the presence of Nar the open state probability (<i>p</i><sub>op</sub>) of mitoBK channels significantly increases. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism of the mitoBK-Nar interactions remains still unrevealed. It is also not known whether the effects of naringenin administration on conformational dynamics can resemble those which are exerted by the other channel-activating stimuli. In aim to answer this question, we examine whether the dwell-time series of mitoBK channels which were obtained at different voltages and Nar concentrations (yet allowing to reach comparable <i>p</i><sub>op</sub>s) are discernible by means of artificial intelligence methods, including k-NN and shapelet learning. The obtained results suggest that the structural complexity of the gating dynamics is shaped both by the interaction of channel gate with the voltage sensor (VSD) and the Nar-binding site. For a majority of data one can observe stimulus-specific patterns of channel gating. Shapelet algorithm allows to obtain better prediction accuracy in most cases. Probably, because it takes into account the complexity of local features of a given signal. About 30% of the analyzed time series do not sufficiently differ to unambiguously distinguish them from each other, which can be interpreted in terms of the existence of the common features of mitoBK channel gating regardless of the type of activating stimulus. There exist long-range mutual interactions between VSD and the Nar-coordination site that are responsible for higher levels of Nar-activation (Δ<i>p</i><sub>op</sub>) at deeply depolarized membranes. These intra-sensor interactions are anticipated to have an allosteric nature.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modeling scenarios for mitigating outbreaks in congregate settings</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Seth Blumberg, Phoebe Lu, Ada T. Kwan, Christopher M. Hoover, James O. Lloyd-Smith, David Sears, Stefano M. Bertozzi, Lee Worden</p>

The explosive outbreaks of COVID-19 seen in congregate settings such as prisons and nursing homes, has highlighted a critical need for effective outbreak prevention and mitigation strategies for these settings. Here we consider how different types of control interventions impact the expected number of symptomatic infections due to outbreaks. Introduction of disease into the resident population from the community is modeled as a stochastic point process coupled to a branching process, while spread between residents is modeled via a deterministic compartmental model that accounts for depletion of susceptible individuals. Control is modeled as a proportional decrease in the number of susceptible residents, the reproduction number, and/or the proportion of symptomatic infections. This permits a range of assumptions about the density dependence of transmission and modes of protection by vaccination, depopulation and other types of control. We find that vaccination or depopulation can have a greater than linear effect on the expected number of cases. For example, assuming a reproduction number of 3.0 with density-dependent transmission, we find that preemptively reducing the size of the susceptible population by 20% reduced overall disease burden by 47%. In some circumstances, it may be possible to reduce the risk and burden of disease outbreaks by optimizing the way a group of residents are apportioned into distinct residential units. The optimal apportionment may be different depending on whether the goal is to reduce the probability of an outbreak occurring, or the expected number of cases from outbreak dynamics. In other circumstances there may be an opportunity to implement reactive disease control measures in which the number of susceptible individuals is rapidly reduced once an outbreak has been detected to occur. Reactive control is most effective when the reproduction number is not too high, and there is minimal delay in implementing control. We highlight the California state prison system as an example for how these findings provide a quantitative framework for understanding disease transmission in congregate settings. Our approach and accompanying interactive website (https://phoebelu.shinyapps.io/DepopulationModels/) provides a quantitative framework to evaluate the potential impact of policy decisions governing infection control in outbreak settings.

                Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is known to have negatively affected the physical and mental well-being of healthcare workers. Estimating such a burden in a limited-resource setting may be essential in the ongoing fight against the pandemic. This research aims to assess the prevalence of mental health problems, that is, depression and anxiety, among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt and their associated factors and predictors. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey to screen for anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) score and depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score among healthcare workers in direct or indirect contact with COVID-19 cases. Results: Analysis of participants’ responses showed that 36.7% suffered from depression, while 30.7% had moderate to severe anxiety. Independent predictors of depression were feeling unsure or dissatisfied with one’s income (AOR =8.87 and 8.51, respectively), working exclusively in private or governmental hospitals (AOR = 8.15 and 5.1, respectively), and serving in central or insurance hospitals (AOR = 2.21). Meanwhile, independent predictors of anxiety were working in governmental hospitals (AOR = 5.87), working duration from 5 to 10 years (AOR = 4.65), and suffering from other comorbidities (AOR = 2.18). Working as a nurse was a protective factor against anxiety (AOR = 0.36). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic considerably affected the mental well-being of health care workers in Egypt. Income, type of hospital, working duration, and other comorbidities were the main predictors of health care workers’ mental health. Examining the mental burden of the pandemic on health care workers is important so that current and future crises can be managed better.

                Background: Staff nurses face frequent emotional situations in their work environment. The constant contact with suffering patients, and the busy work environment, pose tremendous stress on nurses' physical and emotional health. The Emotional Intelligence skills of empathy, self-awareness, motivation, self-control, and keeping relationships, can help handle difficult emotions and allow nurses to work in an organized, calm, and professional way. This study aims to implement and assess the effectiveness of a training program developed by the investigator, tailored to the mental and emotional needs of staff nurses who are working in an organisation. The study also aims to observe any significant change, correlation, and association in the staff nurses’ level of emotional intelligence, intrinsic motivation, self-compassion, emotional labour, and nurse-in-charges’ and patients’ perception of nursing care after the program. Methods: A quasi-experimental (one-group) study design will be used in this study. The study will involve 80 staff nurses working in a selected hospital in India. The staff nurses will be selected from the hospital's general wards using convenience sampling. The investigator will deliver a training program, divided into four sessions of two hours each. Data will be collected from the participants at baseline and 3-months pre-intervention; and post-test data will be collected immediately after the intervention, at 3-month, and 6-month follow-up, to observe any significant change in the study variables before and after the intervention. Results: The current study primarily focuses on the vital aspect of developing emotional needs, for promoting a better work-life balance. Research findings from the study will significantly contribute to the evidence-based Emotional Intelligence programs for staff nurses, and if proven effective, could be delivered extensively in hospitals. Trial registration: The study is registered in June 2019 under the Central Trial Registry of India (CTRI/2019/08/020592).

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mitochondria are one of the essential cellular organelles. Apart from being considered as the powerhouse of the cell, mitochondria have been widely known to regulate redox reaction, inflammation, cell survival, cell death, metabolism, etc., and are implicated in the progression of numerous disease conditions including neurodegenerative diseases. Since brain is an energy-demanding organ, mitochondria and their functions are important for maintaining normal brain homeostasis. Alterations in mitochondrial gene expression, mutations, and epigenetic modification contribute to inflammation and neurodegeneration. Dysregulation of reactive oxygen species production by mitochondria and aggregation of proteins in neurons leads to alteration in mitochondria functions which further causes neuronal death and progression of neurodegeneration. Pharmacological studies have prioritized mitochondria as a possible drug target in the regulation of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the present review article has been intended to provide a comprehensive understanding of mitochondrial role in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases mainly Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis followed by possible intervention and future treatment strategies to combat mitochondrial-mediated neurodegeneration.</p>

                Background: In this study we aimed to test whether suggested DSM-5 criteria for Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) share a similar latent structure to formally recognised addiction. Methods: We used latent class analysis on a dichotomous measure of IGD. The data was collected from a convenient general population sample (500) and a targeted gaming forum sample (236). Results: We found a four or six-class model to be most appropriate, ranging from ‘casual/non-gamer’ to ‘potentially disordered’ with increasing symptom severity. The majority of ‘potentially disordered’ gamers (5+ criteria) were found to be 18-30 years old, and no ‘potentially disordered’ gamers were over 42. Conclusions: The results suggest that gaming may share a similar latent structure to established addictions, with adolescents and young adults being more at risk. Studies replicating these results would be beneficial, with further emphasis on a critical evaluation of the criteria and symptom cut-off point.

                Background: Surgical procedures are accompanied by various complications such as decreased respiratory muscle strength, decreased functional capacity, decreased quality of life, and increased the length of hospital stay. There is a growing body of evidence that indicates that exercise-based prehabilitation offered before major abdominal surgeries can improve the above-mentioned complications. Considering the socioeconomic inequalities, educational characteristics, and healthcare system, which are different in low and lower-middle income countries, it is important to know whether interventions such as prehabilitation are feasible and effective in patients undergoing elective abdominal surgeries. Hence, we set out to determine the role of exercise-based prehabilitation in patients opting for these surgeries. Methods: In this feasibility study, 71% of the eligible patients agreed to participate. Baseline values of respiratory muscle strength, functional capacity and quality of life were recorded preoperatively, and an exercise-based prehabilitation programme consisting of chest physiotherapy, aerobic exercises and inspiratory muscle training according to the patient’s capacity was administered until the day of surgery. A total of 62% of the participants completed the study whose postoperative values and a user satisfaction scale were noted. The feasibility parameters  of recruitment rate, dropout rates, adherence events, adverse events and participants satisfaction were evaluated and the differences in the preoperative and postoperative values of respiratory muscle strength, functional capacity and quality of life  were calculated using the paired t-test  accordingly. Results: Feasibility was measured using five parameters. All the values were > 50% and above. The secondary variables respiratory muscle strength, functional capacity, and quality of life were not significant. Conclusions: This study concluded that prehabilitation is feasible and can be effectively delivered to patients scheduled for elective abdominal surgery.

                <p>Brain imaging is essential to the clinical care of patients with stroke, a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Whereas advanced neuroimaging techniques offer opportunities for aiding acute stroke management, several factors, including time delays, inter-clinician variability, and lack of systemic conglomeration of clinical information, hinder their maximal utility. Recent advances in deep machine learning (DL) offer new strategies for harnessing computational medical image analysis to inform decision making in acute stroke. We examine the current state of the field for DL models in stroke triage. First, we provide a brief, clinical practice-focused primer on DL. Next, we examine real-world examples of DL applications in pixel-wise labeling, volumetric lesion segmentation, stroke detection, and prediction of tissue fate postintervention. We evaluate recent deployments of deep neural networks and their ability to automatically select relevant clinical features for acute decision making, reduce inter-rater variability, and boost reliability in rapid neuroimaging assessments, and integrate neuroimaging with electronic medical record (EMR) data in order to support clinicians in routine and triage stroke management. Ultimately, we aim to provide a framework for critically evaluating existing automated approaches, thus equipping clinicians with the ability to understand and potentially apply DL approaches in order to address challenges in clinical practice.

                Serotonin is a multifunctional signaling molecule. In this issue of Neuron, Zhu et al. (2022) demonstrate, surprisingly, that despite the diminutive size of the enteric serotonin neuronal pool, it is serotonin from these neurons that drives proliferation of colorectal cancer stem cells.

                In this issue of Neuron, Lopez et al. report that KCNQ2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 2) is essential for the sustained antidepressant-like effects of ketamine in glutamatergic neurons of the ventral hippocampus. This study implies that KCNQ2 activators can be novel antidepressants without the ketamine side effects.

                Avitan and Stringer cover recent work describing large-scale spontaneous activity in developing and mature animals. They show that spontaneous activity is high dimensional, correlated with behavior, and distinct from sensory-driven activity, suggesting new functional roles for this activity in the circuit.

                Low voltage-activated calcium currents are mediated by T-type calcium channels Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2, and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3, which modulate a variety of physiological processes including sleep, cardiac pace-making, pain, and epilepsy. Ca<sub>V</sub>3 isoforms' biophysical properties, overlapping expression, and lack of subtype-selective pharmacology hinder the determination of their specific physiological roles in health and disease. We have identified μ-theraphotoxin Pn3a as the first subtype-selective spider venom peptide inhibitor of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3, with &gt;100-fold lower potency against the other T-type isoforms. Pn3a modifies Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 gating through a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation thus decreasing Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3-mediated currents in the normal range of activation potentials. Paddle chimeras of K<sub>V</sub>1.7 channels bearing voltage sensor sequences from all four Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 domains revealed preferential binding of Pn3a to the S3-S4 region of domain II (Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3<sup>DII</sup>). This novel T-type channel pharmacological site was explored through computational docking simulations of Pn3a, site-directed mutagenesis, and full domain II swaps between Cav3 channels highlighting it as a subtype-specific pharmacophore. This research expands our understanding of T-type calcium channel pharmacology and supports the suitability of Pn3a as a molecular tool in the study of the physiological roles of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A dynamic rhizosphere interplay between tree roots and soil bacteria under drought stress</a></h4>

              
                Root exudates are thought to play an important role in plant-microbial interactions. In return for nutrition, soil bacteria can increase the bioavailability of soil nutrients. However, root exudates typically decrease in situations such as drought, calling into question the efficacy of solvation and bacteria-dependent mineral uptake in such stress. Here we tested the hypothesis of exudate-driven microbial priming on <i>Cupressus</i> saplings grown in forest soil in custom-made rhizotron boxes. A 1-month imposed drought and concomitant inoculations with a mix of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and <i>Pseudomonas stutzeri</i>, bacteria species isolated from the forest soil, were applied using factorial design. Direct bacteria counts and visualization by confocal microscopy showed that both bacteria associated with <i>Cupressus</i> Interestingly, root exudation rates increased 2.3-fold with bacteria under drought, as well as irrigation. Forty four metabolites in exudates were significantly different in concentration between irrigated and drought trees, including phenolic acid compounds and quinate. When adding these metabolites as carbon and nitrogen sources to bacterial cultures of both bacterial species, 8 of 9 metabolites stimulated bacterial growth. Importantly, soil phosphorous bioavailability was maintained only in inoculated trees, mitigating drought-induced decrease in leaf phosphorus and iron. Our observations of increased root exudation rate when drought and inoculation regimes were combined, support the idea of root recruitment of beneficial bacteria, especially under water stress.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The rapid developmental rise of somatic inhibition disengages hippocampal dynamics from self-motion</a></h4>

              
                Early electrophysiological brain oscillations recorded in preterm babies and newborn rodents are initially mostly driven by bottom-up sensorimotor activity and only later can detach from external inputs. This is a hallmark of most developing brain areas including the hippocampus, which in the adult brain, functions in integrating external inputs onto internal dynamics. Such developmental disengagement from external inputs is likely a fundamental step for the proper development of cognitive internal models. Despite its importance, the developmental timeline and circuit basis for this disengagement remain unknown. To address this issue, we have investigated the daily evolution of CA1 dynamics and underlying circuits during the first two postnatal weeks of mouse development using two-photon calcium imaging in non-anesthetized pups. We show that the first postnatal week ends with an abrupt shift in the representation of self-motion in CA1. Indeed, most CA1 pyramidal cells switch from activated to inhibited by self-generated movements at the end of the first postnatal week whereas the majority of GABAergic neurons remain positively modulated throughout this period. This rapid switch occurs within two days and follows the rapid anatomical and functional surge of local somatic GABAergic innervation. The observed change in dynamics is consistent with a two-population model undergoing a strengthening of inhibition. We propose that this abrupt developmental transition inaugurates the emergence of internal hippocampal dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Control of nuclear size by osmotic forces in Schizosaccharomyces pombe</a></h4>

              
                The size of the nucleus scales robustly with cell size so that the nuclear-to-cell volume ratio (N/C ratio) is maintained during cell growth in many cell types. The mechanism responsible for this scaling remains mysterious. Previous studies have established that the N/C ratio is not determined by DNA amount but is instead influenced by factors such as nuclear envelope mechanics and nuclear transport. Here, we developed a quantitative model for nuclear size control based upon colloid osmotic pressure and tested key predictions in the fission yeast <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>. This model posits that the N/C ratio is determined by the numbers of macromolecules in the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. Osmotic shift experiments showed that the fission yeast nucleus behaves as an ideal osmometer whose volume is primarily dictated by osmotic forces. Inhibition of nuclear export caused accumulation of macromolecules and an increase in crowding in the nucleoplasm, leading to nuclear swelling. We further demonstrated that the N/C ratio is maintained by a homeostasis mechanism based upon synthesis of macromolecules during growth. These studies demonstrate the functions of colloid osmotic pressure in intracellular organization and size control.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dopamine D2Rs coordinate cue-evoked changes in striatal acetylcholine levels</a></h4>

              
                In the striatum, acetylcholine (ACh) neuron activity is modulated co-incident with dopamine (DA) release in response to unpredicted rewards and reward predicting cues and both neuromodulators are thought to regulate each other. While this co-regulation has been studied using stimulation studies, the existence of this mutual regulation <i>in vivo </i>during natural behavior is still largely unexplored. One long-standing controversy has been whether striatal DA is responsible for the induction of the cholinergic pause or whether D2R modulate a pause that is induced by other mechanisms. Here, we used genetically encoded sensors in combination with pharmacological and genetic inactivation of D2Rs from cholinergic interneurons (CINs) to simultaneously measure ACh and DA levels after CIN D2R inactivation in mice. We found that CIN D2Rs are not necessary for the initiation of cue induced decrease in ACh levels. Rather, they prolong the duration of the decrease and inhibit ACh rebound levels. Notably, the change in task evoked ACh levels is not associated with altered DA levels. Moreover, D2R inactivation strongly decreased the temporal correlation between DA and ACh signals not only at cue presentation but also during the intertrial interval pointing to a general mechanism by which D2Rs coordinate both signals. At the behavioral level D2R antagonism increased the latency to lever press, which was not observed in CIN-selective D2R knock out mice. Press latency correlated with the cue evoked decrease in ACh levels and artificial inhibition of CINs revealed that longer inhibition shortens the latency to press compared to shorter inhibition. This supports a role of the ACh signal and it’s regulation by D2Rs in the motivation to initiate actions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prior-guided Individualized Thalamic Parcellation based on Local Diffusion Characteristics using Deep Learning</a></h4>

              
                As a gateway for projections entering and exiting the cerebral cortex, the human thalamus processes information from sensory to cognition relevant to various neuropsychiatric disorders. It is composed of dozens of nuclei, which have been difficult to identify with clinical MR sequences. However, delineating thalamic nuclei accurately at an individual level is essential for precise neuromodulation treatment. Here, we not only identified the fine-grained thalamic nuclei using local diffusion properties in vivo but also employed a deep learning strategy to achieve highly reproducible individual-level parcellation. Using High-quality diffusion MRI (dMRI), we first constructed a fine-grained group thalamus atlas based on thalamic local diffusion features. Then, the high-probability core area of the group thalamus atlas was wrapped into the native space as prior guidance for individualized thalamus construction. Finally, we trained the semi-supervised multiple classification models to accurately construct the individualized thalamus atlas with single-subject local diffusion characteristics. Compared to group atlas registration and single-subject clustering strategies, our individualized thalamus atlas combines population commonality and individual specificity and is superior in depicting the individual thalamic nuclei boundaries. Besides, our atlas provides a more conspicuous capacity to capture the individual specificity of thalamic nuclei. Through the evaluation by 3.0T7.0T and test-retest dMRI datasets, the proposed high-probability group prior guided individualized thalamus construction pipeline is robust and repeatable in different magnetic field strengths and scanning batches. In addition, the individual parcellation of the thalamic nuclei has a good correspondence with the histological atlas and captured both higher group consistency and inter-subjects variations, which could be a valuable solution for precision clinical treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sustained spinal motor activity triggered by direct mechanosensory stimulation in adult Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Most vertebrates and invertebrates such as Drosophila melanogaster are able to move in complex environments due to their ability to integrate sensory information along with motor commands. Mechanosensory structures exist along each leg to assist in motor coordination by transmitting external cues or proprioceptive information to motor centers in the central nervous system. Nevertheless, how different mechanosensory structures engage these locomotor centers and their underlying circuits remains poorly understood. Here, we tested the role of mechanosensory structures in movement initiation by optogenetically stimulating specific classes of leg sensory structures. We found that stimulation of leg Mechanosensory Bristles (MsB) and femoral Chordotonal Organ (ChO) is sufficient to initiate forward movement in immobile animals. We also found that while the stimulation of the ChO depends on the presence of the central brain to trigger forward movement, stimulation of leg MsB could trigger cyclic motor activity independently of central brain circuits. Leg MsB-triggered movement lacks inter-leg and intra-leg coordination, whilst antagonistic muscle activity within joints is preserved. Moreover, we found that the duration of the MsB-induced movement is dependent on the number of excited cells and is specific to leg afferents, since stimulation of MsB in other segments lead to different motor outcomes. This study sheds light on the ability of specific sensory circuits to modulate motor control, including initiation of movement, and how this information can be automatically translated to a motor command by spinal neuronal pathways.

                Mechanosensory feedback of internal state regulates numerous bodily processes including feeding, defecation, and reproduction. However, how mechanosensory feedback signals to modulate neural circuits and coordinate these behaviors is incompletely understood. Here, we use the egg-laying circuit of C. elegans to test our hypothesis that mechanosensory feedback of egg accumulation promotes the active reproductive behavior state. Using an acute gonad microinjection technique to mimic changes in pressure and stretch resulting from germline activity and egg accumulation, we find that injection rapidly stimulates Ca2+ activity in both neurons and muscles of the egg-laying circuit. Injection-induced vulval muscle Ca2+ activity requires L-type Ca2+ channels but is independent of presynaptic input. Direct mechanical prodding activates the vulval muscles, suggesting they are the proximal targets of the stretch-dependent stimulus. Our results show that egg-laying behavior in C. elegans is regulated by a stretch-dependent homeostat that scales postsynaptic muscle responses with egg accumulation in the uterus.

                The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) is known to regulate various cognitive and behavioral processes. However, while functional diversity among PVT circuits has often been linked to cellular differences, the molecular identity and spatial distribution of PVT cell types remains unclear. To address this gap, here we used single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and identified five molecularly distinct PVT neuronal subtypes. Additionally, multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization of top marker genes revealed that PVT subtypes are organized by a combination of previously unidentified molecular gradients. Lastly, comparing our dataset with a recently published single-cell sequencing atlas of thalamus yielded novel insight into the PVT's connectivity with cortex, including unexpected innervation of auditory and visual areas. This comparison also revealed that our data contains a largely non-overlapping transcriptomic map of multiple midline thalamic nuclei. Collectively, our findings uncover previously unknown features of the molecular diversity and anatomical organization of the PVT and provide a valuable resource for future investigations.

                The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a hub for cognitive control, and dopamine profoundly influences its functions. In other brain regions, astrocytes sense diverse neurotransmitters and neuromodulators and, in turn, orchestrate regulation of neuroactive substances. However, basic physiology of PFC astrocytes, including which neuromodulatory signals they respond to and how they contribute to PFC function, is lacking. Here, we characterize divergent signaling signatures in astrocytes of PFC and primary sensory cortex in mice, which are linked to differential responsivity to locomotion. We find that PFC astrocytes express receptors for dopamine, but are unresponsive through the Gs/Gi-cAMP pathway. Instead, fast calcium signals in PFC astrocytes are time-locked to dopamine release, and are mediated by 1-adrenergic receptors both ex vivo and in vivo. Further, we describe dopamine-triggered regulation of extracellular ATP at PFC astrocyte territories. Thus, we identify astrocytes as active players in dopaminergic signaling in PFC, contributing to PFC function though neuromodulator receptor crosstalk.

                We present MiniVess, the first annotated dataset of rodent cerebrovasculature, acquired using two-photon fluorescence microscopy. MiniVess consists of 70 3D image volumes with segmented ground truths. Segmentations were created using traditional image processing operations, a U-Net, and manual proofreading. Code for image preprocessing steps and the U-Net are provided. Supervised machine learning methods have been widely used for automated image processing of biomedical images. While much emphasis has been placed on the development of new network architectures and loss functions, there has been an increased emphasis on the need for publicly available annotated, or segmented, datasets. Annotated datasets are necessary during model training and validation. In particular, datasets that are collected from different labs are necessary to test the generalizability of models. We hope this dataset will be helpful in testing the reliability of machine learning tools for analyzing biomedical images.

                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder with no effective cure. Cerebrovascular and neurovascular pathology are early and causal hallmarks of AD, with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), the deposition of amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) at the cerebral vasculature, being present in about 90% of AD cases. Our previous work has uncovered the protective effect of carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibition against A{beta}-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis in vascular, glial and neuronal cells in culture and in mouse brains injected with A{beta}. Here, we tested for the first time in a model of AD and cerebrovascular amyloidosis, the TgSwDI mice, a chronic regimen employing FDA-approved CA inhibitors (CAIs), methazolamide (MTZ) and acetazolamide (ATZ). These drugs are used in humans for the treatment of glaucoma, high altitude sickness, and other disorders, and are able to pass the blood-brain barrier. We found that both CAIs were non-toxic, significantly reduced cerebral amyloidosis, including vascular and glial A{beta} accumulation, and ameliorated cognition. MTZ and ATZ treatment prevented caspase activation in endothelial cells, microglia and astrocytes, reverted capillary constriction, reduced gliosis, and induced protective pro-clearance pathways, which are likely responsible for the reduction of A{beta} deposition. Importantly, we unveiled a key new drug target, showing that the mitochondrial isozyme CA-VB is upregulated in TgSwDI brains and in endothelial cells upon A{beta} treatment, and that CA-VB silencing, mimicking CAIs effects, reduces endothelial cell apoptosis. Overall, this work paves the way to the potential application of CAIs in clinical trials for human AD and CAA.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A spherical harmonics-based framework for representing steady-state shifts in neuron models induced by weak electric fields</a></h4>

              
                Objective: We provide a systematic framework for the quantification of the effect of externally applied weak electric fields on realistic neuron compartment models as captured by physiologically relevant quantities such as the membrane potential or transmembrane current as a function of the orientation of the field. Approach: We define a response function as the steady-state change of the membrane potential induced by a canonical external field of 1~V/m as a function of its orientation. We estimate the function values through simulations employing reconstructions of the rat somatosensory cortex from the Blue Brain Project. The response of different cell types is simulated using the NEURON simulation environment. We represent and analyze the angular response as an expansion in spherical harmonics. Main results: We report membrane perturbation values comparable to those in the literature, extend them to different cell types, and provide their profiles as spherical harmonic coefficients. We show that in resting condition, responses are dominated by their dipole terms (l=1), in agreement with experimental findings and compartment theory. Indeed, we show analytically that for a passive cell only the dipole term is nonzero. However, for states other than resting, other terms, while small, appear relevant. In particular, we show how l=0 and l=2 terms can modify the function to induce asymmetries in the response. Significance: This work provides a practical framework for the realistic representation of the effects of weak electric fields on different neuron types and their main regions---an important milestone for the development of micro- and mesoscale models and the optimization of brain stimulation solutions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cross Atlas Remapping via Optimal Transport (CAROT): Creating connectomes for any atlas when raw data is not available</a></h4>

              
                Whether using large-scale projects---like the Human Connectome Project (HCP), the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, Healthy Brain Network (HBN), and the UK Biobank---or pooling together several smaller studies, open-source, publicly available datasets allow for unpresented sample sizes and promote generalization efforts. Overall, releasing preprocessing data can enhance participant privacy, democratize science, and lead to unique scientific discoveries. But releasing preprocessed data also limits the choices available to the end-user. For connectomics, this is especially true as connectomes created from different atlases i.e., ways of dividing the brain into distinct regions) are not directly comparable. In addition, there exist several atlases with no gold standards, and more being developed yearly, making it unrealistic to have processed, open-source data available from all atlases. To address these limitations, we propose Cross Atlas Remapping via Optimal Transport (CAROT) to find a mapping between two atlases, allowing data processed from one atlas to be directly transformed into a connectome based on another atlas without needing raw data. To validate CAROT, we compare reconstructed connectomes against their original counterparts (i.e., connectomes generated directly from an atlas), demonstrate the utility of transformed connectomes in downstream analyses, and show how a connectome-based predictive model can be generalized to publicly available processed data that was processed with different atlases. Overall, CAROT can reconstruct connectomes from an extensive set of atlases---without ever needing the raw data---allowing already processed connectomes to be easily reused in a wide-range of analyses while eliminating wasted and duplicate processing efforts. We share this tool as both source code and as a stand-alone web application (http://carotproject.com/).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Updating memories of unwanted emotions during human sleep</a></h4>

              
                Post-learning sleep contributes to memory consolidation. Yet, it remains contentious whether sleep affords opportunities to modify or update emotional memories, such as those people would prefer to forget. Here we attempted to update memories during sleep using spoken positive emotional words paired with cues to recent memories for aversive events. Affect updating using positive words during human non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, compared with using neutral words instead, reduced negative affect judgments in post-sleep tests, suggesting that the recalled events were perceived as less aversive. EEG analyses showed that emotional words modulated theta and spindle/sigma activity. Specifically, to the extent that theta power was larger for the positive word than for the following memory cue, participants judged the memory cues less negatively. Moreover, to the extent that sigma power was larger for the emotional word than for the following memory cue, participants showed higher forgetting of unwanted memories. Notably, when the onset of individual positive word coincided with the upstate of slow oscillations, a state characterized by increased cortical excitability during NREM sleep, affective updating was more successful. In sum, the affect content of memories was altered via strategic spoken words presentations during sleep, in association with theta power increases and slow-oscillation upstates. These findings offer novel possibilities for modifying unwanted memories during sleep, without requiring conscious confrontations with aversive memories that people would prefer to avoid.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A physical neural mass model framework for the analysis of oscillatory generators from laminar electrophysiological recordings</a></h4>

              
                Cortical function emerges from the interactions of multi-scale networks that may be studied at a high level using neural mass models (NMM), which represent the mean activity of large numbers of neurons. In order to properly reproduce experimental data, these models require the addition of further elements. Here we provide a framework integrating conduction physics that can be used to simulate cortical electrophysiology measurements, in particular those obtained from multicontact laminar electrodes. This is achieved by endowing NMMs with basic physical properties, such as the average laminar location of the apical and basal dendrites of pyramidal cell populations. We call this framework laminar NMM, or LaNMM for short. We then employ this framework to infer the location of oscillatory generators from laminar-resolved data collected from the prefrontal cortex in the macaque monkey. We define, based on the literature of columnar connectivity, a minimal neural mass model capable of generating amplitude and phase coupled slow (alpha, 4--22~Hz) and fast (gamma, 30--250~Hz) oscillations. The synapse layer locations of the two pyramidal cell populations are treated as optimization parameters, together with two more LaNMM-specific parameters, to compare the models with the multicontact recordings. We rank the candidate models using an optimization function that evaluates the match between the functional connectivity of the model and data, where the FC is defined by the covariance between bipolar voltage measurements at different cortical depths. The family of best solutions reproduces the FC of the observed electrophysiology while selecting locations of pyramidal cells and their synapses that result in the generation of fast activity at superficial layers and slow activity across most depths, in line with recent literature proposals.

                Machine learning (ML) is becoming a standard tool in neuroscience and neuroimaging research. Yet, because it is such a powerful tool, the appropriate application of ML requires a sound understanding of its subtleties and limitations. In particular, applying ML to datasets with imbalanced classes, which are very common in neuroscience, can have severe consequences if not adequately addressed. With the neuroscience machine-learning user in mind, this technical note provides a didactic overview of the class imbalance problem and illustrates its impact through systematic manipulation of class imbalance ratios in both simulated data, and real electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) brain data. Our results illustrate how in highly imbalanced data, the commonly used Accuracy (Acc) metric yields misleadingly high performances by preferentially predicting the majority class, while other evaluations metrics (e.g. Balanced Accuracy (BAcc) and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)) may still provide reliable performance evaluations. In terms of classifiers and cross-validation schemes, our data highlights the higher robustness of Random Forest (RF) and Stratified K-Fold cross-validation, compared to the other approaches tested. Critically, for neuroscience ML applications that seek to minimize overall classification error (not preferentially that of a single class), we recommend the routine use of BAcc, rather than the simple and more commonly used Acc metric. Importantly, we provide a best practices list of recommendations for dealing with imbalanced data, and open-source code to allow the neuroscience community to replicate our observations and further explore the best practices in handling imbalanced data.

                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by loss of smell and olfactory system pathology that subsequently leads to dementia. Understanding these early processes can identify therapeutic targets to slow AD progression. Thus, we analyzed differential gene and protein expression in the olfactory bulb (OB) and olfactory tract (OT) of familial AD (FAD) individuals carrying the autosomal dominant presenilin 1 E280A paisa mutation and age-matched controls. In FAD samples, we find human transcriptome signatures for viral infection in OB and for inflammation in OT that carries information via entorhinal cortex from the OB to hippocampus, a brain region essential for learning and memory. Interestingly, spatial proteomic changes consistent with a demyelination response in the OT of FAD individuals were seen, implying dysfunction of communication between the OB and hippocampus. These findings raise the possibility that viral infection and associated inflammation/demyelination of the olfactory system may disrupt downstream hippocampal function, accelerating FAD pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oral oxycodone self-administration leads to features of opioid addiction in male and female mice</a></h4>

              
                Use of prescription opioids, particularly oxycodone is an initiating factor driving the current opioid epidemic. There are several challenges with modeling oxycodone abuse. First, prescription opioids including oxycodone are orally self-administered and have different pharmacokinetics and dynamics than morphine or fentanyl which have been more commonly used in rodent research. This oral route of administration determines the pharmacokinetic profile, which then influences the establishment of drug-reinforcement associations in animals. Moreover, the pattern of intake and the environment in which addictive drugs are self-administered are critical determinants of the levels of drug intake, of behavioral sensitization, and of propensity to relapse behavior. These are all important considerations when modeling prescription opioid use, which is characterized by continuous drug access in familiar environments. Thus, to model features of prescription opioid use and the transition to abuse, we designed an oral, homecage-based oxycodone self-administration paradigm. Mice voluntarily self-administer oxycodone in this paradigm without any taste modification such as sweeteners, and the majority exhibit preference for oxycodone, escalation of intake, physical signs of dependence, and reinstatement of seeking after withdrawal. In addition, a subset of animals demonstrate drug taking that is resistant to aversive consequences. This model is therefore translationally relevant and useful for studying the neurobiological substrates of prescription opioid abuse.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fractionating distraction: How past- and future-relevant distractors influence integrated decisions</a></h4>

              
                Many everyday tasks require us to integrate information from multiple steps to make a decision. Dominant accounts of flexible cognition suggest that we are able to navigate such complex tasks by attending to each step in turn, yet few studies measure how we direct our attention to immediate and future task steps. Here, we used a two-step task to test whether participants are sensitive to information that is currently irrelevant, but will be relevant in a future task step. Participants viewed two displays in sequence, each containing two superimposed moving dot clouds of different colours. Participants attended to one cued target colour in each display and reported the average direction of the two target dot clouds. In a subset of trials, we presented a "decoy" distractor: the second target colour appeared as the distractor in the first display. We regressed behavioural responses on the dot clouds' motion directions to track how this future-relevant "decoy" distractor influenced participants' reporting of the average target direction. We compared the influence of decoy distractors to never-relevant, recently relevant, and globally relevant distractor baselines. Across four experiments, we found that responses reflected what was immediately relevant, as well as the broader historical relevance of the distractors. However, relevance for a future task step did not reliably influence attention. We propose that attention in multi-step tasks is shaped by what has been relevant in the current setting, and by the immediate demands of each task step.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-related Macular Degeneration is associated with faster rates of structural brain changes and widespread differences in connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a prevalent disease impeding vision. More recently, AMD has also been linked to cognitive impairment, such as deficits in language and memory skills. In order to better understand the extent of AMD-related changes in the whole brain structure and connectivity, we have conducted an MRI diffusion acquisition study on 40 participants (20 diagnosed with AMD and 20 controls). These acquisitions were then performed again in a follow up two years later. We developed novel analysis methods for diffusion based tractography and connectomes to better determine which, if any, brain region connections saw the greatest changes between the AMD and the age-matched control groups. Using voxel-based analysis, we identified atrophy in AMD participants in the cuneate gyrus, which has been associated with vision, and the left superior temporal gyrus, which has been associated with language, while later acquisitions compounded this with a deficiency in the bilateral cingulate gyrus, itself linked to higher cognition and memory. These regional atrophy findings support that people with AMD experience widespread neuronal degradation that is not limited to retinal neurons. Regions that saw drastically lowered fractional anisotropy among AMD vs. control included the visual cortex, such as the bilateral occipital lobe and the frontoparietal cortex. Tensor Network Principal Component Analysis (TN-PCA) isolated lingual and temporal connections as important differentiators of AMD connectomes compared to controls, thus supporting our morphometric and texture findings in regions related to vision, but also connectopathies of language and memory brain regions. Bundle based analyses in baseline data revealed that the lingual gyrus had greater spread of tracts overall in the AMD participants, which may be explained by prior reorganization in this area, demonstrating a connection between retinal health and lingual structure. Moreover, we noted group differences in the interhemispheric temporal connections, and lingual cerebellar connections, supporting extensive downstream effects of vision loss. Our bundle-based analyses expand the toolset available for neuroimaging-based phenotyping, and reveal widespread changes in AMD participants beyond brain regions and tractography networks directly involved in vision processing, including those involved in language and memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Menstrual cycle and exogenous attention toward emotional expressions</a></h4>

              
                Several studies suggest that the menstrual cycle affects emotional processing. However, these results may be biased by including women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in the samples. PMS is characterized by negative emotional symptomatology, such as depression and/or anxiety, during the luteal phase. This study aimed to explore the modulation of exogenous attention to emotional facial expressions as a function of the menstrual cycle in women without PMS. For this purpose, 55 women were selected (from an original volunteer sample of 790) according to rigorous exclusion criteria. Happy, angry, and neutral faces were presented as distractors, while both behavioral performance in a perceptual task and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. This task was applied during both phases of the menstrual cycle (luteal and follicular, counterbalanced), and premenstrual symptomatology was monitored daily. Traditional and Bayesian ANOVAs on behavioral data (reaction times and errors in the task) and ERP indices (P1, N170, N2, and LPP amplitudes) confirmed the expected lack of an interaction of phase and emotion. Taken together, these results indicate that women free of PMS present steady exogenous attention levels to emotionally positive and negative stimuli regardless of the menstrual phase.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">NeuVue: A Framework and Workflows for High-Throughput Electron Microscopy Connectomics Proofreading</a></h4>

              
                NeuVue is a software platform created for large-scale proofreading of machine segmentation and neural circuit reconstruction in high-resolution electron microscopy connectomics datasets. The NeuVue platform provides a robust web-based interface for proofreaders to collaboratively view, annotate, and edit segmentation and connectivity data. A backend queuing service organizes proofreader tasks into purpose-driven task types and increases proofreader throughput by limiting proofreader actions to simple, atomic operations. A collection of analytical dashboards, data visualization tools, and Application Program Interface (API) capabilities provide stakeholders real-time access to proofreading progress at an individual proofreader level as well as insights on task generation priorities. NeuVue is agnostic to the underlying data being proofread and improves upon the traditional proofreader experience through quality-of-life features that streamline complex editing operations such as splitting and merging objects in dense nanoscale segmentation. NeuVue heavily leverages cloud resources to enable proofreaders to simultaneously access and edit data on the platform. Production-quality features such as load-balancing, auto-scaling, and pre-deployment testing are all integrated into the platform's cloud architecture. Additionally, NeuVue is powered by well-supported open-source connectomics tools from the community such as Neuroglancer, PyChunkedGraph, and Connectomics Annotation Versioning Engine (CAVE). The modular design of NeuVue facilitates easy integration and adoption of useful community tools to allow proofreaders to take advantage of the latest improvements in data visualization, processing, and analysis. We demonstrate our framework through proofreading of the mouse visual cortex data generated on the IARPA MICrONS Project. This effort has yielded over 40,000 proofreader edits across the 2 petavoxels of "Minnie" neuroimaging data. 44 unique proofreaders of various skill levels have logged a cumulative 3,740 proofreading hours, and we have been able to validate the improved connectivity of thousands of neurons in the volume. With sustained development on the platform, new integrated error detection and error correction capabilities, and continuous improvements to the proofreader model, we believe that the NeuVue framework can enable high-throughput proofreading for large-scale connectomics datasets of the future.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual stimuli modulate local field potentials but drive no high-frequency activity in human auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neuroimaging studies suggest cross-sensory visual influences in human auditory cortices (AC). Whether these influences reflect active visual processing in human ACs, which drives neuronal firing and concurrent broadband high-frequency activity (BHFA; >70 Hz), or whether they merely modulate sound processing is still debatable. Here, we presented auditory, visual, and audiovisual stimuli to 16 participants with stereo-EEG depth electrodes implanted near ACs for presurgical monitoring. Anatomically normalized group analyses were facilitated by inverse modeling of intracranial source currents. Pattern cross-correlation analyses suggested cross-sensory visual influences, lagging auditory responses by ~50 ms in ACs. Visual stimuli also modulated the phase of intrinsic low-frequency oscillations and triggered 15-30-Hz event-related desynchronization in ACs. However, BHFA, a putative correlate of neuronal firing, was not significantly increased in ACs after visual stimuli, not even when they coincided with auditory stimuli. Intracranial recordings demonstrate cross-sensory modulations, but no indication of active visual processing in human ACs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">One-to-one mapping between deep network units and real neurons uncovers a visual population code for social behavior</a></h4>

              
                The rich variety of behaviors observed in animals arises through the complex interplay between sensory processing and motor control. To understand these sensorimotor transformations, it is useful to build models that predict not only neural responses to sensory input but also how each neuron causally contributes to behavior. Here we demonstrate a novel modeling approach to identify a one-to-one mapping between internal units in a deep neural network and real neurons by predicting the behavioral changes arising from systematic perturbations of more than a dozen neuron types. A key ingredient we introduce is "knockout training", which involves perturbing the network during training to match the perturbations of the real neurons during behavioral experiments. We apply this approach to model the sensorimotor transformation of Drosophila melanogaster males during a complex, visually-guided social behavior. Contrary to prevailing views, our model suggests that visual projection neurons at the interface between the eye and brain form a distributed population code that collectively sculpts social behavior. Overall, our framework consolidates behavioral effects elicited from various neural perturbations into a single, unified model, providing a detailed map from stimulus to neuron to behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Event integration and temporal pattern separation: how hierarchical knowledge emerges in hippocampal subfields through learning</a></h4>

              
                Everyday life experiences are composed of sequences of events determined by changes of contexts, layered with more rapidly changing occurrences that unfold within each event. A major challenge of our memory systems is how the brain integrates these occurrences within events while also maintaining their distinct details and avoiding over-integration across different contexts. Here we asked if and how distinct hippocampal subfields come to hierarchically represent both event context and subevents occurrences with learning. Participants learned repeating events, defined as sequences of objects superimposed on shared color frames, while undergoing high-resolution fMRI. Behavioral markers and consequences of event boundaries were evident across all repetitions. After learning, hippocampal CA3 multivoxel activation patterns reflected the event context and the strength of event representations in CA3 correlated with behavioral facilitation during event transitions. In contrast to CA3, dentate gyrus activation patterns became more differentiated through learning, specifically for objects that were close in time and belonged to the same event. This is a form temporal pattern separation that is sensitive to context, to facilitate distinct representations of subevent occurrences. A computational model explained these results by dynamic inhibition in dentate gyrus. We also adopted to fMRI novel similarity measures that are sensitive to the overlap in the population of activated voxels and show that CA3 representations of different contexts, and dentate gyrus' distinct item representations, likely result from different populations of voxels. These findings suggest an interplay between the representations of event context that shapes temporal pattern separation in dentate gyrus, and attractor dynamics in CA3. The results advance our knowledge of how the hippocampus represents context and time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Somatostatin peptide signaling dampens cortical circuits and promotes exploratory behavior</a></h4>

              
                Background Somatostatin (SST) neurons in the prelimbic (PL) cortex mediate a variety of behavioral states, ranging from alcohol consumption to fear learning and avoidance-related behaviors. However, little is known about the role of somatostatin peptide signaling itself to cortical functioning and behavior. Here, we sought to characterize the unique physiological and behavioral roles of the SST peptide in the PL cortex. Methods We employed a combination of ex vivo electrophysiology, in vivo calcium monitoring, and in vivo peptide pharmacology to explore the role of SST neuron and peptide signaling in the mouse PL cortex. Whole-cell slice electrophysiology was conducted in C57BL/6J male and female mice in pyramidal and GABAergic neurons of the PL cortex to characterize the pharmacological mechanism of SST signaling. Fiber photometry recordings of GCaMP6f fluorescent calcium signals from SST neurons were conducted to characterize the activity profile of SST neurons during exploration of an elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field (OF). We further used local delivery of a broad SST receptor (SSTR) agonist into bilateral PL cortex to test causal effects of SST signaling on these same exploratory behaviors. Results SSTR activation broadly hyperpolarized layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the PL cortex in both male and female mice ex vivo, through both monosynaptic and polysynaptic GABA neuron-mediated mechanisms of action. This hyperpolarization was blocked by pre-application of the SSTR antagonist cyclo-somatostatin (cyclo-SST) and was non-reversible. SST neurons in PL were activated during EPM and OF exploration, indicating task-related recruitment of these neurons. Lastly, in line with this exploration-related activity profile, SSTR agonist administration directly into the PL enhanced open arm exploration in the EPM. Conclusions Here we reveal a novel role for the SST peptide system within the PL cortex, by demonstrating a peptide-induced hypoexcitability of PL circuits and modulation of PL-dependent exploratory behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activity-dependent stabilization of nascent dendritic spines requires non-enzymatic CaMKIIα function</a></h4>

              
                The outgrowth and stabilization of nascent dendritic spines are crucial processes underlying learning and memory. Most new spines retract shortly after growth; only a small subset is stabilized and integrated into the new circuit connections that support learning. New spine stabilization has been shown to rely upon activity-dependent molecular mechanisms that also contribute to long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength. Indeed, disruption of the activity-dependent targeting of the kinase CaMKII to the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA-type glutamate receptor disrupts both LTP and activity-dependent stabilization of new spines. Yet it is not known which of CaMKII's many enzymatic and structural functions are important for new spine stabilization. Here, we used two-photon imaging and photolysis of caged glutamate to monitor the activity-dependent stabilization of new dendritic spines on hippocampal CA1 neurons from mice of both sexes in conditions where CaMKII functional and structural interactions were altered. Surprisingly, we found that inhibiting CaMKII kinase activity either genetically or pharmacologically did not impair activity-dependent new spine stabilization. In contrast, shRNA knock-down of CaMKII abolished activity-dependent new spine stabilization, which was rescued by co-expressing shRNA-resistant CaMKII. Notably, overexpression of phospho-mimetic CaMKII-T286D, which exhibits activity-independent targeting to GluN2B, enhanced basal new spine survivorship in the absence of additional glutamatergic stimulation, even when kinase activity was disrupted. Together, our results suggest that nascent dendritic spine stabilization requires structural and scaffolding interactions mediated by CaMKII that are independent of its enzymatic activities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Versatile Multiple Object Tracking in Sparse 2D/3D Videos Via Diffeomorphic Image Registration</a></h4>

              
                Tracking body parts in behaving animals, extracting fluorescence signals from cells embedded in deforming tissue, and analyzing cell migration patterns during development all require tracking objects with partially correlated motion. As dataset sizes increase, manual tracking of objects becomes prohibitively inefficient and slow, necessitating automated and semi-automated computational tools. Unfortunately, existing methods for multiple object tracking (MOT) are either developed for specific datasets and hence do not generalize well to other datasets, or require large amounts of training data that are not readily available. This is further exacerbated when tracking fluorescent sources in moving and deforming tissues, where the lack of unique features and sparsely populated images create a challenging environment, especially for modern deep learning techniques. By leveraging technology recently developed for spatial transformer networks, we propose ZephIR, an image registration framework for semi-supervised MOT in 2D and 3D videos. ZephIR can generalize to a wide range of biological systems by incorporating adjustable parameters that encode spatial (sparsity, texture, rigidity) and temporal priors of a given data class. We demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of our approach in a variety of applications, including tracking the body parts of a behaving mouse and neurons in the brain of a freely moving C. elegans. We provide an open-source package along with a web-based graphical user interface that allows users to provide small numbers of annotations to interactively improve tracking results.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">No evidence of theory of mind reasoning in the human language network</a></h4>

              
                Language comprehension and the ability to infer others' thoughts (theory of mind, ToM) are interrelated during development and language use. However, neural evidence that bears on the relationship between language and ToM mechanisms is mixed. Although robust dissociations have been reported in brain disorders, brain activations for contrasts that target language and ToM bear similarities, and some have reported overlap (Deen et al., 2015). We take another look at the language-ToM relationship by evaluating the response of the language network (Fedorenko et al., 2010), as measured with fMRI, to verbal and non-verbal ToM across 151 participants. Individual-subject analyses reveal that all core language regions respond more strongly when participants read vignettes about false beliefs compared to the control vignettes. However, we show that these differences are largely due to linguistic confounds, and no such effects appear in a non-verbal ToM task. These results argue against cognitive and neural overlap between language processing and ToM. In exploratory analyses, we find responses to social processing in the "periphery" of the language network'''right hemisphere homotopes of core language areas and areas in bilateral angular gyri---but these responses are not selectively ToM-related and may reflect general visual semantic processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">MCT1-dependent energetic failure and neuroinflammation underlie optic nerve degeneration in Wolfram syndrome mice</a></h4>

              
                Wolfram syndrome 1 (WS1) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the WFS1 gene leading to a wide spectrum of clinical dysfunctions, among which blindness, diabetes and neurological deficits are the most prominent. WFS1 encodes for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident transmembrane protein Wolframin with multiple functions in ER processes. However, the WFS1-dependent etiopathology in retinal cells is unknown. Herein, we showed that Wfs1 mutant mice developed early retinal electrophysiological impairments followed by marked visual loss. Interestingly, axons and myelin disruption in the optic nerve preceded the degeneration of the retinal ganglion cell bodies in the retina. Transcriptomics at pre-degenerative stage revealed the STAT3-dependent activation of proinflammatory glial markers with reduction of the homeostatic and pro-survival factors Glutamine synthetase and BDNF. Furthermore, label-free comparative proteomics identified a significant reduction of the monocarboxylate transport isoform 1 (MCT1) and its partner Basigin that are highly enriched on retinal astrocytes and myelin-forming oligodendrocytes in optic nerve together with Wolframin. Loss of MCT1 caused a failure in lactate transfer from glial to neuronal cell bodies and axons leading to a chronic hypometabolic state. Thus, this bioenergetic impairment is occurring concurrently both in the axonal regions and cell bodies of the retinal ganglion cells, selectively endangering their survival while impacting less on other retinal cells. This metabolic dysfunction occurs months before the frank RGC degeneration suggesting an extended time window for intervening with new therapeutic strategies focused on boosting retinal and optic nerve bioenergetics in WS1.

	<p>The clinical differential diagnosis between Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is often challenging. The description of milder PSP phenotypes strongly resembling PD, such as PSP-Parkinsonism, further increased the diagnostic challenge and the need for reliable neuroimaging biomarkers to enhance the diagnostic certainty. This review aims to summarize the contribution of a relatively simple and widely available imaging technique such as MR planimetry in the differential diagnosis between PD and PSP, focusing on the recent advancements in this field. The development of accurate MR planimetric biomarkers, together with the implementation of automated algorithms, led to robust and objective measures for the differential diagnosis of PSP and PD at the individual level. Evidence from longitudinal studies also suggests a role of MR planimetry in predicting the development of the PSP clinical signs, allowing to identify PSP patients before they meet diagnostic criteria when their clinical phenotype can be indistinguishable from PD. Finally, promising evidence exists on the possible association between MR planimetric measures and the underlying pathology, with important implications for trials with new disease-modifying target therapies.</p>

	<p>Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include symptoms of vertigo and dizziness, which is rather unsurprising, since SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism may inflict a broad spectrum of neuropathic effects. The widespread nature of central and peripheral audiovestibular pathways suggests that there may be several probable pathophysiological mechanisms. The cytokine storm, CNS infiltration of the virus through ACE 2 receptors, and other systemic factors can be responsible for the significant number of COVID-19 patients reported to experience symptoms of vertigo and dizziness. In this paper, we present a systematic review of clinical studies reporting the detection of dizziness and vertigo as clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and discuss their etiopathogenesis.</p>

	<p>Objective: fibromyalgia is a complex chronic pain syndrome characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, insomnia and autonomic alterations. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is regarded as a promising treatment in fibromyalgia, but its impact on autonomic function remains uncertain. In this research, we studied the effect of CBT on autonomic functions in fibromyalgia. Methods: Twenty-five participants underwent overnight polysomnographic recordings before and after CBT programs focused on pain (CBT-P) or a hybrid modality focused on pain and insomnia (CBT-C). Sleep quality, daily pain, depression and anxiety were assessed by self-reported questionnaires. We analyzed heart rate variability (HRV) using high-frequency power (HF) as a marker for parasympathetic activity, and low-frequency power (LF) and the LF/HF ratio as relative sympathetic markers during wakefulness and at each sleep stage. Results: After treatment, 14 patients (/25, 58.0%) reported improvement in their sleep: 6 in the CBT-P condition (/12, 50%), and 8 in the CBT-C condition (/13, 61.5%). We found that, regardless of the type of CBT, patients who reported improvement in sleep quality (n = 14, 58%) had an increase in HF during stages N2 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) and N3 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). These changes were related to improvement in sleep quality (N2, r = &amp;amp;minus;0.43, p = 0.033) but not to pain, depression or anxiety. Conclusions: This study showed an improvement in parasympathetic cardiac control during non-rapid-eye-movement sleep following CBT in fibromyalgia participants who reported better sleep after this therapy. CBT may have a cardio-protective effect and HRV could be used as a sleep monitoring tool in fibromyalgia.</p>

	<p>Eye movement disorders have been reported in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) as saccadic disturbances. Several methods have been described for the assessment of saccades, including the K-D and DEM tests. The performance of these tests also involves attention, language, and other brain areas which have been reported to be altered in MS patients. The aim of the study was to determine how developmental eye movement (DEM) and King-Devick (K-D) tests are affected in MS-patients. It was also to analyze whether a resolved episode of optic neuritis (ON) has a negative influence. Subjects with MS showed worse outcomes (higher times) in DEM test (72 (26) s and a K-D test (56 (22) s compared to healthy subjects (64 (7) s and 55 (11) s, respectively). However, a previous ON episode did not worsen the MS-times of DEM (80 (33) s or of K-D (62 (33) s. Horizontal saccades with the DEM showed differences between subjects with MS (with and without ON) and healthy ones (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), whereas no such differences were found in the vertical saccades. According to the DEM instructions, MS patients would present heterogeneous oculomotor and non-visual disturbances. Regarding the K-D test, only the third card (the most complex one) showed differences (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) between groups. These tests can capture impairment of attention, language, and other areas that correlate with suboptimal brain function in addition to the oculomotor dysfunctions present in subjects with MS.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Previous evidence demonstrates that tight glycemic control and good physical function could reduce the risk of delirium. This study aimed to investigate whether the occurrence of postoperative delirium (POD) in older hip fracture surgery patients is associated with preoperative glycemic control factors or pre-injury physical performance. (2) Methods: Three-hundred and nine individuals aged over 65 years and scheduled for hip fracture surgery were included at a single center. Glycemic control factors and pre-injury physical performance were assessed preoperatively. The presence of delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method on postoperative hospitalization days. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models and a risk prediction model of POD were established. (3) Results: Among the 309 patients, 52 (16.83%) experienced POD during the hospital stay. The numbers of pre-injury physical performance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients were significantly different in the POD and non-POD groups. The multivariable model showed that development of delirium was significantly explained by preoperative fasting blood glucose (FBG) (OR 0.804, p = 0.004), stair climbing (OR 0.709, p = 0.003), T2DM (odds ratio (OR) 3.654, p = 0.001), and age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (ACCI) (OR 1.270, p = 0.038). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the risk prediction model including those covariates was 0.770. (4) Conclusions: More older T2DM patients develop POD after hip fracture surgery than patients without T2DM. A simple assessment of preoperative FBG and pre-injury stair climbing capacity may identify those at high risk for the development of POD. Higher preoperative FBG and good pre-injury stair climbing capacity are protective factors for POD.</p>

	<p>During balance recovery from slip perturbations, forward flexion (elevation) of the arms serves to counterbalance the posteriorly displaced center of mass (CoM). We aimed to investigate whether aging affects modulation of arm responses to various intensities of unpredictable slip perturbations and whether arm responses are related to compensatory stepping stability. Ten healthy young adults and ten healthy older adults participated. Participants were asked to react naturally to three randomly administered levels of slip-like surface perturbations (intensity 1 (7.75 m/s2), intensity 2 (12.00 m/s2) and intensity 3 (16.75 m/s2), which occurred by means of forward acceleration of the treadmill belt while standing. Kinematic data were collected using a motion capture system. Outcomes included arm elevation displacement, velocity, and margin of stability (MoS) of compensatory stepping. The results reveal no modulation of arm elevation velocity in older adults from perturbation intensity 1 to 2, whereas younger adults demonstrated progressive increases from intensity 1 to 2 to 3. At intensity 3, older adults demonstrated reduced maximal arm elevation velocity compared to younger adults (p = 0.02). The results in both groups combined reveal a positive correlation between maximal arm elevation velocity and first compensatory step MoS at intensity 3 (p = 0.01). Together, these findings indicate age-related decreases in arm response modulation and the association of arm elevation response with protective stepping stability, suggesting that fall prevention interventions may benefit from an emphasis on arm elevation velocity control in response to greater perturbation intensities.</p>

	<p>Polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-NPs) are organic pollutants that are widely detected in the environment and organisms, posing potential threats to both ecosystems and human health. PS-NPs have been proven to penetrate the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier and increase the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases. However, information relating to the pathogenic molecular mechanism is still unclear. This study investigated the neurotoxicity and regulatory mechanisms of PS-NPs in human neuroblastoma SHSY-5Y cells. The results show that PS-NPs caused obvious mitochondrial damages, as evidenced by inhibited cell proliferation, increased lactate dehydrogenase release, stimulated oxidative stress responses, elevated Ca2+ level and apoptosis, and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and adenosine triphosphate levels. The increased release of cytochrome c and the overexpression of apoptosis-related proteins apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase-3 (caspase-3), and caspase-9 indicate the activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. In addition, the upregulation of autophagy markers light chain 3-II (LC3-II), Beclin-1, and autophagy-related protein (Atg) 5/12/16L suggests that PS-NPs could promote autophagy in SHSY-5Y cells. The RNA interference of Beclin-1 confirms the regulatory role of autophagy in PS-NP-induced neurotoxicity. The administration of antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) significantly attenuated the cytotoxicity and autophagy activation induced by PS-NP exposure. Generally, PS-NPs could induce neurotoxicity in SHSY-5Y cells via autophagy activation and mitochondria dysfunction, which was modulated by mitochondrial oxidative stress. Mitochondrial damages caused by oxidative stress could potentially be involved in the pathological mechanisms for PS-NP-induced neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

	<p>Background: An electrophysiological investigation with auditory brainstem response (ABR), round window electrocochleography (RW-ECoG), and electrical-ABR (E-ABR) was performed in children with suspected hearing loss with the purpose of early diagnosis and treatment. The effectiveness of the electrophysiological measures as diagnostic tools was assessed in this study. Methods: In this retrospective case series with chart review, 790 children below 3 years of age with suspected profound hearing loss were tested with impedance audiometry and underwent electrophysiological investigation (ABR, RW-ECoG, and E-ABR). All implanted cases underwent pure-tone audiometry (PTA) of the non-implanted ear at least 5 years after surgery for a long-term assessment of the reliability of the protocol. Results: Two hundred and fourteen children showed bilateral severe-to-profound hearing loss. In 56 children with either ABR thresholds between 70 and 90 dB nHL or no response, RW-ECoG showed thresholds below 70 dB nHL. In the 21 infants with bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss receiving a unilateral cochlear implant, no statistically significant differences were found in auditory thresholds in the non-implanted ear between electrophysiological measures and PTA at the last follow-up (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Eight implanted children showed residual hearing below 2000 Hz worse than 100 dB nHL and 2 children showed pantonal residual hearing worse than 100 dB nHL (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Conclusion: The audiological evaluation of infants with a comprehensive protocol is highly reliable. RW-ECoG provided a better definition of hearing thresholds, while E-ABR added useful information in cases of auditory nerve deficiency.</p>

     alt="Sex differences in morphine sensitivity are associated with differential glial expression in the brainstem of rats with neuropathic pain"/>
<p>It is well known that males and females show significant differences in both the analgesic and emetic effects of opiates. Our data provide evidence that changes in the morphology and activity of astrocytes in morphine sensitive and pain modulatory medullary regions might underlie these clinically important effects.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Chronic pain is more prevalent and reported to be more severe in women. Opioid analgesics are less effective in women and result in stronger nauseant effects. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying these sex differences have yet to be clearly defined, though recent research has suggested neuronal–glial interactions are likely involved. We have previously shown that similar to people, morphine is less effective at reducing pain behaviors in female rats. In this study, we used the immunohistochemical detection of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression to investigate sex differences in astrocyte density and morphology in six medullary regions known to be modulated by pain and/or opioids. Morphine administration had small sex-dependent effects on overall GFAP expression, but not on astrocyte morphology, in the rostral ventromedial medulla, the subnucleus reticularis dorsalis, and the area postrema. Significant sex differences in the density and morphology of GFAP immunopositive astrocytes were detected in all six regions. In general, GFAP-positive cells in females showed smaller volumes and reduced complexity than those observed in males. Furthermore, females showed lower overall GFAP expression in all regions except for the area postrema, the critical medullary region responsible for opioid-induced nausea and emesis. These data support the possibility that differences in astrocyte activity might underlie the sex differences seen in the processing of opioids in the context of chronic neuropathic pain.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Arginine vasopressin (AVP) serves as a neuromodulator in the brain. The hippocampus is one of the major targets for AVP, as it has been demonstrated that the hippocampus receives vasopressinergic innervation and expresses AVP receptors. The dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells (GCs) serve as a gate governing the inflow of information to the hippocampus. High densities of AVP receptors are expressed in the DG GCs. However, the roles and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of AVP in the DG GCs have not been determined. We addressed this question by recording from the DG GCs in rat hippocampal slices. Our results showed that application of AVP concentration-dependently evoked an inward holding current recorded from the DG GCs. AVP depolarized the DG GCs and increased their action potential firing frequency. The excitatory effects of AVP were mediated by activation of V<SUB>1a</SUB> receptors and required the function of phospholipase C&beta; (PLC&beta;). Whereas intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and protein kinase C activity were unnecessary, PLC&beta;-induced depletion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate was involved in AVP-evoked excitation of the DG GCs. AVP excited the DG GCs by depression of the ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channels, which were required for AVP-elicited facilitation of long-term potentiation at the perforant path&ndash;GC synapses. Our results may provide a cellular and molecular mechanism to explain the physiological functions of AVP, such as learning and memory, and pathologic disorders like anxiety.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Enhancement of Motor Cortical Gamma Oscillations and Sniffing Activity by Medial Forebrain Bundle Stimulation Precedes Locomotion</a></h4>

              
                <p>The medial forebrain bundle (MFB) is a white matter pathway that traverses through mesolimbic structures and includes dopaminergic neural fibers ascending from the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Since dopaminergic signals represent hedonic responses, electrical stimulation of the MFB in animals has been used as a neural reward for operant and spatial tasks. MFB stimulation strongly motivates animals to rapidly learn to perform a variety of behavioral tasks to obtain a reward. Although the MFB is known to connect various brain regions and MFB stimulation dynamically modulates animal behavior, how central and peripheral functions are affected by MFB stimulation per se is poorly understood. To address this question, we simultaneously recorded electrocorticograms (ECoGs) in the primary motor cortex (M1), primary somatosensory cortex (S1), and olfactory bulb (OB) of behaving rats while electrically stimulating the MFB. We found that MFB stimulation increased the locomotor activity of rats. Spectral analysis confirmed that immediately after MFB stimulation, sniffing activity was facilitated and the power of gamma oscillations in the M1 was increased. After sniffing activity and motor cortical gamma oscillations were facilitated, animals started to move. These results provide insight into the importance of sniffing activity and cortical gamma oscillations for motor execution and learning facilitated by MFB stimulation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Expert opinion on the habit forming properties of laxatives in patients with constipation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Constipation is a commonly reported disorder in many patients. Constipation treatment using laxatives on a regular and long term basis can lead to patient dependence, especially among the elderly. However, there is scanty data on the habit-forming potential of laxatives in Indian constipated patients. This review has explored literature evidence and expert opinion on patients’ experience regarding habit-forming attributes of stimulant and osmotic laxatives. Additionally, structured face-to-face discussions were conducted with 2 key opinion leaders to understand their clinical experience on the habit-forming aspects stimulant and osmotic laxatives in patients with constipation. Based on literature evidence, lactulose is not known to lead to any habit-forming behaviors in patients. Furthermore, experts pointed out that dependence on stimulant laxatives is common, but not on osmotic laxatives, and emphasized that milk of magnesia is not habit forming. In conclusion, no habit-forming characteristics or dependence was observed with the use of osmotic laxatives in India. Nevertheless, real-world, studies exploring patient and physician perspectives are warranted to establish the dependence and habit forming attributes of laxatives.

                The web tool Adamant has been developed to systematically collect research metadata as early as the conception of the experiment. Adamant enables a continuous, consistent, and transparent research data management (RDM) process, which is a key element of good scientific practice ensuring the path to Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) research data. It simplifies the creation of on-demand metadata schemas and the collection of metadata according to established or new standards. The approach is based on JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) schema, where any valid schema can be presented as an interactive web-form. Furthermore, Adamant eases the integration of numerous available RDM methods and software tools into the everyday research activities of especially small independent laboratories. A programming interface allows programmatic integration with other software tools such as electronic lab books or repositories. The user interface (UI) of Adamant is designed to be as user friendly as possible. Each UI element is self-explanatory and intuitive to use, which makes it accessible for users that have little to no experience with JSON format and programming in general. Several examples of research data management workflows that can be implemented using Adamant are introduced. Adamant (client-only version) is available from: https://plasma-mds.github.io/adamant.

                The ethics of compulsive treatment (CT) is a medical, social and legal discussion that reemerged after the ratification by 181 countries of the 2007 United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD). The optional protocol of the UN-CRPD was ratified by 86 countries aiming to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights. It also determined the need to review mental health laws as under this light treatment of persons with disabilities, particularly those with mental disorders, cannot accept the use of CT. This selective review of literature aims to clarify inputs from clinical psychiatry adding evidence to the multi-disciplinary discussion. It provides contradictory evidence on how patients experience CT and its impact on their mental health and treatment programs, also which are main reasons for the use of CT and what efforts in psychiatry have been made to reduce, replace and refine it.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Suboptimal human inference can invert the bias-variance trade-off for decisions with asymmetric evidence</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tahra L. Eissa, Joshua I. Gold, Krešimir Josić, Zachary P. Kilpatrick</p>

Solutions to challenging inference problems are often subject to a fundamental trade-off between: 1) bias (being systematically wrong) that is minimized with complex inference strategies, and 2) variance (being oversensitive to uncertain observations) that is minimized with simple inference strategies. However, this trade-off is based on the assumption that the strategies being considered are optimal for their given complexity and thus has unclear relevance to forms of inference based on suboptimal strategies. We examined inference problems applied to rare, asymmetrically available evidence, which a large population of human subjects solved using a diverse set of strategies that varied in form and complexity. In general, subjects using more complex strategies tended to have lower bias and variance, but with a dependence on the form of strategy that reflected an inversion of the classic bias-variance trade-off: subjects who used more complex, but imperfect, Bayesian-like strategies tended to have lower variance but higher bias because of incorrect tuning to latent task features, whereas subjects who used simpler heuristic strategies tended to have higher variance because they operated more directly on the observed samples but lower, near-normative bias. Our results help define new principles that govern individual differences in behavior that depends on rare-event inference and, more generally, about the information-processing trade-offs that can be sensitive to not just the complexity, but also the optimality, of the inference process.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modulation transfer functions for audiovisual speech</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nicolai F. Pedersen, Torsten Dau, Lars Kai Hansen, Jens Hjortkjær</p>

Temporal synchrony between facial motion and acoustic modulations is a hallmark feature of audiovisual speech. The moving face and mouth during natural speech is known to be correlated with low-frequency acoustic envelope fluctuations (below 10 Hz), but the precise rates at which envelope information is synchronized with motion in different parts of the face are less clear. Here, we used regularized canonical correlation analysis (rCCA) to learn speech envelope filters whose outputs correlate with motion in different parts of the speakers face. We leveraged recent advances in video-based 3D facial landmark estimation allowing us to examine statistical envelope-face correlations across a large number of speakers (∼4000). Specifically, rCCA was used to learn modulation transfer functions (MTFs) for the speech envelope that significantly predict correlation with facial motion across different speakers. The AV analysis revealed bandpass speech envelope filters at distinct temporal scales. A first set of MTFs showed peaks around 3-4 Hz and were correlated with mouth movements. A second set of MTFs captured envelope fluctuations in the 1-2 Hz range correlated with more global face and head motion. These two distinctive timescales emerged only as a property of natural AV speech statistics across many speakers. A similar analysis of fewer speakers performing a controlled speech task highlighted only the well-known temporal modulations around 4 Hz correlated with orofacial motion. The different bandpass ranges of AV correlation align notably with the average rates at which syllables (3-4 Hz) and phrases (1-2 Hz) are produced in natural speech. Whereas periodicities at the syllable rate are evident in the envelope spectrum of the speech signal itself, slower 1-2 Hz regularities thus only become prominent when considering crossmodal signal statistics. This may indicate a motor origin of temporal regularities at the timescales of syllables and phrases in natural speech.

Exceptions to Mendel’s law of segregation were important for demonstrating that chromosomes carry genetic material. Scrutiny of additional exceptions to Mendel’s law caused by selfish genes has the potential to unravel other unsolved mysteries of genetics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Sheltering of deleterious mutations explains the stepwise extension of recombination suppression on sex chromosomes and other supergenes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Paul Jay, Emilie Tezenas, Amandine Véber, Tatiana Giraud</p>

Many organisms have sex chromosomes with large nonrecombining regions that have expanded stepwise, generating “evolutionary strata” of differentiation. The reasons for this remain poorly understood, but the principal hypotheses proposed to date are based on antagonistic selection due to differences between sexes. However, it has proved difficult to obtain empirical evidence of a role for sexually antagonistic selection in extending recombination suppression, and antagonistic selection has been shown to be unlikely to account for the evolutionary strata observed on fungal mating-type chromosomes. We show here, by mathematical modeling and stochastic simulation, that recombination suppression on sex chromosomes and around supergenes can expand under a wide range of parameter values simply because it shelters recessive deleterious mutations, which are ubiquitous in genomes. Permanently heterozygous alleles, such as the male-determining allele in XY systems, protect linked chromosomal inversions against the expression of their recessive mutation load, leading to the successive accumulation of inversions around these alleles without antagonistic selection. Similar results were obtained with models assuming recombination-suppressing mechanisms other than chromosomal inversions and for supergenes other than sex chromosomes, including those without XY-like asymmetry, such as fungal mating-type chromosomes. However, inversions capturing a permanently heterozygous allele were found to be less likely to spread when the mutation load segregating in populations was lower (e.g., under large effective population sizes or low mutation rates). This may explain why sex chromosomes remain homomorphic in some organisms but are highly divergent in others. Here, we model a simple and testable hypothesis explaining the stepwise extensions of recombination suppression on sex chromosomes, mating-type chromosomes, and supergenes in general.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Alternative splicing of METTL3 explains apparently METTL3-independent m6A modifications in mRNA</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hui Xian Poh, Aashiq H. Mirza, Brian F. Pickering, Samie R. Jaffrey</p>

<i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is a highly prevalent mRNA modification that promotes degradation of transcripts encoding proteins that have roles in cell development, differentiation, and other pathways. METTL3 is the major methyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of m<sup>6</sup>A in mRNA. As 30% to 80% of m<sup>6</sup>A can remain in mRNA after METTL3 depletion by CRISPR/Cas9-based methods, other enzymes are thought to catalyze a sizable fraction of m<sup>6</sup>A. Here, we reexamined the source of m<sup>6</sup>A in the mRNA transcriptome. We characterized mouse embryonic stem cell lines that continue to have m<sup>6</sup>A in their mRNA after <i>Mettl3</i> knockout. We show that these cells express alternatively spliced <i>Mettl3</i> transcript isoforms that bypass the CRISPR/Cas9 mutations and produce functionally active methyltransferases. We similarly show that other reported <i>METTL3</i> knockout cell lines express altered METTL3 proteins. We find that gene dependency datasets show that most cell lines fail to proliferate after <i>METTL3</i> deletion, suggesting that reported <i>METTL3</i> knockout cell lines express altered METTL3 proteins rather than have full knockout. Finally, we reassessed METTL3’s role in synthesizing m<sup>6</sup>A using an exon 4 deletion of <i>Mettl3</i> and found that METTL3 is responsible for >95% of m<sup>6</sup>A in mRNA. Overall, these studies suggest that METTL3 is responsible for the vast majority of m<sup>6</sup>A in the transcriptome, and that remaining m<sup>6</sup>A in putative <i>METTL3</i> knockout cell lines is due to the expression of altered but functional METTL3 isoforms.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Gut microbiota in monozygotic twins discordant for Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>Differences in gut microbiota between Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and controls seem to depend on multiple – frequently unmeasured – confounders. Monozygotic twins offer a unique model for controlling several factors responsible for interpersonal variation in gut microbiota.</p>
<p>Fecal samples from 20 monozygotic twin pairs (N=40) discordant for PD were studied (metagenomic shotgun analysis). Paired-data analysis detected minimal differences in bacterial taxa abundance at species level (<i>Bacteroides pectinophilus</i> [P=0.037], <i>Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum</i> [P=0.050] and <i>Bifidobacterium catenulatum</i> [P=0.025]) and in predicted metabolic pathways (<i>primary bile acid biosynthesis</i> [P=0.037]).</p>
<p>Additional studies are warranted to understand the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of PD.</p>
