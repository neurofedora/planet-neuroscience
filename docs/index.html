              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10904">Hybrid Brain-Machine Interface: Integrating EEG and EMG for Reduced Physical Demand</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.10904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hybrid brain-machine interface (BMI) that integrates steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP)-based EEG and facial EMG to improve multimodal control and mitigate fatigue in assistive applications. Traditional BMIs relying solely on EEG or EMG suffer from inherent limitations; EEG-based control requires sustained visual focus, leading to cognitive fatigue, while EMG-based control induces muscular fatigue over time. Our system dynamically alternates between EEG and EMG inputs, using EEG to detect SSVEP signals at 9.75 Hz and 14.25 Hz and EMG from cheek and neck muscles to optimize control based on task demands. In a virtual turtle navigation task, the hybrid system achieved task completion times comparable to an EMG-only approach, while 90% of users reported reduced or equal physical demand. These findings demonstrate that multimodal BMI systems can enhance usability, reduce strain, and improve long-term adherence in assistive technologies.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10946">Emergent functions of noise-driven spontaneous activity: Homeostatic maintenance of criticality and memory consolidation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.10946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike digital computers, the brain exhibits spontaneous activity even during complete rest, despite the evolutionary pressure for energy efficiency. Inspired by the critical brain hypothesis, which proposes that the brain operates optimally near a critical point of phase transition in the dynamics of neural networks to improve computational efficiency, we postulate that spontaneous activity plays a homeostatic role in the development and maintenance of criticality. Criticality in the brain is associated with the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs (EI balance), which is essential for maintaining neural computation performance. Here, we hypothesize that both criticality and EI balance are stabilized by appropriate noise levels and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) windows. Using spiking neural network (SNN) simulations and in vitro experiments with dissociated neuronal cultures, we demonstrated that while repetitive stimuli transiently disrupt both criticality and EI balance, spontaneous activity can develop and maintain these properties and prolong the fading memory of past stimuli. Our findings suggest that the brain may achieve self-optimization and memory consolidation as emergent functions of noise-driven spontaneous activity. This noise-harnessing mechanism provides insights for designing energy-efficient neural networks, and may explain the critical function of sleep in maintaining homeostasis and consolidating memory.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11105">Graceful forgetting: Memory as a process</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.11105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rational theory of memory is proposed to explain how we can accommodate unbounded sensory input within bounded storage space. Memory is stored as statistics, organized into complex structures that are constantly summarized and compressed to make room for new input. This process, driven by space constraints, is guided by heuristics that optimize the memory for future needs. Sensory input is rapidly encoded as simple statistics that are more slowly elaborated into more abstract constructs. This theory differs from previous accounts of memory by (a) its reliance on statistics, (b) its use of heuristics to guide the choice of statistics, and (c) the emphasis on memory as a process that is intensive, complex, and expensive. The theory is intended as an aid to make sense of our extensive knowledge of memory, and bring us closer to an understanding of memory in functional and mechanistic terms.

                arXiv:2502.11395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves neurodegeneration, metabolic dysfunction, and proteostasis failure. While amyloid and tau pathology are well studied, the role of metabolic dysregulation as an upstream driver remains unclear.
  METHODS:We used Drosophila AD models expressing APP and BACE1 under the neuron-specific driver, applying quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) to analyze C99-induced proteomic changes and metabolic disruption. Additional biochemical and imaging analyses were performed to assess mitochondrial function and autophagy.
  RESULTS: C99 disrupted mitochondrial proteostasis, impairing TCA cycle enzymes, fatty acid oxidation, and lysosomal clearance. Immunoprecipitation confirmed C99's interaction with proteostasis regulators, leading to neurodegenerative stress.
  DISCUSSION: Our findings extend previous models of AD pathogenesis by demonstrating that C99 impairs lipid metabolism, disrupting ketone availability and neuronal energy balance.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11591">Morphological Neuron Classification Using Machine Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.11591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classification and quantitative characterization of neuronal morphologies from histological neuronal reconstruction is challenging since it is still unclear how to delineate a neuronal cell class and which are the best features to define them by. The morphological neuron characterization represents a primary source to address anatomical comparisons, morphometric analysis of cells, or brain modeling. The objectives of this paper are (i) to develop and integrate a pipeline that goes from morphological feature extraction to classification and (ii) to assess and compare the accuracy of machine learning algorithms to classify neuron morphologies. The algorithms were trained on 430 digitally reconstructed neurons subjectively classified into layers and/or m-types using young and/or adult development state population of the somatosensory cortex in rats. For supervised algorithms, linear discriminant analysis provided better classification results in comparison with others. For unsupervised algorithms, the affinity propagation and the Ward algorithms provided slightly better results.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11597">Automatic target validation based on neuroscientific literature mining for tractography</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.11597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Target identification for tractography studies requires solid anatomical knowledge validated by an extensive literature review across species for each seed structure to be studied. Manual literature review to identify targets for a given seed region is tedious and potentially subjective. Therefore, complementary approaches would be useful. We propose to use text-mining models to automatically suggest potential targets from the neuroscientific literature, full-text articles and abstracts, so that they can be used for anatomical connection studies and more specifically for tractography. We applied text-mining models to three structures: two well-studied structures, since validated deep brain stimulation targets, the internal globus pallidus and the subthalamic nucleus and, the nucleus accumbens, an exploratory target for treating psychiatric disorders. We performed a systematic review of the literature to document the projections of the three selected structures and compared it with the targets proposed by text-mining models, both in rat and primate (including human). We ran probabilistic tractography on the nucleus accumbens and compared the output with the results of the text-mining models and literature review. Overall, text-mining the literature could find three times as many targets as two man-weeks of curation could. The overall efficiency of the text-mining against literature review in our study was 98% recall (at 36% precision), meaning that over all the targets for the three selected seeds, only one target has been missed by text-mining. We demonstrate that connectivity for a structure of interest can be extracted from a very large amount of publications and abstracts. We believe this tool will be useful in helping the neuroscience community to facilitate connectivity studies of particular brain regions. The text mining tools used for the study are part of the HBP Neuroinformatics Platform, publicly available at http://connectivity-brainer.rhcloud.com

                arXiv:2502.12092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural signals related to movement can be measured from intracranial recordings and used in brain-machine interface devices (BMI) to restore physical function in impaired patients. In this study, we explore the use of more abstract neural signals related to economic value in a BMI context. Using data collected from the orbitofrontal cortex in non-human primates, we develop deep learning-based neural decoders that can predict the monkey's choice in a value-based decision-making task. Out-of-sample performance was improved by augmenting the training set with synthesized data, showing the feasibility of using limited training data. We further demonstrate that we can predict the monkey's choice sooner using a neural forecasting module that is equipped with task-related information. These findings support the feasibility of user preference-informed neuroengineering devices that leverage abstract cognitive signals.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12106">Personal Danger Signals Reprocessing: New Online Group Intervention for Chronic Pain</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.12106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chronic pain is a significant global health issue, with many patients experiencing persistent pain despite no identifiable organic cause, classified as nociplastic pain. Increasing evidence highlights the role of danger signal processing in the maintenance of chronic pain. In response, we developed Personal Danger Signals Reprocessing (PDSR), an online, group-based intervention designed to modify these mechanisms using coaching techniques to enhance accessibility and affordability.
  This study evaluated the efficacy of PDSR in reducing pain and mental health comorbidities. A cohort of women (N=19, mean age 43) participated in an 8-week online program, receiving weekly sessions on chronic pain mechanisms within a systemic framework. Outcomes were assessed at three time points: pre-intervention, mid-intervention, and post-intervention. A waiting list group (N=20, mean age 43.5) completed assessments at the same intervals.
  Participants in the PDSR group showed significant pain reduction (p < .001), with moderate to large effects observed at mid-intervention (Cohen's D = 0.7) and post-intervention (Cohen's D = 1.5) compared to controls. Pain interference significantly decreased (p < .01), with large reductions in the PDSR group (Cohen's D = -1.7, p < .0001). Well-being also improved substantially (p < .001, Cohen's D = 1.7-1.8). Secondary outcomes, including pain catastrophizing, sleep interference, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, consistently improved (all p-values < .01).
  Findings suggest PDSR is an effective, scalable intervention for reducing pain, improving function, and enhancing well-being in individuals with chronic pain.

                arXiv:2502.10955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention is fundamental to both biological and artificial intelligence, yet research on animal attention and AI self attention remains largely disconnected. We propose a Recurrent Vision Transformer (Recurrent ViT) that integrates self-attention with recurrent memory, allowing both current inputs and stored information to guide attention allocation. Trained solely via sparse reward feedback on a spatially cued orientation change detection task, a paradigm used in primate studies, our model exhibits primate like signatures of attention, including improved accuracy and faster responses for cued stimuli that scale with cue validity. Analysis of self-attention maps reveals dynamic spatial prioritization with reactivation prior to expected changes, and targeted perturbations produce performance shifts similar to those observed in primate frontal eye fields and superior colliculus. These findings demonstrate that incorporating recurrent feedback into self attention can capture key aspects of primate visual attention.

While much is known about how we explain contingent truths, we understand less about how we explain facts, such as those in mathematics, that are true as a matter of logical necessity. We present a framework, based in computational complexity, where explanations for deductive truths co-emerge with discoveries of simplifying steps during the search process. When such structures are missing, we revert, in turn, to error-based reasons, where a (corrected) mistake can serve as fictitious, but explanatory, contingency-cause: not making the mistake serves as a reason why the truth takes the form it does. We simulate human subjects, using GPT-4o, presented with SAT puzzles of varying complexity and reasonableness, validating our theory and showing how its predictions can be tested in future human studies.

                arXiv:2402.14186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning is easy; representation is hard. Representation and simulation are two sides of the same coin. How are the external environment, internal states, and the mind of a person represented by the brain based on a simple Hebbian learning principle? Conceptually similar to the cloning of DNA for genetics, we suggest a bootstrapping-based constructive framework for representation learning via neural simulation. The key insight is to understand how the evolution of the brain drives the repurposing of old structures for new applications via alternating between temporal exploitation and spatial exploration. For temporal exploitation, a simple dopamine-based reinforcement learning algorithm offers a principled solution to the credit assignment problem and its variations in space and time. For spatial exploration, new structures are invented to generate more powerful representations of the agent's external environment and internal state by neural simulation. Unlike Monte Carlo simulation, the neural simulation uses delta measures as the seed and implements four levels of predictive processing by the neocortex via bootstrapping, including integral transform (fast thinking), conditional sampling (slow thinking), latent quantization (abstract thinking), and flow maximization (social thinking). From reptiles and mammals to primates and humans, our simulation-based framework offers a unified perspective for understanding the evolution of natural intelligence.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07269">The geometry of efficient codes: how rate-distortion trade-offs distort the latent representations of generative models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2406.07269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Living organisms rely on internal models of the world to act adaptively. These models, because of resource limitations, cannot encode every detail and hence need to compress information. From a cognitive standpoint, information compression can manifest as a distortion of latent representations, resulting in the emergence of representations that may not accurately reflect the external world or its geometry. Rate-distortion theory formalizes the optimal way to compress information while minimizing such distortions, by considering factors such as capacity limitations, the frequency and the utility of stimuli. However, while this theory explains why the above factors distort latent representations, it does not specify which specific distortions they produce. To address this question, here we investigate how rate-distortion trade-offs shape the latent representations of images in generative models, specifically Beta Variational Autoencoders ($\beta$-VAEs), under varying constraints of model capacity, data distributions, and task objectives. By systematically exploring these factors, we identify three primary distortions in latent representations: prototypization, specialization, and orthogonalization. These distortions emerge as signatures of information compression, reflecting the model's adaptation to capacity limitations, data imbalances, and task demands. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that these distortions can coexist, giving rise to a rich landscape of latent spaces, whose geometry could differ significantly across generative models subject to different constraints. Our findings contribute to explain how the normative constraints of rate-distortion theory shape the geometry of latent representations of generative models of artificial systems and living organisms.

Abstract: Animals flexibly change their behavior depending on context. It is reported that the hippocampus is one of the most prominent regions for contextual behaviors, and its sequential activity shows context dependency. However, how such context-dependent sequential activity is established through reorganization of neuronal activity (remapping) is unclear. To better understand the formation of hippocampal activity and its contribution to context-dependent flexible behavior, we present a novel biologically plausible reinforcement learning model. In this model, a context-selection module promotes the formation of context-dependent sequential activity and allows for flexible switching of behavior in multiple contexts. This model reproduces a variety of findings from neural activity, optogenetic inactivation, human fMRI, and clinical research. Furthermore, our model predicts that imbalances in the ratio between sensory and contextual inputs in the context-selection module account for schizophrenia (SZ) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-like behaviors.

Abstract: Today's computer vision models achieve human or near-human level performance across a wide variety of vision tasks. However, their architectures, data, and learning algorithms differ in numerous ways from those that give rise to human vision. In this paper, we investigate the factors that affect the alignment between the representations learned by neural networks and human mental representations inferred from behavioral responses. We find that model scale and architecture have essentially no effect on the alignment with human behavioral responses, whereas the training dataset and objective function both have a much larger impact. These findings are consistent across three datasets of human similarity judgments collected using two different tasks. Linear transformations of neural network representations learned from behavioral responses from one dataset substantially improve alignment with human similarity judgments on the other two datasets. In addition, we find that some human concepts such as food and animals are well-represented by neural networks whereas others such as royal or sports-related objects are not. Overall, although models trained on larger, more diverse datasets achieve better alignment with humans than models trained on ImageNet alone, our results indicate that scaling alone is unlikely to be sufficient to train neural networks with conceptual representations that match those used by humans.

Abstract: Apart from what (little) OpenAI may be concealing from us, we all know (roughly) how ChatGPT works (its huge text database, its statistics, its vector representations, and their huge number of parameters, its next-word training, and so on). But none of us can say (hand on heart) that we are not surprised by what ChatGPT has proved to be able to do with these resources. This has even driven some of us to conclude that ChatGPT actually understands. It is not true that it understands. But it is also not true that we understand how it can do what it can do. I will suggest some hunches about benign biases: convergent constraints that emerge at LLM scale that may be helping ChatGPT do so much better than we would have expected. These biases are inherent in the nature of language itself, at LLM scale, and they are closely linked to what it is that ChatGPT lacks, which is direct sensorimotor grounding to connect its words to their referents and its propositions to their meanings. These convergent biases are related to (1) the parasitism of indirect verbal grounding on direct sensorimotor grounding, (2) the circularity of verbal definition, (3) the mirroring of language production and comprehension, (4) iconicity in propositions at LLM scale, (5) computational counterparts of human categorical perception in category learning by neural nets, and perhaps also (6) a conjecture by Chomsky about the laws of thought. The exposition will be in the form of a dialogue with ChatGPT-4.

Abstract: Conservation is a critical milestone of cognitive development considered to be supported by both the understanding of quantitative concepts and the reversibility of operations. To assess whether this critical component of human intelligence has emerged in Vision Language Models, we have curated the ConserveBench, a battery of 365 cognitive experiments across four dimensions of physical quantities: volume, solid quantity, length, and number. The former two involve transformational tasks which require reversibility understanding. The latter two involve non-transformational tasks which assess quantity understanding. Surprisingly, we find that while Vision Language Models are generally good at transformational tasks, they tend to fail at non-transformational tasks. There is a dissociation between understanding the reversibility of operations and understanding of quantity, which both are believed to be the cornerstones of the understanding of law of conservation in humans. $\href{https://growing-ai-like-a-child.github.io/pages/Conservation/}{Website}$

                arXiv:2412.03210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human vision models are at the core of image processing. For instance, classical approaches to the problem of image quality are based on models that include knowledge about human vision. However, nowadays, deep learning approaches have obtained competitive results by simply approaching this problem as regression of human decisions, and training an standard network on human-rated datasets. These approaches have the advantages of being easily adaptable to a particular problem and they fit very efficiently when data is available. However, mainly due to the excess of parameters, they have the problems of lack of interpretability, and over-fitting. Here we propose a vision model that combines the best of both worlds by using a parametric neural network architecture. We parameterize the layers to have bioplausible functionality, and provide a set of bioplausible parameters. We analyzed different versions of the model and compared it with the non-parametric version. The parametric models achieve a three orders of magnitude reduction in the number of parameters without suffering in regression performance. Furthermore, we show that the parametric models behave better during training and are easier to interpret as vision models. Interestingly, we find that, even initialized with bioplausible trained for regression using human rated datasets, which we call the feature-spreading problem. This suggests that the deep learning approach is inherently flawed, and emphasizes the need to evaluate and train models beyond regression.

                arXiv:2412.07236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique to measure and record brain electrical activity, widely used in various BCI and healthcare applications. Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/wjq-learning/CBraMod.

Abstract: Writing is a cognitively demanding task involving continuous decision-making, heavy use of working memory, and frequent switching between multiple activities. Scholarly writing is particularly complex as it requires authors to coordinate many pieces of multiform knowledge. To fully understand writers' cognitive thought process, one should fully decode the end-to-end writing data (from individual ideas to final manuscript) and understand their complex cognitive mechanisms in scholarly writing. We introduce ScholaWrite dataset, a first-of-its-kind keystroke corpus of an end-to-end scholarly writing process for complete manuscripts, with thorough annotations of cognitive writing intentions behind each keystroke. Our dataset includes LaTeX-based keystroke data from five preprints with nearly 62K total text changes and annotations across 4 months of paper writing. ScholaWrite shows promising usability and applications (e.g., iterative self-writing), demonstrating the importance of collection of end-to-end writing data, rather than the final manuscript, for the development of future writing assistants to support the cognitive thinking process of scientists. Our de-identified data examples and code are available on our project page.

                arXiv:2502.10425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests a universal, modality-independent reality representation behind different data modalities. Inspired by this, we view each neuron as a system and detect its multi-segment activity data under various peripheral conditions. We assume there's a time-invariant representation for the same neuron, reflecting its intrinsic properties like molecular profiles, location, and morphology. The goal of obtaining these intrinsic neuronal representations has two criteria: (I) segments from the same neuron should have more similar representations than those from different neurons; (II) the representations must generalize well to out-of-domain data. To meet these, we propose the NeurPIR (Neuron Platonic Intrinsic Representation) framework. It uses contrastive learning, with segments from the same neuron as positive pairs and those from different neurons as negative pairs. In implementation, we use VICReg, which focuses on positive pairs and separates dissimilar samples via regularization. We tested our method on Izhikevich model-simulated neuronal population dynamics data. The results accurately identified neuron types based on preset hyperparameters. We also applied it to two real-world neuron dynamics datasets with neuron type annotations from spatial transcriptomics and neuron locations. Our model's learned representations accurately predicted neuron types and locations and were robust on out-of-domain data (from unseen animals). This shows the potential of our approach for understanding neuronal systems and future neuroscience research.

Most leading ventral stream models are derived by optimizing networks for object categorization, which seems to imply that the ventral stream is also derived under such an objective. Here, we explore an alternative hypothesis: Might the ventral stream be optimized for estimating spatial latents? And a closely related question: How different -- if at all -- are representations learned from spatial latent estimation compared to categorization? To ask these questions, we leveraged synthetic image datasets generated by a 3D graphic engine and trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to estimate different combinations of spatial and category latents. We found that models trained to estimate just a few spatial latents achieve neural alignment scores comparable to those trained on hundreds of categories, and the spatial latent performance of models strongly correlates with their neural alignment. Spatial latent and category-trained models have very similar -- but not identical -- internal representations, especially in their early and middle layers. We provide evidence that this convergence is partly driven by non-target latent variability in the training data, which facilitates the implicit learning of representations of those non-target latents. Taken together, these results suggest that many training objectives, such as spatial latents, can lead to similar models aligned neurally with the ventral stream. Thus, one should not assume that the ventral stream is optimized for object categorization only. As a field, we need to continue to sharpen our measures of comparing models to brains to better understand the functional roles of the ventral stream.

                arXiv:2502.10414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous studies, we introduced a neural network framework based on symmetric differential equations, along with one of its training methods. In this article, we present another training approach for this neural network. This method leverages backward signal propagation and eliminates reliance on the traditional chain derivative rule, offering a high degree of biological interpretability. Unlike the previously introduced method, this approach does not require adjustments to the fixed points of the differential equations. Instead, it focuses solely on modifying the connection coefficients between neurons, closely resembling the training process of traditional multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks. By adopting a suitable adjustment strategy, this method effectively avoids certain potential local minima. To validate this approach, we tested it on the MNIST dataset and achieved promising results. Through further analysis, we identified certain limitations of the current neural network architecture and proposed measures for improvement.

                arXiv:2502.10418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms that learn black-box predictive models (which cannot be directly interpreted) are increasingly used to make predictions affecting the lives of people. It is important that users understand the predictions of such models, particularly when the model outputs a negative prediction for the user (e.g. denying a loan). Counterfactual explanations provide users with guidance on how to change some of their characteristics to receive a different, positive classification by a predictive model. For example, if a predictive model rejected a loan application from a user, a counterfactual explanation might state: If your salary was {\pounds}50,000 (rather than your current {\pounds}35,000), then your loan would be approved. This paper proposes two novel contributions: (a) a novel multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) for counterfactual generation based on lexicographic optimisation, rather than the more popular Pareto dominance approach; and (b) an extension to the definition of the objective of validity for a counterfactual, based on measuring the resilience of a counterfactual to violations of monotonicity constraints which are intuitively expected by users; e.g., intuitively, the probability of a loan application to be approved would monotonically increase with an increase in the salary of the applicant. Experiments involving 15 experimental settings (3 types of black box models times 5 datasets) have shown that the proposed lexicographic optimisation-based EA is very competitive with an existing Pareto dominance-based EA; and the proposed extension of the validity objective has led to a substantial increase in the validity of the counterfactuals generated by the proposed EA.

                arXiv:2502.10419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of Federated Learning (FL), Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), and edge-cloud computing enables distributed and real- time data processing while preserving privacy across edge devices and cloud infrastructure. However, the deployment of MLLMs in FL environments with resource-constrained edge devices presents significant challenges, in- cluding resource management, communication overhead, and non-IID data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid framework wherein MLLMs are deployed on edge devices equipped with sufficient resources and battery life, while the majority of training occurs in the cloud. To identify suitable edge devices for deployment, we employ Particle Swarm Optimiza- tion (PSO), and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is utilized to optimize the transmission of model updates between edge and cloud nodes. This proposed swarm intelligence-based framework aims to enhance the efficiency of MLLM training by conducting extensive training in the cloud and fine-tuning at the edge, thereby reducing energy consumption and communication costs. Our experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves system performance, achieving an accuracy of 92%, reducing communica- tion cost by 30%, and enhancing client participation compared to traditional FL methods. These results make the proposed approach highly suitable for large-scale edge-cloud computing systems.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) mimic biological brain activity, processing data efficiently through an event-driven design, wherein the neurons activate only when inputs exceed specific thresholds. Their ability to track voltage changes over time via membrane potential dynamics helps retain temporal information. This study combines SNNs with PyTorch's adaptable framework, snnTorch, to test their potential for image-based tasks. We introduce DRiVE, a vehicle detection model that uses spiking neuron dynamics to classify images, achieving 94.8% accuracy and a near-perfect 0.99 AUC score. These results highlight DRiVE's ability to distinguish vehicle classes effectively, challenging the notion that SNNs are limited to temporal data. As interest grows in energy-efficient neural models, DRiVE's success emphasizes the need to refine SNN optimization for visual tasks. This work encourages broader exploration of SNNs in scenarios where conventional networks struggle, particularly for real-world applications requiring both precision and efficiency.

                arXiv:2502.10422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are valued for their ability to process spatio-temporal information efficiently, offering biological plausibility, low energy consumption, and compatibility with neuromorphic hardware. However, the commonly used Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model overlooks neuron heterogeneity and independently processes spatial and temporal information, limiting the expressive power of SNNs. In this paper, we propose the Dual Adaptive Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (DA-LIF) model, which introduces spatial and temporal tuning with independently learnable decays. Evaluations on both static (CIFAR10/100, ImageNet) and neuromorphic datasets (CIFAR10-DVS, DVS128 Gesture) demonstrate superior accuracy with fewer timesteps compared to state-of-the-art methods. Importantly, DA-LIF achieves these improvements with minimal additional parameters, maintaining low energy consumption. Extensive ablation studies further highlight the robustness and effectiveness of the DA-LIF model.

                arXiv:2502.10423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature discrimination is a crucial aspect of neural network design, as it directly impacts the network's ability to distinguish between classes and generalize across diverse datasets. The accomplishment of achieving high-quality feature representations ensures high intra-class separability and poses one of the most challenging research directions. While conventional deep neural networks (DNNs) rely on complex transformations and very deep networks to come up with meaningful feature representations, they usually require days of training and consume significant energy amounts. To this end, spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative. SNN's ability to capture temporal and spatial dependencies renders them particularly suitable for complex tasks, where multi-modal data are required. In this paper, we propose a feature discrimination approach for multi-modal learning with SNNs, focusing on audio-visual data. We employ deep spiking residual learning for visual modality processing and a simpler yet efficient spiking network for auditory modality processing. Lastly, we deploy a spiking multilayer perceptron for modality fusion. We present our findings and evaluate our approach against similar works in the field of classification challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work investigating feature discrimination in SNNs.

Abstract: Effective search methods are crucial for improving the performance of deep generative models at test time. In this paper, we introduce a novel test-time search method, Neural Genetic Search (NGS), which incorporates the evolutionary mechanism of genetic algorithms into the generation procedure of deep models. The core idea behind NGS is its crossover, which is defined as parent-conditioned generation using trained generative models. This approach offers a versatile and easy-to-implement search algorithm for deep generative models. We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of NGS through experiments across three distinct domains: routing problems, adversarial prompt generation for language models, and molecular design.

                arXiv:2502.10470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a cornerstone in the Evolutionary Computation (EC) domain, Differential Evolution (DE) is known for its simplicity and effectiveness in handling challenging black-box optimization problems. While the advantages of DE are well-recognized, achieving peak performance heavily depends on its hyperparameters such as the mutation factor, crossover probability, and the selection of specific DE strategies. Traditional approaches to this hyperparameter dilemma have leaned towards parameter tuning or adaptive mechanisms. However, identifying the optimal settings tailored for specific problems remains a persistent challenge. In response, we introduce MetaDE, an approach that evolves DE's intrinsic hyperparameters and strategies using DE itself at a meta-level. A pivotal aspect of MetaDE is a specialized parameterization technique, which endows it with the capability to dynamically modify DE's parameters and strategies throughout the evolutionary process. To augment computational efficiency, MetaDE incorporates a design that leverages parallel processing through a GPU-accelerated computing framework. Within such a framework, DE is not just a solver but also an optimizer for its own configurations, thus streamlining the process of hyperparameter optimization and problem-solving into a cohesive and automated workflow. Extensive evaluations on the CEC2022 benchmark suite demonstrate MetaDE's promising performance. Moreover, when applied to robot control via evolutionary reinforcement learning, MetaDE also demonstrates promising performance. The source code of MetaDE is publicly accessible at: https://github.com/EMI-Group/metade.

                arXiv:2502.11141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has suggested that the brain is more shallow than previously thought, challenging the traditionally assumed hierarchical structure of the ventral visual pathway. Here, we demonstrate that optimizing convolutional network architectures for brain-alignment via evolutionary neural architecture search results in models with clear representational hierarchies. Despite having random weights, the identified models achieve brain-alignment scores surpassing even those of pretrained classification models - as measured by both regression and representational similarity analysis. Furthermore, through traditional supervised training, architectures optimized for alignment with late ventral regions become competitive classification models. These findings suggest that hierarchical structure is a fundamental mechanism of primate visual processing. Finally, this work demonstrates the potential of neural architecture search as a framework for computational cognitive neuroscience research that could reduce the field's reliance on manually designed convolutional networks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11225">METAFOR: A Hybrid Metaheuristics Software Framework for Single-Objective Continuous Optimization Problems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.11225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid metaheuristics are powerful techniques for solving difficult optimization problems that exploit the strengths of different approaches in a single implementation. For algorithm designers, however, creating hybrid metaheuristic implementations has become increasingly challenging due to the vast number of design options available in the literature and the fact that they often rely on their knowledge and intuition to come up with new algorithm designs. In this paper, we propose a modular metaheuristic software framework, called METAFOR, that can be coupled with an automatic algorithm configuration tool to automatically design hybrid metaheuristics. METAFOR is specifically designed to hybridize Particle Swarm Optimization, Differential Evolution and Covariance Matrix Adaptation-Evolution Strategy, and includes a local search module that allows their execution to be interleaved with a subordinate local search. We use the configuration tool irace to automatically generate 17 different metaheuristic implementations and evaluate their performance on a diverse set of continuous optimization problems. Our results show that, across all the considered problem classes, automatically generated hybrid implementations are able to outperform configured single-approach implementations, while these latter offer advantages on specific classes of functions. We provide useful insights on the type of hybridization that works best for specific problem classes, the algorithm components that contribute to the performance of the algorithms, and the advantages and disadvantages of two well-known instance separation strategies, creating stratified training set using a fix percentage and leave-one-class-out cross-validation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10699">Exploring Synaptic Resonance in Large Language Models: A Novel Approach to Contextual Memory Integration</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.10699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contextual memory integration remains a high challenge in the development of language models, particularly in tasks that require maintaining coherence over extended sequences. Traditional approaches, such as self-attention mechanisms and memory-augmented architectures, often prioritize short-term dependencies, leading to fragmentation and inconsistency in long-range contextual understanding. Inspired by principles of synaptic plasticity observed in biological neural systems, a novel mechanism, Synaptic Resonance, is introduced to dynamically reinforce relevant memory pathways during training and inference. Unlike static memory representations, this mechanism continuously adjusts synaptic weight matrices based on contextual relevance, allowing for improved information retention without excessive computational overhead. Evaluations conducted on an open-source language model demonstrate reductions in perplexity, enhancements in contextual coherence, and increased robustness against input noise, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven memory modulation. Comparative analysis against baseline models further reveals that the proposed approach achieves higher memory retention efficiency while maintaining computational feasibility. The architectural modifications integrate seamlessly into existing transformer-based frameworks, ensuring stable convergence and efficient inference without sacrificing scalability. Applications benefiting from improved long-term contextual consistency, such as dialogue systems and document summarization, stand to gain from this approach. Empirical findings suggest that dynamically reinforced memory pathways offer a promising alternative to conventional memory mechanisms, addressing longstanding limitations in extended sequence modeling.

Abstract: We formalize a novel modeling framework for achieving interpretability in deep learning, anchored in the principle of inference equivariance. While the direct verification of interpretability scales exponentially with the number of variables of the system, we show that this complexity can be mitigated by treating interpretability as a Markovian property and employing neural re-parametrization techniques. Building on these insights, we propose a new modeling paradigm -- neural generation and interpretable execution -- that enables scalable verification of equivariance. This paradigm provides a general approach for designing Neural Interpretable Reasoners that are not only expressive but also transparent.

                arXiv:2502.12012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms, such as the Recursive Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (RQAOA), have become increasingly popular, offering promising avenues for employing Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices to address challenging combinatorial optimization tasks like the maximum cut problem. In this study, we utilize an evolutionary algorithm equipped with a unique fitness function. This approach targets hard maximum cut instances within the latent space of a Graph Autoencoder, identifying those that pose significant challenges or are particularly tractable for RQAOA, in contrast to the classic Goemans and Williamson algorithm. Our findings not only delineate the distinct capabilities and limitations of each algorithm but also expand our understanding of RQAOA's operational limits. Furthermore, the diverse set of graphs we have generated serves as a crucial benchmarking asset, emphasizing the need for more advanced algorithms to tackle combinatorial optimization challenges. Additionally, our results pave the way for new avenues in graph generation research, offering exciting opportunities for future explorations.

                arXiv:2502.12020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical information processors can learn from examples if they are modified according to an abstract parameter update equation, termed a learning rule. We introduce a physical model for self-learning that encodes the learning rule in the Hamiltonian of the system. The model consists of a network of multi-modal resonators. One of the modes is driven parametrically into a bi-stable regime, forming a coherent Ising machine (CIM) -- that provides the long-term memory that stores learned responses (weights). The CIM is augmented with an additional spinor field that acts as short-term (activation) memory. We numerically demonstrate that, in the presence of suitable nonlinear interactions between the long-term memory Ising machine and the short-term memory auxiliary field, the system autonomously learns from examples.

                arXiv:2306.02611v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been widely and successfully applied to solve multi-objective optimization problems, due to their nature of population-based search. Population update, a key component in multi-objective EAs (MOEAs), is usually performed in a greedy, deterministic manner. That is, the next-generation population is formed by selecting the best solutions from the current population and newly-generated solutions (irrespective of the selection criteria used such as Pareto dominance, crowdedness and indicators). In this paper, we analytically present that stochastic population update can be beneficial for the search of MOEAs. Specifically, we prove that the expected running time of two well-established MOEAs, SMS-EMOA and NSGA-II, for solving two bi-objective problems, OneJumpZeroJump and bi-objective RealRoyalRoad, can be exponentially decreased if replacing its deterministic population update mechanism by a stochastic one. Empirical studies also verify the effectiveness of the proposed population update method. This work is an attempt to show the benefit of introducing randomness into the population update of MOEAs. Its positive results, which might hold more generally, should encourage the exploration of developing new MOEAs in the area.

                arXiv:2312.08953v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The landscapes of real-world optimization problems can vary strongly depending on the application. In engineering design optimization, objective functions and constraints are often derived from governing equations, resulting in moderate multimodality. However, benchmark problems with such moderate multimodality are typically confined to low-dimensional cases, making it challenging to conduct meaningful comparisons. To address this, we present a benchmark test suite focused on the design of human-powered aircraft for single and multi-objective optimization. This test suite incorporates governing equations from aerodynamics and material mechanics, providing a realistic testing environment. It includes 60 problems across three difficulty levels, with a wing segmentation parameter to scale complexity and dimensionality. Both constrained and unconstrained versions are provided, with penalty methods applied to the unconstrained version. The test suite is computationally inexpensive while retaining key characteristics of engineering problems. Numerical experiments indicate the presence of moderate multimodality, and multi-objective problems exhibit diverse Pareto front shapes.

                arXiv:2502.03287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising bio-inspired third-generation neural networks. Recent research has trained deep SNN models with accuracy on par with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Although the event-driven and sparse nature of SNNs show potential for more energy efficient computation than ANNs, SNN neurons have internal states which evolve over time. Keeping track of SNN states can significantly increase data movement and storage requirements, potentially losing its advantages with respect to ANNs. This paper investigates the energy effects of having neuron states, and how it is influenced by the chosen mapping to realistic hardware architectures with advanced memory hierarchies. Therefore, we develop STEMS, a mapping design space exploration tool for SNNs. STEMS models SNN's stateful behavior and explores intra-layer and inter-layer mapping optimizations to minimize data movement, considering both spatial and temporal SNN dimensions. Using STEMS, we show up to 12x reduction in off-chip data movement and 5x reduction in energy (on top of intra-layer optimizations), on two event-based vision SNN benchmarks. Finally, neuron states may not be needed for all SNN layers. By optimizing neuron states for one of our benchmarks, we show 20x reduction in neuron states and 1.4x better performance without accuracy loss.

                arXiv:2306.11608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple neuromorphic applications require the tuning of two or more devices to a common signal. Various types of neuromorphic computation can be realized using spintronic oscillators, where the DC current induces magnetization precession, which turns into an AC voltage generator. However, in spintronics, synchronization of two oscillators using a DC signal is still a challenging problem because it requires a certain degree of similarity between devices that are to be synchronized, which may be difficult to achieve due to device parameter distribution during the fabrication process. In this work, we present experimental results on the mechanisms of synchronization of spin-torque oscillators. Devices are based on magnetic tunnel junction with a perpendicularly magnetized free layer and take advantage of a uniform magnetization precision in the presence of the magnetic field and a DC bias. By using an external microwave source, we show the optimal condition for the synchronization of the magnetic tunnel junctions. Finally, we present results on the in-series connection of two junctions and discuss the possible path towards improving oscillation power and linewidth. In addition, using numerical simulations of the coupled oscillators model, we aim to reproduce the conditions of the experiments and determine the tolerance for achieving synchronization.

                arXiv:2408.10013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growth rate of the GPU memory capacity has not been able to keep up with that of the size of large language models (LLMs), hindering the model training process. In particular, activations -- the intermediate tensors produced during forward propagation and reused in backward propagation -- dominate the GPU memory use. This leads to high training overhead such as high weight update cost due to the small micro-batch size. To address this challenge, we propose SSDTrain, an adaptive activation offloading framework to high-capacity NVMe SSDs. SSDTrain reduces GPU memory usage without impacting performance by fully overlapping data transfers with computation. SSDTrain is compatible with popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, Megatron, and DeepSpeed, and it employs techniques such as tensor deduplication and forwarding to further enhance efficiency. We extensively experimented with popular LLMs like GPT, BERT, and T5. Results demonstrate that SSDTrain reduces 47% of the activation peak memory usage. Meanwhile, SSDTrain perfectly overlaps the I/O with the computation and incurs negligible overhead. Compared with keeping activations in GPU memory and layerwise full recomputation, SSDTrain achieves the best memory savings with negligible throughput loss. We further analyze how the reduced activation memory use may be leveraged to increase throughput by increasing micro-batch size and reducing pipeline parallelism bubbles.

                arXiv:2410.14735v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training large language models to acquire specific skills remains a challenging endeavor. Conventional training approaches often struggle with data distribution imbalances and inadequacies in objective functions that do not align well with task-specific performance. To address these challenges, we introduce CycleQD, a novel approach that leverages the Quality Diversity framework through a cyclic adaptation of the algorithm, along with a model merging based crossover and an SVD-based mutation. In CycleQD, each task's performance metric is alternated as the quality measure while the others serve as the behavioral characteristics. This cyclic focus on individual tasks allows for concentrated effort on one task at a time, eliminating the need for data ratio tuning and simplifying the design of the objective function. Empirical results from AgentBench indicate that applying CycleQD to LLAMA3-8B-INSTRUCT based models not only enables them to surpass traditional fine-tuning methods in coding, operating systems, and database tasks, but also achieves performance on par with GPT-3.5-TURBO, which potentially contains much more parameters, across these domains. Crucially, this enhanced performance is achieved while retaining robust language capabilities, as evidenced by its performance on widely adopted language benchmark tasks. We highlight the key design choices in CycleQD, detailing how these contribute to its effectiveness. Furthermore, our method is general and can be applied to image segmentation models, highlighting its applicability across different domains.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-216/v1?src=rss">Influence of Acid Composition on Morphology and Physical Properties of Titanium Alloy  [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Surface modifications of titanium alloys used in dental implants can significantly change the implants’ micro and nano topography and composition. These alterations can lead to substantial improvements in mechanical properties, hydrophilicity, osseointegration, and antibacterial performance, as well as positively influencing osteoblast activity and bone formation processes. This paper investigates the effect of the combination of acid etching on titanium alloys’ surface morphology, roughness, and hydrophilicity. Methods A titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) disc with a diameter of 12 mm and thickness of 2 mm was sandblasted using aluminum oxide Al2O3 by particle sizes 100 μm, 250 μm, and 500 μm and followed by acid etching. Acid etching was carried out on these samples using different combinations of acid, i.e., hydrofluoric acid (HF), hydrochloric acid (HCL), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4), with the same temperature and time exposure. All titanium surfaces were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and contact profilometer. Results This study showed that the type of acid combination influenced the surface morphology and roughness profile. After sandblast and acid etching, the titanium alloy has roughness between 1.369 μm – 4.304 μm. There is no significant difference in surface roughness between using a combination of HF, HCL, H2SO4 and only the combination of HCL and H2SO4. Conclusions Titanium alloy has achieved the desired morphology and roughness after sandblasting with Al2O3 250 μm and acid-etching with HCL and H2SO4. Acid etching with a combination of HCL and H2SO4 at 120 degrees can produce micro-topography in a shorter duration.

                Background Death due to hanging is commonly seen. Sometime the ligature mark will be very prominent and in some cases it might not. In those cases, the post-mortem examination with its gross morphological findings and histopathological analysis, becomes significantly important. Objective: The objective of this study was to identify the patterns of epidemiological, gross morphological, and histopathological features in hanging cases. Methods The study was conducted on 46 cases of hanging and was carried out from February 2023 to June 2024. Their sociodemographic features were collected. Gross morphological analysis of the ligature mark and various measurements were taken. Later tissue from the ligature mark was sent for histopathological analysis. Statistical analysis was performed on the collected parameters. Results Significant male preponderance was observed in hanging cases. The maximum number of cases of hanging were observed in the fourth decade of life. Daily wage workers were the most significantly affected population. Depression was cited as the cause of suicide in most cases. Carotid intimal tears and injuries to bony and cartilaginous structures were present in smaller numbers. Vital reaction was observed in all 46 cases. Classification of wound vitality showed a correlation to known time since injury. Conclusion The results of the present study showed that socio-demographic factors play a significant role in the circumstances leading to suicidal deaths. Therefore, in reducing the burden of suicidal deaths, these factors must be addressed. To identify the cause of death as hanging analysis of various gross features and histopathology are very important and should be conducted carefully.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1101/v2?src=rss">Obtaining a PhD in Portugal. Determinants of Success and Subsequent Career Paths [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Over the past three decades, Portugal has invested significantly in doctoral training. However, there is a lack of up-to-date information on the success of scholarship holders in obtaining the degree or on their subsequent career paths. Methods This study analysed four cohorts of scholarship holders funded by the Foundation for Science and Technology between 1995 and 2012. The professional situation at different points in time after the Ph.D. (5, 10, 15 and 20 years) was studied. Results The success rate for obtaining the degree was 88%, which is comparable to other European countries for doctorates completed with funding over a period of 3-4 years. The average time to obtain the degree was 5.06 years. The time to degree was influenced by the scientific field, the nationality of the scholarship holder, and the location of the institution awarding the degree (in Portugal or abroad). The gender or age range of the scholarship recipients did not influence the time required for graduation. The analysis of the career and sector of activity of these graduates at different points in time after obtaining the Ph.D. revealed that approximately 60% percent of the graduates were engaged in R&D activities at some point in their career paths, but this percentage diminished from the oldest to the most recent cohorts. In 2020, 63% of the graduates were engaged in R&D activities, and almost half were employed in higher education as teachers, researchers, or scholarship holders. Conclusions This study showed that there are still challenges to address concerning the integration of doctoral graduates into non-academic research positions. On the other hand, it has demonstrated an efficient use of public funds, with high success rates and a time to degree that is within the average of other European countries.

                Background Trade openness shows a positive impact on economic growth, supported by economic theory, and export diversification and economic complexity show a positive dynamic in trade openness in the world; however, a specificity is generated in South American countries. Therefore, the objective of the research is to analyse the macroeconomic determinants of trade openness in Latin American countries. Methods The research approach was quantitative and explanatory using panel data methodology from the databases of the World Bank, Harvard University and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean for the period 2000-2020. Results The fixed effects panel data model showed that the variables that had a negative impact on trade openness were GDP, the economic complexity index and the logistic performance index, while the variables that had a positive impact were exports of high-tech products (a proxy for innovation), exports, imports, research and development expenditure and interregional trade in goods. Conclusions Therefore, during the analysis period of 2000-2020 in South America, based on the panel data analysis under fixed effects, a total of 8 countries had a negative impact on trade openness, and only the economies of Chile, French Guiana, and Brazil had a positive impact on trade openness; these economies are characterized by their better performance in the economic complexity index, their higher percentage of budget for research and development expenses, and their trade policies oriented towards the industrialization of their value-added products.

                Background Dentigerous cysts are benign, non-inflammatory odontogenic cysts that form over unerupted or partially erupted teeth. They are the second most common type of odontogenic cysts and can cause various complications if left untreated. Methods We report a rare case of bilateral dentigerous cysts in the mandible of a 13-year-old boy. Radiographic examination revealed two cysts on each mandibular side, associated with developing third molars and unerupted permanent second premolars. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of dentigerous cysts. Results The patient underwent surgical enucleation of all cysts and extraction of unerupted teeth under general anesthesia. The postoperative course was uneventful, with no recurrence observed over a 2-year follow-up period. Conclusions Dentigerous cysts are rare in children and even rarer in bilateral presentation. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent potential complications such as infection, tooth displacement, jaw fracture, or malignant transformation. This case illustrates the importance of radiographic examination and histopathological confirmation in the management of dentigerous cysts.

Methods A single center retrospective observational study of patients aged <18 years undergoing orthopedic surgeries at our tertiary care hospital from January 2016 to August 2024 were included and each surgery was analyzed as a discrete event. Age, type of OI, number of osteotomies, and number of bones operated simultaneously were recorded. The fall in hemoglobin, requirement for blood transfusions and associated factors were analyzed. Results Amongst 53 individuals who underwent surgery, 141 procedures were analyzed. The mean age was 11.07± 5.29 years, majority (n=33;62.2%) were phenotypically type III OI, and 42/53 (79%) patients underwent multiple osteotomies. Significant hemoglobin fall was observed after surgery (p<0.001) and was considerable in patients undergoing various osteotomies (p=0.002). Older children showed a smaller drop in hemoglobin level. Patients with type III OI showed significant hemoglobin fall (1.82 ± 0.86 g/dL). The transfusion requirement was seen in 23 (16.3%) surgeries besides it was significant in those undergoing multiple osteotomies (p= <0.05). Conclusion Our study inferred that the fall in hemoglobin was significant postoperatively in OI patients and was associated with younger age, type III OI, and multiple osteotomies. Before performing orthopedic surgeries on patients with OI, surgeons might consider the latter risk factors to explore therapeutic options aimed at reducing hemorrhage and improving outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-659/v2?src=rss">Marital Bargaining and Assortative Mating on Fertility Preference : Evidence based on Cross-sectional Data in China [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Decisions regarding child-bearing are among the most consequential ones within families, as child-rearing necessitates the active involvement of both partners. This dynamic suggests that individuals may seek partners with similar fertility preferences, leading to assortative mating based on these shared preferences. Data and Methods This study investigates second-child fertility decisions using data from the 2018 China Family Panel Studies and applies the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. Furthermore, it examines assortative matching based on fertility preferences, utilizing the 2020 provincial-level sex ratio for individuals aged 20–39 as a proxy for women’s bargaining power in the marriage market. Results The results, based on a sample of 2,351 household-level observations, indicate that spouses’ preferences are complementary. When a husband (or wife) desires a second child, their own preference has a stronger impact on the actual decision to have a second child if their partner also expresses the same desire. Additionally, the findings reveal evidence of assortative mating in terms of preferences for the desired number of children: when a husband’s (or wife’s) ideal number of children increases by one, the wife (or husband) prefers 0.32 (0.49) additional children. Moreover, in provinces with higher male-to-female sex ratios—indicating stronger bargaining power for women—a wife’s preference is more strongly aligned with her husband’s preference. For men, however, a husband’s preference aligns with his wife’s preference regardless of the sex ratio, suggesting that men’s bargaining power in the marriage market is relatively weak. Conclusions The findings have two key implications. First, shared fertility preferences between spouses exert a complementary effect, increasing the likelihood of having a second child. Second, marriage matching is not random, as individuals are more likely to partner with those who share similar fertility preferences. Additionally, women with greater bargaining power positively influence their husbands’ desired family size.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-630/v2?src=rss">Demand-side barriers and economic burden in accessing Human Papillomavirus screening for cervical cancer prevention in rural India: Evidence from a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Cervical cancer is a significant global health concern, especially in low- and middle-income countries with limited access to preventive healthcare. India’s vast rural population amplifies the challenge, demanding immediate action. Despite advancements, cervical cancer remains prevalent among underserved rural communities, hindered by barriers to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) screening uptake, including socioeconomic and financial constraints. This study aims to evaluate the economic challenges encountered by rural women when accessing HPV screening. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1502 women aged 30 to 45 in Pondicherry, India, utilizing the Andersen Model as a conceptual framework. Household questionnaires gathered data on HPV screening expenses, including patient travel costs, productivity loss, and companion costs. The analysis utilized regression models, to identify the factors impacting the economic challenges associated with accessing HPV screening. Results The study found that employment status significantly influenced healthcare costs, with employed women incurring ₹65.78 more than unemployed women (p < 0.001). Education level was also a significant predictor, with each additional year of education leading to a ₹108.45 increase in costs (p < 0.001). Travel time had a positive association with healthcare costs, with every additional minute spent traveling increasing costs by ₹5.98 (p < 0.001). Income and companion accompaniment were also significant predictors, while distance to the PHC and age did not show significant associations with total healthcare. Conclusions The study highlights the multifaceted economic challenges faced by rural populations accessing HPV screening for cervical cancer prevention in India. Notwithstanding diverse demographics and varying proximity to healthcare facilities, individuals encounter significant barriers such as travel time and associated costs. Addressing these challenges necessitates targeted interventions to reduce socioeconomic disparities and improve healthcare accessibility for vulnerable populations, thereby advancing cervical cancer prevention efforts and promoting health equity in rural communities.

                Oral contraceptive use, vaccination for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are risk factors for venous thromboembolism. Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) generally develops mid-60s patients. Herein, we present a case of superotemporal BRVO caused by the above mentioned risk factors in a young woman. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about superotemporal BRVO associated with oral contraceptives, COVID-19 vaccination, and SARS-CoV-2. A 21-year-old woman presented with loss of visual acuity in her right eye for 10 days. She had been receiving oral contraceptives for 2 years for oligomenorrhea before noticing ophthalmological symptoms. Despite having received two doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, she contracted COVID-19 and developed fever, sore throat, cough, low back pain, and general malaise about 40 days before the initial visit. However, only cough persisted for more than a month. The right eye showed superotemporal BRVO with macular edema (ME). She did not smoke nor had diabetes or hypertension. Blood test results, including cardiolipin antibody IgG, were normal. She was treated with an intravitreal aflibercept injection. ME in the fundus showed rapid improvement and resolution. Although more than 20 months have passed since the first injection, there has been no relapse of ME. The combination of oral contraceptive use, COVID-19 vaccination, and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection could induce the development of venous thromboembolism, thereby leading to superotemporal BRVO. Given that cases of COVID-19 have increased globally, patients with retinal vein occlusion who use oral contraceptives are likely to be encountered more frequently.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101882">Mapping kinase domain resistance mechanisms for the MET receptor tyrosine kinase via deep mutational scanning</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the kinase and juxtamembrane domains of the MET Receptor Tyrosine Kinase are responsible for oncogenesis in various cancers and can drive resistance to MET-directed treatments. Determining the most effective inhibitor for each mutational profile is a major challenge for MET-driven cancer treatment in precision medicine. Here, we used a deep mutational scan (DMS) of ~5764 MET kinase domain variants to profile the growth of each mutation against a panel of 11 inhibitors that are reported to target the MET kinase domain. We validate previously identified resistance mutations, pinpoint common resistance sites across type I, type II, and type I ½ inhibitors, unveil unique resistance and sensitizing mutations for each inhibitor, and verify non-cross-resistant sensitivities for type I and type II inhibitor pairs. We augment a protein language model with biophysical and chemical features to improve the predictive performance for inhibitor-treated datasets. Together, our study demonstrates a pooled experimental pipeline for identifying resistance mutations, provides a reference dictionary for mutations that are sensitized to specific therapies, and offers insights for future drug development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101802">Statistical learning beyond words in human neonates</a></h4>

              
                Interest in statistical learning in developmental studies stems from the observation that 8-month-olds were able to extract words from a monotone speech stream solely using the transition probabilities (TP) between syllables (Saffran et al., 1996). A simple mechanism was thus part of the human infant’s toolbox for discovering regularities in language. Since this seminal study, observations on statistical learning capabilities have multiplied across domains and species, challenging the hypothesis of a dedicated mechanism for language acquisition. Here, we leverage the two dimensions conveyed by speech –speaker identity and phonemes– to examine (1) whether neonates can compute TPs on one dimension despite irrelevant variation on the other and (2) whether the linguistic dimension enjoys an advantage over the voice dimension. In two experiments, we exposed neonates to artificial speech streams constructed by concatenating syllables while recording EEG. The sequence had a statistical structure based either on the phonetic content, while the voices varied randomly (Experiment 1) or on voices with random phonetic content (Experiment 2). After familiarisation, neonates heard isolated duplets adhering, or not, to the structure they were familiarised with. In both experiments, we observed neural entrainment at the frequency of the regularity and distinct Event-Related Potentials (ERP) to correct and incorrect duplets, highlighting the universality of statistical learning mechanisms and suggesting it operates on virtually any dimension the input is factorised. However, only linguistic duplets elicited a specific ERP component, potentially an N400 precursor, suggesting a lexical stage triggered by phonetic regularities already at birth. These results show that, from birth, multiple input regularities can be processed in parallel and feed different higher-order networks.

                A doctoral-level internship program was developed at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the intent to create customizable experiential learning opportunities for biomedical trainees to support career exploration, preparation, and transition into their postgraduate professional roles. We report the outcomes of this program over a 5-year period. During that 5-year period, 123 internships took place at over 70 partner sites, representing at least 20 academic, for-profit, and non-profit career paths in the life sciences. A major goal of the program was to enhance trainees’ skill development and expertise in careers of interest. The benefits of the internship program for interns, host/employer, and supervisor/principal investigator were assessed using a mixed-methods approach, including surveys with closed- and open-ended responses as well as focus group interviews. Balancing stakeholder interests is key to creating a sustainable program with widespread support; hence, the level of support from internship hosts and faculty members were the key metrics analyzed throughout. We hypothesized that once a successful internship program was implemented, faculty culture might shift to be more accepting of internships; indeed, the data quantifying faculty attitudes support this. Furthermore, host motivation and performance expectations of interns were compared with results achieved, and this data revealed both expected and surprising benefits to hosts. Data suggests a myriad of benefits for each stakeholder group, and themes are cataloged and discussed. Program outcomes, evaluation data, policies, resources, and best practices developed through the implementation of this program are shared to provide resources that facilitate the creation of similar internship programs at other institutions. Program development was initially spurred by National Institutes of Health pilot funding, thereafter, successfully transitioning from a grant-supported model, to an institutionally supported funding model to achieve long-term programmatic sustainability.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95952">Identification of nonsense-mediated decay inhibitors that alter the tumor immune landscape</a></h4>

              
                Despite exciting developments in cancer immunotherapy, its broad application is limited by the paucity of targetable antigens on the tumor cell surface. As an intrinsic cellular pathway, nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) conceals neoantigens through the destruction of the RNA products from genes harboring truncating mutations. We developed and conducted a high-throughput screen, based on the ratiometric analysis of transcripts, to identify critical mediators of NMD in human cells. This screen implicated disruption of kinase SMG1’s phosphorylation of UPF1 as a potential disruptor of NMD. This led us to design a novel SMG1 inhibitor, KVS0001, that elevates the expression of transcripts and proteins resulting from human and murine truncating mutations in vitro and murine cells in vivo. Most importantly, KVS0001 concomitantly increased the presentation of immune-targetable human leukocyte antigens (HLA) class I-associated peptides from NMD-downregulated proteins on the surface of human cancer cells. KVS0001 provides new opportunities for studying NMD and the diseases in which NMD plays a role, including cancer and inherited diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96839">Behavioural pharmacology predicts disrupted signalling pathways and candidate therapeutics from zebrafish mutants of Alzheimer’s disease risk genes</a></h4>

              
                By exposing genes associated with disease, genomic studies provide hundreds of starting points that should lead to druggable processes. However, our ability to systematically translate these genomic findings into biological pathways remains limited. Here, we combine rapid loss-of-function mutagenesis of Alzheimer’s risk genes and behavioural pharmacology in zebrafish to predict disrupted processes and candidate therapeutics. <a href="https://github.com/francoiskroll/FramebyFrame">FramebyFrame</a>, our expanded package for the analysis of larval behaviours, revealed that decreased night-time sleep was common to F0 knockouts of all four late-onset Alzheimer’s risk genes tested. We developed an online tool, <a href="https://francoiskroll.shinyapps.io/zoltar/">ZOLTAR</a>, which compares any behavioural fingerprint to a library of fingerprints from larvae treated with 3677 compounds. ZOLTAR successfully predicted that <i>sorl1</i> mutants have disrupted serotonin signalling and identified betamethasone as a drug which normalises the excessive day-time sleep of <i>presenilin-2</i> knockout larvae with minimal side effects. Predictive behavioural pharmacology offers a general framework to rapidly link disease-associated genes to druggable pathways.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87930">De novo identification of universal cell mechanics gene signatures</a></h4>

              
                Cell mechanical properties determine many physiological functions, such as cell fate specification, migration, or circulation through vasculature. Identifying factors that govern the mechanical properties is therefore a subject of great interest. Here, we present a mechanomics approach for establishing links between single-cell mechanical phenotype changes and the genes involved in driving them. We combine mechanical characterization of cells across a variety of mouse and human systems with machine learning-based discriminative network analysis of associated transcriptomic profiles to infer a conserved network module of five genes with putative roles in cell mechanics regulation. We validate in silico that the identified gene markers are universal, trustworthy, and specific to the mechanical phenotype across the studied mouse and human systems, and demonstrate experimentally that a selected target, <i>CAV1</i>, changes the mechanical phenotype of cells accordingly when silenced or overexpressed. Our data-driven approach paves the way toward engineering cell mechanical properties on demand to explore their impact on physiological and pathological cell functions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94982">Maintenance of cell wall remodeling and vesicle production are connected in Mycobacterium tuberculosis</a></h4>

              
                Pathogenic and nonpathogenic mycobacteria secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) under various conditions. EVs produced by <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>Mtb</i>) have raised significant interest for their potential in cell communication, nutrient acquisition, and immune evasion. However, the relevance of vesicle secretion during tuberculosis infection remains unknown due to the limited understanding of mycobacterial vesicle biogenesis. We have previously shown that a transposon mutant in the LCP-related gene <i>virR</i> (<i>virR<sup>mut</sup></i>) manifested a strong attenuated phenotype during experimental macrophage and murine infections, concomitant to enhanced vesicle release. In this study, we aimed to understand the role of VirR in the vesicle production process in <i>Mtb</i>. We employ genetic, transcriptional, proteomics, ultrastructural, and biochemical methods to investigate the underlying processes explaining the enhanced vesiculogenesis phenomenon observed in the <i>virR<sup>mut</sup></i>. Our results establish that VirR is critical to sustain proper cell permeability via regulation of cell envelope remodeling possibly through the interaction with similar cell envelope proteins, which control the link between peptidoglycan and arabinogalactan. These findings advance our understanding of mycobacterial extracellular vesicle biogenesis and suggest that these set of proteins could be attractive targets for therapeutic intervention.

">AAV-mediated peripheral single chain variable fragments administration to reduce cerebral tau in adult P301S transgenic mice: mono- vs combination therapy</a></h4>

              
                Tau is a primary target for immunotherapy in Alzheimer s disease. Recent studies have shown the potential of anti-tau fragment antibodies in lowering pathological tau levels in vitro and in vivo. Here, we compared the effects of single-chain variable fragments (scFv) derived from the well-characterized monoclonal antibodies PHF1 and MC1. We used adeno-associated virus 1 (AAV1) to deliver scFvs to skeletal muscle cells in eight-week-old P301S tau transgenic mice. We evaluated motor and behavioral functions at 16 and 23 weeks of age and measured misfolded, soluble, oligomeric and insoluble brain tau species. Monotherapy with scFv-MC1 improved motor and behavioral functions more effectively than scFv-PHF1 or combination therapy. Brain glucose metabolism also benefited from scFv-MC1 treatment. Surprisingly, combining scFvs targeting early (MC1) and late (PHF1) tau modifications did not produce additive or synergistic effects. These results confirm that intramuscular AAV1-mediated scFv-MC1 gene therapy holds promise as a potential treatment for Alzheimer s disease. Our findings also suggest that combining scFvs targeting different tau epitopes may not necessarily enhance efficacy if administered together in a prevention paradigm. Further research is needed to explore whether other antibodies combinations and/or administration schedules could improve the efficacy of scFv-MC1 alone.

">Reversable Acute Sedation Response of Phosphorothioate Antisense Oligonucleotides Following Local Delivery to the Central Nervous System</a></h4>

              
                Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) locally delivered to the central nervous system (CNS) are being approved as therapies for neurological diseases. After intrathecal injection of some ASOs, transient toxicities have been reported, but considerable inconsistencies remain in classifying them and their underlying mechanisms. Here, we characterize an acute sedation response that can include loss of lower spinal reflexes, hypoactivity, paresis, sedation and ataxia, peaking ~3 hours post-intrathecal injection of some phosphorothioate ASOs and reversing by 24 hours with no sequelae. Acute sedation is distinct from acute activation, which is hyperactivity and muscle cramping that occurs immediately after administering oligonucleotides. Acute sedation translates across species from rodents to non-human primates and is sequence-, dose-, and chemistry dependent. Acute sedation can be mitigated by strategic placement of phosphorothioate backbone linkages in ASOs and by avoiding G-rich sequences. The acute sedation response can be modeled in primary neural cultures, with good predictability of in vivo response. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that acute sedation is caused by high extracellular ASO concentrations inhibiting synaptic transmission, which reverses as ASO is cleared from the extracellular space and taken up into cells. Our results provide a comprehensive framework for quantifying and mitigating acute sedation caused by some phosphorothioate ASOs.

">The 5-HT1F Receptor Agonist Lasmiditan improves Cognition and Ameliorates Associated Cortico-Hippocampal Pathology in Aging Parkinsonian Mice</a></h4>

              
                While the etiopathology of Parkinsons disease (PD) is complex, mitochondrial dysfunction is established to have a central role. Thus, mitochondria have emerged as targets of therapeutic interventions aiming to slow or modify PD progression. We have previously identified serotonergic 5-HT1F receptors as novel mediators of mitochondrial biogenesis (MB) - the process of producing new mitochondria. Given this, here, we assessed the therapeutic potential of the FDA-approved 5-HT1F receptor agonist, lasmiditan, in a chronic progressive PD model (Thy1-aSyn line 61 mice). It was observed that systemic lasmiditan exhibited robust brain penetration and reversed cognitive deficits in young (4-5.5 months old) Thy1-aSyn mice (1mg/kg, every other day). Anxiety-like behavior was also improved while motor function remained unaffected. These behavioral changes were associated with enhanced MB and mitochondrial function, paired with reduced alpha-synuclein aggregation particularly in cortico-hippocampal regions. Furthermore, in older (10-11.5 months old) mice, although the effects were milder, daily lasmiditan administration increased MB and bettered cognitive abilities. In essence, these findings indicate that repurposing lasmiditan could be a potent strategy to address PD-related cognitive decline.

">Delayed transplantation of neural stem cells improves initial graft survival following stroke</a></h4>

              
                Neural stem cell therapies hold great promise for improving stroke recovery, but the hostile stroke microenvironment can hinder the initial graft survival. It has long been well documented that the microenvironment evolves over time, making it crucial to identify the optimal transplantation window to maximize therapeutic efficacy. However, it remains uncertain whether acute or delayed local cell transplantations better supports graft viability after stroke. Here, we show that delayed intracerebral transplantation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from human induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) at 7 days post stroke significantly enhances graft proliferation and survival, compared to acute transplantation at 1 day post stroke, in a mouse model of large cortical stroke. Using in vivo bioluminescence imaging over a 6-week period post-transplantation, we observe a more than 5-fold increase in bioluminescence signal in mice that received delayed NPC therapy, compared to those that underwent acute NPC transplantation. The increased number of cell grafts in mice receiving delayed NPC transplantation was driven by increased proliferation rates early after transplantation, which subsequently declined to similarly low levels in both groups. Notably, we found that the majority of transplanted NPCs differentiated into neurons after 6 weeks, with no significant differences in the neuron-to-glia ratio between acute and delayed transplantation groups. These findings suggest that delayed NPC transplantation improves early graft survival and proliferation, which could help identify the optimal therapeutic window for maximizing the effectiveness of NPC-based therapies in stroke.

">Tuning of Task-Relevant Stiffness in Multiple Directions</a></h4>

              
                The dynamics of any mechanical system can be described in terms of forces and motions. The interaction of these terms is often captured in the metric of mechanical impedance - a generalization of stiffness - used to describe how a mechanical system resists the application of force. The ability to adaptively change impedance is advantageous when encountering variable environmental conditions. Changing impedance in robotic systems is limited, whereas humans can rapidly and elegantly adapt the impedance of their limbs, especially during initial contact with objects. This is especially true for movements of our arms and hands. Multiple studies have examined the arm's response to perturbation with the idea of impedance as a reactive component. In this study, we investigate the ability of humans to predictively set their arm impedance in a contact breaking task to perform fast movements to target positions in different directions. Our findings show that subjects (n=20) predictively co-activate antagonist muscles to primarily adjust one component of the arm's impedance - stiffness - to match different task constraints before the movement begins irrespective of movement direction. Interestingly, the subjects' performance was limited by the task-dependent stiffness rather than the required force and they tended to generate minimal stiffness to perform the task. With this robust strategy, task success is optimized at the expense of energy efficiency. This type of control is essential for the uniquely human ability to interact with objects.

">Synaptotoxic forms of amyloid-b and a-synuclein act through a common pathway.</a></h4>

              
                It has been suggested that a-synuclein (aSyn), a major player in Parkinson's disease (PD), plays a role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several reports have also concluded that aSyn and amyloid-beta (Ab) are mechanistically linked, although how is unclear. Synapse loss is an early feature in both PD and AD and held to be the driver of both diseases. We have previously uncovered a signalling pathway required for Ab-driven dendritic spine loss - a non-canonical branch of Wnt signalling known as the Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (Wnt/PCP) pathway. We asked if a synaptotoxic form of aSyn known to impact dendritic spines, the A53T autosomal dominant PD mutant form of aSyn (A53T-aSyn), might act on synapses through the same pathway. Here, by blocking all Wnt activity with the porcupine inhibitor IWP2, we show that A53T-aSyn driven spine loss is Wnt-dependent. By silencing Daam1, which is unique to Wnt/PCP, we show that A53T-aSyn spine loss is Daam1-dependent. Finally, using the pan-ROCK inhibitor fasudil indicates the mechanism also involves ROCK1/2, which Daam1 signals to via RhoA to modulate actin cytoskeletal dynamics within dendritic spines. Together, these observations indicate that A53T-aSyn-driven spine loss involves the Wnt/PCP pathway, the same pathway that mediates Ab synaptotoxicity. This indicates that Ab and aSyn are mechanistically connected and that a common pathway is responsible for synapse loss in AD and PD. It also begins to explain why this group of neurodegenerative diseases have many features in common and suggests that drugs which target Wnt/PCP could be of benefit for both AD and PD.

">Combined Transplantation of Mesenchymal Progenitor and Neural Stem Cells to repair cervical spinal cord injury.</a></h4>

              
                Mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPC) are effective in reducing tissue loss, preserving white matter and improving forelimb function after spinal cord injury (SCI) (White et al., 2016). We proposed that by preconditioning the mouse by intravenous delivery (IV) of MPCs for 24 hours following SCI that this would provide a more favorable tissue milieu for NSC intraspinal bridging transplantation at day 3 and day 7. In com-bination these transplants will provide better anatomical and functional outcomes. The intravenous MSCs would provide cell protection and reduce inflammation. NSCs would provide a tissue bridge for axonal regeneration and myelination and reconnect long tract spinal pathways. Results showed that initial protection of the injury site by IV MPCs transplantation resulted in no increased survival of the NSCs transplanted at Day 7. However, integration of transplanted NSCs was increased at the Day 3 time point indicating MPCs influence very early immune signaling. We show in this study that MPC transplantation resulted in a co-operative NSC cell survival improvement at Day 3 post SCI. In addition to increased NSC survival at day 3 there was an increase in NSC derived mature oligodendrocytes at this early time point. In vitro analysis confirmed MPC driven oligodendrocyte differentiation which was statistically increased when compared to control NSC only cultures. These observations provide important information about the combination, delivery, and timing of two cellular therapies in treating SCI. This study provides important new data on understanding the MPC inflammatory signaling within the host tissue and time points for cellular transplantation survival and oligodendroglia differentiation. These results demonstrate that MPC transplantation can alter the therapeutic window for intraspinal transplantation by controlling both the circulating inflammatory response and local tissue milieu.

">DynamoSort: Using machine learning approaches for the automatic classification of seizure dynamotypes</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Epilepsy is characterised by unprovoked and recurring seizures, which can be electrically measured using electroencephalograms (EEG). To better understand the underlying mechanisms of seizures, researchers are exploring their temporal dynamics through the lens of dynamical systems modelling. Seizure initiation and termination patterns of spiking amplitude and frequency can be sorted into "dynamotypes", which may be able to serve as biomarkers for intervention. However, manual classification of these dynamotypes requires trained raters and is prone to variability. To address this, we developed DynamoSort, a machine-learning algorithm for automatic seizure onset and offset classification. Methods: We used approximately 2100 seizures from an intra-amygdala kainic acid (IAK) mouse model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, categorized by five trained raters. MATLAB's classification learner application was used to create an ensemble model to score and label dynamotypes of individual seizures based on spiking and frequency features. Results: Dynamotype classification of real EEG data lacks a definitive ground truth, with mean inter-rater agreement at 73.4% for onset and 64.2% for offset types. Despite this, DynamoSort achieved a mean area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81 for onset and a mean AUC of 0.75 for offset types. Machine-human agreement was not significantly different from human-to-human agreement. To address the lack of ground truth in ratings, DynamoSort assigns probabilistic scores (-20 to 20), to indicate similarity to each seizure dynamotype based on spiking features, allowing for a characterization of seizure dynamics on a spectrum rather than the traditional qualitative taxonomy. Significance: Automating the classification of dynamotypes is a critical step for their inclusion as a biomarker in clinical and research applications. DynamoSort is a straightforward, open-access tool that uses automatic labelling and probabilistic scoring to quantify subtle changes in seizure onset and offset dynamics.

">Therapeutic assessment of a novel mitochondrial complex I inhibitor in in vitro and in vivo models of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Despite recent approval of monoclonal antibodies that reduce amyloid (A{beta}) accumulation, the development of disease-modifying strategies targeting the underlying mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is urgently needed. We demonstrate that mitochondrial complex I (mtCI) represents a druggable target, where its weak inhibition activates neuroprotective signaling, benefiting AD mouse models with A{beta} and p-Tau pathologies. Rational design and structure-activity relationship studies yielded novel mtCI inhibitors profiled in a drug discovery funnel designed to address their safety, selectivity, and efficacy. The new lead compound C458 is highly protective against A{beta} toxicity, has favorable pharmacokinetics, and has minimal off-target effects. C458 exhibited excellent brain penetrance, activating neuroprotective pathways with a single dose. Preclinical studies in APP/PS1 mice were conducted via functional tests, metabolic assessment, in vivo 31P-NMR spectroscopy, blood cytokine panels, ex vivo electrophysiology, and Western blotting. Chronic oral administration improved long-term potentiation, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, antioxidant signaling, and cellular energetics. These studies provide further evidence that the restoration of mitochondrial function and brain energetics in response to mild energetic stress represents a promising disease-modifying strategy for AD.

">Parietal alpha frequency shapes own-body perception by modulating the temporal integration of bodily signals</a></h4>

              
                An influential proposal in the field of cognitive neuroscience suggests that alpha-frequency brain oscillations constrain the temporal sampling of external sensory signals, shaping the temporal binding window (TBW), the interval during which sensory signals are integrated. However, whether alpha frequency modulates the integration of self-related sensory signals and the perception of the body as one's own (body ownership) remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that individual alpha frequency (IAF) from the parietal cortex predicted TBWs and perceptual sensitivities in body ownership and visuotactile simultaneity judgment tasks, with faster frequencies narrowing TBWs and increasing sensitivities, and vice versa. Modulating IAF through brain stimulation altered TBWs and sensitivities, establishing a causal relationship. Computational modeling linked IAF to uncertainty in asynchrony information within the causal inference process, providing a mechanism. These findings demonstrate that parietal alpha frequency shapes the sense of body ownership by modulating the temporal integration of bodily sensory signals.

">Body movement perception is shaped by both generic and actor-specific models of human bodies</a></h4>

              
                Body movement perception is shaped by knowledge of the human body biomechanics. Apparent motion elicited by rapidly alternating pictures follows the shortest path between two body postures only if it is biomechanically plausible. And although we tend to perceive the location of a moving body part as slightly shifted forward along its trajectory, this perceptual extrapolation is absent or reduced if the movement would have been unlikely to continue along the same trajectory because of the body biomechanical constraints. The received view is that perception is shaped by a model of the observer's own body. Here, we report three lines of evidence suggesting otherwise. In Experiments 1 and 2, we report the typical influence of knowledge of the upper limb biomechanics on apparent movement perception and perceptual extrapolation in two individuals born completely without upper and lower limbs. In Experiment 3, we report that we failed to find evidence that observers' own biomechanics influence perceptual extrapolation of body movements. And in Experiments 4 to 8, we show that participants' perception is influenced by their knowledge of actor specific biomechanics. We conclude that body movement perception is shaped by visually acquired models of both generic and actor-specific body biomechanics.

">The effect of task demand on EEG responses to irrelevant sound and speech in simulated surgical environments.</a></h4>

              
                Complex soundscapes in high-stakes environments, such as the operating room (OR), are characterized by a variety of overlapping auditory stimuli and present significant challenges for personnel, particularly during periods of high demand. This study investigates how task demand and an OR soundscape including irrelevant speech, influence perceived workload, surgical performance, and auditory processing in a simulated surgical environment, using mobile electroencephalography (EEG). Participants performed two simulated surgical tasks, namely peg transfer and suturing, representing a low-demand and high-demand task, respectively. The tasks were performed under two sound conditions: An OR soundscape was presented with irrelevant speech or alone. Neural responses to transient and continuous auditory stimuli were analyzed using event-related potentials (ERPs) and temporal response functions (TRFs), respectively. Results showed that irrelevant speech increased self-reported workload and distraction. EEG analyses revealed reduced neural responses to transient sounds and irrelevant speech under high task demand, reflecting early-stage sensory filtering of auditory distractions. Notably, an inverse relationship was observed between neural responses to speech and self-reported workload, indicating that the speech responses may serve as a marker for perceived workload. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of EEG to assess irrelevant sound processing in realistic work-like settings and highlights the critical role of task demand in modulating neural responses and self-reported workload to soundscapes.

">Investigation of mitochondrial phenotypes in motor neurons derived by direct conversion of fibroblasts from familial ALS subjects</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of motor neurons, leading to fatal muscle paralysis. Familial forms of ALS (fALS) account for approximately 10% of cases and are associated with mutations in numerous genes. Alterations of mitochondrial functions have been proposed to contribute to disease pathogenesis. Here, we employed a direct conversion (DC) technique to generate induced motor neurons (iMN) from skin fibroblasts to investigate mitochondrial phenotypes in a patient-derived disease relevant cell culture system. We converted 7 control fibroblast lines and 17 lines harboring the following fALS mutations, SOD1A4V, TDP-43N352S, FUSR521G, CHCHD10R15L, and C9orf72 repeat expansion. We developed new machine learning approaches to identify iMN, analyze their mitochondrial function, and follow their fate longitudinally. Mitochondrial and energetic abnormalities were observed, but not all fALS iMN lines exhibited the same alterations. SOD1A4V, C9orf72, and TDP-43N352S iMN had increased mitochondrial membrane potential, while in CHCHD10R15L cells membrane potential was decreased. TDP-43N352S iMN displayed changes in mitochondrial morphology and increased motility. SOD1A4V, TDP-43N352S, and CHCHD10R15L iMN had increased oxygen consumption rates and altered extracellular acidification rates, reflecting a hypermetabolic state similar to the one described in sporadic ALS fibroblasts. FUSR521G mutants had decreased ATP/ADP ratio, suggesting impaired energy metabolism. We then tested the viability of iMN and found decreases in survival in SOD1A4V, C9orf72, and FUSR521G, which were corrected by small molecules that target mitochondrial stress. Together, our findings reinforce the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in ALS and indicate that fibroblast-derived iMN may be useful to study fALS metabolic alterations. Strengths of the DC iMN approach include low cost, speed of transformation, and the preservation of epigenetic modifications. However, further refinement of the fibroblasts DC iMN technique is still needed to improve transformation efficiency, reproducibility, the relatively short lifespan of iMN, and the senescence of the parental fibroblasts.

">L-DOPA induces spatially discrete changes in gene expression in the forebrain of mice with a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                L-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is effective at alleviating motor impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients but has mixed effects on nonmotor symptoms and causes adverse effects after prolonged treatment. Here, we analyzed the spatial profile of L-DOPA-induced gene expression in the forebrain of mice with an inducible progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons (the TIF-IADATCreERT2 strain), with a focus on the similarities and differences in areas relevant to different PD symptoms. The animals received a 14-day L-DOPA treatment, and 1 h after the final drug injection, a spatial transcriptome analysis was performed on coronal forebrain sections. A total of 121 genes were identified as being regulated by L-DOPA. We found that the treatment had widespread effects extending beyond the primary areas involved in dopamine-dependent movement control. An unsupervised clustering analysis of the transcripts recapitulated the forebrain anatomy and indicated both ubiquitous and region-specific effects on transcription. The changes were most pronounced in layers 2/3 and 5 of the dorsal cortex and the dorsal striatum, where a robust increase in the abundance of activity-regulated transcripts, including Fos, Egr1, and Junb, was observed. Conversely, transcripts with a decreased abundance, e.g., Plekhm2 or Pgs1, were identified primarily in the piriform cortex, the adjacent endopiriform nucleus, and the claustrum. Taken together, our spatial analysis of L-DOPA-induced alterations in gene expression reveals the anatomical complexity of treatment effects, identifying novel genes affected by the drug, as well as molecular activation in brain areas relevant to the nonmotor symptoms of PD.

">cxcl18b-defined transitional state-specific nitric oxide drives injury-induced Müller glia cell-cycle re-entry in the zebrafish retina</a></h4>

              
                In lower vertebrates, retinal Muller glia (MG) exhibit a life-long capacity of cell-cycle re-entry to regenerate neurons following the retinal injury. However, the mechanism driving such injury-induced MG cell-cycle re-entry remains incompletely understood. Combining single-cell transcriptomic analysis and in-vivo clonal analysis, we identified previously undescribed cxcl18b-defined MG transitional states as essential routes towards MG proliferation following green/red cone (G/R cone) ablation. Microglial inflammation was necessary for triggering these transitional states, which expressed the gene modules shared by cells of the ciliary marginal zone (CMZ) where life-long adult neurogenesis takes place. Functional studies of the redox properties of these transitional states further demonstrated the regulatory role of nitric oxide (NO) produced by Nos2b in injury-induced MG proliferation. Finally, we developed a viral-based strategy to specifically disrupt nos2b in cxcl18b-defined MG transitional states and revealed the effect of transitional state-specific NO signaling. Our findings elucidate the redox-related mechanism underlying injury-induced MG cell-cycle re-entry, providing insights into species-specific mechanisms for vertebrate retina regeneration.

">Rostro-caudal TMS mapping of immediate transcranial evoked potentials reveals a pericentral crescendo-decrescendo pattern</a></h4>

              
                Background: We recently demonstrated that single-pulse TMS of the primary sensorimotor hand area (SM1HAND) elicits an immediate transcranial evoked potential (iTEP). This iTEP response appears within 2-7 ms post-TMS, featuring high-frequency peaks superimposed on a slow positive wave. Here, we used a linear TMS-EEG mapping approach to characterize the rostro-caudal iTEP expression and compared it to that of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). Methods: In 15 healthy young volunteers (9 females), we identified the iTEP hotspot in left SM1HAND. We applied single biphasic TMS pulses at an intensity of 110% of resting motor threshold over six cortical sites along a rostro-caudal axis (2 cm rostral to 3 cm caudal to the SM1HAND hotspot). We analyzed site-specific iTEP and MEP responses. Results: iTEP magnitude decreased rostrally and caudally from the SM1HAND hotspot. MEPs exhibited a similar rostro-caudal crescendo-decrescendo pattern. While iTEP and MEP response profiles were similar, normalized iTEP amplitudes decayed less rapidly at the first postcentral site. Discussion: These findings support the idea that pericentral iTEPs reflect a direct response signature of the pericentral cortex, possibly involving a synchronized TMS-induced excitation of cortical pyramidal tract neurons. Similar but non-identical rostro-caudal patterns suggest that iTEPs and MEPs may arise from overlapping but distinct neuronal populations.

">Tiling of large-scaled environments by grid cells requires experience</a></h4>

              
                Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex are widely believed to provide a universal spatial metric supporting vector-based navigation irrespective of the spatial scale of an environment. However, using single unit recordings in freely behaving mice, we demonstrate that spatial periodicity in grid cell firing is substantially disrupted when transitioning from a small to a large-scale arena when the scale ratio is larger than the scale ratio of successive grid modules. Remarkably, grid patterns reemerge with experience in the large-scale arena, suggesting that grid cells can learn to represent large-scale spaces with experience.

">3BTRON: A Blood-Brain Barrier Recognition Network</a></h4>

              
                The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis. During ageing, the BBB undergoes structural alterations. Electron microscopy (EM) is the gold standard for studying the structural alterations of the brain vasculature. However, analysis of EM images is time-intensive and can be prone to selection bias, limiting our understanding of the structural effect of ageing on the BBB. Here, we introduce 3BTRON, a deep learning framework for the automated analysis of the BBB architecture (the morphology, structure, and texture of its various components) in EM images. Using age as a readout, we trained and validated our model on a unique dataset (n = 359). We show that the proposed model could confidently identify the BBB architecture of aged mouse brains from young mouse brains across three different brain regions, achieving a sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 80.0% post-stratification when predicting on unseen data. Additionally, feature importance methods revealed the spatial features of each image that contributed most to the predictions. These findings demonstrate a new data-driven approach to analysing age-related changes in the architecture of the BBB.

">Non-Canonical Role of DNA Mismatch Repair on Sensory Processing in Mice</a></h4>

              
                DNA repair mechanisms are essential for cellular development and function. This is particularly true in post-mitotic neurons, where deficiencies in DNA damage response proteins can result in severe neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. One highly conserved factor involved in DNA repair is Mut-S Homolog 2 (Msh2), which is responsible for correcting base-base mismatches and insertion/deletion loops during cell proliferation. However, its role in mature neuronal function remains poorly understood. This study investigates the impact of Msh2 loss on sensory processing in a mouse model. Using electrophysiological and molecular assays, we identified significant deficits in cortical and thalamic sound processing in Msh2-/- mice. These deficits were linked to dysfunction of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a brain region that critically regulates corticothalamic and thalamocortical activity. Our findings revealed increased oxidative damage, aberrant neuronal activity, and elevated parvalbumin (PV) expression in PV+ interneurons in the TRN of Msh2-/- mice. Additionally, we observed the presence of connexin plaques, indicating that disrupted gap junction formation may contribute to impaired TRN function. These results underscore the critical role of Msh2 in supporting the functionality of PV+ interneurons in the TRN, thereby profoundly influencing sensory processing pathways. This study provides new insights into the importance of DNA repair mechanisms in neuronal development and function, potentially contributing to our understanding of their role in neurological disorders.

">The dynamics of explore-exploit decisions suggest a threshold mechanism for reduced random exploration in older adults</a></h4>

              
                When faced with a choice between exploring an unknown option vs exploiting an option they know well, older adults explore less and exploit more than younger adults. Recent work has suggested that one driver of this age difference in exploration is a reduction in the extent to which older adults use "random exploration" - exploration that is driven by behavioral variability. Here we investigate potential mechanisms for this age-related difference in random exploration through the lens of a drift diffusion model (DDM) of the explore-exploit choice. In this model, random exploration can be modulated by two mechanisms - the fidelity with which information about the choice is represented in the brain, the "signal-to-noise ratio" (SNR), and the amount of information required to make a decision, the "decision threshold." Reduced random exploration in aging could therefore be caused either by an increase in signal-to-noise ratio or an increase in decision threshold in older adults. By fitting the DDM to choices and response times in a sample of healthy younger and older adults, we found that older adults had a lower SNR and a higher threshold than younger adults. We therefore suggest that reduced random exploration in aging is driven by higher response thresholds in older adults which may compensate for the reduced signal-to-noise ratio with which decision information is represented in the brain.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Hemispatial neglect is common after stroke but is often evaluated only after right hemisphere (RH) stroke. We sought to determine the prevalence of two types of neglect, viewer-centered neglect (VCN) and stimulus-centered neglect (SCN), after left hemisphere (LH) and RH strokes. Additionally, we identified lesion load in each vascular territory and areas of hypoperfusion, estimated with FLAIR hyperintense vessels (FVHs) that contribute to neglect. Methods: A series of 233 stroke patients (73 LH and 160 RH) were administered a task to detect VCN and SCN and received brain MRI within 5 days of onset. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify vascular territories where lesion load and/or hypoperfusion contributed to each type of neglect. Results: While VCN was more prevalent after RH stroke, SCN occurred at a similar rate after LH and RH stroke. In RH stroke, lesion load in the middle cerebral artery occipital region and anterior cerebral artery territory and age predicted left VCN, whereas parietal hypoperfusion independently predicted left SCN. In LH stroke, lesion load across regions and age predicted right VCN, while lesion load in posterior cerebral artery occipital and anterior cerebral artery regions, as well as age, predicted right SCN. The addition of information about hypoperfusion improved the prediction of both VCN and SCN. Conclusions: VCN and SCN are each common after RH stroke, and SCN is common after LH stroke. Each type of neglect is accounted for by distinct areas of infarct and hypoperfusion. Results will aid in the detection of neglect after stroke and may guide reperfusion interventions to improve neglect.</p>

	<p>Background: Recently proposed brain-tumor treatment strategies prioritize fast reduction of tumor cell population while often neglecting the radiation or chemotherapeutic drug dosage requirements to achieve it. Moreover, these techniques provide chemotherapy based treatment strategies, while ignoring the toxic side effects of the drugs employed by it. Methods: This study updates the recently proposed brain-tumor system dynamics by incorporating radiotherapy along with chemotherapy to simultaneously initiate both therapies for a more comprehensive and effective response against tumor proliferation. Afterwards, based on the upgraded system dynamics, this study proposes a novel multi-input sigmoid-based smooth synergetic nonlinear controller with the aim to reduce the dosage requirements of both therapies while keeping the overall system response robust and efficient. The novelty of this study lies in the combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy inputs in a way that prioritizes patients health and well-being, while integrating advanced synergetic control technique with a sigmoid function based smoothing agent. Results: The proposed method reduced baseline radiation and chemo drug dosages by 57% and 33% respectively while effectively suppressing tumor growth and proliferation. Similarly, the proposed controller reduced the time required for complete tumor mitigation by 60% while reducing the radiation and chemotherapeutic drug intensity by 93.8% and 21.3% respectively. Conclusions: This study offers significant improvement in tumor treatment methodologies by providing a safer, less riskier brain-tumor treatment strategy that has promising potential to improve survival rates against this menacing health condition so that the affected patients may lead a healthier and better quality of life.</p>

	<p>Fibromyalgia is a common, high-impact condition of chronic widespread pain and sensory dysfunction associated with altered central and peripheral sensory processing. A growing body of evidence supports the role of neuroinflammation and immune changes in fibromyalgia, and a narrative review of this literature was undertaken. Published data suggest that the interactions between the neural pain networks and the immune system in fibromyalgia appear to be bidirectional and operate both centrally and peripherally. There is a growing focus on processes occurring in the dorsal root ganglia and the role of maladaptive microglial cell activation. Ongoing insight into neuroinflammatory mechanisms in fibromyalgia opens potential avenues for the development of mechanism-based therapies in what is, at present, a challenging-to-manage condition.</p>

">Transferrin receptor-binding blood-brain barrier shuttle enhances brain delivery and efficacy of a therapeutic anti-Abeta antibody</a></h4>

              
                Transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1) transcytosis-mediated delivery of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a promising concept in drug development for CNS disorders. We sought to investigate brain delivery and efficacy of Aducanumab (Adu), an anti-A{beta} antibody, when fused to a mouse TfR1-binding Fab fragment as BBB shuttle (TfR1-Adu). Automated 3D light sheet fluorescence imaging coupled with computational analysis was applied to evaluate drug IgG distribution and plaque counts throughout the intact brain of transgenic APP/PS1 mice. TfR1-Adu demonstrated enhanced brain delivery and more homogeneous distribution after both acute and chronic dosing in transgenic APP/PS1 mice compared with unmodified Adu. Also, importantly, only unmodified Adu showed perivascular labelling. While high-dose Adu promoted A{beta} plaque depletion in multiple brain regions, similar plaque-clearing efficacy was achieved with a five-fold lower dose of TfR1-Adu. Furthermore, low-dose TfR1-Adu demonstrated greater capacity to reduce congophilic plaque burden. Collectively, these observations strongly support the applicability of TfR1-enabled BBB shuttle strategies to improve brain delivery and plaque-clearing efficacy while mitigating the risk of vascular-associated amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) adverse effects associated with current A{beta} immunotherapeutics.

">Glutamatergic heterogeneity in the neuropeptide projections from the lateral hypothalamus to the mouse olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                The direct pathway from the lateral hypothalamus to the mouse olfactory bulb (OB) includes neurons that express the neuropeptide orexin-A, and others that do not. The OB-projecting neurons that do not express orexin-A are present in an area of the lateral hypothalamus known to contain neurons that express the neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH). We used virally mediated anterograde tract tracing and immunohistochemistry for orexin-A and MCH to demonstrate that the OB is broadly innervated by axon projections from both populations of neurons. Orexin-A and MCH were expressed in each OB layer across its anterior to posterior axis. Both orexin-A and MCH neurons are genetically heterogeneous, with subsets that co-express an isoform of vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT). We used high-resolution confocal imaging to test whether the projections from orexin-A and MCH neurons to the OB reflect this glutamatergic heterogeneity. The majority (~57%) of putative orexin-A axon terminals overlapped with VGLUT2, with smaller proportions that co-expressed VGLUT1, or that did not overlap with either VGLUT1 or VGLUT2. In contrast, only ~26% of putative MCH axon terminals overlapped with VGLUT2, with the majority not overlapping with either VGLUT. Therefore, the projections from the lateral hypothalamus to the OB are genetically heterogeneous and include neurons that can release two different neuropeptides. The projections from both populations are themselves genetically heterogeneous with distinct ratios of glutamatergic and non-glutamatergic axon terminals.

">Sleep duration and efficiency moderate the effects of prenatal and childhood ambient pollutant exposure on global white matter microstructural integrity in adolescence</a></h4>

              
                Background: Air pollution is a ubiquitous neurotoxicant associated with alterations in structural connectivity. Good habitual sleep may be an important protective lifestyle factor due to its involvement in the brain waste clearance and its bidirectional relationship with immune function. Wearable multisensory devices may provide more objective measures of sleep quantity and quality. We investigated whether sleep duration and efficiency moderated the relationship between prenatal and childhood pollutant exposure and whole-brain white matter microstructural integrity at ages 10-13 years. Methods: We used multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging data collected on 3T MRI scanners and objective sleep data collected with Fitbit Charge 2 from the 2-year follow-up visit for 2178 subjects in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study(R). White matter tracts were identified using a probabilistic atlas. Restriction spectrum imaging was performed to extract restricted normalized isotropic (RNI) and directional (RND) signal fraction parameters for all white matter tracts, then averaged to calculate global measures. Sleep duration was calculated by summing the time spent in each sleep stage; sleep efficiency was calculated by dividing sleep duration by time spent in bed. Using an ensemble-based modeling approach, air pollution concentrations of PM2.5, NO2, and O3 were assigned to each child's residential addresses during the prenatal period (9-month average before birthdate) as well as at ages 9-10 years. Multi-pollutant linear mixed effects models assessed the associations between global RNI and RND and sleep-by-pollutant interactions, adjusting for appropriate covariates. Results: Sleep duration interacted with childhood NO2 exposure and sleep efficiency interacted with prenatal O3 exposure to affect RND at ages 10-13 years. Longer sleep duration and higher sleep efficiency in the context of higher pollutant exposure was associated with lower RND compared to those with similar pollutant exposure but shorter sleep duration and lower sleep efficiency. Conclusions: Low-level air pollution poses a risk to brain health in youth, and healthy sleep duration and efficiency may increase resilience to its harmful effects on white matter microstructural integrity. Future studies should evaluate the generalizability of these results in more diverse cohorts as well as utilize longitudinal data to understand how sleep may impact brain health trajectories in the context of pollution over time.

">A Novel Method for Culturing Telencephalic Neurons in Axolotls</a></h4>

              
                The axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum), a neotenic salamander with remarkable regenerative capabilities, serves as a key model for studying nervous system regeneration. Despite its potential, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this regenerative capacity remain poorly understood, partly due to the lack of reliable in vitro models for axolotl neural cells. In this study, we developed a novel protocol for primary cultures of adult axolotl telencephalon/pallium, enabling the maintenance of viable and functionally active neural cells. Using calcium imaging and immunocytochemistry, we demonstrated the presence of neuronal and glial markers, synaptic connections, and spontaneous calcium activity, highlighting the functional integrity of the cultured cells. Our findings reveal that these cultures can be maintained in both serum and serum-free conditions, with neurons exhibiting robust neurite outgrowth and responsiveness to injury. This protocol addresses a critical gap in axolotl research by providing a controlled in vitro system to study neurogenesis and regeneration. By offering insights into the regenerative mechanisms of axolotl neurons, this work lays the foundation for comparative studies with mammalian systems, potentially informing therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases and CNS injuries in humans.

">Microglia Adopt Temporally Specific Subtypes after Irradiation, Correlating with Neuronal Asynchrony</a></h4>

              
                Cranial radiotherapy causes progressive neurocognitive impairments in cancer survivors. Neuroinflammation is believed to be a key contributor, but its dynamics and consequences for brain function remain poorly understood. Here, we performed comprehensive longitudinal profiling, from 6 hours to 1 year after irradiation (IR) of the mouse hippocampus, using transcriptomic, protein and histological analyses. We identified a delayed microglial response coupling interferon signaling to mitotic progression, and a subsequent induction of temporally regulated subtypes. IR rewired the parenchymal phagocyte profiles due to progressive microglial loss, failure of repopulation through self-renewal and compensatory generation of microglia-like cells derived from peripheral monocytes. These findings were confirmed in autopsied human brain. Finally, we demonstrate two phases of neuronal asynchrony, an early one associated with inflammation and a late one associated with synaptic aberrant regulation. These results provide comprehensive, longitudinal insights into microglia responses that can aid tailoring therapies to preserve cognition in cancer survivors.

">Selective manipulation of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in top-down and bottom-up visual pathways using ultrasound stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Techniques for precise manipulation of neurons in specific neural pathways are crucial for excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance and investigation of complex brain circuits. Low-intensity focused ultrasound stimulation (LIFUS) has emerged as a promising tool for noninvasive deep-brain targeting at high spatial resolution. However, there is a lack of studies that extensively investigate the modulation of top-down and bottom-up corticothalamic circuits via selective manipulation of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Here, a comprehensive methodology using electrophysiological recording and c-Fos staining is employed to demonstrate pulse repetition frequency (PRF)-dependent E/I selectivity of ultrasound stimulation in the top-down and bottom-up corticothalamic pathways of the visual circuit in rodents. Ultrasound stimulation at various PRFs is applied to either the lateral posterior nucleus of the thalamus (LP) or the primary visual cortex (V1), and multi-channel single-unit activity is recorded from the V1 using a silicon probe. Our results demonstrate that high frequency PRFs, particularly at 3 kHz and 1 kHz, are effective at activating the bidirectional corticothalamic visual pathway. In addition, brain region-specific PRFs modulate E/I cortical signals, corticothalamic projections, and synaptic neurotransmission, which is imperative for circuit-specific applications and behavioral studies.

">A vector-based strategy for olfactory navigation in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Odors serve as essential cues for navigation. Although tracking an odor plume has been modeled as a reflexive process, it remains unclear whether animals can use memories of their past odor encounters to infer the spatial structure of their chemical environment or their location within it. Here we developed a virtual-reality olfactory paradigm that allows head-fixed Drosophila to navigate structured chemical landscapes, offering insight into how memory mechanisms shape their navigational strategies. We found that flies track an appetitive odor corridor by following its boundary, alternating between rapid counterturns to exit the plume and directed returns to its edge. Using a combination of behavioral modeling, functional calcium imaging, and neural perturbations, we demonstrate that this 'edge-tracking' strategy relies on vector-based computations within the Drosophila central complex in which flies store and dynamically update memories of the direction to return them to the plume's boundary. Consistent with this, we find that FC2 neurons within the fan-shaped body, which encode a fly's navigational goal, signal the direction back to the odor boundary when flies are outside the plume. Together, our studies suggest that flies leverage the plume's boundary as a dynamic landmark to guide their navigation, analogous to the memory-based strategies other insects use for long-distance migration or homing to their nests. Plume tracking thus uses components of a conserved navigational toolkit, enabling flies to use memory mechanisms to navigate through a complex shifting chemical landscape.

">Transient Acute Neuronal Activation Response Caused by High Concentrations of Oligonucleotides in the Cerebral Spinal Fluid</a></h4>

              
                Oligonucleotide (ON) therapeutics are promising as a disease-modifying therapy for central nervous system disorders. Intrathecal ON administration into the cerebral spinal fluid is a safe and effective delivery mode to the CNS. However, preclinical studies have shown acute toxicities following high-dose central ON delivery. Here we characterize a transient neurobehavioral change peaking 15 minutes after ON dosing and resolving after 120 minutes. Symptoms include shaking, muscle twitching, cramping, hyperactivity, stereotypic movements, hyperreactivity, vocalizations, tremors, convulsions, and seizures. These are collectively referred here as the acute neuronal activation response. Acute neuronal activation is observed in rats, mice, and non-human primates and is quantifiable using a simple scoring system. It is distinct from acute sedation seen with some phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides, characterized by loss of spinal reflexes, ataxia, and sedation. The acute neuronal activation response is largely sequence-independent and is driven by ON chelation of divalent cations, particularly influenced by the divalent cations-to-ON ratio in the dosing solution. Acute neuronal activation can be safely mitigated by adjusting this ratio through magnesium supplementation in the ON formulation. We provide a comprehensive framework for quantifying and mitigating the acute neuronal activation response caused by high concentrations of centrally delivered ON therapeutics in preclinical species.

">Top-down control of the descending pain modulatory system drives placebo analgesia</a></h4>

              
                In placebo analgesia, prior experience and expectations lead to pain suppression by the administration of an inert substance, but causal evidence for its neural basis is lacking. To identify the underlying neural circuits, we reverse-translated a conditioned placebo protocol from humans to mice. Surprisingly, the placebo effect suppresses both nociception and unconditioned emotional-motivational pain-related behavior. Descending pain modulatory neurons in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) are critical for both morphine and placebo antinociception. The placebo effect depends on input to the PAG from the medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, but not anterior insular cortex. Conditioning enhances noxious stimulus-evoked endogenous opioid release in the PAG to produce analgesia. Our results suggest that cortical control of the descending pain modulatory system (DPMS) is gated by rapid endogenous opioid signaling in the PAG during placebo trials. This study bridges clinical and preclinical research, establishing a central role for the DPMS in placebo analgesia.

">Mice dynamically adapt to opponents in competitive multi-player games</a></h4>

              
                Competing for resources in dynamic social environments is fundamental for survival, and requires continuous monitoring of both 'self' and 'others' to guide effective choices. Yet our understanding of value-based decision-making comes primarily from studying individuals in isolation, leaving open fundamental questions about how animals adapt their strategies during social competition. Here, we developed an ethologically relevant multi-player game, in which freely-moving mice make value-based decisions in a competitive spatial foraging task. We found that mice integrate real-time spatial information about 'self' and the opponent to flexibly shift their preference towards safer, low-payout options when appropriate. Analyses of mice and reinforcement learning agents reveal that these behavioural adaptations cannot be explained by simple reward learning, but are instead consistent with optimal decision strategies guided by opponent features. Using a dynamical model of neural activity, we found that in addition to opponent effects, decisions under competition were also noisier and more sensitive to initial conditions, generating testable predictions for neural recordings and perturbations. Together, this work reveals a fundamental mechanism for competitive foraging, and proposes novel quantitative frameworks towards understanding value-based decision-making in a fast-changing social environment.

	<p>Background: Emerging evidence suggests that peripheral immunoinflammatory responses contribute to Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) pathogenesis, and endothelial cells (ECs) are involved in these responses. Nevertheless, the potential molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways by which ECs modulate peripheral immunoinflammatory responses and thus contribute to AD pathogenesis are not fully understood. Methods: The single-cell RNA sequencing dataset GSE157827 was analyzed, and AD key genes were screened using LASSO regression and random forest algorithms. Functional enrichment analyses of these AD key genes were conducted using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene set variation analysis. Immune cell infiltration analyses for AD key genes were performed using single-sample GSEA, and their correlations with immunoinflammatory factors were assessed using the TISIDB database. Peripheral blood RNA sequencing data from our cohort were utilized to validate the expression patterns of EC-related AD key genes in peripheral blood and to investigate their association with cognition. Results: ECs are the most significant contributors to AD among all brain cell subpopulations. For the first time, the EC-related genes EIF1 and HSPA1B were identified as key genes associated with AD progression. These two EC-related key genes may participate in AD pathogenesis by modulating peripheral immunoinflammatory responses. The levels of EIF1 and HSPA1B were significantly altered in the peripheral blood during AD progression, and EIF1 levels correlated with cognitive functions in AD clinical continuum patients. Conclusions: These findings underscore the critical roles of the EC-related genes EIF1 and HSPA1B in AD pathogenesis and their potential as biomarkers for this disease.</p>

	<p>Background: Acute subdural hematoma (aSDH) is associated with a high risk of epilepsy, a complication linked to poor outcomes. Craniotomy is a known risk factor, with an epilepsy incidence of approximately 25%. This study evaluated radiomic features from preoperative CT scans to predict epilepsy risk in aSDH patients undergoing craniotomy. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 178 adult aSDH patients treated between 2016 and 2022 identified 64 patients meeting inclusion criteria. Radiomic features (e.g., Feret diameter, elongation, flatness, surface area, and volume) from preoperative CT scans within 24 h of surgery were analyzed alongside clinical factors, including cardiac comorbidities, pupillary response, SOFA score, age, and anticoagulation status. Results: Of the 64 patients, 18 (28%) developed generalized seizures. Univariate analysis showed significant associations with Feret diameter (p = 0.045), elongation (p = 0.005), cardiac comorbidities (p = 0.017), and SOFA score (p = 0.036). ROC analysis showed excellent discriminatory ability for elongation (AUC = 0.82). Multivariate analysis identified elongation as an independent predictor (p = 0.003); elongation &amp;amp;ge; 1.45 increased seizure risk 7.78-fold (OR = 7.778; 95% CI = 1.969&amp;amp;ndash;30.723). Conclusions: Radiomic features, particularly elongation, may help predict epilepsy risk in aSDH patients undergoing craniotomy. Prospective validation is needed.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: This systematic review integrates Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), Educational Neuroscience (EdNeuro), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) to examine their combined impact on optimizing learning environments. It explores how AI-driven adaptive learning systems, informed by neurophysiological insights, enhance personalized education for K-12 students and adult learners. This study emphasizes the role of Electroencephalography (EEG), Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), and other neurophysiological tools in assessing cognitive states and guiding AI-powered interventions to refine instructional strategies dynamically. Methods: This study reviews n = 103 papers related to the integration of principles of CLT with AI and ML in educational settings. It evaluates the progress made in neuroadaptive learning technologies, especially the real-time management of cognitive load, personalized feedback systems, and the multimodal applications of AI. Besides that, this research examines key hurdles such as data privacy, ethical concerns, algorithmic bias, and scalability issues while pinpointing best practices for robust and effective implementation. Results: The results show that AI and ML significantly improve Learning Efficacy due to managing cognitive load automatically, providing personalized instruction, and adapting learning pathways dynamically based on real-time neurophysiological data. Deep Learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) improve classification accuracy, making AI-powered adaptive learning systems more efficient and scalable. Multimodal approaches enhance system robustness by mitigating signal variability and noise-related limitations by combining EEG with fMRI, Electrocardiography (ECG), and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR). Despite these advances, practical implementation challenges remain, including ethical considerations, data security risks, and accessibility disparities across learner demographics. Conclusions: AI and ML are epitomes of redefinition potentials that solid ethical frameworks, inclusive design, and scalable methodologies must inform. Future studies will be necessary for refining pre-processing techniques, expanding the variety of datasets, and advancing multimodal neuroadaptive learning for developing high-accuracy, affordable, and ethically responsible AI-driven educational systems. The future of AI-enhanced education should be inclusive, equitable, and effective across various learning populations that would surmount technological limitations and ethical dilemmas.</p>

	<p>The global rise in mental health-related disorders represents a significant health and wellbeing challenge, imposing a substantial social and economic burden on individuals, communities, and healthcare systems. According to the World Health Organization, one in four people globally will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, highlighting a significant global health concern that warrants carefully considered and innovative responses. While mental health challenges arise from complex, multifaceted factors, emerging research indicates that the built environment&amp;amp;mdash;the architecture of our homes, workplaces, and public spaces&amp;amp;mdash;may exert a critical but underappreciated influence on mental health outcomes. This paper outlines a novel theoretical framework for how visual stressors in the built environment might trigger neurophysiological stress responses via the HPA and SAM axes, potentially contributing over time to allostatic load. In this paper, it is proposed that chronic physiological strain can alter neuroplastic processes and neurogenesis in key brain regions&amp;amp;mdash;such as the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and amygdala&amp;amp;mdash;thereby affecting cognitive health, emotional regulation, and overall mental wellbeing. Drawing on the principle of neurosustainability, this paper suggests that long-term exposure to stress-inducing environments may create feedback loops, particularly involving the amygdala, that have downstream effects on other brain areas and may be linked to adverse mental health outcomes such as depression. By presenting this framework, this paper aims to inspire further inquiry and applied experimental research into the intersection of neurophysiology, mental health, and the built environment, with a particular emphasis on rigorous testing and validation of the proposed mechanisms, that may then be translated into practical architectural design strategies for supporting health and wellbeing. In doing so, it is hoped that this work may contribute to a more holistic approach to improving mental health that integrates the creation of nurturing, resilient spaces into the broader public health agenda.</p>

	<p>Background: Hypermobility Ehlers&amp;amp;ndash;Danlos syndrome (hEDS) is a clinical condition characterized by hypermobility and tissue fragility and is associated with chronic pain. The present study aimed to investigate the associations between affect regulation, pain perception, and psychophysical dimensions as well as alexithymic characteristics in the pathological range. Methods: Twenty-five hEDS patients completed a socio-anamnestic questionnaire as well as the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), the 36-Item Short Form Survey (psychophysical health), the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), and the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (affect regulation). Results: Correlational analysis showed several negative significant associations between the SF-36, DERS, and TAS-20. The BPI showed few significant associations with both affect regulation measures. Moreover, a relationship between psychological dimensions and the time since diagnosis emerged. A total of 28% of participants reported TAS-20 scores in the clinical range and 36% reported scores in the borderline area. Discussion: Patients with hEDS seem to show high alexithymia levels; pain seems to interfere with the practical aspects of daily life and may reduce an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s awareness of their emotional capabilities. The perception of heightened pain has a stronger impact on emotional resources when it interferes with affective life than when it interferes with practical life. Finally, delayed diagnoses of hEDS entail psychological consequences such as alexithymia. Conclusions: The present findings highlight the importance of promoting affect regulation capabilities through the implementation of psychological intervention programs for patients suffering from this medical condition.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/2/ENEURO.0114-24.2024?rss=1">Temporal Lobectomy Evidence for the Role of the Amygdala in Early Emotional Face and Body Processing</a></h4>

              
                <p>The amygdala is believed to make invaluable contributions to visual emotion processing. Yet how this subcortical body contributes to emotion perception across time is contended. Here, we measured differences in the perceptual processing of emotional stimuli after unilateral temporal lobe and amygdala resection (TLR) in humans, using EEG. Through mass univariate analysis of brain activity, we compared responses to fearful and neutral faces (left TLR <I>N</I> = 8, right TLR <I>N</I> = 8, control <I>N</I> = 8), and fearful and neutral bodies (left TLR <I>N</I> = 9, right TLR <I>N</I> = 9, control <I>N</I> = 9). We found that TLR impaired the early-stage perceptual processing of emotional stimuli seen in the control group. Indeed, in controls a heightened responses to fearful faces was found in the 140&ndash;170&nbsp;ms time window, over temporoparietal electrodes. This effect was also present in the left TLR group but disappeared in the right TLR group. For emotional bodies, brain activity was differentially sensitive to fearful stimuli at 90&ndash;120&nbsp;ms in the control group, but this effect was eliminated in both TLR groups. Collectively, these results reveal the amygdala contributes to the early stages of perceptual processing that discriminate emotional stimuli from neutral stimuli. Further, they emphasize the unique role of the right medial temporal structures such as the amygdala in emotional face perception.</p>

                <p>Axons in the mammalian brain show significant diversity in myelination motifs, displaying spatial heterogeneity in sheathing along individual axons and across brain regions. However, its impact on neural signaling and susceptibility to injury remains poorly understood. To address this, we leveraged cable theory and developed model axons replicating the myelin sheath distributions observed experimentally in different regions of the mouse central nervous system. We examined how the spatial arrangement of myelin affects propagation and predisposition to conduction failure in axons with cortical versus callosal myelination motifs. Our results indicate that regional differences in myelination significantly influence conduction timing and signaling reliability. Sensitivity of action potential propagation to the specific positioning, lengths, and ordering of myelinated and exposed segments reveals non-linear and path-dependent conduction. Furthermore, myelination motifs impact signaling vulnerability to demyelination, with callosal motifs being particularly sensitive to myelin changes. These findings highlight the crucial role of myelinating glia in brain function and disease.</p>

                <p>The behavioral interactions between adults and newborns are decisive for the fitness and the survival of offspring across the animal kingdom. In laboratory mice, while virgin females display caregiving behaviors, virgin males are rather neglectful or aggressive toward pups. Despite the importance of these behavioral variations, the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. Brain regions encoding these behaviors may exhibit sex-dependent functional differences at the baseline. Additionally, these structures might undergo sex-specific plasticity after adults interact with the offspring. Emerging evidence suggests sex-based differences in input connectivity, genetics, and receptor expression of the epithalamic lateral habenula (LHb). Moreover, LHb neuronal activity is instrumental for adult&ndash;newborn interactions. However, whether LHb neuronal function varies between sexes and/or undergoes adaptations following interactions with pups has not been fully investigated. In this study, we used in vivo and ex vivo single-cell electrophysiology to examine the basal LHb neuronal activity of virgin female and male mice. In a second set of experiments, we exposed mice to pups and recapitulated sex-based divergent behaviors. Recordings in acute slices showed no alterations in LHb firing properties, regardless of sex or pup exposure. These findings suggest that, although the LHb participates in adult behaviors toward pups, this is not mediated by sex-dependent functional differences or adaptations in the neuronal firing properties. Thus, this study provides new insights into the neural basis of sex-specific adult&ndash;newborn behaviors and the role of the LHb in these processes.</p>

                Background This study investigated the relationship between preferred bubble speeds in sensory room bubble tubes and physiological–psychological factors, including interoceptive sensitivity, subjective time perception, visual discomfort, and anxiety levels. Methods A sample of 50 participants engaged in a controlled experiment in which they used the method of adjustment to determine their preferred speed of a bubble tube simulated by an upward-moving Random Dot Motion (RDM) stimulus. Subjective time perception was evaluated through a time estimation task in which participants estimated a 60-second interval, and interoceptive sensitivity was measured via a heartbeat-tracking task. Participants’ visual discomfort and anxiety levels were assessed using the Visual Discomfort Scale Japanese Version (VDS-J), Trypophobia Questionnaire Japanese Version (TQ-J), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Results The results from the method of adjustment indicated that the preferred speed varied largely, from 1.09 to 13.86 degrees per second. Spearman’s correlation analysis revealed that higher interoceptive awareness correlated with a preference for slower speeds, whereas higher anxiety levels correlated with a preference for faster speeds. In addition, our multiple regression analysis showed that subjective time perception accuracy and visual discomfort levels were significant predictors of the participants’ preferred RDM speeds in the regression model. Conclusion The results indicate that interoceptive sensitivity, subjective time, visual discomfort, and anxiety levels play significant roles in determining the preferred speeds for RDM stimulation. Our results highlight the importance of considering individual differences in physiological and psychological states when designing therapeutic sensory environments such as sensory rooms and bubble tubes to enhance well-being and therapeutic outcomes.

                Background The Federalist Society, a leading conservative legal organization, has played a significant role in shaping the American judiciary for decades. Despite its influence, comprehensive empirical data on the organization remains scarce. We address this gap by systematically documenting 20,205 public events hosted by the Society from 1984 to 2024, with substantive coverage from 2007 onward. Methods Following ethical best practices in data collection and ownership, we gathered event metadata—including titles, dates, locations, sponsors, topics, and speakers—via web scraping from the Federalist Society’s archives. The dataset is structured to facilitate analysis of event trends, co-speaking networks, and thematic shifts over time. To ensure data integrity, we performed validation, deduplication, and cleaning, resulting in a well-structured, high-quality dataset. Conclusions This dataset provides an empirical foundation for examining the Federalist Society’s role in legal discourse. It is a resource for scholars in law, political science, sociology, gender studies, network science, and computational social science, enabling investigations into key themes of discussion, event participation patterns, demographic diversity, professional backgrounds, and more. Researchers can use it to study institutional influence, legal networks, and the evolution of conservative legal thought.

                Background This study investigates factors influencing the deposit of academic publications and research data in open access repositories by Spanish researchers. Methods Using survey data from a sample of Spanish academics, the research examines the impact of personal attributes (e.g., gender, age, knowledge of open science) and contextual variables (e.g., academic discipline, institutional type) on deposit behaviours. Quantitative methods, including chi-square tests and regression analysis, reveal significant associations between knowledge of open science and deposit practices. Results Researchers familiar with open science principles were more likely to deposit multiple versions of articles and datasets, albeit with varying intensity. Key findings highlight disciplinary and institutional differences: researchers in Life Sciences and Experimental Sciences showed higher engagement with both article and data deposits, whereas Health Sciences lagged. Gender differences were also observed, with male researchers depositing articles and datasets more frequently than their female counterparts, though age showed limited impact. Public institutions exhibited lower data deposit rates despite mandates supporting open access. Conclusions The study underscores the need for tailored policies, including awareness campaigns, infrastructure investment, and discipline-specific strategies, to promote equitable and widespread adoption of open science practices. Findings contribute to understanding open science implementation, emphasizing the interplay of individual, institutional, and systemic factors.

                We developed a new time-calibrated phylogenetic tree incorporating primarily endemic Ryukyu Islands cicada data, along with some cryptic species, following the recent global cicada studies by Marshall et al. (2018), Łukasik et al. (2018), Simon et al. (2019), Price et al. (2019), and Hill et al. (2021). A total of 352 specimens were analyzed using BEAST v1.10.4 software with a relaxed clock model. Fossil calibrations dating as far back as the Triassic were adopted, largely following Johnson et al. (2018) and Moulds (2018), with a Quaternary geological event calibration based on Osozawa et al. (2012, 2021b), which was input into BEAST v1.10.4. In the COI tree, the crown age of Cicadoidea was estimated at 200.63 Ma. Tettigarctidae was found to be the oldest lineage, sister to all remaining cicadas. Derotettiginae, at 99.2 Ma, is the next oldest lineage, sister to all other monophyletic cicadas. The Tibicininae clade branched at 66.15 Ma, with the subfamilies Tettigomyiinae, Cicadettinae, and Cicadidae diverging at a crown age of 40.57 Ma. The Cicadinae clade consists of many tribe and genus-specific clades, with numerous cryptic species emerging due to vicariance and adaptive radiation. We estimated the base substitution rate as a function of age, and the results strongly indicate an exponential increase in substitution rates during recent geological time. This increase in cicada biodiversity, including the generation of cryptic species in the Ryukyu Islands and surrounding regions, may have been driven by the spread of C4 grasses and concurrent Quaternary climate changes.

                Background Musculoskeletal disorders comprise injuries that limit the ability of the human body to move and include elements such as muscles, tendons, and ligaments. They are considered significant problems within the practice of clinical dentistry, arising mainly because of physical overload resulting from dynamic and static activities. The aim of the research was to evaluate the relationship between shoulder, arm, and hand disability and body mass index in dentists. Methods The study was classified as applied research with a non-experimental and correlational design. The sample consisted of 222 private practice´s dentists. A simple random probabilistic sampling was chosen. A questionnaire was considered to collect demographic, occupational, anthropometric, and exercise data. To assess the presence of symptoms of functional disability of the shoulder, arm, and hand, the shortened Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scale (QuickDASH) was used. Results There are differences in shoulder, arm, and hand disability scores among the body mass index classification groups (PR=12.74, 95% CI [9.08; 16.4], p<0.001), even after adjusting for occupational and physical activity variables (PR=10544.08, 95% CI [302.84; 367111.40], p<0.001). Conclusion This study highlights the significant relationship between BMI and functional disability of the shoulder, arm, and hand in dental surgeons, emphasizing the need for preventive strategies focused on weight management and the promotion of physical activity.

Biological and dynamic mechanisms by which Drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells contribute to the development of acquired drug resistance have not been fully elucidated. Here, by integrating multidimensional data from drug-treated PC9 cells, we developed a novel multiscale mathematical model from an evolutionary perspective that encompasses epigenetic and cellular population dynamics. By coupling stochastic simulation with quantitative analysis, we identified epigenetic instability as the most prominent kinetic feature related to the emergence of DTP cell subpopulations and the effectiveness of intermittent treatment. Moreover, we revealed the optimal schedule for intermittent treatment, including the optimal area for therapeutic time and drug holidays. By leveraging single-cell RNA-seq data characterizing the drug tolerance of lung cancer, we validated the predictions made by our model and further revealed previously unrecognized biological features of DTP cells, such as cell autophagy and migration, as well as new biomarker genes of therapeutic tolerance. Our work not only provides a paradigm for the integration of multiscale mathematical models with newly emerging genomics data but also improves our understanding of the crucial roles of DTP cells and offers guidance for developing new intermittent treatment strategies against acquired drug resistance in cancer.

Research lab groups are hotspots for the education of the next generation of scientists, and making these units work as creatively as possible is essential for solving pressing issues in biology, the environment, and beyond. This article highlights 10 points that can help make labs as creative as possible. Several of these points are about setting up a creative lab culture; others are about fostering group-level creative output, some are more about encouraging creativity of individual team members, or both. While the head of a research group, the principal investigator, plays an important role, this can only be successful in healthy labs where everyone contributes.

                <p>by Wenxuan Li, Xu Chen, Suli Liu, Chiyu Zhang, Guyue Liu</p>

With the ongoing evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its increasing adaptation to humans, several variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs) have been identified since late 2020. These include Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Omicron parent lineage, and other variants. These variants may show distinct levels of virulence, antigenicity, and infectivity, which require specific defense and control measures. In this study, we propose an SI1…InR infectious disease model to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants among the human population. We combine the proposed epidemic model and reported infected data of variants with physical information neural networks (PINNs) to develop a novel mechanism called VOCs-informed neural network (VOCs-INN). In our experiments, we found that this algorithm can accurately fit the reported data of the British Columbia (BC) province and its five internal health agencies in Canada. Furthermore, it can simulate observed or unobserved dynamics, infer time-dependent parameters, and enable short-term predictions. The experimental results also reveal variations in the intensity of control strategies implemented across these regions. VOCs-INN performs well in fitting and forecasting when analyzing long-term or multi-wave data.

                <p>by Christina Y. Lee, Sina Bonakdar, Kelly B. Arnold</p>

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition characterized by a shift in vaginal microbiome composition that is linked to negative reproductive outcomes and increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections. Despite the commonality of BV, standard-of-care antibiotics provide limited control of recurrent BV episodes and development of new biotherapies is limited by the lack of controlled models needed to evaluate new dosing and treatment regimens. Here, we develop an <i>in silico</i> framework to evaluate selection criteria for potential probiotic strains, test adjunctive therapy with antibiotics, and alternative dosing strategies. This computational framework highlighted the importance of resident microbial species on the efficacy of hypothetical probiotic strains, identifying specific interaction parameters between resident non-optimal anaerobic bacteria (nAB) and <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp. with candidate probiotic strains as a necessary selection criterion. Model predictions were able to replicate results from a recent phase 2b clinical trial for the live biotherapeutic product, Lactin-V, demonstrating the relevance of the <i>in silico</i> platform. Results from the computational model support that the probiotic strain in Lactin-V requires adjunctive antibiotic therapy to be effective, and that increasing the dosing frequency of the probiotic could have a moderate impact on BV recurrence at 12 and 24 weeks. Altogether, this framework could provide evidence for the rational selection of probiotic strains and help optimize dosing frequency or adjunctive therapies.

<p>COMPLEX CELLS, COMPLEX CIRCUITS: We found great diversity of synaptic motifs in the lobula tree of crabs’ giant neurons, MLG1. They acted both as presynaptic and postsynaptic partners. The dendritic arbor seems compartmentalized, with primary and secondary branches participating in different functions.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Arthropods are diverse, abundant, successful animals that exploit all available ecological niches. They sense the environment, move, interact with prey/predators/conspecifics, learn, and so forth using small brains with five orders of magnitude less neurons than mammals. Hence, these brains need to be efficient in information processing. One distinct aspect is the presence of large, easily identifiable single neurons that act as functional units for information processing integrating a high volume of information from different sources to guide behavior. To understand the synaptic organization behind these high-integration nodes research on suitable neurons is needed. The lobula giant neurons (LGs) found in the third optic neuropil, the lobula, of semiterrestrial crabs <i>Neohelice granulata</i> respond to moving stimuli, integrate information from both eyes, and show short- and long-term plasticity. They are thought to be key elements in the visuomotor transformation guiding escape responses to approaching objects. One subgroup, the MLG1 (monostratified LG type 1), is composed of 16 elements that have very wide main branches and a regular arrangement in a deep layer of the lobula which allows their identification even in unstained preparations. Here, we describe the types and abundance of synaptic contacts involving MLG1 profiles using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We found an unexpected diversity of synaptic motifs and an apparent compartmentalization of the dendritic arbor in two domains where MLG1s act predominantly as presynaptic or postsynaptic, respectively. We propose that the variety of contact types found in the dendritic arbor of the MLG1s reflects the multiple circuits in which these cells are involved. Regarding the detection of approaching objects, the distinctive input contact motifs shared by lobula giant neurons in crabs and locusts suggest a similar organization of the collision-detecting pathways in both species.</p>

                Background Hybrid nanofluids, consisting of two distinct nanoparticles dispersed in a base fluid, are widely used in industries requiring enhanced heat and mass transfer, such as cooling systems and heat exchangers. These fluids improve thermal conductivity and fluid dynamics, leading to better heat management and energy efficiency. This study investigates the combined effects of non-linear thermal radiation, Cattaneo-Christov heat and mass fluxes, and other factors on the three-dimensional flow, heat, and mass transfer of a Williamson hybrid nanofluid. The flow occurs over a stretching porous sheet subjected to an external magnetic field, Joule heating, chemical reactions, and heat generation. Methods Copper (Cu) and aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) nanoparticles are suspended in ethylene glycol (C₂C₆O₂) to form the hybrid nanofluid. The governing partial differential equations are transformed into ordinary differential equations using similarity transformations and solved numerically with MATLAB’s bvp4c solver. The study examines various parameters, including stretching ratio, nanoparticle volume fraction, and relaxation times for concentration and thermal effects. Results are validated against existing literature. Results The findings reveal that a higher stretching ratio reduces velocity, temperature, concentration profiles, and local Nusselt and Sherwood numbers, while also lowering skin friction and secondary velocity. Increasing nanoparticle volume fraction decreases velocity and temperature profiles but enhances skin friction, local Nusselt, and Sherwood numbers. Concentration profiles decline with higher concentration relaxation time, while temperature increases with longer thermal relaxation time. Conclusions In conclusion, Cu−Al₂O₃/C₂C₆O₂ hybrid nanofluids demonstrate superior heat and mass transfer capabilities compared to mono-nanofluids. The performance is significantly influenced by parameters such as nanoparticle volume fraction, relaxation times, and the stretching ratio, providing valuable insights for heat and mass transfer applications.

                Background Increased awareness of sustainability has renewed academic interest in understanding perception. The objective was to determine the expected behavior among university students concerning air quality mitigation. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) was used as a theoretical framework to understand students’ attitudes toward air quality mitigation along with subjective norms and perceived behavioral control. Method This study uses the systematic literature review (SLR) methodology to provide an understanding of current studies regarding the aspect of air quality and behavior from databases reviewed by experts. The research highlights the gap in the current study area and provides a need for more detailed empirical research. Result The study reviewed 24 articles and proposed a conceptual model based on the TPB framework to understand the means of air quality mitigation behaviors in a campus environment. Conclusion This model aims to guide future research to improve air quality in higher education institutions. The findings also focuses on theoretical contributions by applying TPB.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27209?af=R">Psychoses of Epilepsy: Unravelling the Phenotypic and Genotypic Features</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>We analyzed the genotypic and phenotypic features of patients with psychosis of epilepsy (POE).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with POE recruited to an epilepsy genetics research program underwent phenotyping and genetic analysis. The latter included screening for rare pathogenic variants in epilepsy genes, and polygenic risk score (PRS) calculation for common risk variants associated with schizophrenia.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>One hundred twenty-two individuals with POE were identified. Eighty-six of 122 of the individuals (70%) had interictal psychosis, with schizophrenia the most common interictal phenotype (36/86, 42%). Twenty-eight of 122 of the individuals (23%) had postictal psychosis (PIP), 2 of 122 of the individuals (2%) had antiseizure medication-induced psychosis, and 6 of 122 of the individuals (5%) had substance-induced psychosis. Focal epilepsies were more frequently associated with PIP (24/28, 86%) compared to interictal psychosis (39/86, 45%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Twenty-nine percent of the patients with POE with genetic data had a rare pathogenic variant: 19 in an epilepsy gene (<i>PCDH19</i>, <i>SCN1A</i>, <i>DEPDC5</i>, <i>KCNT1</i>, <i>CHD2</i>, <i>SLC2A1</i>, <i>NPRL3</i>, <i>CLN3</i>, <i>NPRL3</i>, <i>ATP1A3</i>, and <i>CACNA1A</i>) and 4 had a chromosomal anomaly. Fifty-seven percent of the patients with a rare pathogenic variant had interictal schizophrenia/schizophreniform disorder rather than PIP (9%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). PRSs showed that schizophrenia-related common risk variants were enriched in patients with POE compared to population controls (<i>p</i> = 0.0007), however, among the POE phenotypes, a raised PRS was only observed in interictal schizophrenia (<i>p</i> = 0.015) and not in those with PIP or other interictal POEs.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Interictal POE is threefold more common than PIP, and more likely to be associated with both rare pathogenic variants for epilepsy and common risk variants for schizophrenia. Distinguishing between different POE phenotypes enhances clinical practice and our understanding of etiology, paving the way for precision medicine. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Rapid advances in transcriptomics have driven efforts to identify deregulated pathways in multiple sclerosis (MS) tissues, though many detected differentially expressed genes are likely false positives, with only a small fraction reflecting actual pathological events. Robust, integrative methods are essential for accurately understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying MS pathology.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a gene prioritization analysis of MS white matter pathology transcriptomic studies. Articles were sought in Scopus and PubMed up to July 31, 2024. Potentially eligible publications were those that provided either transcriptomics datasets (deposited in GEO) or lists of differentially expressed genes comparing MS white matter to control white matter.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Applying a vote-count strategy to search for the intersection of genes reported in multiple independent studies with a consistent fold-change direction, followed by a Monte Carlo simulation, we identified 528 highly significant differentially expressed multi-study genes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001; 10,000 simulations). Functional enrichment analysis revealed deregulation of the folate pathway in MS normal-appearing white matter, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -related and complement-related pathways in active and chronic active lesions, respectively. Network analysis identified 6 key signaling hubs: PTPRC, HLA-B, MYC, MMP2, COL11A2, MAG. The major nodes identified revealed mechanistic concordance with published in vivo MS models, supporting their value as potential therapeutic targets.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our strategy provides a robust framework for integrating gene expression data, effectively identifying the intricate pathways altered in human diseased tissues. This method holds potential for translating findings into drug development strategies. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>
