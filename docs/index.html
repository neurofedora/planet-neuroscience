">Longitudinal deep phenotyping in a mouse model of West syndrome reveals temporal dynamics of synapse remodeling, gliosis, and proteomic and lipidomic changes during seizure evolution</a></h4>

              
                Neurodevelopmental disorders can have long-lasting effects, causing not only early pediatric symptoms but also a range of neurological issues throughout adulthood. West syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder marked by infantile spasms, an early symptom that typically subsides with age. However, many patients progress to other seizure forms, known as seizure evolution, which is closely linked to poor long-term outcomes. Despite its clinical significance, the neurobiological mechanisms behind seizure evolution in West syndrome remain poorly understood. Recent genetic studies have consistently identified the CYFIP2 p.Arg87Cys variant in West syndrome patients, and the Cyfip2+/R87C mouse model carrying this mutation has been shown to recapitulate key symptoms of the disorder, including infantile spasms. In this study, we aimed to gain deeper insight into seizure evolution by conducting longitudinal deep phenotyping of the Cyfip2+/R87C mouse model from the neonatal stage to seven months of age. We tracked seizure activity through behavioral and EEG recordings and employed multi-omic analyses, including tissue and single-cell level transcriptomics, ultrastructural analysis, proteomics, and lipidomics, to capture a comprehensive view of molecular and cellular changes. Our results showed that after an initial period of neonatal spasms, Cyfip2+/R87C mice entered a seizure-free phase, followed by spontaneous recurrent seizures in adulthood, ultimately leading to premature death. This progression was associated with synaptic remodeling, sequential activation of different glial cell types, lipid droplet accumulation in astrocytes, and significant proteomic and lipidomic changes in the brain. These findings suggest that seizure evolution in West syndrome involves complex, time-dependent interactions between neurons and glial cells, along with alterations in lipid metabolism. Our study highlights the potential of longitudinal multi-omic approaches to uncover underlying mechanisms of seizure evolution and suggests that targeting these changes could offer novel therapeutic strategies. Additionally, the dataset generated here may provide valuable insights for other epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorder models.

">APOE genotype confers context dependent neurovascular vulnerability in immune-vascularized human forebrain organoids</a></h4>

              
                The APOE gene is a major genetic determinant of neurovascular and immune function, yet the mechanisms by which its isoforms modulate brain vulnerability to pathogenic stress remain incompletely understood. Here, we employ isogenic human iPSC-derived immune vascularized Forebrain Organoid-based Multicellular Assembled Cerebral Organoids (FORMA COs) to dissect isoform-specific responses to a clinically relevant viral challenge. We find that APOE2 and APOE4 FORMA-COs exhibit heightened viral RNA burden and distinct neuroinflammatory profiles compared to APOE3. Specifically, APOE4 promotes IL-1 and VEGFA induction, whereas APOE2 leads to elevated TNF{beta} and VEGFA protein accumulation, indicating divergent pathways of injury. Integrated transcriptomic analyses, combined with known and predicted APOE protein protein interaction networks, reveal genotype dependent enrichment of cytokine signaling, angiogenic remodeling, and immune dysregulation. In vivo validation using humanized mouse models corroborates APOE genotype specific vascular remodeling, microglial activation, and oligodendrocyte perturbation. These findings demonstrate that APOE genotype confers context-specific susceptibility to neuroimmune and vascular injury, providing insight into genetic risk mechanisms underlying infection-related and neurodegenerative brain disorders.

">Linking Brain Entropy to Molecular and Cellular Architecture in Psychosis</a></h4>

              
                Brain entropy reflects the complexity of intrinsic activity and has been associated with cognitive function and psychiatric disorders. However, its relationship with neurochemical and cellular architecture in the brain remains poorly understood. By integrating molecular imaging, and neuroimaging datasets, we provide converging evidence that the spatial distribution of diverse cell types, neurotransmitter systems, and mitochondrial phenotypes is systematically associated with brain entropy. We found significant differences in entropy correlations between normal controls and individuals with schizophrenia for the mu-opioid receptor and dopamine receptor (D1), and between normal controls and bipolar disorder for the norepinephrine transporter (NAT) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA). No significant differences were observed between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in the neurotransmitter domain. In terms of cellular and metabolic features, both the normal controls vs. schizophrenia and normal controls vs. bipolar disorder comparisons revealed widespread differences associated with most mitochondrial markers, as well as glial cells and inhibitory neurons. These findings suggest disruptions in energy metabolism, neuroinflammatory activity, and inhibitory neuronal regulation in the clinical groups. Furthermore, these results indicate that brain entropy is not randomly distributed but is systematically linked to specific neurochemical systems and cellular characteristics. This systems-level perspective offers valuable insights into how the complexity of brain activity emerges from the underlying molecular architecture and how it is altered in psychiatric disorders. Moreover, it provides a biological foundation for understanding brain entropy in the context of psychosis.

">A unified imaging-histology framework for superficial white matter architecture studies in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                The superficial white matter (SWM), immediately beneath the cortical mantle, is thought to play a major role in cortico-cortical connectivity as well as large-scale brain function. Yet, this compartment remains rarely studied due to its complex organization. Our objectives were to develop and disseminate a robust computational framework to study SWM organization based on 3D histology and high-field 7T MRI. Using data from the BigBrain and Ahead 3D histology initiatives, we first interrogated variations in cell staining intensities across different cortical regions and different SWM depths. These findings were then translated to in-vivo 7T quantitative myelin-sensitive MRI, including T1 relaxometry (T1 map) and magnetization transfer saturation (MTsat). As indicated by the statistical moments of the SWM intensity profiles, the first 2 mm below the cortico-subcortical boundary were characterized by high structural complexity. We quantified SWM microstructural variation using a non-linear dimensionality reduction method and examined the relationship of the resulting microstructural gradients with indices of cortical geometry, as well as structural and functional connectivity. Our results showed correlations between SWM microstructural gradients, as well as curvature and cortico-cortical functional connectivity. Our study provides novel insights into the organization of SWM in the human brain and underscores the potential of SWM mapping to advance fundamental and applied neuroscience research.

">Music as a real-time fMRI neurofeedback interface for modulating interhemispheric connectivity: effects on mood and recruitment of the putamen and insula</a></h4>

              
                Music is a universal language that transcends cultures and is deeply rooted in human evolutionary history. Its creation and appreciation recruit the brain's limbic and reward systems, leading to the evocation of emotions ranging from happiness and sadness to tenderness and grief. Here, we explore the potential of music as an interventional tool in a novel neurofeedback experiment. This study introduces and validates a musical interface for real-time fMRI neurofeedback that is adaptable to various experimental paradigms. Using a previously developed motor imagery connectivity-based framework, we evaluate its feasibility and efficacy by comparing the modulation of bilateral premotor cortex (PMC) activity during functional runs with real versus sham (random) feedback in 22 healthy adults. We also assess its performance against a visual feedback interface. The experiment involves a 50-minute MRI session, including anatomical scans, a PMC functional localizer run, and four neurofeedback runs (two with active feedback and two with sham feedback). Pre- and post-session questionnaires assess mood (looking at the behavioral impact of the NF session), musical background (in search of predictors of NF success), and subjective feedback experiences. During neurofeedback, participants perform motor imagery of finger-tapping, with feedback delivered as a dynamic, pre-validated chord progression that evolves or regresses based on the correlation between left and right PMC activity. We found that our implementation of music-based feedback was successful, with participants managing to modulate their own connectivity using the proposed interface. The modulation performance was similar for active and sham NF runs, possible due to the power of music to boost neuromodulation, but the network recruitment was stronger for active NF, including in the insula, putamen, and target ROIs. Behaviorally, we found a decrease in tension and an improvement in the overall mood of the participants after the session. When comparing our results to previous NF data with a visual interface, we found stronger brain activations, in particular in NF-relevant regions such as the insula and the putamen. This work highlights the potential of musical feedback as a more intuitive and engaging interface in neurofeedback protocols, paving the way for enhanced participant experience and training outcomes.

However, functional MRI (fMRI) of these nuclei in humans involves unique challenges due to their size and location deep within the brain. Here, we used ultra-high-field MRI and other methodological advances to investigate the activity of 6 subcortical nuclei during reward anticipation and memory encoding: the locus coeruleus (LC), basal forebrain, median and dorsal raphe nuclei, substantia nigra, and ventral tegmental area. Participants performed a monetary incentive delay task, which successfully induced a state of reward anticipation, and a 24-h delayed surprise memory test. Region-of-interest analyses revealed that activity in all subcortical nuclei increased in anticipation of potential rewards as opposed to neutral outcomes. In contrast, activity in none of the nuclei predicted memory performance 24 h later. These findings provide new insights into the cognitive functions that are supported by the human AAS.</span>

                Background This study investigates the connection between aggregate markups and income inequality, exploring how market power affects inequality in developed, emerging, and developing economies. The analysis aims to reveal how institutional differences and economic systems shape this relationship. Method The study examines data from 12 countries from 1997 to 2016 using a panel data approach. The analysis focuses on key variables such as the Gini index (measuring inequality), lagged markups, trade openness, GDP per capita, tax revenue, poverty, and R&D expenditure. A two-way fixed-effects model is applied to account for country and year-specific differences, while robust standard errors ensure reliability. Results The results show that higher markups are closely linked to greater income inequality, with the impact being particularly pronounced in emerging and developing economies. Integrating tax policies, trade openness, and GDP growth into the analysis indicates the limitations of relying solely on economic growth to achieve equity. The research highlights taxation and trade as effective levers for mitigating inequality and raises important questions about the role of innovation in this dynamic. Conclusion This study shows the interaction between market power and inequality across diverse economic systems. We examine how factors like market concentration and institutional quality drive inequality provides practical insights and policy recommendations for effectively addressing income disparities.

                Background Shaken Baby Syndrome describes serious cranial trauma inflicted upon infants and young children, potentially leading to significant injury or death. This study aims to evaluate parents' knowledge and attitudes regarding Shaken Baby Syndrome in Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in Al-Ahsa, focusing on all reachable parents of young children by using convenience sampling from June 2024 to August 2024, and data was collected using a pre-structured questionnaire. Results A total of 572 eligible parents participated, with ages ranging from 20 to over 40 years. The predominant gender of responders was female, comprising 433 (75.7%). A significant proportion of participants 432 (75.5%) displayed poor overall knowledge of Shaken Baby Syndrome, whereas 140 (24.5%) indicated competent knowledge and awareness. Female gender and parents with multiple children had a significant correlation with parents' understanding of Shaken Baby Syndrome (P< 0.05). Conclusion The study indicated that only around one-quarter of parents demonstrated a competent comprehension of Shaken Baby Syndrome, with mothers exhibiting more awareness. Consequently, health authorities must increase efforts to enhance public awareness of Shaken Baby Syndrome.

                The WWC1 (KIBRA) gene has been repeatedly implicated in cognitive performance, with carriers of the favorable allele showing enhanced episodic memory, spatial ability, and achievements in chess and STEM fields. However, gene-level associations do not reveal the underlying biological mechanisms. Here, we applied a modern proteomic assay coupled with an AI-based protein complex quantification method to elucidate the protein interaction phenotype involving WWC1 in a Scottish cohort (Viking Genes; N = 200). Although the bulk plasma level of WWC1 was not significantly associated with cognitive g factor, several WWC1-containing protein complexes, including the DDR1-WWC1 and the DDR1-PRKCZ-WWC1 complex scores, demonstrated significant associations with cognitive performance. In particular, one standard deviation increase in the normalized DDR1-WWC1 complex score corresponded to about 14% decrease in cognitive g factor (P = 0.024), even with educational attainment adjusted. These findings validate previous genetic studies and highlight the importance of protein-protein interactions in mediating the cognitive effects of WWC1.

                <p>by Jan Babič, Tjasa Kunavar, Erhan Oztop, Mitsuo Kawato</p>

Our study explores how ecological aspects of motor learning enhance survival by improving movement efficiency and mitigating injury risks during task failures. Traditional motor control theories mainly address isolated body movements and often overlook these ecological factors. We introduce a novel computational motor control approach, incorporating ecological fitness and a strategy that alternates between success-driven movement efficiency and failure-driven safety, akin to win-stay/lose-shift tactics. In our experiments, participants performed squat-to-stand movements under novel force perturbations. They adapted effectively through various adaptive motor control mechanisms to avoid falls, reducing failure rates rapidly. The results indicate a high-level ecological controller in human motor learning that switches objectives between safety and movement efficiency, depending on failure or success. This approach is supported by policy learning, internal model adaptation, and adaptive feedback control. Our findings offer a comprehensive perspective on human motor control, integrating risk management in a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for real-world environments.

                <p>by Debby D. Wang, Yuting Huang</p>

With a burgeoning number of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in various fields, biomolecular science has also given a big welcome to advanced AI techniques in recent years. In this broad field, scoring a protein-ligand binding structure to output the binding strength is a crucial problem that heavily relates to computational drug discovery. Aiming at this problem, we have proposed an efficient scoring framework using deep learning techniques. This framework describes a binding structure by a high-resolution atomic graph, places a focus on the inter-molecular interactions and learns the graph in a rational way. For a protein-ligand binding complex, the generated atomic graph reserves key information of the atoms (as graph nodes), and focuses on inter-molecular interactions (as graph edges) that can be identified by introducing multiple distance ranges to the atom pairs within the binding area. To provide more confidence in the predicted binding strengths, we have interpreted the deep learning model from the model level and in a post-hoc analysis. The proposed learning framework has been demonstrated to have competitive performances in scoring and screening tasks, which will prospectively promote the development of related fields further.

                <p>by Xiaoxiao Cheng, Shixian Shen, Ekaterina Ivanova, Gerolamo Carboni, Atsushi Takagi, Etienne Burdet</p>

Humans activate muscles to shape the mechanical interaction with their environment, but can they harness this control mechanism to best sense the environment? We investigated how participants adapt their muscle activation to visual and haptic information when tracking a randomly moving target with a robotic interface. The results exhibit a differentiated effect of these sensory modalities, where participants’ muscle coactivation increases with the haptic noise and decreases with the visual noise, in apparent contradiction to previous results. These results can be explained when considering muscle spring-like mechanics, where stiffness increases with coactivation to regulate motion guidance. Increasing coactivation to more closely follow the motion plan favors accurate visual over haptic information, while decreasing it filters visual noise and relies more on accurate haptic information. We formulated this active sensing mechanism as the optimization of visuo-haptic information and effort. This optimal information and effort (OIE) model can explain the adaptation of muscle activity to unimodal and multimodal sensory information when interacting with fixed or dynamic environments, or with another human, and can be used to optimize human-robot interaction.

Molecular docking is a useful method for predicting the binding affinity and conformation of small chemical entities to support lead optimisation. It is also used to virtually screen a large chemical database to find new chemical entities. There are several docking programs available with different algorithms and varying preparation steps. We identify ten quick tips that apply to molecular docking irrespective of the program one might choose. Our objective is to provide the beginners with important things to keep in mind while using molecular docking for their research. We aim to ensure that experts and beginners can perform molecular docking to yield biologically relevant and reproducible results.

                <p>by Yuru Song, Marcus K. Benna</p>

Cortical neurons often establish multiple synaptic contacts with the same postsynaptic neuron. To avoid functional redundancy of these parallel synapses, it is crucial that each synapse exhibits distinct computational properties. Here we model the current to the soma contributed by each synapse as a sigmoidal transmission function of its presynaptic input, with learnable parameters such as amplitude, slope, and threshold. We evaluate the classification capacity of a neuron equipped with such nonlinear parallel synapses, and show that with a small number of parallel synapses per axon, it substantially exceeds that of the Perceptron. Furthermore, the number of correctly classified data points can increase superlinearly as the number of presynaptic axons grows.
When training with an unrestricted number of parallel synapses, our model neuron can effectively implement an arbitrary aggregate transmission function for each axon, constrained only by monotonicity. Nevertheless, successful learning in the model neuron often requires only a small number of parallel synapses.
We also apply these parallel synapses in a feedforward neural network trained to classify MNIST images, and show that they can increase the test accuracy. This demonstrates that multiple nonlinear synapses per input axon can substantially enhance a neuron’s computational power.

A new study by Suchak et al. describes a sudden, recent explosion in papers analyzing the NHANES health dataset, where similar manuscripts have been described as overwhelming processes at some journals. In this accompanying Primer article, we summarize the study's findings and recommendations. We outline practical steps that publishers, journals, peer reviewers and readers can take to better recognize similarly formulaic, low-value submissions and publications to reduce their research impacts.

                Ongoing digitalization and data-driven developments in materials science and engineering (MSE) emphasize the growing importance of reusing research data and enabling machine accessibility, which requires robust data management and consistent semantic data representation. Ontologies have emerged as powerful tools for establishing interoperable and reusable data structures from inconsistent data structures. Despite advancements in semantic data representation for specific applications, integrating application ontologies with primary data repositories, such as electronic lab notebooks (ELNs), to feed world data remains an open task. As a use case in the MSE domain, this work presents a system based on semantic technologies from the point of view of engineers, developed with the help of information scientists, and unraveled on a small scale. The development of an application ontology (AO) was elaborated for flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) processes with the implementation of a data pipeline. The proposed FSP application ontology emerges from experimental in-house best-practice procedures and is adapted to the mid-level Project Material Digital core ontology (PMDco) to allow interoperability within the MSE domain. The pipeline retrieves manually acquired experimental data from an ELN, translates it into a machine-actionable format, and converts it into a Resource Description Framework (RDF) format to support semantic interoperability. The latter was stored in a triple store with a SPARQL interface, enabling findable and accessible datasets that are searchable and traceable. By creating semantically linked data structures in line with FAIR principles, this approach allows traceable and findable experimental results between stakeholders through both human-readable and machine-actionable formats. Seamless integration of the modular microservices of the data pipeline within established lab practices minimizes disruption while maintaining the software framework. The present work demonstrates the practical implementation of a FAIR data pipeline within a laboratory setting, paving the way for future data-centric science.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-482/v1?src=rss">The perceived barriers to data sharing in health and life sciences: a survey at the University of Bristol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Sharing research data is critical for study validation and reuse, yet challenges persist across disciplines, such as psychology1 and biomedical science2. While global initiatives promote open science, understanding localized barriers in specific academic contexts is vital to implementing effective solutions. Objective To investigate the main perceived barriers and reasons preventing data sharing within the Faculty of Health and Life Sciences (FHLS) at the University of Bristol, a research-intensive university in the UK. Methods We distributed a comprehensive survey to FHLS researchers, addressing logistical, technical, and cultural challenges. A total of 143 participants provided insights into their experiences with data sharing. Results The primary obstacles identified were time constraints and the complexity of the preparation process, with 34% reporting they “usually” or “always” lack sufficient time to adequately prepare their data for sharing. Additional barriers included not having the rights to share (27%), insufficient technical support (15%), and limited incentives within research teams. Moreover, qualitative responses highlighted a lack of confidence in data sharing infrastructure and guidance. Conclusions These findings highlight the importance of targeted interventions to enhance data-sharing practices. Solutions should prioritize data preparation processes, clarify data ownership policies, and offer tailored training programs. Integrating data-sharing requirements into research workflows from the outset could significantly alleviate these challenges. Our study provides actionable recommendations to inform the development of resources and infrastructure that support a culture of open science within the FHLS at the University of Bristol.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1307/v2?src=rss">Terminal efficiency of Peruvian university students in the second specialty programs of a dental school over seven years [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Terminal efficiency (TE), the proportion of students completing academic programs within the expected timeframe, is a critical metric for assessing postgraduate health education quality, yet it remains underexplored in Latin American dental specialties. Efficient training is vital for producing competent professionals to meet regional healthcare demands. This study aimed to determine the TE of Peruvian university students in second specialty dental programs at a Peruvian university from 2017 to 2023. Methods A longitudinal, cross-sectional analysis was conducted using 257 complete records from the university institutional repository. Inclusion criteria encompassed full documentation of admission, academic status, and graduation dates. TE was calculated as the time from document submission to graduation, categorized as ≤1 year or ≥2 years. Statistical analyses included Chi-square tests, non-parametric Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests, Poisson regression, and hierarchical multiple linear regression on log-transformed TE. Results: Mean TE was 0.93 years (SD=1.22), with 72.37% of students (n=186) completing within ≤1 year. Significant variations were observed by submission year (p=0.001) and specialty (p<0.001), with Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology (0.30 years) outperforming Periodontics and Implantology (1.76 years). The submission year was the only significant predictor of mean TE (β=0.144, p<0.001). Conclusion Dental programs of a Peruvian university demonstrate robust TE, though specialty-specific and temporal disparities highlight areas for improvement. Targeted interventions, such as streamlined thesis processes and specialty-specific support, could enhance efficiency, informing educational policy in Latin America.

                Hu et al. discovered that condensation-dependent interaction between EB1, a protein that specifically tracks the growing microtubule plus-ends, and CENP-R, a component of the CCAN complex, regulates mitotic chromosome oscillations. The findings provide new insights into the dynamic linkage between kinetochores and spindle microtubules.

                McFadden et al. find the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) is activated by C-type lectin receptor signaling during Candida albicans infection without protein misfolding. IRE1α enhances calcium flux at the C. albicans-containing phagosome, likely through coordinating ER-phagosome contact sites. IRE1α promotes phagosome maturation and integrity, as well as macrophage fungicidal activity.

                Krell et al. show that mTORC1 in β cells acts as an activity sensor, activated by the same signals that trigger insulin secretion. This activation, in turn, inhibits insulin release via RhoA-dependent actin remodeling, establishing a negative feedback loop that allows β cells to intrinsically regulate their own activity.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00472-3?rss=yes">NANS suppresses NF-κB signaling to promote ferroptosis by perturbing iron homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                Wang et al. report that NANS suppresses colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis by promoting ferroptosis. Phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of NANA upregulate FTH1, disrupting iron homeostasis and inhibiting ferroptosis. This finding suggests that chemically enhancing ferroptosis may be a therapeutic strategy to limit CRC metastasis.

                Bardon et al. show that different anesthetic drugs have similar effects on the phase alignment of neural oscillations across cortical areas. Neighboring regions within a hemisphere become misaligned, while homologous regions across hemispheres are more synchronized. Their results suggest a common mechanism of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness, through realignment of cortical communication.

                Neocortical layer 1 interneurons (L1-INs) regulate network activity and plasticity, yet their inputs remain unclear. Sweeney et al. show that L1-INs respond to sensory stimuli with low trial-to-trial reliability but exhibit feature selectivity. Therefore, L1-INs are key sensory processing sites that may modulate cortex in a stimulus- and state-dependent manner.

                <p>Nature Neuroscience, Published online: 09 May 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01946-x">doi:10.1038/s41593-025-01946-x</a></p>Widespread, slow fluctuations in brain blood flow detected via functional MRI and neural activity are integrated with systemic physiological dynamics across the body. We showed this brain–body integration associates with the arousal response orchestrated by the autonomic nervous system.

                Mollusks are a major component of animal biodiversity and play a critical role in ecosystems and global food security. The Pacific oyster, <i>Crassostrea (Magallana) gigas</i>, is the most farmed bivalve mollusk in the world and is becoming a model species for invertebrate biology. Despite the extensive research on hemocytes, the immune cells of bivalves, their characterization remains elusive. Here, we were able to extensively characterize the diverse hemocytes and identified at least seven functionally distinct cell types and three hematopoietic lineages. A combination of single-cell RNA sequencing, quantitative cytology, cell sorting, functional assays, and pseudo-time analyses was used to deliver a comprehensive view of the distinct hemocyte types. This integrative analysis enabled us to reconcile molecular and cellular data and identify distinct cell types performing specialized immune functions, such as phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species production, copper accumulation, and expression of antimicrobial peptides. This study emphasized the need for more in depth studies of cellular immunity in mollusks and non-model invertebrates and set the ground for further comparative immunology studies at the cellular level.

">Real-time affect decoding in the amygdalo-hippocampal circuit from dynamic auditory signals</a></h4>

              
                Affect decoding from auditory signals requires the temporal tracking and neural processing of dynamic sound patterns, such as in affective speech. Affective speech is commonly expressed to maximize its emotional impact and its neural decoding in integrated medial limbic circuits of recipients. Here we examined how affective speech, which was live produced by speakers to maximize amygdala-hippocampal connectivity in listeners, can evoke significant intralimbic and cortico-limbic affect decoding mechanisms. Aggressive and joyful affective speech that was produced based on real-time feedback of amygdala-hippocampal couplings in listeners increased intralimbic connectivity as well as activity in auditory cortical nodes as parts of a broader affective sound processing network. Neural time courses in the auditory cortex also correlated with acoustic patterns of adaptive speech indicative of a communicative speaker-listener coupling. Affective speech can thus meaningfully influence limbic circuit synchronizations with a specific significance of the amygdala-hippocampal circuit for affect decoding from auditory signals.

">Early downregulation of HC-specific genes in the vestibular sensory epithelium during chronic ototoxicity</a></h4>

              
                Exposure of mammals to ototoxic compounds causes hair cell (HC) loss in the vestibular sensory epithelia of the inner ear. In chronic exposure models, this loss often occurs by extrusion of the HC from the sensory epithelium towards the luminal cavity. HC extrusion is preceded by several steps that begin by detachment and synaptic uncoupling of the cells from the afferent terminals of their postsynaptic vestibular ganglion neurons. To identify gene expression programs driving these responses to chronic ototoxic stress, we performed five RNA-seq control versus treated comparisons involving two species (rat and mouse), two compounds (streptomycin and 3,3'-iminodipropionitrile, IDPN), and three time points in the rat/IDPN model. By comparing the differentially expressed genes and their associated Gene Ontology terms, we identified both common and model-unique expression responses. The earliest and most robust common response was a downregulation of HC-specific genes, including stereocilium (Atp2b2, Xirp2), synaptic (Nsg2), and ion channel genes (Kcnab1, Kcna10), together with new potential biomarkers of HC stress (Vsig10l2). This response was validated by in-situ hybridisation and immunofluorescence analyses. A second common response across species and compounds was the upregulation of the stress mediator Atf3. Model- or time- restricted responses included downregulation of cell-cell adhesion and mitochondrial ATP synthesis genes, and upregulation of interferon response, unfolded protein response and tRNA aminoacylation genes. The present results provide key insights on the responses of the vestibular sensory epithelium to chronic ototoxic stress, potentially relevant to other types of chronic stress.

">A compact multisensory representation of self-motion is sufficient for computing an external world variable</a></h4>

              
                External forces shape navigation, but cannot be directly measured by an animal in motion. How the brain integrates multi-modal cues to estimate external forces remains unclear. Here we investigated the representation of multi-modal self-motion cues across columnar inputs to the fly navigation center, known as PFNs. We find that one type integrates optic flow and airflow direction signals with distinct dynamics. We reveal airspeed encoding by a different type. Based on these data, we construct and validate models of how multi-sensory dynamics are encoded across PFNs, allowing us to simulate neural responses during rapid flight maneuvers. Applying a nonlinear observability analysis to these responses, we show that PFN representations during active maneuvers are sufficient to decode the direction of an external force (wind) during free flight. Our work provides evidence that active sensation, combined with multisensory encoding, can allow a compact nervous system to infer a property of the external world that cannot be directly measured by a single sensory system.

">NAD+ reduction in glutamatergic neurons triggers fatty acid catabolism and neuroinflammation in the brain, mitigated by SARM1 deletion</a></h4>

              
                The importance of NAD+ homeostasis for neuronal health has been emphasized by studies on nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferase 2 (NMNAT2), a NAD+-synthesizing enzyme, and sterile alpha and TIR motif-containing protein 1 (SARM1), a NAD+ hydrolase. NMNAT2 declines caused by neurodegenerative insults activate SARM1 to degenerate axons. To elucidate the impact of the NMNAT2-SARM1 axis on brain energy metabolism, we employed multi-omics approaches to investigate the metabolic effects caused by neuronal NMNAT2 loss. The loss of NMNAT2 in glutamatergic neurons results in a striking metabolic shift in the cerebral cortex from glucose to lipid catabolism, reduced lipid abundance, and pronounced neurodegenerative phenotypes. Proteomic analysis found that neuronal NMNAT2 loss altered levels of glial enzymes central to glucose and lipid metabolism. Genetic deletion of SARM1 in NMNAT2-deficient mice restores lipid metabolism and mitigates neurodegeneration. Taken together, we show that neuronal NAD+ reduction leads to SARM1-dependent maladaptive adaptations in both neurons and glia.

">A Spinal Circuit for Hypoxia-Evoked Motor Output in Zebrafish Larvae</a></h4>

              
                Oxygen availability is a critical environmental variable that shapes animal physiology and behavior. In larval zebrafish, acute hypoxia elicits a distinct increase in rhythmic pectoral fin movements, a behavior thought to facilitate oxygen uptake. While peripheral oxygen sensors such as neuroepithelial cells (NECs) and Merkel-like cells (MLCs) have been well characterized, the motor circuits responsible for executing this behavior remain unknown. Four distinct lower motor nerve branches in the spinal cord have been shown to innervate the pectoral fin muscles and are candidate effectors of hypoxia-induced behaviors. Here, we identify the neural pathways that transform hypoxia detection into a dedicated motor output. Using high-speed behavioral tracking, we confirm that hypoxia reliably increases pectoral fin beat frequency without affecting locomotor tail activity or visually guided swimming. Two-photon calcium imaging in Tg(ChaTa:Gal4;UAS:GCaMP6s) larvae reveals that a subset of cholinergic spinal motor neurons is selectively active during hypoxia-induced fin movements. Targeted laser ablation of pectoral fin motor nerves abolishes the response, demonstrating the necessity of descending input for this behavior. Our findings define a distributed, partially redundant motor circuit that implements a homeostatic fin response to hypoxia. By establishing a mechanistic framework for this behavior in a genetically accessible vertebrate model, this work enables future studies of oxygen sensing, sensorimotor integration, and the neural basis of homeostatic motor control.

">Neural and Computational Mechanisms Underlying One-shot Perceptual Learning in Humans</a></h4>

              
                The ability to quickly learn and generalize is one of the brain's most impressive feats and recreating it remains a major challenge for modern artificial intelligence research. One of the most mysterious one-shot learning abilities displayed by humans is one-shot perceptual learning, whereby a single viewing experience drastically alters visual perception in a long-lasting manner. Where in the brain one-shot perceptual learning occurs and what mechanisms support it remain enigmatic. Combining psychophysics, 7T fMRI, and intracranial recordings, we identify high-level visual cortex as the most likely neural substrate wherein neural plasticity supports one-shot perceptual learning. We further develop a novel deep neural network model incorporating top-down feedback into a vision transformer, which recapitulates and predicts human behavior. The prior knowledge learnt by this model is highly similar to the neural code in the human high-level visual cortex. These results reveal the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying one-shot perceptual learning in humans.

">Measuring neurofilament light in human plasma and cerebrospinal fluid: a comparison of five analytical immunoassays</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Neurofilament light (NfL) is an established biofluid marker of neuroaxonal injury for neurological diseases. Several high-throughput and sensitive immunoassays have been developed to quantify NfL in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), facilitating the use of NfL as a biomarker in research and clinical practice. However, because of the lack of rigorous comparisons of assays, it has been difficult to determine whether data are comparable and whether assay performance differs. Here, we compared the performance of five NfL immunoassays. Methods: To assess the five NfL immunoassays (Fujirebio, ProteinSimple, Quanterix, Roche and Siemens), we used pooled plasma or pooled CSF, as well as unique samples from 20 healthy controls and 20 individuals with El Escorial defined probable or definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), to evaluate precision, parallelism and/or bias. We also examined correlations between plasma and CSF NfL concentrations within and across assays and evaluated their ability to differentiate healthy controls from individuals with ALS. Results: Four of the five assays demonstrated exemplary performance based on our analyses of precision and parallelism. Across the five assays, NfL concentrations were lower in plasma than in CSF, although they displayed a high degree of correlation. We noted bias across assays; plasma NfL concentrations were lowest for the Roche assay and highest for the ProteinSimple assay. In addition, all assays reliably distinguished healthy controls from individuals with ALS using plasma or CSF NfL. Conclusions: Four NfL assays demonstrated similar analytic performance. Alongside performance, other factors such as costs, accessibility, useability, footprint, and intended use, should be considered.

">Intrinsic and TDP-43 dysfunction-induced catabolic stress elicit neuroprotective cellular degradation in ALS-vulnerable motor neurons</a></h4>

              
                Selective neuronal vulnerability is a defining feature of neurodegenerative disorders, exemplified by motor neuron degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The nature of motor neurons underlying this selectivity remains unresolved. Here, by monitoring autophagy at single-cell resolution across the translucent zebrafish spinal cord, we identify motor neurons as the cell population with the highest autophagic flux. Large spinal motor neurons (SMNs), most susceptible to ALS, exhibit higher flux compared to smaller SMNs and ALS-resistant ocular motor neurons. Notably, large SMNs accelerates both autophagy and proteasome-mediated degradation, which are further augmented by TDP-43 loss. Additionally, acceleration of multiple unfolded protein response pathways indicates their innate tendency to accumulate misfolded proteins. Enhanced cellular degradation in large SMNs is neuroprotective as its inhibition halts axon outgrowth. These findings propose that cell size-associated degradation load underlies selective neuronal vulnerability in ALS, highlighting the alleviation of catabolic stress as a target of therapy and prevention.

">Microglial brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) supports the behavioral and synaptogenic effects of ketamine</a></h4>

              
                Microglia have been implicated in the pathogenesis for several psychiatric disorders, yet comparatively little is known about their role in treatments for these conditions. Prior work showed that the rapid-acting antidepressant ketamine increases synaptic density in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling is required for its synaptic and behavioral effects. These studies assumed that neurons were the primary source of BDNF, but other studies have since demonstrated that microglia can produce BDNF in the brain. Still, it remains unclear if microglial BDNF is important for the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine. Our initial studies show that the behavioral and synaptic effects of ketamine are associated with increased Bdnf expression in sorted PFC microglia 24 hours after injection. We then demonstrate that conditional BDNF depletion in microglia (Cx3cr1Cre/+:Bdnffl/fl) reduces GluN2B levels in PFC synaptoneurosomes and attenuates antidepressant-like responses following ketamine treatment compared to genotype controls (Cx3cr1Cre/+:Bdnf+/+). Consistent with this, we found that Cx3cr1Cre/+:Bdnffl/fl mice show no change in dendritic spine density in the PFC following ketamine. These results indicate that microglial BDNF is important for the effects of ketamine on brain and behavior, expanding upon the role of microglia in pharmacological interventions for psychiatric disorders.

">Relating Monosynaptic and Functional Connectivity - Complementary Perspectives on Neural Computation -</a></h4>

              
                Information processing in the brain is thought to result from the coordination of large-scale neuronal activity, but this occurs on a fine neural circuit. Here, we investigate their relationship. First, we estimate monosynaptic connectivity by applying an advanced analysis method to spike trains recorded with high-density microelectrodes and confirm that the estimated neuronal wiring is largely consistent with neuroanatomical and neurophysiological evidence. Second, we simulate calcium imaging signals from the same dataset and confirm that the estimated functional connectivity is influenced by shared inputs and population synchronization on slower timescales. Notably, even with unrealistically fast calcium dynamics, the functional connectivity is only partially consistent with the monosynaptic connectivity. These findings suggest the complementary roles for monosynaptic and functional connectivity: the former provides circuit-level specificity, while the latter reflects emergent system-wide patterns of activity. We propose that an integrative approach combining both perspectives is essential for understanding circuit-level computation in the brain.

">Sex-dependent neural plasticity in response to damage</a></h4>

              
                Plasticity of intact neural tissue in the vicinity of neural damage serves to restoring functionality of circuits. Much remains to be learned about the mechanisms regulating this process and the reported sex differences in recovery outcomes. Here we present the fly gut and its innervation as simplified model to address these questions. We show that gut damage caused by ingestion of toxic agents resulted in plasticity of the enteric neuronal network, manifested as a Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)-dependent increase in neural tissue, which was reversible after a recovery period. Interestingly, males did not display neural plasticity, and masculinization of neurons in females suppressed the damage-dependent neural growth. Together, these findings position the fly gut as a system to investigate the cellular, molecular and sex-specific underpinnings of neural plasticity, with implications for therapeutic advancements in neural circuit recovery.

">High-fidelity, but hypometric spatial localization of afterimages across saccades</a></h4>

              
                Humans typically perceive their visual world as stable and continuous, despite frequent shifts of the retinotopic reference frame caused by saccades. This visual stability is paralleled by the curious case of afterimage movement across saccades: Albeit being stabilized retinotopically, afterimages appear to move in egocentric space wherever the eye moves. While this phenomenon has been known for centuries, the exact relationship between eye and afterimage position remains elusive. Using custom-built presentation hardware in complete darkness, we subjected twelve human observers to a novel task, in which they viewed a bright foveal inducer pulse during fixation, executed a saccade to a previously cued location, and performed spatial localization of the emerging afterimage with respect to a sequence of briefly flashed probes. This psychophysical tracking of afterimages was accompanied by high-precision eye tracking, allowing us to estimate afterimage-movement gain by fitting a dedicated computational model to the data. We found that the size of afterimage movement was tightly contingent upon the size of the corresponding eye movement, but yielding significantly hypometric gains which averaged to 0.94 and were remarkably stable across experimental sessions. Gains were unaffected by (even false) post-saccadic visual feedback and remained constant when saccade amplitudes were successfully adapted to significantly lower gains. Regardless of saccadic adaptation, afterimage-movement gains were inversely related to saccade gain - a finding that could be explained by a parsimonious efference-based model of head-centered visual localization. Our results suggest that afterimage movement across saccades is driven by feedforward prediction of the visual consequences of impending saccades and demonstrate the potential of the afterimage-tracking technique for studying sensorimotor processes involved in active vision.

">Induced long-term potentiation improves synaptic stability and restores network function in ALS motor neurons</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease causing progressive dysfunction and degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. An increasing body of evidence has identified synaptic alterations in patients and experimental models of ALS. Importantly, these have been associated with functional impairments in motor neuron networks, suggesting that synaptic impairments are early events in the disease cascade resulting in functional compensatory reconfigurations. The synapse may therefore represent a disease-modifying target to delay disease progression. In this study, we aimed to stabilize synapses and modify structural connectivity to restore network balance in ALS patient-derived motor neuron networks. To this end, we blocked the potassium channels using tetraethylammonium (TEA) which has been shown to induce chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP). The unperturbed ALS patient-derived motor neuron networks developed clear signs of subtle network dysfunction, including increased firing rate and bursting, and accompanying structural abnormalities. These features were partially restored by temporarily blocking the potassium channels. Specifically, the TEA-treated ALS networks were characterized by a reduction in aberrant branching and stabilization of dendritic spines, alongside a temporary reduction in firing rate and bursting. Furthermore, protein expression assays revealed restoration of dysregulated molecular pathways, including protein synthesis and metabolic pathways, and upregulation of pathways involved in synapse organization in the TEA-treated ALS networks. Collectively, these findings improve our understanding of the association between synaptic impairments and functional alterations in ALS, and demonstrate the relevance of modulating synaptic plasticity to promote network balance.

">Microsaccades do not give rise to a conscious feeling of agency for their sensorimotor consequences in visual perception.</a></h4>

              
                Feeling of agency (FoA)--the experience of controlling one's actions and their outcomes--has been widely studied for bodily movements. Here, we investigated if microsaccades--small ballistic eye movements--are equally characterized by FoA and if intention mediates this sense of control. We measured FoA via intentional binding, a perceived compression between an action and its effect. In our experiments, we presented a vertically oriented grating, rendered invisible during stable fixation by a rapid temporal phase shift (>60 Hz) that became visible when its retinal motion was slowed down by a microsaccade (active condition). The stimulus was embedded in a clock face and observers reported perceived stimulus timing in each trial. Perceived timing of microsaccade-contingent stimulus perception was compared to the replay of a previous microsaccade's retinal consequence (replay condition). Trials without a stimulus were included as a control. To examine the role of intention, we tested this paradigm across two experiments in which observers were either instructed to saccade (intended microsaccades) or fixate (unintended microsaccades). In Experiment 2, no instruction was administered such that any microsaccades were considered spontaneous. Microsaccades--either actively generated or replayed--consistently rendered the stimulus highly visible compared to trials without such movements--provided microsaccade direction and peak velocity aligned with the stimulus's motion. Temporal estimates did not differ between the active and replay conditions for any microsaccade type. This result suggests the absence of temporal binding between eye movements and their sensory consequences, and that intention does not facilitate FoA for small eye movements.

">Tracking White Matter Changes After Stereotaxic Radiosurgery inMiniature Pigs Using structural MRI, DTI, and FDG-PET</a></h4>

              
                Stereotaxic radiosurgery (SRS) non-invasively and precisely ablates brain tumors or glioma located in the location where is surgically inaccessible with the aid of three-dimensional coordination system. This technique can also treat functional or psychiatric disorders, yet its dosimetry and curative mechanism remain to be elucidated. In this study, a miniature pig model was utilized to verify the effect of stereotaxic radiosurgery on a white matter tract with various doses delivered by CyberKnife. As porcine brain bears high resemblance to that of human in size and structure, the potential irradiation-induced change in structures and metabolism was monitored by conventional tools in clinical, including anatomical magnetic resonance image (MRI), diffusion tensor image (DTI) and 18F-Fluoro-D-Glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). The right internal capsule was selected as the surgical target, and a one-year longitudinal study was conducted with whole brain images obtained once per three months. The results indicate that a dose equal to or higher than 60 Gy led to a late-onset radionecrosis which took a period close to 180 d to develop edema and breakage in the blood-brain barrier. In the meanwhile, DTI indices and differential tractography further illustrate a dose- and distance-dependent white matter injury along the tract of internal capsule. In contrast, doses of 40 Gy and below did not result in any discernible harm to the brain structure, but a sustained local inhibition in brain metabolism was observed in some pigs. The modulatory effect of low dose radiation awaits a comprehensive assessment throughout the whole brain in combination with behavioral or cognitive tasks built on pigs. This study showing the dose- and time-dependent changes will improve the understanding of the SRS dosimetry on the white matter and help investigators to decide an optimal window for brain imaging or behavioral assessment to take place on patients.

">Deep three-photon functional imaging in the mouse cortex with adaptive optics</a></h4>

              
                Three-photon (3P) microscopy enables functional imaging at greater depths in the mammalian brain than any other technique with single-cell resolution, owing to greater penetration ability. One of the main challenges of such imaging is tissue-induced optical aberration, which inevitably reduces the excitation confinement at depth. Adaptive optics systems, by using deformable mirrors or other wavefront-shaping devices to compensate for optical distortions, enable real-time correction of these aberrations. In this study, we present a practical adaptive optics-assisted 3P imaging system optimized for in vivo functional recordings in the mouse cortex during behaviour. We introduce a hierarchical, three-level aberration correction strategy that sequentially targets aberration caused by the microscope system, the cranial window, and tissue depth. We demonstrate the application of this aberration correction strategy in two anatomically distinct regions: the prelimbic cortex, adjacent to the superior sagittal sinus, and the somatosensory cortex as a representative lateral cortical area, highlighting how aberration sources vary with imaging geometry. Adaptive optics significantly improved imaging performance in both contexts: restoring cellular visibility adjacent to large vascular structures in the prelimbic cortex, and enhancing signal-to-noise ratio during deep imaging in the lateral somatosensory cortex. Together, our work provides a practical framework for implementing adaptive optics-assisted 3P imaging and optimizing deep in vivo functional imaging performance across diverse cortical environments.

                <p>Principal neurons (PNs) of the lateral superior olive (LSO) are a critical component of brain circuits that compare information between the two ears to extract sound source-location-related cues. LSO PNs are not a homogenous group but differ in their transmitter type, intrinsic membrane properties, and projection pattern to higher processing centers in the inferior colliculus. Glycinergic inhibitory LSO PNs have higher input resistance than glutamatergic excitatory LSO PNs (~double). This suggests that the inhibitory cell type has a lower minimum input or signal intensity required to produce an output (activation threshold) which may impact how they integrate binaural inputs. However, cell-type-specific differences in the strength of synaptic drive could offset or accentuate such differences in intrinsic excitability and have not been assessed. To evaluate this possibility, we used a knock-in mouse model to examine spontaneous and electrically stimulated (evoked) synaptic events in LSO PN types using voltage-clamp technique. Both excitatory and inhibitory spontaneous postsynaptic currents were larger in inhibitory LSO PNs, but evoked events were not. Additionally, we found that LSO PN types had inputs with similar short-term plasticity and number of independent fibers. An important contrast was that inhibitory LSO PNs received inhibitory inputs with slower decay kinetics which could impact integrative functions. These data suggest that synaptic inputs onto LSO PNs are unlikely to offset excitability differences. Differences in activation threshold along with transmitter type and projection laterality may allow for distinct roles for LSO PN types in inferior colliculus information processing.</p>

                <p>Childhood epilepsy is a common and devastating condition, for which many children still do not have adequate treatment. Some children with drug-resistant epilepsy require surgical excision of epileptogenic brain tissue for seizure control, affording the opportunity to study this tissue ex vivo to interrogate human epileptic neurons for potentially hyperexcitable perturbations in intrinsic electrophysiological properties. In this study, we characterized the diversity of layer L2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons (PNs) in ex vivo brain slices from pediatric patients with epilepsy. We found a remarkable diversity in the firing properties of epileptic L2/3 PNs: five distinct subpopulations were identified. Additionally, we investigated whether the etiology of epilepsy influenced the intrinsic neuronal properties of L2/3 PNs when comparing tissue from patients with epilepsy due to malformations of cortical development (MCDs), other forms of epilepsy (OEs), or with deep-seated tumors. When comparing epileptic with control L2/3 PNs, we observed a decrease in voltage sag and lower maximum firing rates. Moreover, we found that MCD and OE L2/3 PNs were mostly similar indicating that epilepsy etiology may not outweigh the influences of epileptiform activity on L2/3 PN physiology. Lastly, we show that the proconvulsant drug, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), leads to increased AP half-width, reduced firing rate accommodation, and slower AHPs. These changes imply that 4-AP induces an increase in [K<sup>+</sup>]<SUB>o</SUB> and a resultant increase in AP duration, leading to the release of more excitatory neurotransmitters per action potential, thereby promoting network hyperexcitability.</p>

                <p>The explore/exploit trade-off is a fundamental property of choice selection during reward-guided decision making, where the "same" choice can reflect either of these internal cognitive states. An unanswered question is whether the execution of a decision provides an underexplored measure of internal cognitive states. Touchscreens are increasingly used across species for cognitive testing and afford the ability to measure the precise location of choice touch responses. We examined how male and female mice in a restless bandit decision making task interacted with a touchscreen to determine if the explore/exploit trade-off, prior reward, and/or sex differences change the variability in the kinetics of touchscreen choices. During exploit states, successive touch responses are closer together than those made in an explore state, suggesting exploit states reflect periods of increased motor stereotypy. Although exploit decisions might be expected to be rewarded more frequently than explore decisions, we find that immediate past reward reduces choice variability independently of explore/exploit state. Male mice are more variable in their interactions with the touchscreen than females, even in low-variability trials such as exploit or following reward. These results suggest that as exploit behavior emerges in reward-guided decision making, all mice become less variable and more automated in both their choice and the actions taken to make that choice, but this occurs on a background of increased male variability. These data uncover the hidden potential for touchscreen decision making tasks to uncover the latent neural states that unite cognition and movement.</p>

                <p>by William R. Shoemaker, Álvaro Sánchez, Jacopo Grilli</p>

Ecology has historically benefited from the characterization of statistical patterns of biodiversity within and across communities, an approach known as macroecology. Within microbial ecology, macroecological approaches have identified universal patterns of diversity and abundance that can be captured by effective models. Experimentation has simultaneously played a crucial role, as the advent of high-replication community time-series has allowed researchers to investigate underlying ecological forces. However, there remains a gap between experiments performed in the laboratory and macroecological patterns documented in natural systems, as we do not know whether these patterns can be recapitulated in the lab and whether experimental manipulations produce macroecological effects. This work aims at bridging the gap between experimental ecology and macroecology. Using high-replication time-series, we demonstrate that microbial macroecological patterns observed in nature exist in a laboratory setting, despite controlled conditions, and can be unified under the Stochastic Logistic Model of growth (SLM). We found that demographic manipulations (e.g., migration) impact observed macroecological patterns. By modifying the SLM to incorporate said manipulations alongside experimental details (e.g., sampling), we obtain predictions that are consistent with macroecological outcomes. By combining high-replication experiments with ecological models, microbial macroecology can be viewed as a predictive discipline.

                <p>by Péter Polcz, István Z. Reguly, Kálmán Tornai, János Juhász, Sándor Pongor, Attila Csikász-Nagy, Gábor Szederkényi</p>

Optimal intervention planning is a critical part of epidemiological control, which is difficult to attain in real life situations. Ordinary differential equation (ODE) models can be used to optimize control but the results can not be easily translated to interventions in highly complex real life environments. Agent-based methods on the other hand allow detailed modeling of the environment but optimization is precluded by the large number of parameters. Our goal was to combine the advantages of both approaches, i.e., to allow control optimization in complex environments. The epidemic control objectives are expressed as a time-dependent reference for the number of infected people. To track this reference, a model predictive controller (MPC) is designed with a compartmental ODE prediction model to compute the optimal level of stringency of interventions, which are later translated to specific actions such as mobility restriction, quarantine policy, masking rules, school closure. The effects of interventions on the transmission rate of the pathogen, and hence their stringency, are computed using PanSim, an agent-based epidemic simulator that contains a detailed model of the environment. The realism and practical applicability of the method is demonstrated by the wide range of discrete level measures that can be taken into account. Moreover, the change between measures applied during consecutive planning intervals is also minimized. We found that such a combined intervention planning strategy is able to efficiently control a COVID-19-like epidemic process, in terms of incidence, virulence, and infectiousness with surprisingly sparse (e.g. 21 day) intervention regimes. At the same time, the approach proved to be robust even in scenarios with significant model uncertainties, such as unknown transmission rate, uncertain time and probability constants. The high performance of the computation allows a large number of test cases to be run. The proposed computational framework can be reused for epidemic management of unexpected pandemic events and can be customized to the needs of any country.

As a result of rapidly accelerating artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, multiple national governments and multinational bodies have launched efforts to address safety, security and ethics issues related to AI models. One high priority among these efforts is the mitigation of misuse of AI models, such as for the development of chemical, biological, nuclear or radiological (CBRN) threats. Many biologists have for decades sought to reduce the risks of scientific research that could lead, through accident or misuse, to high-consequence disease outbreaks. Scientists have carefully considered what types of life sciences research have the potential for both benefit and risk (dual use), especially as scientific advances have accelerated our ability to engineer organisms. Here we describe how previous experience and study by scientists and policy professionals of dual-use research in the life sciences can inform dual-use capabilities of AI models trained using biological data. Of these dual-use capabilities, we argue that AI model evaluations should prioritize addressing those which enable high-consequence risks (i.e., large-scale harm to the public, such as transmissible disease outbreaks that could develop into pandemics), and that these risks should be evaluated prior to model deployment so as to allow potential biosafety and/or biosecurity measures. While biological research is on balance immensely beneficial, it is well recognized that some biological information or technologies could be intentionally or inadvertently misused to cause consequential harm to the public. AI-enabled life sciences research is no different. Scientists’ historical experience with identifying and mitigating dual-use biological risks can thus help inform new approaches to evaluating biological AI models. Identifying which AI capabilities pose the greatest biosecurity and biosafety concerns is necessary in order to establish targeted AI safety evaluation methods, secure these tools against accident and misuse, and avoid impeding immense potential benefits.

                <p>by Daniel Schmid, Heiko Neumann</p>

Object-basd visual attention marks a key process of mammalian perception. By which mechanisms this process is implemented and how it can be interacted with by means of attentional control is not completely understood yet. Incremental binding is a mechanism required in demanding scenarios of object-based attention and is experimentally well investigated. Attention spreads across a representation of the visual object and labels bound elements by constant up-modulation of neural activity. The speed of incremental binding was found to be dependent on the spatial arrangement of distracting elements in the scene and to be scale invariant giving rise to the growth-cone hypothesis. In this work, we propose a neural dynamical model of incremental binding that provides a mechanistic account for these findings. Through simulations, we investigate the model properties and demonstrate how an attentional spreading mechanism tags neurons that participate in the object binding process. They utilize Gestalt properties and eventually show growth-cone characteristics labeling perceptual items by delayed activity enhancement of neuronal firing rates. We discuss the algorithmic process underlying incremental binding and relate it to our model computations. This theoretical investigation encompasses complexity considerations and finds the model to be not only of explanatory value in terms of neurophysiological evidence, but also to be an efficient implementation of incremental binding striving to establish a normative account. By relating the connectivity motifs of the model to neuroanatomical evidence, we suggest thalamo-cortical interactions to be a likely candidate for the flexible and efficient realization suggested by the model. There, pyramidal cells are proposed to serve as the processors of incremental grouping information. Local bottom-up evidence about stimulus features is integrated via basal dendritic sites. It is combined with an apical signal consisting of contextual grouping information which is gated by attentional task-relevance selection mediated via higher-order thalamic representations.

                <p>by Wenjun Zhao, Erica Larschan, Björn Sandstede, Ritambhara Singh</p>

Inferring gene regulatory networks from gene expression data is an important and challenging problem in the biology community. We propose OTVelo, a methodology that takes time-stamped single-cell gene expression data as input and predicts gene regulation across two time points. It is known that the rate of change of gene expression, which we will refer to as gene velocity, provides crucial information that enhances such inference; however, this information is not always available due to the limitations in sequencing depth. Our algorithm overcomes this limitation by estimating gene velocities using optimal transport. We then infer gene regulation using time-lagged correlation and Granger causality via regularized linear regression. Instead of providing an aggregated network across all time points, our method uncovers the underlying dynamical mechanism across time points. We validate our algorithm on 13 simulated datasets with both synthetic and curated networks and demonstrate its efficacy on 9 experimental data sets.

                <p>by Naruemon Rueangkham, Miguel Valle-Inclán Cabello, Franziska Lautenschläger, Rhoda J. Hawkins</p>

We present a model to calculate the displacement and extension of deformable cellular cargo pulled by molecular motors stepping along cytoskeletal filaments. We consider the case of a single type of molecular motor and cytoskeletal filaments oriented in one dimension in opposite directions on either side of a cargo. We model a deformable cargo as a simple elastic spring. We simulate this tug-of-war simple exclusion process model using a Monte Carlo Gillespie algorithm and calculate the displacement and extension of the cargo for different configurations of motors and filaments. We apply our model to kinesin-1 motors on microtubules to investigate whether they are strong enough to translocate and deform the largest cellular cargo, the nucleus. We show that the extension caused by motors on a single microtubule saturates for larger numbers of motors but that the extension and displacement scales linearly with the number of microtubules. We also show how the binding and unbinding behaviors of molecular motors on microtubule filaments affect the nuclear deformation. Our modelling results correspond to experiments on cells treated with the drug kinesore, which is thought to increase rescue events resulting in more stable microtubules and more active kinesin-1 molecular motors bound to them. Both the experiments and our simulations result in nuclear deformation.

Chemical synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is regulated by electrical activity of the motor circuit, but may also be affected by neuromodulation. Here, we assessed the role of neuropeptide signaling in the plasticity of NMJ function in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We show that the CAPS (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activator protein for secretion) ortholog UNC-31, which regulates exocytosis of dense core vesicles, affects both pre- and post-synaptic functional properties, as well as NMJ-mediated locomotion. Despite reduced evoked acetylcholine (ACh) transmission, the loss of <i>unc-31</i> results in a more vigorous response to presynaptic stimulation, i.e., enhanced muscle contraction and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. Based on expression profiles, we identified neuropeptides involved in both cholinergic (FLP-6, FLP-15, NLP-9, NLP-15, NLP-21, and NLP-38) and GABAergic motor neurons (FLP-15, NLP-15), that mediate normal transmission at the NMJ. In the absence of these peptides, neurons fail to upregulate their ACh output in response to increased cAMP signaling; for <i>flp-15; nlp-15</i> double mutants, we observed overall increased postsynaptic currents, indicating that these neuropeptides may be inhibitory. We also identified proprotein convertases encoded by <i>aex-5/kpc-3</i> and <i>egl-3/kpc-2</i> that act synergistically to generate these neuropeptides. We propose that postsynaptic homeostatic scaling, mediated by increased muscle activation, likely through excitability, might compensate for the reduced cholinergic transmission in mutants affected for neuropeptide signaling, thus maintaining net synaptic strength. We show that in the absence of UNC-31 muscle excitability is modulated by upregulating the expression of the muscular L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel EGL-19. Our results unveil a role for neuropeptidergic regulation in synaptic plasticity, linking changes in presynaptic transmission to compensatory changes in muscle excitability.

With the growth of artificial intelligence (AI)-ready datasets such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), new opportunities for data-driven research are being created, but also generating risks of data exploitation by paper mills. In this work, we focus on two areas of potential concern for AI-supported research efforts. First, we describe the production of large numbers of formulaic single-factor analyses, relating single predictors to specific health conditions, where multifactorial approaches would be more appropriate. Employing AI-supported single-factor approaches removes context from research, fails to capture interactions, avoids false discovery correction, and is an approach that can easily be adopted by paper mills. Second, we identify risks of selective data usage, such as analyzing limited date ranges or cohort subsets without clear justification, suggestive of data dredging, and post-hoc hypothesis formation. Using a systematic literature search for single-factor analyses, we identified 341 NHANES-derived research papers published over the past decade, each proposing an association between a predictor and a health condition from the wide range contained within NHANES. We found evidence that research failed to take account of multifactorial relationships, that manuscripts did not account for the risks of false discoveries, and that researchers selectively extracted data from NHANES rather than utilizing the full range of data available. Given the explosion of AI-assisted productivity in published manuscripts (the systematic search strategy used here identified an average of 4 papers per annum from 2014 to 2021, but 190 in 2024–9 October alone), we highlight a set of best practices to address these concerns, aimed at researchers, data controllers, publishers, and peer reviewers, to encourage improved statistical practices and mitigate the risks of paper mills using AI-assisted workflows to introduce low-quality manuscripts to the scientific literature.

<p>Using two different EEG tasks with static and articulating faces, deprivation-induced cortical changes in postlingually deafened individuals were found by means of reduced visual cortex activation and a relationship between these alterations and the CI outcome after 6 months. These alterations are not significantly affected by CI experience.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Although a cochlear implant (CI) can partially restore auditory function, CI recipients show alterations not only in auditory but also in visual cortical processing. Yet, it is not well understood how these visual changes relate to the CI outcome and to what extent these changes are induced by auditory deprivation and the limited CI input, respectively. Here, we present a prospective longitudinal electroencephalography study which examined the deprivation- and CI-induced alterations on cortical face processing by comparing visual evoked potentials (VEP) in CI users before and 6 months after implantation. A group of normal-hearing (NH) listeners served as a control. The participants performed a word-identification task and a face-categorization task to study the cortical processing of static and articulating faces in attended and unattended conditions. The CI candidates and CI users showed a reduced visual-cortex activation, a stronger functional connectivity between the visual and auditory cortex, and a reduced attention effect in the (extended) alpha frequency range (8–18 Hz) when compared to NH listeners. There was a positive correlation between the P1 VEP amplitude recorded before implantation and the speech recognition ability after implantation. Our results suggest that the CI users' alterations in cortical face processing are mainly induced by auditory deprivation and not by CI experience. Importantly, these deprivation-induced changes seem to be related to the CI outcome. Our results suggest that the visual P1 amplitude as recorded <i>before</i> implantation provides an objective index of cortical visual reorganization that may help predict the CI outcome.</p>

[version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Pollution refers to the addition of harmful substances to that level where they cause an effect on the environment, it has three major categories such as water, soil, and air pollution but this report is on water pollution. It occurs when harmful substances contaminate water bodies such as, groundwater, rivers, lakes, and oceans rendering them unfavorable for various purposes for example drinking, recreation, and support to aquatic life. Globally, over 80% of wastewater worldwide is discharged into the water bodies without adequate treatment. In Africa, lack of clean water and sanitation is a significant challenge in many countries, affecting approximately 319 million people. Thus, water pollution is one of the types of pollution that has been threatening the lives of living organisms. Implementing effective policies and strategies can have a profound impact on the environment and local communities. By reducing pollution levels and improving water quality, we can create a healthier environment and decrease the incidence of waterborne diseases, leading to improved health and well-being for residents. The research on water pollution in the River Meizimera Kihihi has important implications for future research, policy and governance, human health, the environment, and communities and society. In conclusion, effective policies can foster community involvement, raise awareness, and promote collective action to address water pollution. By achieving clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), we can contribute to the broader sustainable development goals. This research has important ramifications for future research, policy and governance, human health, the environment, communities, and society. This study investigated the problems of water pollution, its causes, its impact, and the current effort to address the issues along the river of Meizimera-kihihi, Kanugu district, Uganda. Recommendations were made, which included encouraging the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices, industrial processes, and waste management strategies to minimize pollution.

                Background Young people with mental disorders should be offered evidence-based treatments. In 2018, we developed a national evidence portal in Norway providing access to living evidence summaries. This work has been an important contribution to mental health care in Norway but is also a rich data source for exploring the existing research. At the time of this study, eight overviews of overviews (OoO) were published addressing the effects of treatments for attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, psychosis, obsessive compulsive disorder, self-harm and trauma / post-traumatic stress disorder. The objective of this study was to do a secondary analysis of this evidence to describe the state-of-the art in this field, and to map: treatments evaluated for each diagnostic group and the longest time of follow-up treatment comparisons evaluated for more than one diagnostic group Methods We performed a mapping review. Data extraction was performed independently by two authors. All data was entered into Excel. Unique treatment comparisons were visualised in Sunburst diagrams. The longest time of follow-up and treatments evaluated across diagnostic groups were reported in descriptive tables. Results We identified 200 treatment comparisons including a wide variety of interventions. Some diagnoses are treated mostly with pharmaceutical therapies (such as bipolar disorder) or psychological therapy alone or in combination (such as anxiety and psychosis). Others are treated with a broader spectrum of therapeutic approaches (such as depression and ADHD). The evidence supporting most treatments is of low to very low certainty. Ten percent of the comparisons included follow-up assessments beyond 12 months. Cognitive behavioural therapy, dialectic behavioural therapy, physical activity and mindfulness interventions were effective across populations. Conclusions The evidence supporting treatment of mental disorders in young people has important limitations. Future research efforts should address these evidence gaps.

                The taxon Elasmobranchii (sharks and rays) contains one of the most long-established evolutionary lineages of vertebrates with a tantalizing collection of species occupying critical aquatic habitats. To overcome the current limitation in molecular resources, we launched the Squalomix Consortium in 2020 to promote a genome-wide array of molecular approaches, specifically targeting shark and ray species. Among the various bottlenecks in working with elasmobranchs are their elusiveness and low fecundity as well as the large and highly repetitive genomes. Their peculiar body fluid composition has also hindered the establishment of methods to perform routine cell culturing required for their karyotyping. In the Squalomix consortium, these obstacles are expected to be solved through a combination of in-house cytological techniques including karyotyping of cultured cells, chromatin preparation for Hi-C data acquisition, and high fidelity long-read sequencing. The resources and products obtained in this consortium, including genome and transcriptome sequences, a genome browser powered by JBrowse2 to visualize sequence alignments, and comprehensive matrices of gene expression profiles for selected species are accessible through https://github.com/Squalomix/info.

sFCD decreased widely, whereas lFCD increased in PLP patients.
Hub dysfunction in the PreCG/INS/MOG/PCUN correlated with clinical severity.
Seed-based FC showed divergent patterns: diminished intra-hub connectivity versus enhanced DLPFC-directed coupling.
Critical pathways associated with symptom severity: DLPFC-INS and DLPFC-PCUN circuits.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Phantom limb pain (PLP) is prevalent and challenging to treat in amputees, which likely stems from maladaptive cortical reorganization, but the precise mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the cortical remodeling patterns in amputees experiencing PLP, pinpointing key brain regions and neural circuits directly associated with the pain. Eighteen PLP patients and 20 healthy participants were recruited for resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). The functional connectivity density (FCD) mapping method was used to identify PLP-related abnormal local and global signaling hubs. FCD changes were observed within the sensorimotor, pain-processing, and visual stream networks in PLP patients, with the precentral gyrus (PreCG), insula (INS), precuneus (PCUN), and middle occipital gyrus (MOG) identified as key hubs correlated with the visual analog scale (VAS) pain ratings. A voxel-wise functional connectivity (FC) analysis was further performed between the VAS-correlated FCD hubs and the rest of the brain. FC was significantly decreased between the hubs and widespread brain regions. In contrast, increased FC was revealed between the hubs and subregions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (the dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus [SFGdor] and middle frontal gyrus [MFG]). FC of the SFGdor-INS and MFG-PCUN pathways was negatively correlated with VAS pain ratings specifically, likely playing crucial roles in PLP. These results provide novel insights into the critical neural mechanisms of PLP, highlighting valuable targets for developing long-term effective neuromodulation modalities.</p>

                Microglia–neuron interactions are essential for maintaining brain homeostasis. In a recent study, Zhao and colleagues demonstrated that activation of Gi–G-protein-coupled receptors (Gi-GPCRs) on microglia suppresses microglial process dynamics, reduces neuronal activity, and disrupts network synchronization. These findings highlight the role of microglial Gi-GPCR signaling in neuromodulation and its role in network activity in the healthy brain.

The aPVT and pPVT distinctly modulate visceral pain and anxiety via different molecular targets and projection patterns, thus providing evidence for clinically targeted treatment of visceral pain and anxiety.

                Papanikolaou et al. show that deep-layer cortical neurons exhibit abnormally prolonged Ca2+ transients early in Alzheimer’s mouse models. This is linked to suppressed activity and altered tuning of fast-spiking parvalbumin interneurons, mediated by reduced NPTX2 and GluA4, and reversed by NPTX2 overexpression, revealing a deep-layer circuit vulnerability in early Alzheimer’s.

                Li et al. identify NSUN2, an m5C methyltransferase, as a key regulator in AML progression. Their findings reveal that NSUN2 stabilizes PHGDH and SHMT2 mRNAs, promoting serine/glycine biosynthesis and cancer growth. Targeting the NSUN2/m5C axis may offer new therapeutic strategies for AML treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101667">Adolescent alcohol exposure promotes mechanical allodynia and alters synaptic function at inputs from the basolateral amygdala to the prelimbic cortex</a></h4>

              
                Binge drinking is common among adolescents despite mounting evidence linking it to various adverse health outcomes that include heightened pain perception. The prelimbic (PrL) cortex is vulnerable to insult from adolescent alcohol exposure and receives input from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) while sending projections to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) – two brain regions implicated in nociception. In this study, adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure was carried out in male and female rats using a vapor inhalation procedure. Assessments of mechanical and thermal sensitivity revealed that AIE exposure-induced protracted mechanical allodynia. To investigate synaptic function at BLA inputs onto defined populations of PrL neurons, retrobeads and viral labeling were combined with optogenetics and slice electrophysiology. Recordings from retrobead labeled cells in the PrL revealed AIE reduced BLA-driven feedforward inhibition of neurons projecting from the PrL to the vlPAG, resulting in augmented excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance and increased intrinsic excitability. Consistent with this finding, recordings from virally tagged PrL parvalbumin interneurons (PVINs) demonstrated that AIE exposure reduced both E/I balance at BLA inputs onto PVINs and PVIN intrinsic excitability. These findings provide compelling evidence that AIE alters synaptic function and intrinsic excitability within a prefrontal nociceptive circuit.
