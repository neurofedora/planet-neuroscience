              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Ankyrin-R Links Kv3.3 to the Spectrin Cytoskeleton and Is Required for Purkinje Neuron Survival</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ankyrin scaffolding proteins are critical for membrane domain organization and protein stabilization in many different cell types including neurons. In the cerebellum, Ankyrin-R (AnkR) is highly enriched in Purkinje neurons, granule cells, and in the cerebellar nuclei (CN). Using male and female mice with a floxed allele for <I>Ank1</I> in combination with <I>Nestin-Cre</I> and <I>Pcp2-Cre</I> mice, we found that ablation of AnkR from Purkinje neurons caused ataxia, regional and progressive neurodegeneration, and altered cerebellar output. We show that AnkR interacts with the cytoskeletal protein &beta;3 spectrin and the potassium channel Kv3.3. Loss of AnkR reduced somatic membrane levels of &beta;3 spectrin and Kv3.3 in Purkinje neurons. Thus, AnkR links Kv3.3 channels to the &beta;3 spectrin-based cytoskeleton. Our results may help explain why mutations in &beta;3 spectrin and Kv3.3 both cause spinocerebellar ataxia.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Ankyrin scaffolding proteins localize and stabilize ion channels in the membrane by linking them to the spectrin-based cytoskeleton. Here, we show that Ankyrin-R (AnkR) links Kv3.3 K<sup>+</sup> channels to the &beta;3 spectrin-based cytoskeleton in Purkinje neurons. Loss of AnkR causes Purkinje neuron degeneration, altered cerebellar physiology, and ataxia, which is consistent with mutations in Kv3.3 and &beta;3 spectrin causing spinocerebellar ataxia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">MMP2 and MMP9 Activity Is Crucial for Adult Visual Cortex Plasticity in Healthy and Stroke-Affected Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>A fundamental regulator of neuronal network development and plasticity is the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the brain. The ECM provides a scaffold stabilizing synaptic circuits, while the proteolytic cleavage of its components and cell surface proteins are thought to have permissive roles in the regulation of plasticity. The enzymatic proteolysis is thought to be crucial for homeostasis between stability and reorganizational plasticity and facilitated largely by a family of proteinases named matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Here, we investigated whether MMP2 and MMP9 play a role in mediating adult primary visual cortex (V1) plasticity as well as stroke-induced impairments of visual cortex plasticity in mice. In healthy adult mice, selective inhibition of MMP2/9 for 7 d suppressed ocular dominance plasticity. In contrast, brief inhibition of MMP2/9 after a cortical stroke rescued compromised plasticity. Our data indicate that the proteolytic activity of MMP2 and MMP9 is critical and required to be within a narrow range to allow adult visual plasticity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Learning and recovery from injuries depend on the plasticity of neuronal connections. The brain's extracellular matrix (ECM) provides a scaffold for stabilizing synaptic circuits, while its enzymatic proteolysis is hypothesized to regulate homeostasis between stability and reorganizational plasticity. ECM digestion is facilitated by a family of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Here, we show that treatments that inhibit MMP2/9 can either inhibit or rescue cortical plasticity depending on cortical state: in the visual cortex of healthy adult mice, inhibition of MMP2/9 suppressed cortical plasticity. In contrast, brief inhibition of MMP2/9 after a stroke rescued compromised plasticity. Our data provide strong evidence that an optimal level of MMP2/9 proteolytic activity is crucial for adult visual plasticity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Economic Choices under Simultaneous or Sequential Offers Rely on the Same Neural Circuit</a></h4>

              
                <p>A series of studies in which monkeys chose between two juices offered in variable amounts identified in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) different groups of neurons encoding the value of individual options (offer value), the binary choice outcome (chosen juice), and the chosen value. These variables capture both the input and the output of the choice process, suggesting that the cell groups identified in OFC constitute the building blocks of a decision circuit. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis. However, in previous experiments offers were presented simultaneously, raising the question of whether current notions generalize to when goods are presented or are examined in sequence. Recently, <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B2">Ballesta and Padoa-Schioppa (2019)</cross-ref> examined OFC activity under sequential offers. An analysis of neuronal responses across time windows revealed that a small number of cell groups encoded specific sequences of variables. These sequences appeared analogous to the variables identified under simultaneous offers, but the correspondence remained tentative. Thus, in the present study, we examined the relation between cell groups found under sequential versus simultaneous offers. We recorded from the OFC while monkeys chose between different juices. Trials with simultaneous and sequential offers were randomly interleaved in each session. We classified cells in each choice modality, and we examined the relation between the two classifications. We found a strong correspondence; in other words, the cell groups measured under simultaneous offers and under sequential offers were one and the same. This result indicates that economic choices under simultaneous or sequential offers rely on the same neural circuit.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Research in the past 20 years has shed light on the neuronal underpinnings of economic choices. A large number of results indicates that decisions between goods are formed in a neural circuit within the orbitofrontal cortex. In most previous studies, subjects chose between two goods offered simultaneously. Yet, in daily situations, goods available for choice are often presented or examined in sequence. Here we recorded neuronal activity in the primate orbitofrontal cortex alternating trials under simultaneous and under sequential offers. Our analyses demonstrate that the same neural circuit supports choices in the two modalities. Hence, current notions on the neuronal mechanisms underlying economic decisions generalize to choices under sequential offers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Cortico-Cortical Pathway Targets Inhibitory Interneurons and Modulates Paw Movement during Locomotion in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>The primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is important for the control of movement as it encodes sensory input from the body periphery and external environment during ongoing movement. Mouse S1 consists of several distinct sensorimotor subnetworks that receive topographically organized corticocortical inputs from distant sensorimotor areas, including the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and primary motor cortex (M1). The role of the vibrissal S1 area and associated cortical connections during active sensing is well documented, but whether (and if so, how) non-whisker S1 areas are involved in movement control remains relatively unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that unilateral silencing of the non-whisker S1 area in both male and female mice disrupts hind paw movement during locomotion on a rotarod and a runway. S2 and M1 provide major long-range inputs to this S1 area. Silencing S2-&gt;non-whisker S1 projections alters the hind paw orientation during locomotion, whereas manipulation of the M1 projection has little effect. Using patch-clamp recordings in brain slices from male and female mice, we show that S2 projection preferentially innervates inhibitory interneuron subtypes. We conclude that interneuron-mediated S2&ndash;S1 corticocortical interactions are critical for efficient locomotion.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Somatosensory cortex participates in controlling rhythmic movements, such as whisking and walking, but the neural circuitry underlying movement control by somatosensory cortex remains relatively unexplored. We uncover a corticocortical circuit in primary somatosensory cortex that regulates paw orientation during locomotion in mice. We identify neuronal elements that comprise these cortical pathways using pharmacology, behavioral assays, and circuit-mapping methods.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Mapping the Microstructure and Striae of the Human Olfactory Tract with Diffusion MRI</a></h4>

              
                <p>The human sense of smell plays an important role in appetite and food intake, detecting environmental threats, social interactions, and memory processing. However, little is known about the neural circuity supporting its function. The olfactory tracts project from the olfactory bulb along the base of the frontal cortex, branching into several striae to meet diverse cortical regions. Historically, using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to reconstruct the human olfactory tracts has been prevented by susceptibility and motion artifacts. Here, we used a dMRI method with readout segmentation of long variable echo-trains (RESOLVE) to minimize image distortions and characterize the human olfactory tracts <I>in vivo</I>. We collected high-resolution dMRI data from 25 healthy human participants (12 male and 13 female) and performed probabilistic tractography using constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD). At the individual subject level, we identified the lateral, medial, and intermediate striae with their respective cortical connections to the piriform cortex and amygdala (AMY), olfactory tubercle (OT), and anterior olfactory nucleus (AON). We combined individual results across subjects to create a normalized, probabilistic atlas of the olfactory tracts. We then investigated the relationship between olfactory perceptual scores and measures of white matter integrity, including mean diffusivity (MD). Importantly, we found that olfactory tract MD negatively correlated with odor discrimination performance. In summary, our results provide a detailed characterization of the connectivity of the human olfactory tracts and demonstrate an association between their structural integrity and olfactory perceptual function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study provides the first detailed <I>in vivo</I> description of the cortical connectivity of the three olfactory tract striae in the human brain, using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI). Additionally, we show that tract microstructure correlates with performance on an odor discrimination task, suggesting a link between the structural integrity of the olfactory tracts and odor perception. Lastly, we generated a normalized probabilistic atlas of the olfactory tracts that may be used in future research to study its integrity in health and disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Maturation of Temporal Saccade Prediction from Childhood to Adulthood: Predictive Saccades, Reduced Pupil Size, and Blink Synchronization</a></h4>

              
                <p>When presented with a periodic stimulus, humans spontaneously adjust their movements from reacting to predicting the timing of its arrival, but little is known about how this sensorimotor adaptation changes across development. To investigate this, we analyzed saccade behavior in 114 healthy humans (ages 6&ndash;24 years) performing the visual metronome task, who were instructed to move their eyes in time with a visual target that alternated between two known locations at a fixed rate, and we compared their behavior to performance in a random task, where target onsets were randomized across five interstimulus intervals (ISIs) and thus the timing of appearance was unknown. Saccades initiated before registration of the visual target, thus in anticipation of its appearance, were labeled predictive [saccade reaction time (SRT) &lt; 90 ms] and saccades that were made in reaction to its appearance were labeled reactive (SRT &gt; 90 ms). Eye-tracking behavior including saccadic metrics (e.g., peak velocity, amplitude), pupil size following saccade to target, and blink behavior all varied as a function of predicting or reacting to periodic targets. Compared with reactive saccades, predictive saccades had a lower peak velocity, a hypometric amplitude, smaller pupil size, and a reduced probability of blink occurrence before target appearance. The percentage of predictive and reactive saccades changed inversely from ages 8&ndash;16, at which they reached adult-levels of behavior. Differences in predictive saccades for fast and slow target rates are interpreted by differential maturation of cerebellar-thalamic-striatal pathways.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> From the first moments of life, humans are exposed to rhythm (i.e., mother's heartbeat <I>in utero</I>), but the timeline of brain development to promote the identification and anticipation of a rhythmic stimulus, known as temporal prediction, remains unknown. Here, we used saccade reaction time (SRT) in the visual metronome task to differentiate between temporally predictive and reactive responses to a target that alternated at a fixed rate in humans aged 6&ndash;24. Periods of age-related change varied little by target rate, with matured predictive performance evident by mid-adolescence for fast and slow rates. A strong correlation among saccade, pupil, and blink responses during target prediction provides evidence of oculomotor coordination and dampened noradrenergic neuronal activity when generating rhythmic motor responses.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Prediction of Learned Resistance or Helplessness by Hippocampal-Prefrontal Cortical Network Activity during Stress</a></h4>

              
                <p>The perception of control over a stressful experience may determine its impacts and generate resistance against future stressors. Although the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HPC) are implicated in the encoding of stressor controllability, the neural dynamics underlying this process are unknown. Here, we recorded HPC and PFC neural activities in male rats during the exposure to controllable, uncontrollable, or no shocks and investigated electrophysiological predictors of escape performance upon exposure to subsequent uncontrollable shocks. We were able to accurately discriminate stressed from nonstressed animals and predict resistant (R) or helpless (H) individuals based on hippocampal-cortical oscillatory dynamics. Remarkably, R animals exhibited an increase in theta power during CS, while H exhibited a decrease. Furthermore, R exhibited higher HPC to PFC  synchronization during stress. Notably, HPC-PFC  connectivity in the initial stress exposure showed strong correlations with escape performance evaluated days later. R rats also showed stronger  coupling to both  oscillations and neuronal firing in the PFC. Finally, we found that these distinct features of network dynamics collectively formed a pattern that accurately predicted learned resistance and was lacking in H individuals. Our findings suggest that hippocampal-prefrontal network  activity supports cognitive mechanisms of stress coping, whose impairment may underlie vulnerability to stress-related disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The appraisal of adversities as controllable or uncontrollable is key in determining resilience or risk for stress-related disorders. Here, we performed the first electrophysiological investigation during controllable or uncontrollable stress. Pharmacological studies showed that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HPC) encode stressor controllability, and here we identified the neural activity underlying this process. This "neural signature of stressor controllability" accurately predicted resistance to future stressors and was characterized by increased HPC-PFC oscillatory activity in the  frequency (4&ndash;10 Hz). Our findings suggest a new role of frontal  oscillations in adaptive stress coping, integrating its emotional and cognitive functions. We also endorse the potential of this biomarker to guide neurophysiologically-informed and rhythm-based stimulation therapies for depression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Rapid Extraction of the Spatial Distribution of Physical Saliency and Semantic Informativeness from Natural Scenes in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Physically salient objects are thought to attract attention in natural scenes. However, research has shown that meaning maps, which capture the spatial distribution of semantically informative scene features, trump physical saliency in predicting the pattern of eye moments in natural scene viewing. Meaning maps even predict the fastest eye movements, suggesting that the brain extracts the spatial distribution of potentially meaningful scene regions very rapidly. To test this hypothesis, we applied representational similarity analysis to ERP data. The ERPs were obtained from human participants (<I>N</I> = 32, male and female) who viewed a series of 50 different natural scenes while performing a modified 1-back task. For each scene, we obtained a physical saliency map from a computational model and a meaning map from crowd-sourced ratings. We then used representational similarity analysis to assess the extent to which the representational geometry of physical saliency maps and meaning maps can predict the representational geometry of the neural response (the ERP scalp distribution) at each moment in time following scene onset. We found that a link between physical saliency and the ERPs emerged first (~78 ms after stimulus onset), with a link to semantic informativeness emerging soon afterward (~87 ms after stimulus onset). These findings are in line with previous evidence indicating that saliency is computed rapidly, while also indicating that information related to the spatial distribution of semantically informative scene elements is computed shortly thereafter, early enough to potentially exert an influence on eye movements.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Attention may be attracted by physically salient objects, such as flashing lights, but humans must also be able to direct their attention to meaningful parts of scenes. Understanding how we direct attention to meaningful scene regions will be important for developing treatments for disorders of attention and for designing roadways, cockpits, and computer user interfaces. Information about saliency appears to be extracted rapidly by the brain, but little is known about the mechanisms that determine the locations of meaningful information. To address this gap, we showed people photographs of real-world scenes and measured brain activity. We found that information related to the locations of meaningful scene elements was extracted rapidly, shortly after the emergence of saliency-related information.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Representations of Food-Related Attributes in the Human Orbitofrontal Cortex during Choice Deliberation in Anorexia Nervosa</a></h4>

              
                <p>Decisions about what to eat recruit the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and involve the evaluation of food-related attributes such as taste and health. These attributes are used differently by healthy individuals and patients with disordered eating behavior, but it is unclear whether these attributes are decodable from activity in the OFC in both groups and whether neural representations of these attributes are differentially related to decisions about food. We used fMRI combined with behavioral tasks to investigate the representation of taste and health attributes in the human OFC and the role of these representations in food choices in healthy women and women with anorexia nervosa (AN). We found that subjective ratings of tastiness and healthiness could be decoded from patterns of activity in the OFC in both groups. However, health-related patterns of activity in the OFC were more related to the magnitude of choice preferences among patients with AN than healthy individuals. These findings suggest that maladaptive decision-making in AN is associated with more consideration of health information represented by the OFC during deliberation about what to eat.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> An open question about the OFC is whether it supports the evaluation of food-related attributes during deliberation about what to eat. We found that healthiness and tastiness information was decodable from patterns of neural activity in the OFC in both patients with AN and healthy controls. Critically, neural representations of health were more strongly related to choices in patients with AN, suggesting that maladaptive overconsideration of healthiness during deliberation about what to eat is related to activity in the OFC. More broadly, these results show that activity in the human OFC is associated with the evaluation of relevant attributes during value-based decision-making. These findings may also guide future research into the development of treatments for AN.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Visual Motion and Decision-Making in Dyslexia: Reduced Accumulation of Sensory Evidence and Related Neural Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>Children with and without dyslexia differ in their behavioral responses to visual information, particularly when required to pool dynamic signals over space and time. Importantly, multiple processes contribute to behavioral responses. Here we investigated which processing stages are affected in children with dyslexia when performing visual motion processing tasks, by combining two methods that are sensitive to the dynamic processes leading to responses. We used a diffusion model which decomposes response time and accuracy into distinct cognitive constructs, and high-density EEG. Fifty children with dyslexia (24 male) and 50 typically developing children (28 male) 6-14 years of age judged the direction of motion as quickly and accurately as possible in two global motion tasks (motion coherence and direction integration), which varied in their requirements for noise exclusion. Following our preregistered analyses, we fitted hierarchical Bayesian diffusion models to the data, blinded to group membership. Unblinding revealed reduced evidence accumulation in children with dyslexia compared with typical children for both tasks. Additionally, we identified a response-locked EEG component which was maximal over centro-parietal electrodes which indicated a neural correlate of reduced drift rate in dyslexia in the motion coherence task, thereby linking brain and behavior. We suggest that children with dyslexia tend to be slower to extract sensory evidence from global motion displays, regardless of whether noise exclusion is required, thus furthering our understanding of atypical perceptual decision-making processes in dyslexia.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Reduced sensitivity to visual information has been reported in dyslexia, with a lively debate about whether these differences causally contribute to reading difficulties. In this large preregistered study with a blind modeling approach, we combine state-of-the art methods in both computational modeling and EEG analysis to pinpoint the stages of processing that are atypical in children with dyslexia in two visual motion tasks that vary in their requirement for noise exclusion. We find reduced evidence accumulation in children with dyslexia across both tasks, and identify a neural marker, allowing us to link brain and behavior. We show that children with dyslexia exhibit general difficulties with extracting sensory evidence from global motion displays, not just in tasks that require noise exclusion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Representations of Chinese Characters: Evidence from Sublexical Components</a></h4>

              
                <p>Little research has been done about the neural substrate of the sublexical level of Chinese word recognition. In particular, it is unclear how radicals participate in Chinese word processing. We compared two measures of radical combinability, position-general radical combinability (GRC) and position-specific radical combinability (SRC) depending on whether the position of the radical is taken into account. We selected characters with embedded target radicals that had different GRC and SRC measures. These measures were used as predictors in a parametric modulation analysis and a multivariate representational similarity analysis. Human participants with native Mandarin speakers (17 males and 24 females) were asked to read words in search of animal words. Results showed that SRC is a better predictor than GRC in decoding the neural patterns. Whole-brain analysis indicated that SRC is encoded bilaterally in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, pars opercularis, and pars triangularis), the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and a region on the border of the superior parietal lobule and the inferior parietal lobule (SPL/IPL). Region-of-interest-based RSA confirmed the results of the whole-brain analysis. Furthermore, we observed a correlation of another sublexical variable, logographeme composition, with bilateral activity in SPL. Logographemes refer to the basic stroke combinations that form radicals and characters. Finally, we observed involvement of bilateral cerebellum activity in Chinese word recognition. Our findings confirm the importance of sublexical components (SRC and logographeme composition) in Chinese word recognition and also confirm that Chinese word recognition involves more bilateral processing than word recognition in alphabetical languages.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chinese is a logographic language. However, characters contain informative subword components (radicals, logographemes, and strokes). We investigated whether the position of the radical is important. We presented carefully selected words and looked where brain activity correlated with subword information. Results indicate that position-dependent radicals predict brain encoding in a network of regions associated with Chinese word recognition, including higher order regions such as bilateral IFG, MFG, and SPL/IPL. Logographeme composition had an effect as well. Our findings provide strong evidence (1) for the importance of position-specific radical information and logographemes in Chinese word recognition, (2) that current brain imaging techniques are best suited to study these, and (3) that confirms the interactive nature of Chinese character recognition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Presenilin/{gamma}-Secretase Activity Is Located in Acidic Compartments of Live Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Presenilin (PSEN)/-secretase is a protease complex responsible for the proteolytic processing of numerous substrates. These substrates include the amyloid precursor protein (APP), the cleavage of which by -secretase results in the production of &beta;-amyloid (A&beta;) peptides. However, exactly where within the neuron -secretase processes APP C99 to generate A&beta; and APP intracellular domain (AICD) is still not fully understood. Here, we employ novel Fo&#x0308;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based multiplexed imaging assays to directly "visualize" the subcellular compartment(s) in which -secretase primarily cleaves C99 in mouse cortex primary neurons (from both male and female embryos). Our results demonstrate that -secretase processes C99 mainly in LysoTracker-positive low-pH compartments. Using a new immunostaining protocol which distinguishes A&beta; from C99, we also show that intracellular A&beta; is significantly accumulated in the same subcellular loci. Furthermore, we found functional correlation between the endo-lysosomal pH and cellular -secretase activity. Taken together, our findings are consistent with A&beta; being produced from C99 by -secretase within acidic compartments such as lysosomes and late endosomes in living neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetics and histopathology highlight the importance of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing by -secretase in pathogenesis. For the first time, this study has enabled us to directly "visualize" that -secretase processes C99 mainly in acidic compartments such as late endosomes and lysosomes in live neurons. Furthermore, we uncovered that intracellular &beta;-amyloid (A&beta;) is significantly accumulated in the same subcellular loci. Emerging evidence proposes the great importance of the endo-lysosomal pathway in mechanisms of misfolded proteins propagation (e.g., Tau, &alpha;-Syn). Therefore, the predominant processing of C99 and enrichment of A&beta; in late endosomes and lysosomes may be critical events in the molecular cascade leading to AD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Characteristics and long-term outcomes of childhood glaucoma: a retrospective-cohort study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: To evaluate the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with childhood glaucoma. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients with childhood glaucoma who visited the glaucoma clinics at the Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health and the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital between January 2008 and January 2018. The diagnosis was based on the Childhood Glaucoma Research Network classification. We recorded their clinical characteristics and requirement of any glaucoma interventions. Results: A total of 691 eyes from 423 patients were included in this study. The patients predominantly comprised boys. The average follow-up duration was 71.3±63.8 months. The mean age at presentation was 3.9±4.4 years. Most patients presented with a high initial intraocular pressure (IOP). The average intial IOP of all patients was 28.5±11.2 mmHg. Glaucoma associated with non-acquired ocular anomalies (22.9%) was the most common subtype, followed by primary congenital glaucoma (20.8%). We recorded a family history of glaucoma in 6.4% of patients of the 234 patients with an available family history. Most patients had bilateral glaucoma (63.4%) and required at least one intervention (51.5%). The average IOP at the latest follow-up visit was 19.1±10.8 mmHg. All glaucoma types had significantly lower IOP, compared to that at their baselines (all p<0.001). Moreover, most patients had an unfavourable visual acuity (49.5%) at their latest visit. Conclusions: Secondary glaucoma associated with non-acquired ocular anomalies is the most common subtype of glaucoma. The majority of patients had unfavourable visual outcomes. These real-world findings are fundamental to acquire a better understanding of childhood glaucoma.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of physical activity and dietary supplement on fat free mass and bone mass density during weight loss – a systematic review and meta-analysis. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: After a diet- or surgery induced weight loss almost 1/3 of lost weight consists of fat free mass (FFM) if carried out without additional therapy. Exercise training and a sufficient supply of protein, calcium and vitamin D is recommended to reduce the loss of FFM. Objective: To investigate the effect of exercise training, protein, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation on the preservation of FFM during non-surgical and surgical weight loss and of the combination of all interventions together in adults with obesity. Methods: A systematic review was performed with a pairwise meta-analysis and an exploratory network meta-analysis according to the PRISMA statement. Results: Thirty studies were included in the quantitative analysis. The pairwise meta-analysis showed for Exercise Training + High Protein vs. High Protein a moderate and statistically significant effect size (SMD 0.45; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.86), for Exercise Training + High Protein vs. Exercise Training a high but statistically not significant effect size (SMD 0.91; 95% CI -0.59 to 2.41) and for Exercise Training alone vs. Control a moderate but statistically not significant effect size (SMD 0.67; 95% CI -0.25 to 1.60). In the exploratory network meta-analysis three interventions showed statistically significant effect sizes compared to Control and all of them included the treatment Exercise Training. Conclusions: Results underline the importance of exercise training and a sufficient protein intake to preserve FFM during weight loss in adults with obesity. The effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation remains controversial and further research are needed.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">OperonSEQer: A set of machine-learning algorithms with threshold voting for detection of operon pairs using short-read RNA-sequencing data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Raga Krishnakumar, Anne M. Ruffing</p>

Operon prediction in prokaryotes is critical not only for understanding the regulation of endogenous gene expression, but also for exogenous targeting of genes using newly developed tools such as CRISPR-based gene modulation. A number of methods have used transcriptomics data to predict operons, based on the premise that contiguous genes in an operon will be expressed at similar levels. While promising results have been observed using these methods, most of them do not address uncertainty caused by technical variability between experiments, which is especially relevant when the amount of data available is small. In addition, many existing methods do not provide the flexibility to determine the stringency with which genes should be evaluated for being in an operon pair. We present OperonSEQer, a set of machine learning algorithms that uses the statistic and p-value from a non-parametric analysis of variance test (Kruskal-Wallis) to determine the likelihood that two adjacent genes are expressed from the same RNA molecule. We implement a voting system to allow users to choose the stringency of operon calls depending on whether your priority is high recall or high specificity. In addition, we provide the code so that users can retrain the algorithm and re-establish hyperparameters based on any data they choose, allowing for this method to be expanded as additional data is generated. We show that our approach detects operon pairs that are missed by current methods by comparing our predictions to publicly available long-read sequencing data. OperonSEQer therefore improves on existing methods in terms of accuracy, flexibility, and adaptability.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational investigation of blood cell transport in retinal microaneurysms</a></h4>

              
                <p>by He Li, Yixiang Deng, Konstantina Sampani, Shengze Cai, Zhen Li, Jennifer K. Sun, George E. Karniadakis</p>

Microaneurysms (MAs) are one of the earliest clinically visible signs of diabetic retinopathy (DR). MA leakage or rupture may precipitate local pathology in the surrounding neural retina that impacts visual function. Thrombosis in MAs may affect their turnover time, an indicator associated with visual and anatomic outcomes in the diabetic eyes. In this work, we perform computational modeling of blood flow in microchannels containing various MAs to investigate the pathologies of MAs in DR. The particle-based model employed in this study can explicitly represent red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets as well as their interaction in the blood flow, a process that is very difficult to observe <i>in vivo</i>. Our simulations illustrate that while the main blood flow from the parent vessels can perfuse the entire lumen of MAs with small body-to-neck ratio (BNR), it can only perfuse part of the lumen in MAs with large BNR, particularly at a low hematocrit level, leading to possible hypoxic conditions inside MAs. We also quantify the impacts of the size of MAs, blood flow velocity, hematocrit and RBC stiffness and adhesion on the likelihood of platelets entering MAs as well as their residence time inside, two factors that are thought to be associated with thrombus formation in MAs. Our results show that enlarged MA size, increased blood velocity and hematocrit in the parent vessel of MAs as well as the RBC-RBC adhesion promote the migration of platelets into MAs and also prolong their residence time, thereby increasing the propensity of thrombosis within MAs. Overall, our work suggests that computational simulations using particle-based models can help to understand the microvascular pathology pertaining to MAs in DR and provide insights to stimulate and steer new experimental and computational studies in this area.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Modelling how cleaner fish approach an ephemeral reward task demonstrates a role for ecologically tuned chunking in the evolution of advanced cognition</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yosef Prat, Redouan Bshary, Arnon Lotem</p>

What makes cognition “advanced” is an open and not precisely defined question. One perspective involves increasing the complexity of associative learning, from conditioning to learning sequences of events (“chaining”) to representing various cue combinations as “chunks.” Here we develop a weighted graph model to study the mechanism enabling chunking ability and the conditions for its evolution and success, based on the ecology of the cleaner fish <i>Labroides dimidiatus</i>. In some environments, cleaners must learn to serve visitor clients before resident clients, because a visitor leaves if not attended while a resident waits for service. This challenge has been captured in various versions of the ephemeral reward task, which has been proven difficult for a range of cognitively capable species. We show that chaining is the minimal requirement for solving this task in its common simplified laboratory format that involves repeated simultaneous exposure to an ephemeral and permanent food source. Adding ephemeral–ephemeral and permanent–permanent combinations, as cleaners face in the wild, requires individuals to have chunking abilities to solve the task. Importantly, chunking parameters need to be calibrated to ecological conditions in order to produce adaptive decisions. Thus, it is the fine-tuning of this ability, which may be the major target of selection during the evolution of advanced associative learning.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Smell-induced gamma oscillations in human olfactory cortex are required for accurate perception of odor identity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Qiaohan Yang, Guangyu Zhou, Torben Noto, Jessica W. Templer, Stephan U. Schuele, Joshua M. Rosenow, Gregory Lane, Christina Zelano</p>

Studies of neuronal oscillations have contributed substantial insight into the mechanisms of visual, auditory, and somatosensory perception. However, progress in such research in the human olfactory system has lagged behind. As a result, the electrophysiological properties of the human olfactory system are poorly understood, and, in particular, whether stimulus-driven high-frequency oscillations play a role in odor processing is unknown. Here, we used direct intracranial recordings from human piriform cortex during an odor identification task to show that 3 key oscillatory rhythms are an integral part of the human olfactory cortical response to smell: Odor induces theta, beta, and gamma rhythms in human piriform cortex. We further show that these rhythms have distinct relationships with perceptual behavior. Odor-elicited gamma oscillations occur only during trials in which the odor is accurately perceived, and features of gamma oscillations predict odor identification accuracy, suggesting that they are critical for odor identity perception in humans. We also found that the amplitude of high-frequency oscillations is organized by the phase of low-frequency signals shortly following sniff onset, only when odor is present. Our findings reinforce previous work on theta oscillations, suggest that gamma oscillations in human piriform cortex are important for perception of odor identity, and constitute a robust identification of the characteristic electrophysiological response to smell in the human brain. Future work will determine whether the distinct oscillations we identified reflect distinct perceptual features of odor stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Comparative genomics reveals electron transfer and syntrophic mechanisms differentiating methanotrophic and methanogenic archaea</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Grayson L. Chadwick, Connor T. Skennerton, Rafael Laso-Pérez, Andy O. Leu, Daan R. Speth, Hang Yu, Connor Morgan-Lang, Roland Hatzenpichler, Danielle Goudeau, Rex Malmstrom, William J. Brazelton, Tanja Woyke, Steven J. Hallam, Gene W. Tyson, Gunter Wegener, Antje Boetius, Victoria J. Orphan</p>

The anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to sulfate reduction is a microbially mediated process requiring a syntrophic partnership between anaerobic methanotrophic (ANME) archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). Based on genome taxonomy, ANME lineages are polyphyletic within the phylum <i>Halobacterota</i>, none of which have been isolated in pure culture. Here, we reconstruct 28 ANME genomes from environmental metagenomes and flow sorted syntrophic consortia. Together with a reanalysis of previously published datasets, these genomes enable a comparative analysis of all marine ANME clades. We review the genomic features that separate ANME from their methanogenic relatives and identify what differentiates ANME clades. Large multiheme cytochromes and bioenergetic complexes predicted to be involved in novel electron bifurcation reactions are well distributed and conserved in the ANME archaea, while significant variations in the anabolic C1 pathways exists between clades. Our analysis raises the possibility that methylotrophic methanogenesis may have evolved from a methanotrophic ancestor.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Evolutionary plasticity and functional versatility of CRISPR systems</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eugene V. Koonin, Kira S. Makarova</p>

The principal biological function of bacterial and archaeal CRISPR systems is RNA-guided adaptive immunity against viruses and other mobile genetic elements (MGEs). These systems show remarkable evolutionary plasticity and functional versatility at multiple levels, including both the defense mechanisms that lead to direct, specific elimination of the target DNA or RNA and those that cause programmed cell death (PCD) or induction of dormancy. This flexibility is also evident in the recruitment of CRISPR systems for nondefense functions. Defective CRISPR systems or individual CRISPR components have been recruited by transposons for RNA-guided transposition, by plasmids for interplasmid competition, and by viruses for antidefense and interviral conflicts. Additionally, multiple highly derived CRISPR variants of yet unknown functions have been discovered. A major route of innovation in CRISPR evolution is the repurposing of diverged repeat variants encoded outside CRISPR arrays for various structural and regulatory functions. The evolutionary plasticity and functional versatility of CRISPR systems are striking manifestations of the ubiquitous interplay between defense and “normal” cellular functions.

                <p>by Peter Dayan</p>

Psychological and neural distinctions between the technical concepts of “liking” and “wanting” pose important problems for motivated choice for goods. Why could we “want” something that we do not “like,” or “like” something but be unwilling to exert effort to acquire it? Here, we suggest a framework for answering these questions through the medium of reinforcement learning. We consider “liking” to provide immediate, but preliminary and ultimately cancellable, information about the true, long-run worth of a good. Such initial estimates, viewed through the lens of what is known as potential-based shaping, help solve the temporally complex learning problems faced by animals.

                Classic late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN2 disease) is caused by a deficiency of tripeptidyl-peptidase-1. In 2017, the first CLN2 enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) cerliponase alfa (Brineura) was approved by the FDA and EMA. The CLN2 disease clinical rating scale (CLN2 CRS) was developed to monitor loss of motor function, language and vision as well as frequency of generalised tonic clonic seizures. Using CLN2 CRS in an open label clinical trial it was shown that Brineura slowed down the progression of CLN2 symptoms. Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a protein highly expressed in myelinated axons. An increase of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood NfL is found in a variety of neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative, traumatic, and cerebrovascular diseases. We analysed CSF NfL in CLN2 patients treated with Brineura to establish whether it can be used as a possible biomarker of response to therapy. Newly diagnosed patients had CSF samples collected and analysed at first treatment dose and up to 12 weeks post-treatment to look at acute changes. Patients on a compassionate use programme who were already receiving ERT for approximately 1yr had CSF samples collected and NfL analysed over the following 1.3 years (2.3 years post-initiation of ERT) to look at long-term changes. All newly diagnosed patients we investigated with classical late infantile phenotype had high NfL levels >2000 pg/ml at start of treatment. No significant change was observed in NfL up to 12 weeks post-treatment. After one year of ERT, two out of six patients still had high NfL levels, but all patients showed a continued decrease, and all had low NfL levels after two years on ERT. NfL levels appear to correspond and predict improved clinical status of patients on ERT and could be useful as a biomarker to monitor neurodegeneration and verify disease modification in CLN2 patients on ERT.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Neural organization of the third optic neuropil, the lobula, in the highly visual semiterrestrial crab Neohelice granulata</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The visual neuropils (lamina, medulla and lobula complex), of malacostracan crustaceans and hexapods have many organizational principles, cell types and functional properties in common. Information about the cellular elements that compose the crustacean lobula is scarce especially when focusing on small columnar cells. Semiterrestrial crabs possess a highly developed visual system and display conspicuous visually guided behaviors. In particular, <i>Neohelice granulata</i> has been previously used to describe the cellular components of the first two optic neuropils using Golgi impregnation technique. Here, we present a comprehensive description of individual elements composing the third optic neuropil, the lobula, of that same species. We characterized a wide variety of elements (140 types) including input terminals and lobula columnar, centrifugal and input columnar elements. Results reveal a very dense and complex neuropil. We found a frequently impregnated input element (suggesting a supernumerary cartridge representation) that arborizes in the third layer of the lobula and that presents four variants each with ramifications organized following one of the four cardinal axes suggesting a role in directional processing. We also describe input elements with two neurites branching in the third layer, probably connecting with the medulla and lobula plate. These facts suggest that this layer is involved in the directional motion detection pathway in crabs. We analyze and discuss our findings considering the similarities and differences found between the layered organization and components of this crustacean lobula and the lobula of insects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Low power, less occupying area, and improved speed of a 4-bit router/rerouter circuit for low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoders [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are more error-resistant than other forward error-correcting codes. Existing circuits give high power dissipation, less speed, and more occupying area. This work aimed to propose a better design and performance circuit, even in the presence of noise in the channel. Methods: In this research, the design of the multiplexer and demultiplexer were achieved using pass transistor logic. The target parameters were low power dissipation, improved throughput, and more negligible delay with a minimum area. One of the essential connecting circuits in a decoShder architecture is a multiplexer (MUX) and a demultiplexer (DEMUX) circuit. The design of the MUX and DEMUX contributes significantly to the performance of the decoder. The aim of this paper was the design of a 4 × 1 MUX to route the data bits received from the bit update blocks to the parallel adder circuits and a 1 × 4 DEMUX to receive the input bits from the parallel adder and distribute the output to the bit update blocks in a layered architecture LDPC decoder. The design uses pass transistor logic and achieves the reduction of the number of transistors used. The proposed circuit was designed using the Mentor Graphics CAD tool for 180 nm technology. Results: The parameters of power dissipation, area, and delay were considered crucial parameters for a low power decoder. The circuits were simulated using computer-aided design (CAD) tools, and the results depicted a significantly low power dissipation of 7.06 nW and 5.16 nW for the multiplexer and demultiplexer, respectively. The delay was found to be 100.5 ns (MUX) and 80 ns (DEMUX). Conclusion: This decoder’s potential use may be in low-power communication circuits such as handheld devices and Internet of Things (IoT) circuits.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Space-log: a novel approach to inferring gene-gene net-works using SPACE model with log penalty [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Gene expression data have been used to infer gene-gene networks (GGN) where an edge between two genes implies the conditional dependence of these two genes given all the other genes. Such gene-gene networks are of-ten referred to as gene regulatory networks since it may reveal expression regulation. Most of existing methods for identifying GGN employ penalized regression with L1 (lasso), L2 (ridge), or elastic net penalty, which spans the range of L1 to L2 penalty. However, for high dimensional gene expression data, a penalty that spans the range of L0 and L1 penalty, such as the log penalty, is often needed for variable selection consistency. Thus, we develop a novel method that em-ploys log penalty within the framework of an earlier network identification method space (Sparse PArtial Correlation Estimation), and implement it into a R package space-log. We show that the space-log is computationally efficient (source code implemented in C), and has good performance comparing with other methods, particularly for networks with hubs.Space-log is open source and available at GitHub, https://github.com/wuqian77/SpaceLog

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A multi-parameter grading system for optimal fitting of scleral contact lenses [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: While scleral lens practise has improved over the years due to factors such as availability of lenses with better materials and designs as well as experience of practitioners, a lack of objectivity appears to remain in terms of assessment of scleral lens fitting. This prospective observational work aimed to achieve standardization on this front through proposing a grading system for scleral lens fitting. Methods: After application of prosthetic replacement of ocular surface ecosystem (PROSE) devices on the participants’ eyes, four fundamental components for understanding scleral lens fitting such as central and limbal corneal clearance, mid-haptic compression, and alignment of lens edge over anterior sclera were assessed through a series of slit-lamp biomicroscopy imaging as well as with anterior segment optical coherence tomography. FitConnect® was used to modify the device parameters to simulate different grading patterns on the proposed scale. Serial imaging was done for all the different lenses to compose the grading scale. Results: A clinically relevant grading scale was constructed that pictorially demonstrated grades for the different aspect of scleral lens fitting. The grades were conveniently scaled within three categories: “optimal”, “acceptable” and “not acceptable”. Conclusion: The gradation of scleral lens fitting parameters would take a step towards objectifying the assessment patterns in practise. This will also help reducing the gap between a novice and an experienced practitioner in terms of understanding of scleral lens fitting.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Temporal trends of sex differences for COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation, severe disease, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death: a meta-analysis of 229 studies covering over 10M patients [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This review aims to investigate the association of sex with the risk of multiple COVID-19 health outcomes, ranging from infection to death. Methods: Pubmed and Embase were searched through September 2020. We considered studies reporting sex and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. Qualitative and quantitative data were extracted using standardised electronic data extraction forms with the assessment of Newcastle Ottawa Scale for risk of bias. Pooled trends in infection, hospitalization, severity, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death rate were calculated separately for men and women and subsequently random-effects meta-analyses on relative risks (RR) for sex was performed. Results: Of 10,160 titles, 229 studies comprising 10,417,452 patients were included in the analyses. Methodological quality of the included studies was high (6.9 out of 9). Men had a higher risk for infection with COVID-19 than women (RR = 1.14, 95%CI: 1.07 to 1.21). When infected, they also had a higher risk for hospitalization (RR = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.27 to 1.41), higher risk for severe COVID-19 (RR = 1.22, 95%CI: 1.17 to 1.27), higher need for Intensive Care (RR = 1.41, 95%CI: 1.28 to 1.55), and higher risk of death (RR = 1.35, 95%CI: 1.28 to 1.43). Within the period studied, the RR for infection and severity increased for men compared to women, while the RR for mortality decreased for men compared to women. Conclusions: Meta-analyses on 229 studies comprising over 10 million patients showed that men have a higher risk for COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, disease severity, ICU admission and death. The relative risks of infection, disease severity and death for men versus women showed temporal trends with lower relative risks for infection and severity of disease and higher relative risk for death at the beginning of the pandemic compared to the end of our inclusion period.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Reduction in cognitive processing speed surrounding multiple sclerosis relapse</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore the longitudinal relationship between multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses and information processing efficiency among persons with relapsing-remitting MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Swedish nationwide cohort study of persons with incident relapsing-remitting MS (2001-2019). Relapse information and symbol digit modalities test (SDMT) scores were obtained from the Swedish MS Registry. Follow-up was categorized into two periods based on relapse status: “relapse” (90 days pre-relapse to 730 days post-relapse, subdivided into 10 periods) and “remission”. Linear mixed models compared SDMT scores during the relapse periods to SDMT scores recorded during remission (reference) with results reported as β-coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for age, sex, SDMT type (written vs oral), time-varying disease-modifying therapy exposure and sequence of SDMT.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Over a mean (SD) follow-up of 10.7 (4.3) years, 31,529 distinct SDMTs were recorded among 3877 persons with MS. There was a significant decline in information processing efficiency that lasted from 30 days pre-relapse up to 550 days post-relapse, with the largest decline occurring 0-30 days post-relapse (β-coefficient:-4.00 (95%CI: -4.61 to -3.39), relative to the period of remission.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We found evidence of cognitive change up to one month prior to relapse onset. The reduction in SDMT lasted 1.5 years and was clinically significant up to three months post-relapse. These results suggest that the effects of a relapse on cognition are longer than previously thought and highlight the importance of reducing relapse rates as a potential means of preserving cognitive function.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To compare the rate of change in cognition between <i>glucocerebrosidase</i> (<i>GBA)</i> mutation carriers and non-carriers with and without subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) in Parkinson’s disease (PD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical and genetic data from 12 datasets were examined. Global cognition was assessed using the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS). Subjects were examined for mutations in <i>GBA</i> and categorized as <i>GBA</i> carriers with or without DBS (<i>GBA</i>+DBS+, <i>GBA</i>+DBS-), and non-carriers with or without DBS (<i>GBA</i>-DBS+, <i>GBA</i>-DBS-). <i>GBA</i> mutation carriers were subcategorized according to mutation severity (risk variant, mild, severe). Linear mixed modeling was used to compare rate of change in MDRS scores over time among the groups according to <i>GBA</i> and DBS status and then according to <i>GBA</i> severity and DBS status.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Data were available for 367 subjects: 58 <i>GBA</i>+DBS+, 82 <i>GBA</i>+DBS-, 98 <i>GBA</i>-DBS+, and 128 <i>GBA</i>-DBS- subjects who were longitudinal followed (range 36 to 60 months after surgery). Using the MDRS, <i>GBA</i>+DBS+ subjects declined on average 2.02 points/year more than <i>GBA</i>-DBS- subjects (95% CI = -2.35, -1.69), 1.71 points/year more than <i>GBA</i>+DBS- subjects (95% CI = -2.14, -1.28), and 1.49 points/year more than <i>GBA</i>-DBS+ subjects (95% CI = -1.80, -1.18).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although non-randomized, this composite analysis suggests that the combined effects of <i>GBA</i> mutations and STN-DBS negatively impact cognition. We advise that DBS candidates be screened for <i>GBA</i> mutations as part of the pre-surgical decision-making process. We advise that <i>GBA</i> mutation carriers be counseled regarding potential risks associated with STN-DBS and alternative options may be considered.</p>

                Advances in genetic technologies have facilitated the development of new animal models of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), enabling cross-species validation of disease-related phenotypes and exploration of species-specific behaviours. In a recent study, Berg et al. used a rat model of Angelman Syndrome (AS) to identify Ube3a-dependent social behaviours, highlighting potential cross-species convergence and divergence between rodent models.

                Neurodegenerative disorders can alter neural circuitry long before symptoms appear, but the path from early changes to later pathologies is obscure. In this issue of Neuron, Capizzi et al. (2021) show how early axonal growth defects in Huntington’s disease create vulnerability to later degeneration.

                In this issue of Neuron, Zhao et al. (2022) describe the effects of plateau potentials, discharges common in hippocampus but rare in cortex.

                In this issue of Neuron, Natraj et al.

The movements are encoded in a distributed network that is preserved across various hand actions. The neural dynamics are specific to particular hand movements, leading to movement-specific submanifolds in the network.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The pioneer factor hypothesis is not necessary to explain ectopic liver gene activation</a></h4>

              
                The Pioneer Factor Hypothesis (PFH) states that pioneer factors (PFs) are a subclass of transcription factors (TFs) that bind to and open inaccessible sites and then recruit non-pioneer factors (nonPFs) that activate batteries of silent genes. The PFH predicts that ectopic gene activation requires the sequential activity of qualitatively different TFs. We tested the PFH by expressing the endodermal PF FOXA1 and nonPF HNF4A in K562 lymphoblast cells. While co-expression of FOXA1 and HNF4A activated a burst of endoderm-specific gene expression, we found no evidence for a functional distinction between these two TFs. When expressed independently, both TFs bound and opened inaccessible sites, activated endodermal genes, and 'pioneered' for each other, although FOXA1 required fewer copies of its motif for binding. A subset of targets required both TFs, but the predominant mode of action at these targets did not conform to the sequential activity predicted by the PFH. From these results we hypothesize an alternative to the PFH where 'pioneer activity' depends not on categorically different TFs but rather on the affinity of interaction between TF and DNA.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Type I and II PRMTs inversely regulate post-transcriptional intron detention through Sm and CHTOP methylation</a></h4>

              
                Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) are required for the regulation of RNA processing factors. Type I PRMT enzymes catalyze mono- and asymmetric dimethylation; Type II enzymes catalyze mono- and symmetric dimethylation. To understand the specific mechanisms of PRMT activity in splicing regulation, we inhibited Type I and II PRMTs and probed their transcriptomic consequences. Using the newly developed Splicing Kinetics and Transcript Elongation Rates by Sequencing (SKaTER-seq) method, analysis of co-transcriptional splicing demonstrated that PRMT inhibition resulted in altered splicing rates. Surprisingly, co-transcriptional splicing kinetics did not correlate with final changes in splicing of polyadenylated RNA. This was particularly true for retained introns (RI). By using actinomycin D to inhibit ongoing transcription, we determined that PRMTs post-transcriptionally regulate RI. Subsequent proteomic analysis of both PRMT-inhibited chromatin and chromatin-associated polyadenylated RNA identified altered binding of many proteins, including the Type I substrate, CHTOP, and the Type II substrate, SmB. Targeted mutagenesis of all methylarginine sites in SmD3, SmB, and SmD1 recapitulated splicing changes seen with Type II PRMT inhibition, without disrupting snRNP assembly. Similarly, mutagenesis of all methylarginine sites in CHTOP recapitulated the splicing changes seen with Type I PRMT inhibition. Examination of subcellular fractions further revealed that RI were enriched in the nucleoplasm and chromatin. Together, these data demonstrate that, through Sm and CHTOP arginine methylation, PRMTs regulate the post-transcriptional processing of nuclear, detained introns.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cavefish cope with environmental hypoxia by developing more erythrocytes and overexpression of hypoxia inducible genes</a></h4>

              
                Dark caves lacking primary productivity can expose subterranean animals to hypoxia. We used the surface-dwelling (surface fish) and cave-dwelling (cavefish) morphs of <i>Astyanax mexicanus</i> as a model for understanding the mechanisms of hypoxia tolerance in the cave environment. Primitive hematopoiesis, which is restricted to the posterior lateral mesoderm in other teleosts, also occurs in the anterior lateral mesoderm in <i>Astyanax</i>, potentially pre-adapting surface fish for hypoxic cave colonization. Cavefish have enlarged both hematopoietic domains and develop more erythrocytes than surface fish, which are required for normal development in both morphs. Laboratory induced hypoxia suppresses growth in surface fish but not in cavefish. Both morphs respond to hypoxia by overexpressing <i>hypoxia-inducible factor 1</i> (<i>hif1</i>) pathway genes, and some <i>hif1</i> genes are constitutively upregulated in normoxic cavefish to similar levels as in hypoxic surface fish. We conclude that cavefish cope with hypoxia by increasing erythrocyte development and constitutive <i>hif1</i> gene overexpression.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The anterior cingulate cortex and its role in controlling contextual fear memory to predatory threats</a></h4>

              
                Predator exposure is a life-threatening experience and elicits learned fear responses to the context in which the predator was encountered. The anterior cingulate area (ACA) occupies a pivotal position in a cortical network responsive to predatory threats, and it exerts a critical role in processing fear memory. The experiments were made in mice and revealed that the ACA is involved in both the acquisition and expression of contextual fear to predatory threat. Overall, the ACA can provide predictive relationships between the context and the predator threat and influences fear memory acquisition through projections to the basolateral amygdala and perirhinal region and the expression of contextual fear through projections to the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray. Our results expand previous studies based on classical fear conditioning and open interesting perspectives for understanding how the ACA is involved in processing contextual fear memory to ethologic threatening conditions that entrain specific medial hypothalamic fear circuits.

                <b>Background:</b> Risk factors or interventions may affect the variability                    as well as the mean of health outcomes. Understanding this can aid aetiological                    understanding and public health translation, in that interventions which shift                    the outcome mean and reduce variability are typically preferable to those which                    affect only the mean. However, most commonly used statistical tools do not test                    for differences in variability. Tools that do have few epidemiological                    applications to date, and fewer applications still have attempted to explain                    their resulting findings. We thus provide a tutorial for investigating this                    using GAMLSS (Generalised Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Activation by cleavage of the epithelial Na+ channel α and γ subunits independently coevolved with the vertebrate terrestrial migration</a></h4>

              
                Vertebrates evolved mechanisms for sodium conservation and gas exchange in conjunction with migration from aquatic to terrestrial habitats. Epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channel (ENaC) function is critical to systems responsible for extracellular fluid homeostasis and gas exchange. ENaC is activated by cleavage at multiple specific extracellular polybasic sites, releasing inhibitory tracts from the channel’s α and γ subunits. We found that proximal and distal polybasic tracts in ENaC subunits coevolved, consistent with the dual cleavage requirement for activation observed in mammals. Polybasic tract pairs evolved with the terrestrial migration and the appearance of lungs, coincident with the ENaC activator aldosterone, and appeared independently in the a and g subunits. In summary, sites within ENaC for protease activation developed in vertebrates when renal Na<sup>+</sup> conservation and alveolar gas exchange was required for terrestrial survival.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Allosteric modulation of the adenosine A2A receptor by cholesterol</a></h4>

              
                Cholesterol is a major component of the cell membrane and commonly regulates membrane protein function. Here, we investigate how cholesterol modulates the conformational equilibria and signaling of the adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor (A<sub>2A</sub>R) in reconstituted phospholipid nanodiscs. This model system conveniently excludes possible effects arising from cholesterol-induced phase separation or receptor oligomerization and focuses on the question of allostery. GTP hydrolysis assays show that cholesterol weakly enhances the basal signaling of A<sub>2A</sub>R while decreasing the agonist EC<sub>50</sub>. Fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>19</sup>F NMR) spectroscopy shows that this enhancement arises from an increase in the receptor’s active state population and a G-protein-bound precoupled state. <sup>19</sup>F NMR of fluorinated cholesterol analogs reveals transient interactions with A<sub>2A</sub>R, indicating a lack of high-affinity binding or direct allosteric modulation. The combined results suggest that the observed allosteric effects are largely indirect and originate from cholesterol-mediated changes in membrane properties, as shown by membrane fluidity measurements and high-pressure NMR.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The role of action potential changes in depolarization-induced failure of excitation contraction coupling in mouse skeletal muscle</a></h4>

              
                Excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) is the process by which electrical excitation of muscle is converted into force generation. Depolarization of skeletal muscle resting potential contributes to failure of ECC in diseases such as periodic paralysis, intensive care unit acquired weakness and possibly fatigue of muscle during vigorous exercise. When extracellular K<sup>+</sup> is raised to depolarize the resting potential, failure of ECC occurs suddenly, over a narrow range of resting potentials. Simultaneous imaging of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and recording of action potentials (APs) demonstrated failure to generate Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients when APs peaked at potentials more negative than –30mV. An AP property that closely correlated with failure of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient was the integral of AP voltage with respect to time. Simultaneous recording of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and APs with electrodes separated by 1.6mm revealed AP conduction fails when APs peak below –21mV. We hypothesize propagation of APs and generation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are governed by distinct AP properties: AP conduction is governed by AP peak, whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is governed by AP integral. The reason distinct AP properties may govern distinct steps of ECC is the kinetics of the ion channels involved. Na channels, which govern propagation, have rapid kinetics and are insensitive to AP width (and thus AP integral) whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is governed by gating charge movement of Cav1.1 channels, which have slower kinetics such that Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is sensitive to AP integral. The quantitative relationships established between resting potential, AP properties, AP conduction and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients provide the foundation for future studies of failure of ECC induced by depolarization of the resting potential.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Functional profiling of long intergenic non-coding RNAs in fission yeast</a></h4>

              
                Eukaryotic genomes express numerous long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) that do not overlap any coding genes. Some lincRNAs function in various aspects of gene regulation, but it is not clear in general to what extent lincRNAs contribute to the information flow from genotype to phenotype. To explore this question, we systematically analysed cellular roles of lincRNAs in <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>. Using seamless CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing, we deleted 141 lincRNA genes to broadly phenotype these mutants, together with 238 diverse coding-gene mutants for functional context. We applied high-throughput colony-based assays to determine mutant growth and viability in benign conditions and in response to 145 different nutrient, drug, and stress conditions. These analyses uncovered phenotypes for 47.5% of the lincRNAs and 96% of the protein-coding genes. For 110 lincRNA mutants, we also performed high-throughput microscopy and flow cytometry assays, linking 37% of these lincRNAs with cell-size and/or cell-cycle control. With all assays combined, we detected phenotypes for 84 (59.6%) of all lincRNA deletion mutants tested. For complementary functional inference, we analysed colony growth of strains ectopically overexpressing 113 lincRNA genes under 47 different conditions. Of these overexpression strains, 102 (90.3%) showed altered growth under certain conditions. Clustering analyses provided further functional clues and relationships for some of the lincRNAs. These rich phenomics datasets associate lincRNA mutants with hundreds of phenotypes, indicating that most of the lincRNAs analysed exert cellular functions in specific environmental or physiological contexts. This study provides groundwork to further dissect the roles of these lincRNAs in the relevant conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Development, validation and application of a machine learning model to estimate salt consumption in 54 countries</a></h4>

              
                Global targets to reduce salt intake have been proposed but their monitoring is challenged by the lack of population-based data on salt consumption. We developed a machine learning (ML) model to predict salt consumption at the population level based on simple predictors and applied this model to national surveys in 54 countries. We used 21 surveys with spot urine samples for the ML model derivation and validation; we developed a supervised ML regression model based on: sex, age, weight, height, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. We applied the ML model to 54 new surveys to quantify the mean salt consumption in the population. The pooled dataset in which we developed the ML model included 49,776 people. Overall, there were no substantial differences between the observed and ML-predicted mean salt intake (p&lt;0.001). The pooled dataset where we applied the ML model included 166,677 people; the predicted mean salt consumption ranged from 6.8 g/day (95% CI: 6.8-6.8 g/day) in Eritrea to 10.0 g/day (95% CI: 9.9-10.0 g/day) in American Samoa. The countries with the highest predicted mean salt intake were in Western Pacific. The lowest predicted intake was found in Africa. The country-specific predicted mean salt intake was within reasonable difference from the best available evidence. A ML model based on readily available predictors estimated daily salt consumption with good accuracy. This model could be used to predict mean salt consumption in the general population where urine samples are not available.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptional and cell type profiles of cortical brain regions showing ultradian cortisol rhythm dependent responses to emotional face stimulation</a></h4>

              
                The characteristic endogenous circadian rhythm of plasma glucocorticoid concentrations is made up from an underlying ultradian pulsatile secretory pattern. Recent evidence has indicated that this ultradian cortisol pulsatility is crucial for normal emotional response in man. In this study, we investigate the anatomical transcriptional and cell type signature of brain regions sensitive to a loss of ultradian rhythmicity in the context of emotional processing. We combine human cell type and transcriptomic atlas data of high spatial resolution with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We show that the loss of cortisol ultradian rhythm alters emotional processing response in cortical brain areas that are characterized by transcriptional and cellular profiles of GABAergic function. We find that two previously identified key components of rapid non-genomic GC signaling - the ANXA1 gene and retrograde endocannabinoid signaling - show top differential expression and the most significant enrichment. Our results further indicate that specific cell types, including a specific NPY-expressing GABAergic neuronal cell type, and specific G protein signaling cascades underly the cerebral effects of a loss of ultradian cortisol rhythm. Our results provide a biological mechanistic underpinning of our fMRI findings, indicating specific cell types and cascades as a target for manipulation in future experimental studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The neural dynamics associated with computational complexity</a></h4>

              
                Many everyday tasks require people to solve computationally complex problems. However, little is known about the effects of computational hardness on the neural processes associated with solving such problems. Here, we draw on computational complexity theory to address this issue. We performed an experiment in which participants solved several instances of the 0-1 knapsack problem, a combinatorial optimization problem, while undergoing ultra-high field (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Instances varied in two task-independent measures of intrinsic computational hardness: complexity and proof hardness. We characterise a network of brain regions whose activation was correlated with both measures but in distinct ways, including the anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the intra-parietal sulcus/angular gyrus. Activation and connectivity changed dynamically as a function of complexity and proof hardness, in line with theoretical computational requirements. Overall, our results suggest that computational complexity theory provides a suitable framework to study the effects of computational hardness on the neural processes associated with solving complex cognitive tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep slow-wave oscillations trigger seizures in a genetic epilepsy model of Dravet syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is the brain state when cortical activity decreases and memory consolidates. However, in human epileptic patients, including genetic epileptic seizures such as Dravet syndrome, sleep is the preferential period when epileptic spike-wave discharges (SWDs) appear, with more severe epileptic symptoms in female patients than male patients, which influencing patient sleep quality and memory. Currently, seizure onset mechanisms during sleep period still remain unknown. Our previous work has shown that the sleep-like state-dependent synaptic potentiation mechanism can trigger epileptic SWDs (Zhang et al., 2021). In this study, using one heterozygous (het) knock-in (KI) transgenic mice (GABAA receptor {gamma}2 subunit Gabrg2Q390X mutation) and an optogenetic method, we hypothesized that slow-wave oscillations (SWOs) themselves in vivo could trigger epileptic seizures. We found that epileptic SWDs in het Gabrg2+/Q390X KI mice exhibited preferential incidence during NREM sleep period, accompanied by motor immobility/ facial myoclonus/vibrissal twitching, with more frequent incidence in female het KI mice than male het KI mice. Optogenetic induced SWOs in vivo significantly increased epileptic seizure incidence in het Gabrg2+/Q390X KI mice with increased duration of NREM sleep or quiet-wakeful states. Furthermore, suppression of SWO-related homeostatic synaptic potentiation by 4-(diethylamino)-benzaldehyde (DEAB) injection (i.p.) greatly decreased seizure incidence in het KI mice, suggesting that SWOs did trigger seizure activity in het KI mice. In addition, EEG delta-frequency (0.1-4 Hz) power spectral density during NREM sleep was significantly larger in female het Gabrg2+/Q390X KI mice than male het Gabrg2+/Q390X KI mice, which likely contributes to the gender difference in seizure incidence during NREM sleep/quiet-wake as that in human patients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Resting-State Network Analysis of Suicide Attempt History in the UK Biobank</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prior research has identified altered brain structure and function in individuals at risk for self-directed violence thoughts and behaviors. However, these studies have largely utilized healthy controls and findings have been inconsistent. Thus, this study examined differences in resting-state functional network connectivity among individuals with lifetime suicide attempt(s) versus lifetime self-directed violence thoughts alone. Methods: Using data from the UK Biobank, this study utilized a series of linear regressions to compare individuals with lifetime suicide attempt(s) (n = 566) versus lifetime self-directed violence thoughts alone (n = 3,447) on within- and between- network resting-state functional connectivity subnetworks. Results: There were no significant between-group differences for between-network, within-network, or whole-brain functional connectivity after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, and body mass index and performing statistical corrections for multiple comparisons. Conclusions: Resting-state network measures may not differentiate between individuals with lifetime suicide attempt(s) and lifetime self-directed violence thoughts alone. Null findings diverge from results reported in smaller neuroimaging studies of suicide risk, but are consistent with null findings in other large-scale studies and meta-analyses. Strengths of the study include its large sample size and stringent control group. Future research on a wider array of imaging, genetic, and psychosocial risk factors can clarify relative contributions of individual and combined variables to suicide risk and inform scientific understanding of ideation-to-action framework.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Drosophila Mechanical Nociceptors Preferentially Sense Localized Poking</a></h4>

              
                Mechanical nociception is an evolutionarily conserved sensory process required for the survival of living organisms. Previous studies have revealed much about the neural circuits and key sensory molecules in mechanical nociception, but the cellular mechanisms adopted by nociceptors in force detection remain elusive. To address this issue, we study the mechanosensation of a fly larval nociceptor (class IV da neurons, c4da) using a customized mechanical device. We find that c4da are sensitive to mN-scale forces and make uniform responses to the forces applied at different dendritic regions. Moreover, c4da showed a greater sensitivity to more localized forces, consistent with them being able to sense the poking of sharp objects, such as wasp ovipositor. Further analysis reveals that high morphological complexity, mechanosensitivity to lateral tension and active signal propagation in the dendrites altogether facilitate the mechanosensitivity and sensory features of c4da. In particular, we discover that Piezo and Ppk1/Ppk26, two key mechanosensory molecules, make differential but additive contributions to the mechanosensation of c4da. In all, our results provide updates into understanding how c4da process mechanical signals at the cellular level and reveal the contributions of key molecules.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Texture-like representation of objects in human visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                The human visual ability to recognize objects and scenes is widely thought to rely on representations in category-selective regions of visual cortex. These representations could support object vision by specifically representing objects, or, more simply, by representing complex visual features regardless of the particular spatial arrangement needed to constitute real world objects. That is, by representing visual textures. To discriminate between these hypotheses, we leveraged an image synthesis approach that, unlike previous methods, provides independent control over the complexity and spatial arrangement of visual features. We found that human observers could easily detect a natural object among synthetic images with similar complex features that were spatially scrambled. However, observer models built from BOLD responses from category-selective regions, as well as a model of macaque inferotemporal cortex and Imagenet-trained deep convolutional neural networks, were all unable to identify the real object. This inability was not due to a lack of signal-to-noise, as all of these observer models could predict human performance in image categorization tasks. How then might these texture-like representations in category-selective regions support object perception? An image-specific readout from category-selective cortex yielded a representation that was more selective for natural feature arrangement, showing that the information necessary for object discrimination is available. Thus, our results suggest that the role of human category-selective visual cortex is not to explicitly encode objects but rather to provide a basis set of texture-like features that can be infinitely reconfigured to flexibly learn and identify new object categories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential mosquito attraction to humans is associated with skin-derived carboxylic acid levels</a></h4>

              
                Female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes feed on human blood, which they use to develop their eggs. It has been widely noted that some people are more attractive to mosquitoes than others, but the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon is poorly understood. Here we tested mosquito attraction to skin odor collected from human subjects and identified people who are exceptionally attractive or unattractive to mosquitoes. Notably, these preferences were stable over several years, indicating consistent longitudinal differences in skin odor between subjects. We carried out gas chromatography/quadrupole time of flight-mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical composition of human skin odor in these subjects and discovered that highly attractive people produce significantly increased levels of carboxylic acids. Consistent with the hypothesis that odor concentration is a major driver of differential attraction, mosquitoes could reliably distinguish a highly attractive human from their weakly attractive counterparts unless we substantially diluted the odor of the most attractive subject. Our work suggests that an increased abundance of mosquito attractants on the preferred subject explains differential attraction, rather than the non-preferred skin odor blend being repellent. Mosquitoes detect carboxylic acids with a large family of odor-gated ion channels encoded by the Ionotropic Receptor gene superfamily. Mutant mosquitoes lacking any of the Ionotropic Receptor (IR) co-receptors Ir8a, Ir25a, and Ir76b, were severely impaired in attraction to human scent but retained the ability to differentiate highly and weakly attractive people. The link between elevated carboxylic acids in mosquito-magnet human skin odor and phenotypes of genetic mutations in carboxylic acid receptors suggests that such compounds contribute to differential mosquito attraction. Understanding why some humans are more attractive than others will provide insights into what skin odorants are most important to the mosquito and could inform the development of more effective repellents.

                Background: The application of insecticides for malaria vector control has led to a global problem, which is the current trend of increased resistance against these chemicals. This study aimed to review the insecticide resistance status was previously determined in Asia and how to implement the necessary interventions. Moreover, the implications of resistance in malaria vector control in this region were studied. Methods: This systematic review was conducted using a predefined protocol based on PRISMA-retrieved articles from four science databases, namely ProQuest, Science Direct, EBSCO, and PubMed in the last ten years (2009 to 2019). The searching process utilized four main combinations of the following keywords: malaria, vector control, insecticide, and Asia. In ProQuest, malaria control, as well as an insecticide, were used as keywords. The following criteria were included in the filter, namely full text, the source of each article, scholarly journal, Asia, and publication date as in the last ten years. Results: There were 1408 articles retrieved during the initial search (ProQuest=722, Science Direct=267, EBSCO=50, PubMed=285, and Scopus=84). During the screening, 27 articles were excluded because of duplication, 1361 based on title and abstract incompatibility with the inclusion criteria, and 20 due to content differences. In the final screening process, 15 articles were chosen to be analyzed. From the 15 articles, it is known that there was organochlorine (DDT), organophosphate (malathion), and pyrethroids resistance in several Anopheles species with a less than 80% mortality rate. Conclusion: This review found multiple resistance in several Anopheles includes resistance to pyrethroid. The reports of pyrethroid resistance were quite challenging because it is considered effective in the malaria vector control. Several countries in Asia are implementing an insecticide resistance management (IRM) strategy against malaria vectors following the Global Plan for IRM.

Methods: Applying long-term personal vital care data for 28 months for an elderly patient, I investigated and evidenced adverse reactions after the first dose of the COVID-19 Pfizer vaccination. Results: The precise, detailed, and continuous data statistically clarified the long-term fevers associated with no meals or drinks. Interrupted time series analysis showed significant and fluctuating increases of body temperatures, pressures, and pulses, although solely long-term plots showed an abrupt and timely increase in these vital data after the vaccine. Conclusions: Anorexia was fatal, and newly reported in the present care records since the patient received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.

Pandemic management requires reliable and efficient dynamical simulation to predict and control disease spreading. The COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is mitigated by several non-pharmaceutical interventions, but it is hard to predict which of these are the most effective for a given population. We developed the computationally effective and scalable, agent-based microsimulation framework <i>PanSim</i>, allowing us to test control measures in multiple infection waves caused by the spread of a new virus variant in a city-sized societal environment using a unified framework fitted to realistic data. We show that vaccination strategies prioritising occupational risk groups minimise the number of infections but allow higher mortality while prioritising vulnerable groups minimises mortality but implies an increased infection rate. We also found that intensive vaccination along with non-pharmaceutical interventions can substantially suppress the spread of the virus, while low levels of vaccination, premature reopening may easily revert the epidemic to an uncontrolled state. Our analysis highlights that while vaccination protects the elderly from COVID-19, a large percentage of children will contract the virus, and we also show the benefits and limitations of various quarantine and testing scenarios. The uniquely detailed spatio-temporal resolution of <i>PanSim</i> allows the design and testing of complex, specifically targeted interventions with a large number of agents under dynamically changing conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Formation, collective motion, and merging of macroscopic bacterial aggregates</a></h4>

              
                <p>by George Courcoubetis, Manasi S. Gangan, Sean Lim, Xiaokan Guo, Stephan Haas, James Q. Boedicker</p>

Chemotactic bacteria form emergent spatial patterns of variable cell density within cultures that are initially spatially uniform. These patterns are the result of chemical gradients that are created from the directed movement and metabolic activity of billions of cells. A recent study on pattern formation in wild bacterial isolates has revealed unique collective behaviors of the bacteria <i>Enterobacter cloacae</i>. As in other bacterial species, <i>Enterobacter cloacae</i> form macroscopic aggregates. Once formed, these bacterial clusters can migrate several millimeters, sometimes resulting in the merging of two or more clusters. To better understand these phenomena, we examine the formation and dynamics of thousands of bacterial clusters that form within a 22 cm square culture dish filled with soft agar over two days. At the macroscale, the aggregates display spatial order at short length scales, and the migration of cell clusters is superdiffusive, with a merging acceleration that is correlated with aggregate size. At the microscale, aggregates are composed of immotile cells surrounded by low density regions of motile cells. The collective movement of the aggregates is the result of an asymmetric flux of bacteria at the boundary. An agent-based model is developed to examine how these phenomena are the result of both chemotactic movement and a change in motility at high cell density. These results identify and characterize a new mechanism for collective bacterial motility driven by a transient, density-dependent change in motility.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Terrestrial reproduction and parental care drive rapid evolution in the trade-off between offspring size and number across amphibians</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Andrew I. Furness, Chris Venditti, Isabella Capellini</p>

The trade-off between offspring size and number is central to life history strategies. Both the evolutionary gain of parental care or more favorable habitats for offspring development are predicted to result in fewer, larger offspring. However, despite much research, it remains unclear whether and how different forms of care and habitats drive the evolution of the trade-off. Using data for over 800 amphibian species, we demonstrate that, after controlling for allometry, amphibians with direct development and those that lay eggs in terrestrial environments have larger eggs and smaller clutches, while different care behaviors and adaptations vary in their effects on the trade-off. Specifically, among the 11 care forms we considered at the egg, tadpole and juvenile stage, egg brooding, male egg attendance, and female egg attendance increase egg size; female tadpole attendance and tadpole feeding decrease egg size, while egg brooding, tadpole feeding, male tadpole attendance, and male tadpole transport decrease clutch size. Unlike egg size that shows exceptionally high rates of phenotypic change in just 19 branches of the amphibian phylogeny, clutch size has evolved at exceptionally high rates in 135 branches, indicating episodes of strong selection; egg and tadpole environment, direct development, egg brooding, tadpole feeding, male tadpole attendance, and tadpole transport explain 80% of these events. By explicitly considering diversity in parental care and offspring habitat by stage of offspring development, this study demonstrates that more favorable conditions for offspring development promote the evolution of larger offspring in smaller broods and reveals that the diversity of parental care forms influences the trade-off in more nuanced ways than previously appreciated.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>A major challenge in multiple sclerosis (MS) research is the understanding of silent progression and Progressive MS. Using a novel method to accurately capture upper cervical cord area from legacy brain MRI scans we aimed to study the role of spinal cord and brain atrophy for silent progression and conversion to secondary progressive disease (SPMS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>From a single-center observational study, all RRMS (n = 360) and SPMS (n = 47) patients and 80 matched controls were evaluated. RRMS patient subsets who converted to SPMS (n = 54) or silently progressed (n = 159), respectively, during the 12-year observation period were compared to clinically matched RRMS patients remaining RRMS (n = 54) or stable (n = 147), respectively. From brain MRI, we assessed the value of brain and spinal cord measures to predict silent progression and SPMS conversion.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients who developed SPMS showed faster cord atrophy rates (−2.19%/yr) at least 4 years before conversion compared to their RRMS matches (−0.88%/yr, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Spinal cord atrophy rates decelerated after conversion (−1.63%/yr, <i>p</i> = 0.010) towards those of SPMS patients from study entry (−1.04%). Each 1% faster spinal cord atrophy rate was associated with 69% (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) and 53% (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) shorter time to silent progression and SPMS conversion, respectively.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Silent progression and conversion to secondary progressive disease are predominantly related to cervical cord atrophy. This atrophy is often present from the earliest disease stages and predicts the speed of silent progression and conversion to Progressive MS. Diagnosis of SPMS is rather a late recognition of this neurodegenerative process than a distinct disease phase. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

     alt="Handedness impacts the neural correlates of kinesthetic motor imagery and execution: A FMRI study"/>
<p>We are the first investigating the effects of participant's handedness in a motor imagery (MI) and movement execution task in both right and left-handed individuals at the cortical and subcortical levels. Twenty-six right-handed and 25 left-handed participants were studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging during the imagination and execution of repetitive self-paced movements of squeezing a ball with their dominant, non-dominant, and both hands. Our results highlight differences in the functional organization of motor areas in right and left-handed people, supporting the hypothesis that MI is influenced by the way people habitually perform motor actions. </p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The human brain functional lateralization has been widely studied over the past decades, and neuroimaging studies have shown how activation of motor areas during hand movement execution (ME) is different according to hand dominance. Nevertheless, there is no research directly investigating the effects of the participant's handedness in a motor imagery (MI) and ME task in both right and left-handed individuals at the cortical and subcortical level. Twenty-six right-handed and 25 left-handed participants were studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging during the imagination and execution of repetitive self-paced movements of squeezing a ball with their dominant, non-dominant, and both hands. Results revealed significant statistical difference (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) between groups during both the execution and the imagery task with the dominant, non-dominant, and both hands both at cortical and subcortical level. During ME, left-handers recruited a spread bilateral network, while in right-handers, activity was more lateralized. At the critical level, MI between-group analysis revealed a similar pattern in right and left-handers showing a bilateral activation for the dominant hand. Differentially at the subcortical level, during MI, only right-handers showed the involvement of the posterior cerebellum. No significant activity was found for left-handers. Overall, we showed a partial spatial overlap of neural correlates of MI and ME in motor, premotor, sensory cortices, and cerebellum. Our results highlight differences in the functional organization of motor areas in right and left-handed people, supporting the hypothesis that MI is influenced by the way people habitually perform motor actions.</p>

                <p>Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is a chronic sleep disorder correlated with loss of hypocretin(orexin). In NT1 post-mortem brains, we observed 88% reduction in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-positive neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and significantly less CRH-positive fibers in the median eminence, while CRH-neurons in the locus coeruleus and thalamus, and other PVN neuronal populations were spared: i.e. vasopressin, oxytocin, tyrosine hydroxylase and thyrotropin releasing hormone-expressing neurons. Other hypothalamic cell groups, i.e. the suprachiasmatic, ventrolateral preoptic, infundibular and supraoptic nuclei and nucleus basalis of Meynert were unaffected. The surprising selective decrease in CRH-neurons provide novel targets for diagnostics and therapeutic interventions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Ethical Perspectives on Treatment Options with Spinal Muscular Atrophy Patients</a></h4>

              
                <p>Since 2016, three innovative therapies for spinal muscular atrophy have changed the face of disease. Although these therapies often result in remarkable improvements in infants and children, benefits in adults are modest and treatment is not curative. Concerns have been raised about the enormous costs of these medications, the ultimate burden to taxpayers, and the costs to society of withholding treatments and sacrificing or disadvantaging some individuals. Physicians are best positioned to serve our patients by carefully considering the costs, benefits, implications for quality of life, and the interplay of these factors within the framework of core ethical principles that guide clinical care.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Risk factors for phenoconversion in REM sleep behavior disorder</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To follow up predictive factors for α-synuclein-related neurodegenerative diseases in a multicenter cohort of idiopathic/isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with iRBD from 12 centers underwent a detailed assessment for potential environmental and lifestyle risk factors via a standardized questionnaire at baseline. Patients were then prospectively followed and received assessments for parkinsonism or dementia during follow-up. The cumulative incidence of parkinsonism or dementia was estimated with competing risk analysis. Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the predictive value of environmental/lifestyle factors over a follow-up period of 11 years, adjusting for age, sex, and center.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 319 patients who were free of parkinsonism or dementia, 281 provided follow-up information. After a mean follow-up of 5.8 years, 130 (46.3%) patients developed neurodegenerative disease. The overall phenoconversion rate was 24.2% after 3 years, 44.8% after 6 years, and 67.5% after 10 years. Patients with older age (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.05), and nitrate derivative use (aHR 2.18) were more likely to phenoconvert, whereas prior pesticide exposure (aHR 0.21–0.64), rural living (aHR 0.53), lipid-lowering medication use (aHR 0.59), and respiratory medication use (aHR 0.36) were associated with lower phenoconversion risk. Risk factors for those converting to primary dementia and parkinsonism were generally similar, with dementia-first converters having lower coffee intake and beta-blocker intake, and higher occurrence of family history of dementia.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings elucidate the predictive values of environmental factors and comorbid conditions in identifying RBD patients at higher risk of phenoconversion.</p>

     alt="A comparative study of pre-alpha islands in the entorhinal cortex from selected primates and in lissencephaly"/>
<p>The drawing at the top shows coronal sections through a gyrified human brain (at left) and a lissencephalic (‘’smooth,” i.e., lacking normal convolutions) human brain (at right). The lower half of the image shows exemplary images of primate brains with a strongly gyrified cortex (<i>Pongo pygmaeus</i>) versus a comparatively smooth brain surface (<i>Perodicticus potto</i>). Although the pre-alpha layer in <i>Pongo pygmaeus</i> (at left) displays cellular islands, these are lacking in the lissencephalic primate (at right). The images are identical to those shown in Figure 1.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The entorhinal cortex (EC) is the main interface between the sensory association areas of the neocortex and the hippocampus. It is crucial for the evaluation and processing of sensory data for long-term memory consolidation and shows damage in many brain diseases, for example, neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and developmental disorders.</p>
<p>The pre-alpha layer of the EC in humans (layer II) displays a remarkable distribution of neurons in islands. These cellular islands give rise to a portion of the perforant path—the major reciprocal data stream for neocortical information into the hippocampal formation. However, the functional relevance of the morphological appearance of the pre-alpha layer in cellular islands and the precise timing of their initial appearance during primate evolution are largely unknown. Here, we conducted a comparative study of the EC from 38 nonhuman primates and <i>Homo sapiens</i> and found a strong relationship between gyrification index (GI) and the presence of the pre-alpha cellular islands. The formation of cellular islands also correlated with brain and body weight as well as neopallial volume. In the two human lissencephalic cases, the cellular islands in the pre-alpha layer were lacking. These findings emphasize the relationship between cortical folding and island formation in the EC from an evolutionary perspective and suggest a role in the pathomechanism of developmental brain disorders.</p>

                Cui et al. demonstrate that glutamate is required for itch transmission in MRGPRA3+ primary afferents, which also use the neuropeptide NMB to enhance signaling. Because both glutamate and Nmb are broadly available in primary afferents, this suggests that distinct neurotransmitters are not necessary to confer itch modality specificity.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Ebola virus delta peptide is an enterotoxin</a></h4>

              
                Melnik et al. use the murine ligated ileal loop model to demonstrate that delta peptide is a potent enterotoxin. Intestinal fluid accumulation, alteration of villous architecture, and loss of goblet cells follow injection of delta peptide. Delta peptide induces diarrhea via direct cellular damage and regulation of fluid secretion.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium uses anaerobic respiration to overcome propionate-mediated colonization resistance</a></h4>

              
                Propionate, a short-chain fatty acid produced by the gut microbiota, is proposed to mediate colonization resistance against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Tm). Here, Shelton et al. show that nitrate-dependent propionate metabolism fuels pathogen expansion in the inflamed gut, allowing S. Tm to overcome propionate's inhibitory effects.

                Grenier et al. show that pharmacological AMPK activation by GSK621 induces an unfolded protein response (UPR) that is mainly driven by PERK activation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AMPK/PERK activation results in mitochondrial apoptosis, and GSK621 increases the anti-leukemic activity of the Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax in AML preclinical models.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">CXCL4 drives fibrosis by promoting several key cellular and molecular processes</a></h4>

              
                Dysregulation of extracellular matrix homeostasis can lead to fibrotic disorders. Affandi et al. find that CXCL4 mediates fibrosis in multiple in vivo models by acting directly on endothelial cells and stromal cells, transforming them into myofibroblasts with excessive collagen production. Targeting CXCL4 suppresses fibrosis development, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy.

                The threshold for LTP induction changes depending on neuronal activity. Ueda et al. show the inhibitory mechanism of structural LTP (i.e., metaplasticity) in chronically excited neurons. Two independent mechanisms of GluN2B-dependent Ca2+ influx and CaMKII downstream in the signaling for structural LTP contribute to the increase of structural LTP threshold.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transcriptional regulation of neural stem cell expansion in adult hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Experience governs neurogenesis from radial-glial neural stem cells (RGLs) in the adult hippocampus to support memory. Transcription factors in RGLs integrate physiological signals to dictate self-renewal division mode. Whereas asymmetric RGL divisions drive neurogenesis during favorable conditions, symmetric divisions prevent premature neurogenesis while amplifying RGLs to anticipate future neurogenic demands. The identities of transcription factors regulating RGL symmetric self-renewal, unlike those that regulate RGL asymmetric self-renewal, are not known. Here, we show in mice that the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 9 (<i>Klf9</i>) is elevated in quiescent RGLs and inducible, deletion of <i>Klf9</i> promotes RGL activation state. Clonal analysis and longitudinal intravital 2-photon imaging directly demonstrate that Klf9 functions as a brake on RGL symmetric self-renewal. <i>In vivo</i> translational profiling of RGLs lacking Klf9 generated a molecular blueprint for RGL symmetric self-renewal that was characterized by upregulation of genetic programs underlying Notch and mitogen signaling, cell-cycle, fatty acid oxidation and lipogenesis. Together, these observations identify Klf9 as a transcriptional regulator of neural stem cell expansion in the adult hippocampus.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Autophagosomes fuse to phagosomes and facilitate the degradation of apoptotic cells in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                Autophagosomes are double-membrane intracellular vesicles that degrade protein aggregates, intracellular organelles, and other cellular components. During the development of the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, many somatic and germ cells undergo apoptosis. These cells are engulfed and degraded by their neighboring cells. We discovered a novel role of autophagosomes in facilitating the degradation of apoptotic cells using a real-time imaging technique. Specifically, the double-membrane autophagosomes in engulfing cells are recruited to the surfaces of phagosomes containing apoptotic cells and subsequently fuse to phagosomes, allowing the inner vesicle to enter the phagosomal lumen. Mutants defective in the production of autophagosomes display significant defects in the degradation of apoptotic cells, demonstrating the importance of autophagosomes to this process. The signaling pathway led by the phagocytic receptor CED-1, the adaptor protein CED-6, and the large GTPase dynamin (DYN-1) promotes the recruitment of autophagosomes to phagosomes. Moreover, the subsequent fusion of autophagosomes with phagosomes requires the functions of the small GTPase RAB-7 and the HOPS complex components. Further observations suggest that autophagosomes provide apoptotic cell-degradation activities in addition to and in parallel of lysosomes. Our findings reveal that, unlike the single-membrane, <span class="underline">L</span>C3-<span class="underline">a</span>ssociated <span class="underline">p</span>hagocytosis (LAP) vesicles reported for mammalian phagocytes, the canonical double-membrane autophagosomes facilitate the clearance of <i>C. elegans</i> apoptotic cells. These findings add autophagosomes to the collection of intracellular organelles that contribute to phagosome maturation, identify novel crosstalk between the autophagy and phagosome maturation pathways, and discover the upstream signaling molecules that initiate this crosstalk.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Chlamydomonas ARMC2/PF27 is an obligate cargo adapter for IFT of radial spokes</a></h4>

              
                Intraflagellar transport (IFT) carries proteins into flagella but how IFT trains interact with the large number of diverse proteins required to assemble flagella remains largely unknown. Here, we show that IFT of radial spokes in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> requires ARMC2/PF27, a conserved armadillo repeat protein associated with male infertility and reduced lung function. <i>Chlamydomonas</i> ARMC2 was highly enriched in growing flagella and tagged ARMC2 and the spoke protein RSP3 comigrated on anterograde trains. In contrast, a cargo and an adapter of inner and outer dynein arms moved independently of ARMC2, indicating that unrelated cargoes distribute stochastically onto the IFT trains. After concomitant unloading at the flagellar tip, RSP3 attached to the axoneme whereas ARMC2 diffused back to the cell body. In <i>armc2/pf27</i> mutants, IFT of radial spokes was abolished and the presence of radial spokes was limited to the proximal region of flagella. We conclude that ARMC2 is a cargo adapter required for IFT of radial spokes to ensure their assembly along flagella. ARMC2 belongs to a growing class of cargo-specific adapters that enable flagellar transport of preassembled axonemal substructures by IFT.

                Hyperventilation reliably provokes seizures in patients diagnosed with absence epilepsy. Despite this predictable patient response, the mechanisms that enable hyperventilation to powerfully activate absence seizure-generating circuits remain entirely unknown. By utilizing gas exchange manipulations and optogenetics in the WAG/Rij rat, an established rodent model of absence epilepsy, we demonstrate that absence seizures are highly sensitive to arterial carbon dioxide, suggesting that seizure-generating circuits are sensitive to pH. Moreover, hyperventilation consistently activated neurons within the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus, a structure implicated in seizure generation.  We show that intralaminar thalamus also contains pH-sensitive neurons. Collectively, these observations suggest that hyperventilation activates pH-sensitive neurons of the intralaminar nuclei to provoke absence seizures.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Polyunsaturated fatty acids inhibit a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel through one of two binding sites</a></h4>

              
                Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) inhibit pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) but the mechanism of inhibition is not well understood. The PUFA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), inhibits agonist responses of the pLGIC, ELIC, more effectively than palmitic acid, similar to the effects observed in the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Using photo-affinity labeling and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we identified two fatty acid binding sites in the outer transmembrane domain (TMD) of ELIC. Fatty acid binding to the photolabeled sites is selective for DHA over palmitic acid, and specific for an agonist-bound state. Hexadecyl-methanethiosulfonate modification of one of the two fatty acid binding sites in the outer TMD recapitulates the inhibitory effect of PUFAs in ELIC. The results demonstrate that DHA selectively binds to multiple sites in the outer TMD of ELIC, but that state-dependent binding to a single intrasubunit site mediates DHA inhibition of ELIC.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Similar neural and perceptual masking effects of low-power optogenetic stimulation in primate V1</a></h4>

              
                Can direct stimulation of primate V1 substitute for a visual stimulus and mimic its perceptual effect? To address this question, we developed an optical-genetic toolkit to 'read' neural population responses using widefield calcium imaging, while simultaneously using optogenetics to 'write' neural responses into V1 of behaving macaques. We focused on the phenomenon of visual masking, where detection of a dim target is significantly reduced by a co-localized medium-brightness mask [1, 2]. Using our toolkit, we tested whether V1 optogenetic stimulation can recapitulate the perceptual masking effect of a visual mask. We find that, similar to a visual mask, low-power optostimulation can significantly reduce visual detection sensitivity, that a sublinear interaction between visual and optogenetic evoked V1 responses could account for this perceptual effect, and that these neural and behavioral effects are spatially selective. Our toolkit and results open the door for further exploration of perceptual substitutions by direct stimulation of sensory cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Establishment of developmental gene silencing by ordered polycomb complex recruitment in early zebrafish embryos</a></h4>

              
                Vertebrate embryos achieve developmental competency during zygotic genome activation (ZGA) by establishing chromatin states that silence yet poise developmental genes for subsequent lineage-specific activation. Here, we reveal the order of chromatin states in establishing developmental gene poising in preZGA zebrafish embryos. Poising is established at promoters and enhancers that initially contain open/permissive chromatin with 'Placeholder' nucleosomes (bearing H2A.Z, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac), and DNA hypomethylation. Silencing is initiated by the recruitment of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), and H2Aub1 deposition by catalytic Rnf2 during preZGA and ZGA stages. During postZGA, H2Aub1 enables Aebp2-containing PRC2 recruitment and H3K27me3 deposition. Notably, preventing H2Aub1 (via Rnf2 inhibition) eliminates recruitment of Aebp2-PRC2 and H3K27me3, and elicits transcriptional upregulation of certain developmental genes during ZGA. However, upregulation is independent of H3K27me3 - establishing H2Aub1 as the critical silencing modification at ZGA. Taken together, we reveal the logic and mechanism for establishing poised/silent developmental genes in early vertebrate embryos.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dissociation of impulsive traits by subthalamic metabotropic glutamate receptor 4</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral strategies require gating of premature responses to optimize outcomes. Several brain areas control impulsive actions, but the neuronal basis of natural variation in impulsivity between individuals remain largely unknown. Here, by combining a Go/No-Go behavioral assay with  resting state (rs) functional MRI in mice, we identified the subthalamic nucleus (STN), a known gate for motor control in the basal ganglia, as a major hot spot for trait impulsivity. In vivo recorded STN neural activity encoded impulsive action as a separable state from basic motor control, characterized by decoupled STN/Substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) mesoscale networks. Optogenetic modulation of STN activity bi-directionally controlled impulsive behavior. Pharmacological and genetic manipulations showed that these impulsive actions are modulated by metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 (mGlu4) function in STN and its coupling to SNr in a behavioral trait-dependent manner, and independently of general motor function. In conclusion, STN circuitry multiplexes motor control and trait impulsivity, which are molecularly dissociated by mGlu4. This provides a potential mechanism for the genetic modulation of impulsive behavior, a clinically relevant predictor for developing psychiatric disorders associated with impulsivity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fluorescence activation mechanism and imaging of drug permeation with new sensors for smoking-cessation ligands</a></h4>

              
                Nicotinic partial agonists provide an accepted aid for smoking cessation and thus contribute to decreasing tobacco-related disease. Improved drugs constitute a continued area of study. However, there remains no reductionist method to examine the cellular and subcellular pharmacokinetic properties of these compounds in living cells. Here, we developed new intensity-based drug sensing fluorescent reporters ('iDrugSnFRs') for the nicotinic partial agonists dianicline, cytisine, and two cytisine derivatives - 10-fluorocytisine and 9-bromo-10-ethylcytisine. We report the first atomic-scale structures of liganded periplasmic binding protein-based biosensors, accelerating development of iDrugSnFRs and also explaining the activation mechanism. The nicotinic iDrugSnFRs detect their drug partners in solution, as well as at the plasma membrane (PM) and in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cell lines and mouse hippocampal neurons. At the PM, the speed of solution changes limits the growth and decay rates of the fluorescence response in almost all cases. In contrast, we found that rates of membrane crossing differ among these nicotinic drugs by &gt; 30 fold. The new nicotinic iDrugSnFRs provide insight into the real-time pharmacokinetic properties of nicotinic agonists and provide a methodology whereby iDrugSnFRs can inform both pharmaceutical neuroscience and addiction neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Heterogeneity of social cognition in temporo-parietal junction: Overlapping yet distinct representation between visual perspective-taking and theory of mind</a></h4>

              
                Visual perspective taking (VPT), particularly level 2 VPT (VPT2), which allows an individual to understand that the same object can be seen differently by others, is related to the theory of mind (ToM), because both functions require a decoupled representation from oneself. Although previous neuroimaging studies have shown that VPT and ToM activate the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), it is unclear whether common neural substrates are involved in VPT and ToM. To clarify this point, the present study directly compared the TPJ activation patterns of individual participants performing VPT2 and ToM tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging and within-subjects design. VPT2-induced activations were compared with activations observed during a mental rotation task as a control task, whereas ToM-related activities were identified with a standard ToM localizer using false-belief stories. A whole-brain analysis revealed that VPT2 and ToM activated overlapping areas in the posterior part of the TPJ. By comparing the activations induced by VPT2 and ToM in individual participants, we found that the peak voxels induced by ToM were located significantly more anteriorly and dorsally within the bilateral TPJ than those measured during the VPT2 task. We further confirmed that these activity areas were spatially distinct from the nearby extrastriate body area (EBA), visual motion area (MT+), and the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) using independent localizer scans. Our findings revealed that VPT2 and ToM have distinct representations, albeit partially overlapping, indicating the functional heterogeneity of social cognition within the TPJ.

                Septins are a family of cytoskeletal proteins that regulate several important aspects of neuronal development. Septin 7 (Sept7) is enriched at the base of dendritic spines in excitatory neurons and mediates both spine formation and spine-synapse maturation. Phosphorylation at a conserved C-terminal tail residue of Sept7 mediates its translocation into the dendritic spine head to allow spine-synapse maturation. The mechanistic basis for postsynaptic stability and compartmentalization conferred by phosphorylated Sept7, however, is not known. We report herein the proteomic identification of Sept7 phosphorylation dependent neuronal interactors. Using Sept7 C-terminal phosphopeptide pulldown and biochemical assays, we show that the 14-3-3 family of proteins specifically interact with Sept7 when phosphorylated at the T426 residue. Biochemically, we validate the interaction between Sept7 and 14-3-3 isoform gamma, and show that 14-3-3 gamma is also enriched in mature dendritic spine head. Further, we demonstrate that interaction of phosphorylated Sept7 with 14-3-3 protects it from dephosphorylation, as expression of a 14-3-3 antagonist significantly decreases phosphorylated Sept7 in neurons. This study identifies 14-3-3 proteins as an important physiological regulator of Sept7 function in neuronal development.

                Neural codes are thought to be reorganized during memory formation by long-term potentiation (LTP) of synapses. Here, using a novel approach for selectively blocking LTP, we found that eliminating LTP in hippocampal or striatal circuits only produces limited effects on learning and memory. To reconcile the discrepancy between the large physiological effect of blocking LTP and the absent effect on learning, we studied how LTP impacts neuronal computations in the hippocampus using in-vivo Ca2+-imaging. Contrary to current conceptual frameworks, we found that hippocampal CA1-region LTP is not required for accurate representations of space in hippocampal neurons, but rather endows these neurons with reward- and novelty-coding properties. Thus, instead of driving formation of cognitive maps and memory engrams, CA1-region LTP incorporates salience information into cognitive representations.

                Many experimental studies have examined behavioral and electrophysiological responses of mosquitoes to odors. However, the differences across studies in data collection, processing, and reporting make it difficult to perform large-scale analyses combining data from multiple studies. Here we extract and standardize data for 12 mosquito species, along with Drosophila melanogaster for comparison, from over 170 studies and curate the Mosquito Olfactory Response Ensemble (MORE), publicly available at https://neuralsystems.github.io/MORE. We demonstrate the ability of MORE in generating biological insights by finding patterns across studies. Our analyses reveal that ORs are tuned to specific ranges of several physicochemical properties of odorants; the empty-neuron recording technique for measuring OR responses is more sensitive than the Xenopus oocyte technique; there are systematic differences in the behavioral preferences reported by different types of assays; and odorants tend to become less attractive or more aversive at higher concentrations.

                Intracellular trafficking of AMPA receptors is a tightly regulated process which involves several adaptor proteins, and is crucial for the activity of excitatory synapses in both basal conditions and during synaptic plasticity. We found that, in rat hippocampal neurons, an intracellular pool of the tetraspanin TSPAN5 specifically promotes exocytosis of newly synthesised GluA2-containing AMPA receptors without affecting their internalisation. TSPAN5 mediates this function by interacting with AP-4 and Stargazin and possibly using recycling endosomes as a delivery route. This work highlights TSPAN5 as a new adaptor regulating AMPA receptor trafficking. In addition, it provides a possible mechanism for the intellectual disability symptoms that occur in AP-4 deficiency syndrome.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Encoding of speech in convolutional layers and the brain stem based on language experience</a></h4>

              
                Comparing artificial neural networks (ANNs) with outputs of brain imaging techniques has recently seen substantial advances in (computer) vision and text-based language models. Here, we propose a framework to compare biological and artificial neural computations of spoken language representations and propose several new challenges to this paradigm. Using a technique proposed by Begus and Zhou (2021b), we can analyze encoding of any acoustic property in intermediate convolutional layers of an artificial neural network. This allows us to test similarities in speech encoding between the brain and artificial neural networks in a way that is more interpretable than the majority of existing proposals that focus on correlations and supervised models. We introduce fully unsupervised deep generative models (the Generative Adversarial Network architecture) trained on raw speech to the brain-and-ANN-comparison paradigm, which enable testing of both the production and perception principles in human speech. We present a framework that parallels electrophysiological experiments measuring complex Auditory Brainstem Response (cABR) in human brain with intermediate layers in deep convolutional networks. We compared peak latency in cABR relative to the stimulus in the brain stem experiment, and in intermediate convolutional layers relative to the input/output in deep convolutional networks. We also examined and compared the effect of prior language exposure on the peak latency in cABR, and in intermediate convolutional layers of a phonetic property. Specifically, the phonetic property (i.e., VOT =10 ms) is perceived differently by English vs. Spanish speakers as voiced (e.g. [ba]) vs voiceless (e.g. [pa]). Critically, the cABR peak latency to the VOT phonetic property is different between English and Spanish speakers, and peak latency in intermediate convolutional layers is different between English-trained and Spanish-trained computational models. Substantial similarities in peak latency encoding between the human brain and intermediate convolutional networks emerge based on results from eight trained networks (including a replication experiment). The proposed technique can be used to compare encoding between the human brain and intermediate convolutional layers for any acoustic property.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal Volume, Neurite Density and Trace Eye-Blink Conditioning in Young Children</a></h4>

              
                The current study examined the relations between hippocampal structure (e.g., volume and neurite density) and performance on a trace eye blink conditioning (EBC) task in young children. Our first aim assessed whether individual differences in hippocampal volume were associated with trace EBC performance, using both percent Conditioned Responses (% CR) and CR onset latency or the average latency (ms) at which the child started their blink, as measures of hippocampal-dependent associative learning. Our second aim evaluated whether individual differences in hippocampal neurite density were associated with EBC performance using the same outcome measures. Typically developing 4- to 6-year-olds (N = 31; 14 girls; Mage = 5.67; SDage = 0.89) completed T1 and diffusion-weighted MRI scans and a 15-minute trace eyeblink conditioning task outside of the scanner. % CR and CR onset latency were computed across all tone-puff and tone-alone trials. While hippocampal volume was not associated with any of our EBC measures, greater hippocampal neurite density bilaterally, was associated with later CR onset. In other words, children with greater left and right hippocampal neurite density blinked closer to the US (i.e., air puff) than children with less hippocampal neurite density, indicating that structural changes in the hippocampus assisted in the accurate timing of conditioned responses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quality assessment of anatomical MRI images from Generative Adversarial Networks: human assessment and image quality metrics</a></h4>

              
                Background: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can synthesize brain images from image or noise input. So far, the gold standard for assessing the quality of the generated images has been human expert ratings. However, due to limitations of human assessment in terms of cost, scalability, and the limited sensitivity of the human eye to more subtle statistical relationships, a more automated approach towards evaluating GANs is required. New method: We investigated to what extent visual quality can be assessed using image quality metrics and we used group analysis and spatial independent components analysis to verify that the GAN reproduces multivariate statistical relationships found in real data. Reference human data was obtained by recruiting neuroimaging experts to assess real Magnetic Resonance (MR) images and images generated by a Wasserstein GAN. Image quality was manipulated by exporting images at different stages of GAN training. Results: Experts were sensitive to changes in image quality as evidenced by ratings and reaction times, and the generated images reproduced group effects (age, gender) and spatial correlations moderately well. We also surveyed a number of image quality metrics which consistently failed to fully reproduce human data. While the metrics Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Naturalness Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE) showed good overall agreement with human assessment for lower-quality images (i.e. images from early stages of GAN training), only a Deep Quality Assessment (QA) model trained on human ratings was sensitive to the subtle differences between higher-quality images. Conclusions: We recommend a combination of group analyses, spatial correlation analyses, and both distortion metrics (SSIM, NIQE) and perceptual models (Deep QA) for a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of brain images produced by GANs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual search training benefits from the integrative effect of enhanced covert attention and optimized overt eye movements</a></h4>

              
                Visual search in a complex environment requires efficient discrimination between target and distractors. Training serves as an effective approach to improve visual search performance when the target does not automatically pop out from the distractors. In the present study, we trained subjects on a conjunction visual search task and examined the training effects in behavior and eye movement from Experiments 1 to 4. The results showed that training improved behavioral performance and reduced the number of saccades and overall scanning time. Training also increased the search initiation time before the first saccade and the proportion of trials in which the subjects correctly identified the target without any saccade, but these effects were modulated by stimulus' parameters. In Experiment 5, we replicated these training effects when eye movements and EEG signals were recorded simultaneously. The results revealed significant N2pc components after the stimulus onset (i.e., stimulus-locked) and before the first saccade (i.e., saccade-locked) when the search target was the trained one. These N2pc components can be considered as the neural signatures for the training-induced boost of covert attention to the trained target. The enhanced covert attention led to a beneficial tradeoff between search initiation time and the number of saccades as a small amount of increase in search initiation time could result in a larger reduction in scanning time. These findings suggest that the enhanced covert attention to target and optimized overt eye movements are coordinated together to facilitate visual search training.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Low vision impairs implicit sensorimotor adaptation in response to small errors, but not large errors</a></h4>

              
                Successful goal-directed actions require constant fine-tuning in response to errors introduced by changes in the body and environment. This implicit adaptive process has been assumed to operate in a statistically optimal fashion, reducing its sensitivity to errors when sensory uncertainty is high. However, recent work has shown that visual uncertainty attenuates implicit adaptation for small errors, but not large errors, a result that is at odds with an optimal integration hypothesis. This error size interaction has motivated a new hypothesis that sensory uncertainty impacts the distribution of the perceived error locations but not the system's sensitivity to errors. To examine these competing hypotheses, previous studies have experimentally manipulated uncertainty. But it is unknown which hypothesis best describes motor adaptation to sensory uncertainty experienced during daily life. To address this question, we recruited individuals with low vision due to diverse clinical conditions impacting visual uncertainty and matched controls. The groups were tested on visuomotor tasks designed to isolate implicit adaptation and maintain tight control over the error size. In two experiments, low vision was associated with attenuated implicit adaptation only for small errors, but not for large errors. Taken together with prior work in which visual uncertainty was experimentally manipulated, these results support the notion that increasing sensory uncertainty increases the likelihood that errors are mis-localized but does not affect error sensitivity, offering a novel account for the motor learning deficits seen in low vision.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Keeping time and rhythm by replaying a sensory-motor engram</a></h4>

              
                Imagine practicing a piece of music, or a speech, solely within the mind, without any sensory input or motor output. Our ability to implement dynamic internal representations is key for successful behavior, yet how the brain achieves this is not fully understood. Here we trained primates to perceive, and internally maintain, rhythms of different tempos and performed large-scale recordings of neuronal activity across multiple areas spanning the sensory-motor processing hierarchy. Results show that perceiving and maintaining rhythms engage multiple brain areas, including visual, parietal, premotor, prefrontal, and hippocampal regions. Each area displayed oscillatory activity that reflected the temporal and spatial characteristics of an internal metronome which flexibly encoded fast, medium, and slow tempos on a trial-by-trial basis. The presence of widespread metronome-related activity across the brain, in the absence of stimuli and overt actions, is consistent with the idea that time and rhythm are maintained by a mechanism that internally replays the stimuli and actions that define well-timed behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The structured flow on the brain's resting state manifold</a></h4>

              
                Spontaneously fluctuating brain activity patterns emerge at rest and relate to brain functional networks involved in task conditions. Despite detailed descriptions of the spatio-temporal brain patterns, our understanding of their generative mechanism is still incomplete. Using a combination of computational modeling and dynamical systems analysis we provide a complete mechanistic description in terms of the constituent entities and the productive relation of their causal activities leading to the formation of a resting state manifold via the network connectivity. We demonstrate that the symmetry breaking by the connectivity creates a characteristic flow on the manifold, which produces the major empirical data features including spontaneous high amplitude co-activations, neuronal cascades, spectral cortical gradients, multistability and characteristic functional connectivity dynamics. The understanding of the brain's resting state manifold is fundamental for the construction of task-specific flows and manifolds used in theories of brain function such as predictive coding.
