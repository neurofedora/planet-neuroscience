	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a complex and progressive neurodegenerative disease, characterized by resting tremor, rigidity, slowness of movement, and postural instability. Furthermore, PD is associated with a wide spectrum of non-motor symptoms that add to overall disability. In recent years, some investigations, from basic science to clinical applications, have focused on the role of vitamin D in PD, often with controversial findings. Vitamin D has widespread effects on several biological processes in the central nervous system, including neurotransmission in dopaminergic neural circuits. Various studies have recorded lower levels of vitamin D in PD patients than in healthy controls. Low vitamin D status has also been correlated with the risk for PD and motor severity, whereas less is known about the effects vitamin D has on cognitive function and other non-motor symptoms. This review aims to better characterize the correlation between vitamin D and PD, clarify the role of vitamin D in PD prevention and treatment, and discuss avenues for future research in this field.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Visual Uncertainty Unveils the Distinct Role of Haptic Cues in Multisensory Grasping</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Human multisensory grasping movements (i.e., seeing and feeling a handheld object while grasping it with the contralateral hand) are superior to movements guided by each separate modality. This multisensory advantage might be driven by the integration of vision with either the haptic position only or with both position and size cues. To contrast these two hypotheses, we manipulated visual uncertainty (central vs peripheral vision) and the availability of haptic cues during multisensory grasping. We showed a multisensory benefit regardless of the degree of visual uncertainty suggesting that the integration process involved in multisensory grasping can be flexibly modulated by the contribution of each modality. Increasing visual uncertainty revealed the role of the distinct haptic cues. The haptic position cue was sufficient to promote multisensory benefits evidenced by faster actions with smaller grip apertures, whereas the haptic size was fundamental in fine-tuning the grip aperture scaling. These results support the hypothesis that, in multisensory grasping, vision is integrated with all haptic cues, with the haptic position cue playing the key part. Our findings highlight the important role of nonvisual sensory inputs in sensorimotor control and hint at the potential contributions of the haptic modality in developing and maintaining visuomotor functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Lessons from the Stories of Women in Neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                <p>Women have been contributing to the field of neuroscience since its inception, but their accomplishments are often overlooked. Lack of recognition, among other issues, has led to progressively fewer women at each academic stage; although half of neuroscience graduate students are women, women comprise less than one-third of neuroscience faculty, and even fewer full professors. Those who reach this level continue to struggle to get their work recognized. Women from historically excluded backgrounds are even more starkly underrepresented and face added challenges related to racial, ethnic, and other biases. To increase the visibility of women in neuroscience, promote their voices, and learn about their career journeys, we created Stories of Women in Neuroscience (Stories of WiN). Stories of WiN shares the scientific and personal stories of women neuroscientists with diverse backgrounds, identities, research interests, and at various career stages. From &gt;70 women highlighted thus far, a major theme has emerged: there is not a single archetype of a woman neuroscientist, nor a single path to "success." Yet, through these diverse experiences run common threads, such as the importance of positive early research experiences, managing imposter syndrome, the necessity of work&ndash;life balance, and the challenges of fitting into&mdash;or resisting&mdash;the "scientist mold" within a patriarchal, racialized academic system. These commonalities reveal important considerations for supporting women neuroscientists. Through the lens of women highlighted by Stories of WiN, we explore the similarities among their journeys and detail specific actionable items to help encourage, support, and sustain women in neuroscience.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Roles of Par3, Par6, and aPKC Polarity Proteins in Normal Neurodevelopment and in Neurodegenerative and Neuropsychiatric Disorders</a></h4>

              
                <p>Normal neural circuits and functions depend on proper neuronal differentiation, migration, synaptic plasticity, and maintenance. Abnormalities in these processes underlie various neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders. Neural development and maintenance are regulated by many proteins. Among them are Par3, Par6 (partitioning defective 3 and 6), and aPKC (atypical protein kinase C) families of evolutionarily conserved polarity proteins. These proteins perform versatile functions by forming tripartite or other combinations of protein complexes, which hereafter are collectively referred to as "Par complexes." In this review, we summarize the major findings on their biophysical and biochemical properties in cell polarization and signaling pathways. We next summarize their expression and localization in the nervous system as well as their versatile functions in various aspects of neurodevelopment, including neuroepithelial polarity, neurogenesis, neuronal migration, neurite differentiation, synaptic plasticity, and memory. These versatile functions rely on the fundamental roles of Par complexes in cell polarity in distinct cellular contexts. We also discuss how cell polarization may correlate with subcellular polarization in neurons. Finally, we review the involvement of Par complexes in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. While emerging evidence indicates that Par complexes are essential for proper neural development and maintenance, many questions on their <I>in vivo</I> functions have yet to be answered. Thus, Par3, Par6, and aPKC continue to be important research topics to advance neuroscience.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Depolarizing NaV and Hyperpolarizing KV Channels Are Co-Trafficked in Sensory Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuronal excitability relies on coordinated action of functionally distinction channels. Voltage-gated sodium (Na<SUB>V</SUB>) and potassium (K<SUB>V</SUB>) channels have distinct but complementary roles in firing action potentials: Na<SUB>V</SUB> channels provide depolarizing current while K<SUB>V</SUB> channels provide hyperpolarizing current. Mutations and dysfunction of multiple Na<SUB>V</SUB> and K<SUB>V</SUB> channels underlie disorders of excitability, including pain and epilepsy. Modulating ion channel trafficking may offer a potential therapeutic strategy for these diseases. A fundamental question, however, is whether these channels with distinct functional roles are transported independently or packaged together in the same vesicles in sensory axons. We have used Optical Pulse-Chase Axonal Long-distance imaging to investigate trafficking of Na<SUB>V</SUB> and K<SUB>V</SUB> channels and other axonal proteins from distinct functional classes in live rodent sensory neurons (from male and female rats). We show that, similar to Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.7 channels, Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.8 and K<SUB>V</SUB>7.2 channels are transported in Rab6a-positive vesicles, and that each of the Na<SUB>V</SUB> channel isoforms expressed in healthy, mature sensory neurons (Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.6, Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.7, Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.8, and Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.9) is cotransported in the same vesicles. Further, we show that multiple axonal membrane proteins with different physiological functions (Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.7, K<SUB>V</SUB>7.2, and TNFR1) are cotransported in the same vesicles. However, vesicular packaging of axonal membrane proteins is not indiscriminate, since another axonal membrane protein (NCX2) is transported in separate vesicles. These results shed new light on the development and organization of sensory neuron membranes, revealing complex sorting of axonal proteins with diverse physiological functions into specific transport vesicles.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Normal neuronal excitability is dependent on precise regulation of membrane proteins, including Na<SUB>V</SUB> and K<SUB>V</SUB> channels, and imbalance in the level of these channels at the plasma membrane could lead to excitability disorders. Ion channel trafficking could potentially be targeted therapeutically, which would require better understanding of the mechanisms underlying trafficking of functionally diverse channels. Optical Pulse-chase Axonal Long-distance imaging in live neurons permitted examination of the specificity of ion channel trafficking, revealing co-packaging of axonal proteins with opposing physiological functions into the same transport vesicles. This suggests that additional trafficking mechanisms are necessary to regulate levels of surface channels, and reveals an important consideration for therapeutic strategies that target ion channel trafficking for the treatment of excitability disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Oxidative Stress-Induced Damage to the Developing Hippocampus Is Mediated by GSK3{beta}</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neonatal brain injury renders the developing brain vulnerable to oxidative stress, leading to cognitive deficit. However, oxidative stress-induced damage to hippocampal circuits and the mechanisms underlying long-term changes in memory and learning are poorly understood. We used high oxygen tension or hyperoxia (HO) in neonatal mice of both sexes to investigate the role of oxidative stress in hippocampal damage. Perinatal HO induces reactive oxygen species and cell death, together with reduced interneuron maturation, inhibitory postsynaptic currents, and dentate progenitor proliferation. Postinjury interneuron stimulation surprisingly improved inhibitory activity and memory tasks, indicating reversibility. With decreased hippocampal levels of Wnt signaling components and somatostatin, HO aberrantly activated glycogen synthase kinase 3 &beta; activity. Pharmacological inhibition or ablation of interneuron glycogen synthase kinase 3 &beta; during HO challenge restored progenitor cell proliferation, interneuron development, inhibitory/excitatory balance, as well as hippocampal-dependent behavior. Biochemical targeting of interneuron function may benefit learning deficits caused by oxidative damage.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Premature infants are especially vulnerable to oxidative stress, as their antioxidant defenses are underdeveloped. Indeed, high oxygen tension is associated with poor neurologic outcomes. Because of its sustained postnatal development and role in learning and memory, the hippocampus is especially vulnerable to oxidative damage in premature infants. However, the role of oxidative stress in the developing hippocampus has yet to be explored. With ever-rising rates of neonatal brain injury and no universally viable approach to maximize functional recovery, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying neonatal brain injury is needed. Addressing this need, this study uses perinatal hyperoxia to study cognitive deficits, pathophysiology, and molecular mechanisms of oxidative damage in the developing hippocampus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neuropilin 2/Plexin-A3 Receptors Regulate the Functional Connectivity and the Excitability in the Layers 4 and 5 of the Cerebral Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>The functions of cortical networks are progressively established during development by series of events shaping the neuronal connectivity. Synaptic elimination, which consists of removing the supernumerary connections generated during the earlier stages of cortical development, is one of the latest stages in neuronal network maturation. The semaphorin 3F coreceptors neuropilin 2 (Nrp2) and plexin-A3 (PlxnA3) may play an important role in the functional maturation of the cerebral cortex by regulating the excess dendritic spines on cortical excitatory neurons. Yet, the identity of the connections eliminated under the control of Nrp2/PlxnA3 signaling is debated, and the importance of this synaptic refinement for cortical functions remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Nrp2/PlxnA3 controls the spine densities in layer 4 (L4) and on the apical dendrite of L5 neurons of the sensory and motor cortices. Using a combination of neuroanatomical, <I>ex vivo</I> electrophysiology, and <I>in vivo</I> functional imaging techniques in <I>Nrp2</I> and <I>PlxnA3</I> KO mice of both sexes, we disprove the hypothesis that Nrp2/PlxnA3 signaling is required to maintain the ectopic thalamocortical connections observed during embryonic development. We also show that the absence of Nrp2/PlxnA3 signaling leads to the hyperexcitability and excessive synchronization of the neuronal activity in L5 and L4 neuronal networks, suggesting that this system could participate in the refinement of the recurrent corticocortical connectivity in those layers. Altogether, our results argue for a role of semaphorin&ndash;Nrp2/PlxnA3 signaling in the proper maturation and functional connectivity of the cerebral cortex, likely by controlling the refinement of recurrent corticocortical connections.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The function of a neuronal circuit is mainly determined by the connections that neurons establish with one another during development. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the establishment of the functional connectivity is fundamental to comprehend how network functions are implemented, and to design treatments aiming at restoring damaged neuronal circuits. Here, we show that the cell surface receptors for the family of semaphorin guidance cues neuropilin 2 (Nrp2) and plexin-A3 (PlxnA3) play an important role in shaping the functional connectivity of the cerebral cortex likely by trimming the recurrent connections in layers 4 and 5. By removing the supernumerary inputs generated during early development, Nrp2/PlxnA3 signaling reduces the neuronal excitability and participates in the maturation of the cortical network functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Existence of a Long-Range Caudo-Rostral Sensory Influence in Terrestrial Locomotion</a></h4>

              
                <p>In multisegmented locomotion, coordination of all appendages is crucial for the generation of a proper motor output. In running for example, leg coordination is mainly based on the central interaction of rhythm generating networks, called central pattern generators (CPGs). In slower forms of locomotion, however, sensory feedback, which originates from sensory organs that detect changes in position, velocity and load of the legs' segments, has been shown to play a more crucial role. How exactly sensory feedback influences the activity of the CPGs to establish functional neuronal connectivity is not yet fully understood. Using the female stick insect <I>Carausius morosus</I>, we show for the first time that a long-range caudo-rostral sensory connection exists and highlight that load as sensory signal is sufficient to entrain rhythmic motoneuron (MN) activity in the most rostral segment. So far, mainly rostro-caudal influencing pathways have been investigated where the strength of activation, expressed by the MN activity in the thoracic ganglia, decreases with the distance from the stepping leg to these ganglia. Here, we activated CPGs, producing rhythmic neuronal activity in the thoracic ganglia by using the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine and enforced the stepping of a single, remaining leg. This enabled us to study sensory influences on the CPGs' oscillatory activity. Using this approach, we show that, in contrast to the distance-dependent activation of the protractor-retractor CPGs in different thoracic ganglia, there is no such dependence for the entrainment of the rhythmic activity of active protractor-retractor CPG networks by individual stepping legs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show for the first time that sensory information is transferred not only to the immediate adjacent segmental ganglia but also to those farther away, indicating the existence of a long-range caudo-rostral sensory influence. This influence is dependent on stepping direction but independent of whether the leg is actively or passively moved. We suggest that the sensory information comes from unspecific load signals sensed by cuticle mechanoreceptors (campaniform sensilla) of a leg. Our results provide a neuronal basis for the long-established behavioral rules of insect leg coordination. We thus provide a breakthrough in understanding the neuronal networks underlying multilegged locomotion and open new vistas into the neuronal functional connectivity of multisegmented locomotion systems across the animal kingdom.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Vigilance and Behavioral State-Dependent Modulation of Cortical Neuronal Activity throughout the Sleep/Wake Cycle</a></h4>

              
                <p>GABAergic inhibitory neurons, through their molecular, anatomic, and physiological diversity, provide a substrate for the modulation of ongoing cortical circuit activity throughout the sleep/wake cycle. Here, we investigated neuronal activity dynamics of parvalbumin (PV), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and somatostatin (SST) neurons in naturally sleeping head-restrained mice at the level of layer 2/3 of the primary somatosensory barrel cortex of mice. Through calcium imaging and targeted single-unit loose-patch or whole-cell recordings, we found that PV action potential firing activity was largest during both rapid eye movement (REM) and nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stages, that VIP neurons were most active during REM sleep, and that the overall activity of SST neurons remained stable throughout the sleep/wake cycle. Analysis of neuronal activity dynamics uncovered rapid decreases in PV cell firing at wake onset followed by a progressive recovery during wake. Simultaneous local field potential (LFP) recordings further revealed that except for SST neurons, a large proportion of neurons were modulated by ongoing delta and theta oscillations. During NREM sleep spindles, PV and SST activity increased and decreased, respectively. Finally, we uncovered the presence of whisking behavior in mice during REM sleep and show that the activity of VIP and SST is differentially modulated during awake and sleeping whisking bouts, which may provide a neuronal substrate for internal brain representations occurring during sleep.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In the sensory cortex, the balance between excitation and inhibition is believed to be highly dynamic throughout the sleep/wake cycle, shaping the response of cortical circuits to external stimuli while allowing the formation of newly encoded memory. Using <I>in vivo</I> two-photon calcium imaging or targeted single-unit recordings combined with LFP recordings, we describe the vigilance state and whisking-behavior-dependent activity of excitatory pyramidal and inhibitory GABAergic neurons in the supragranular layers of mouse somatosensory cortex. Interneuronal activity was found to be differentially modulated by ongoing delta and theta waves, sleep spindles, and a novel type of whisking observed during REM sleep, potentially providing a neuronal substrate for internal brain representations occurring during sleep.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Brain Functional Connectivity Mapping of Behavioral Flexibility in Rhesus Monkeys</a></h4>

              
                <p>The predisposition to engage in autonomous habitual behaviors has been associated with behavioral disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and addiction. Attentional set-shifting tasks (ASSTs), which incorporate changes governing the association of discriminative stimuli with contingent reinforcement, are commonly used to measure underlying processes of cognitive/behavioral flexibility. The purpose of this study was to identify primate brain networks that mediate trait-like deficits in ASST performance using resting-state fMRI. A self-pacing ASST was administered to three cohorts of rhesus monkeys (total <I>n</I> = 35, 18 female). Increased performance over 30 consecutive sessions segregated the monkeys into two populations, termed High Performers (HP, <I>n</I> = 17) and Low Performers (LP, <I>n</I> = 17), with one anomaly. Compared with LPs, HPs had higher rates of improving performance over sessions and completed the 8 sets/sessions with fewer errors. LP monkeys, on the other hand, spent most of each session in the first set and often did not acquire the first reversal. A whole-brain independent components analysis of resting-state fMRI under isoflurane identified four strong networks. Of these, a dual regression analysis revealed that a designated "executive control network," differed between HPs and LPs. Specific areas of connectivity in the rhesus executive control network, including frontal cortices (ventrolateral, ventromedial, and orbital) and the dorsal striatum (caudate, putamen) correlated with perseverative errors and response latency. Overall, the results identify trait-like characteristics of behavioral flexibility that are associated with correlated brain activity involving specific nuclei of frontostriatal networks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Resting state functional connectivity MRI in rhesus monkeys identified specific nuclei in frontostriatal circuitry that were associated with population differences in perseverative and impulsive aspects of cognitive flexibility.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Recruitment of Control and Representational Components of the Semantic System during Successful and Unsuccessful Access to Complex Factual Knowledge</a></h4>

              
                <p>Our ability to effectively retrieve complex semantic knowledge meaningfully impacts our daily lives, yet the neural processes that underly successful access and transient failures in access remain only partially understood. In this fMRI study, we contrast activation during successful semantic access, unsuccessful semantic access because of transient access failures (i.e., "tip-of-the-tongue," "feeling-of-knowing"), and trials where the semantic knowledge was not possessed. Twenty-four human participants (14 female) were presented 240 trivia-based questions relating to person, place, object, or scholastic knowledge domains. Analyses of the recall event indicated a relatively greater role of a dorsomedial section of the prefrontal cortex in unsuccessful semantic access and relatively greater recruitment of the pars orbitalis of the inferior frontal gyrus in successful access. Successful access was also associated with increased activation in knowledge domain-selective areas. Generally, knowledge domain-selective areas showed increased responses for both preferred and nonpreferred stimulus classes. The exception was place-selective regions (parahippocampal gyrus, transverse occipital sulcus, retrosplenial complex), which were recruited during unsuccessful access attempts for all stimulus domains. Collectively, these results suggest that prefrontal semantic control systems and classical spatial knowledge-selective regions work together to locate relevant information and that access to complex knowledge results in a broad activation of semantic representation extending to regions selective for other knowledge domains.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ability to access the deep factual knowledge we possess has a meaningful influence on our scholastic, professional, and social lives. In this fMRI study, we investigate the neural processes associated with successful access to this knowledge as well as transient failures in semantic access (tip-of-the-tongue/feeling-of-knowing). Participants attempted to answer trivia-style general knowledge questions drawn from four different knowledge domains. Results suggest that prefrontal semantic control systems and classical spatial knowledge-selective regions work to locate relevant information and that access to complex knowledge results in a broad activation of semantic representation extending to regions selective for other knowledge domains.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Accumulation System: Distributed Neural Substrates of Perceptual Decision Making Revealed by fMRI Deconvolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neural substrates of evidence accumulation have been a central issue in decision-making studies because of the prominent success of the accumulation model in explaining a wide range of perceptual decision making. Since accumulation-shaped activities have been found in multiple brain regions, which are called accumulators, questions regarding functional relations among these accumulators are emerging. This study employed the deconvolution method of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals from human male and female participants during object-category decision tasks, taking advantage of the whole-brain coverage of fMRI with improved availability of temporal information of the deconvolved activity. We detected the accumulation activity in many non-category-selective regions (NCSRs) over the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes as well as category-selective regions (CSRs) of the categorization task. Importantly, the frontal regions mostly showed activity peaks matching the decision timing (classified as "type-A accumulator"), while activity peaks of the parietal and temporal regions were behind the decision (classified as "type-B accumulator"). The CSRs showed activity peaks whose timing depended on both region and stimulus preference, plausibly reflecting the competition among the alternative choices (classified as "type-C accumulator"). The results suggest that these functionally heterogeneous accumulators form a system for evidence accumulation in which the type-A accumulator regions make decisions in a general manner while the type-B and type-C accumulator regions are employed depending on the modality and content of decision tasks. The concept of the accumulation system may provide a key to understanding the universality of the accumulation model over various kinds of decision tasks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Perceptual decision making, such as deciding to walk or stop on seeing the signal colors, has been explained theoretically by the accumulation model, in which sensory information is accumulated to reach a certain threshold for making decisions. Neural substrates of this model, however, are still under elucidation among candidate regions found over the brain. We show here that, taking advantage of the whole-brain coverage of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with improving availability of temporal information by deconvolution method, the accumulation is conducted by a system comprising many regions in different abstraction levels and only a part of these regions in the frontal cortex make decisions. The system concept may provide a key to explaining the universality of the accumulation model.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Simulated Attack Reveals How Lesions Affect Network Properties in Poststroke Aphasia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aphasia is a prevalent cognitive syndrome caused by stroke. The rarity of premorbid imaging and heterogeneity of lesion obscures the links between the local effects of the lesion, global anatomic network organization, and aphasia symptoms. We applied a simulated attack approach in humans to examine the effects of 39 stroke lesions (16 females) on anatomic network topology by simulating their effects in a control sample of 36 healthy (15 females) brain networks. We focused on measures of global network organization thought to support overall brain function and resilience in the whole brain and within the left hemisphere. After removing lesion volume from the network topology measures and behavioral scores [the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient (WAB-AQ), four behavioral factor scores obtained from a neuropsychological battery, and a factor sum], we compared the behavioral variance accounted for by simulated poststroke connectomes to that observed in the randomly permuted data. Global measures of anatomic network topology in the whole brain and left hemisphere accounted for 10% variance or more of the WAB-AQ and the lexical factor score beyond lesion volume and null permutations. Streamline networks provided more reliable point estimates than FA networks. Edge weights and network efficiency were weighted most highly in predicting the WAB-AQ for FA networks. Overall, our results suggest that global network measures provide modest statistical value beyond lesion volume when predicting overall aphasia severity, but less value in predicting specific behaviors. Variability in estimates could be induced by premorbid ability, deafferentation and diaschisis, and neuroplasticity following stroke.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Poststroke, the remaining neuroanatomy maintains cognition and supports recovery. However, studies often use small, cross-sectional samples that cannot fully model the interactions between lesions and other variables that affect networks in stroke. Alternate methods are required to account for these effects. "Simulated attack" models are computational approaches that apply virtual damage to the brain and measure their putative consequences. Using a simulated attack model, we estimated how simulated damage to anatomic networks could account for language performance. Overall, our results reveal that global network measures can provide modest statistical value predicting overall aphasia severity, but less value in predicting specific behaviors. These findings suggest that more theoretically precise network models could be necessary to robustly predict individual outcomes in aphasia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Tracking Neural Markers of Template Formation and Implementation in Attentional Inhibition under Different Distractor Consistency</a></h4>

              
                <p>Performing visual search tasks requires optimal attention deployment to promote targets and inhibit distractors. Rejection templates based on the feature of the distractor can be built to constrain the search process. We measured electroencephalography (EEG) of human participants of both sexes when they performed a visual search task in conditions where the distractor cues were constant within a block (fixed cueing) or changed on a trial-by-trial basis (varied cueing). In the fixed-cueing condition, sustained decoding of the cued colors could be achieved during the retention interval, and participants with higher decoding accuracy showed larger suppression benefits of the distractor cueing in the search period. In the varied-cueing condition, the cued color could only be transiently decoded after its onset, and higher decoding accuracy was observed from the participants who demonstrated lower suppression benefit. The differential neural representations of the to-be-ignored color in the two cueing conditions as well as their reverse associations with behavioral performance implied that rejection templates were formed in the fixed-cueing condition but not in the varied-cueing condition. Additionally, we observed stronger posterior alpha lateralization and midfrontal theta/beta power during the retention interval of the varied-cueing condition, indicating the cognitive costs in template formation caused by the trialwise change of distractor colors. Together, our findings revealed the neural markers associated with the critical roles of distractor consistency in linking template formation to successful inhibition.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How do we strategically build a rejection template based on distractor features to filter out matched items when performing visual search tasks? Previous studies have suggested that the consistency of the to-be-ignored feature may play a significant role in this process. We recorded scalp EEGs when human participants searched for a target among distractors. Capitalized on multivariate decoding technique and time-frequency analysis, we revealed the neural markers of the rejection template under different distractor consistencies. Being able to track these processes in visual search could help us to understand the connection between template formation and successful distractor inhibition. Our findings may also benefit future EEG-based interventions on individuals with deficits in attentional control.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Quantitative Model of Sporadic Axonal Degeneration in the Drosophila Visual System</a></h4>

              
                <p>In human neurodegenerative diseases, neurons undergo axonal degeneration months to years before they die. Here, we developed a system modeling early degenerative events in <I>Drosophila</I> adult photoreceptor cells. Thanks to the stereotypy of their axonal projections, this system delivers quantitative data on sporadic and progressive axonal degeneration of photoreceptor cells. Using this method, we show that exposure of adult female flies to a constant light stimulation for several days overcomes the intrinsic resilience of R7 photoreceptors and leads to progressive axonal degeneration. This was not associated with apoptosis. We furthermore provide evidence that loss of synaptic integrity between R7 and a postsynaptic partner preceded axonal degeneration, thus recapitulating features of human neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, our experiments uncovered a role of postsynaptic partners of R7 to initiate degeneration, suggesting that postsynaptic cells signal back to the photoreceptor to maintain axonal structure. This model can be used to dissect cellular and circuit mechanisms involved in the early events of axonal degeneration, allowing for a better understanding of how neurons cope with stress and lose their resilience capacities.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurons can be active and functional for several years. In the course of aging and in disease conditions leading to neurodegeneration, subsets of neurons lose their resilience and start dying. What initiates this turning point at the cellular level is not clear. Here, we developed a model allowing to systematically describe this phase. The loss of synapses and axons represents an early and functionally relevant event toward degeneration. Using the ordered distribution of <I>Drosophila</I> photoreceptor axon terminals, we assembled a system to study sporadic initiation of axon loss and delineated a role for non-cell-autonomous activity regulation in the initiation of axon degeneration. This work will help shed light on key steps in the etiology of nonfamilial cases of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Explainable detection of adverse drug reaction with imbalanced data distribution</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jin Wang, Liang-Chih Yu, Xuejie Zhang</p>

Analysis of health-related texts can be used to detect adverse drug reactions (ADR). The greatest challenge for ADR detection lies in imbalanced data distributions where words related to ADR symptoms are often minority classes. As a result, trained models tend to converge to a point that strongly biases towards the majority class and then ignores the minority class. Since the most used cross-entropy criteria is an approximation to accuracy, the model focuses more readily on the majority class to achieve high accuracy. To address this issue, existing methods apply either oversampling or down-sampling strategies to balance the data distribution and exploit the most difficult samples of the minority class. However, increasing or reducing the number of individual tokens alone in sequence labeling tasks will result in the loss of the syntactic relations of the sentence. This paper proposes a weighted variant of conditional random field (CRF) for data-imbalanced sequence labeling tasks. Such a weighting strategy can alleviate data distribution imbalances between majority and minority classes. Instead of using <i>softmax</i> in the output layer, the CRF can capture the relationship of labels between tokens. The locally interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) algorithm was applied to investigate performance differences between models with and without the weighted loss function. Experimental results on two different ADR tasks show that the proposed model outperforms previously proposed sequence labeling methods.

                <p>by Thao Vu, Julia Wrobel, Benjamin G. Bitler, Erin L. Schenk, Kimberly R. Jordan, Debashis Ghosh</p>

The tumor microenvironment (TME), which characterizes the tumor and its surroundings, plays a critical role in understanding cancer development and progression. Recent advances in imaging techniques enable researchers to study spatial structure of the TME at a single-cell level. Investigating spatial patterns and interactions of cell subtypes within the TME provides useful insights into how cells with different biological purposes behave, which may consequentially impact a subject’s clinical outcomes. We utilize a class of well-known spatial summary statistics, the K-function and its variants, to explore inter-cell dependence as a function of distances between cells. Using techniques from functional data analysis, we introduce an approach to model the association between these summary spatial functions and subject-level outcomes, while controlling for other clinical scalar predictors such as age and disease stage. In particular, we leverage the additive functional Cox regression model (AFCM) to study the nonlinear impact of spatial interaction between tumor and stromal cells on overall survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, using multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) data. The applicability of our approach is further validated using a publicly available multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) triple-negative breast cancer dataset.

                Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can differentiate into nerve cells with an induction from chemical compounds in medium culture. Chromolaena odorata contains active compounds, such as alkaloids and flavonoids, that can initiate the transformation of MSCs into nerve cells. The aim of this study was to determine the potential of methanol extracted C. odorata leaf to induce the differentiation of bone marrow MSCs into nerve cells. Methods: A serial concentration of C. odorata leaf extract (0.7–1.0 mg/mL) with two replications was used. The parameters measured were the number of differentiated MSCs into nerve cells (statistically analyzed using ANOVA) and cell confirmation using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: The results showed that the C. odorata extract had a significant effect on the number MSCs differentiating into nerve cells (p < 0.05) on the doses of 0.8 mg/ml with 22.6%. Molecular assay with RT-PCR confirmed the presence of the nerve cell gene in all of the samples. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study showed the potential application of C. odorata leaf extract in stem cell therapy for patients experiencing neurodegeneration by inducing the differentiation of MSCs into nerve cells.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A computational biology approach for the identification of potential SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors from natural essential oil compounds. [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has fomented a climate of fear worldwide due to its rapidly spreading nature, and high mortality rate. The World Health Organization declared it a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. Many endeavors have been made to find appropriate medications to restrain the SARS-CoV-2 infection from spreading but there is no specific antiviral therapy to date. However, a computer-aided drug design approach can be an alternative to identify probable drug candidates within a short time. SARS-CoV-2 main protease is a proven drug target, and it plays a pivotal role in viral replication and transcription. Methods: In this study, we identified a total of 114 essential oil compounds as a feasible anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent from several online reservoirs. These compounds were screened by incorporating absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profiling, molecular docking, and 50 ns of molecular dynamics simulation to identify potential drug candidates. The crystallized SARS-CoV-2 main protease structure was collected from the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank database (Protein Data Bank ID 6LU7). Results: According to the results of the ADMET study, none of the compounds have any side effects that could reduce their druglikeness or pharmacokinetic properties. Among 114 compounds, we selected bisabololoxide B, eremanthin, and leptospermone as top drug candidates based on their higher binding affinity scores, and strong interaction with the Cys 145-His 41 catalytic dyad. Finally, the molecular dynamics simulation was implemented to evaluate the structural stability of the ligand-receptor complex. Molecular dynamics simulation disclosed that all the hits showed conformational stability compared to the positive control α-ketoamide. Conclusions: Our study showed that the top three hits might work as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents, which can pave the way for discovering new drugs, but further in vivo trials will require for experimental validation.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Longitudinal retinal changes in MOGAD</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Patients with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody (MOG-IgG) associated disease (MOGAD) suffer from severe optic neuritis (ON) leading to retinal neuro-axonal loss, which can be quantified by optical coherence tomography (OCT). We assessed whether ON-independent retinal atrophy can be detected in MOGAD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Eighty MOGAD patients and 139 healthy controls (HC) were included. OCT data was acquired with 1) Spectralis spectral domain OCT (MOGAD (N=66) and HC (N=103)) and 2) Cirrus HD-OCT (MOGAD (N=14) and HC (N=36)). Macular combined ganglion cell and inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) and peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (pRNFL) were quantified.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>At baseline, GCIPL and pRNFL were lower in MOGAD eyes with a history of ON (MOGAD-ON) compared with MOGAD eyes without a history of ON (MOGAD-NON) and HC (p&lt;0.001). MOGAD-NON eyes had lower GCIPL volume compared to HC (p&lt;0.001) in the Spectralis, but not in the Cirrus cohort. Longitudinally (follow-up up to 3 years), MOGAD-ON with ON within the last 6-12 months before baseline exhibited greater pRNFL thinning than MOGAD-ON with an ON &gt;12 months ago (p&lt;0.001). The overall MOGAD cohort did not exhibit faster GCIPL thinning compared with HC.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study suggests the absence of attack-independent retinal damage in MOGAD. Yet, ongoing neuroaxonal damage or oedema resolution seems to occur for up to 12 months after ON, which is longer than what has been reported with other ON forms. These findings support that the pathomechanisms underlying optic nerve involvement and the evolution of OCT retinal changes after ON is distinct in MOGAD.</p>

     alt="Calcium-binding proteins typify the dopaminergic neuronal subtypes in the ventral tegmental area of zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata"/>
<p>Graphical Abstract: Dopamine (DA) neurons residing in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN) in the midbrain of zebra finch demonstrate distinct differences in size and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (TH-ir). The DA neurons in VTA were smaller than those in SN. Based on TH-ir, VTA neurons have been demarcated as subtype 1, 2, and 3. The further study probed the nature of the calcium binding proteins (CBPs), namely, Calbindin (CB)-, Calretinin (CR)-, Parvalbumin (PV)-, and Secretagogin (SCGN)-expressing DA neurons in the VTA and SN. CBPs mRNA and protein showed differential expression in VTA subdivisions and SN. While the subtype 1 TH neurons in the VTA were CB- or CR-negative, subtype 2 and 3 TH neurons co-expressed CB and CR, respectively. Neurons expressing SCGN were observed only in the SN. All subtypes of TH neurons in the VTA co-expressed PV, and the PV and TH-ir showed reciprocal relationship.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Calcium-binding proteins (CBPs) regulate neuronal function in midbrain dopamine (DA)-ergic neurons in mammals by buffering and sensing the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and vesicular release. In birds, the equivalent set of neurons are important in song learning, directed singing, courtship, and energy balance, yet the status of CBPs in these neurons is unknown. Herein, for the first time, we probe the nature of CBPs, namely, Calbindin-, Calretinin-, Parvalbumin-, and Secretagogin-expressing DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN) in the midbrain of zebra finch, <i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>. qRT-PCR analysis of ventral midbrain tissue fragment revealed higher Calbindin- and Calretinin-mRNA levels compared to Parvalbumin and Secretagogin. Application of immunofluorescence showed CBP-immunoreactive (-i) neurons in VTA (anterior [VTAa], mid [VTAm], caudal [VTAc]), SN (compacta [SNc], and reticulata [SNr]). Compared to VTAa, higher Calbindin- and Parvalbumin-immunoreactivity (-ir), and lower Calretinin-ir were observed in VTAm and VTAc. Secretagogin-ir was highly localized to VTAa. In SN, Calbindin- and Calretinin-ir were higher in SNc, SNr was Parvalbumin enriched, and Secretagogin-ir was not detected. Weak, moderate, and intense tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-i VTA neurons were demarcated as subtypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. While subtype 1 TH-i neurons were neither Calbindin- nor Calretinin-i, ∼80 and ∼65% subtype 2 and ∼30 and ∼45% subtype 3 TH-i neurons co-expressed Calbindin and Calretinin, respectively. All TH-i neuronal subtypes co-expressed Parvalbumin with reciprocal relationship with TH-ir. We suggest that the CBPs may determine VTA DA neuronal heterogeneity and differentially regulate their activity in <i>T. guttata</i>.</p>

                Background: Vaccination is an effective and alternative means of disease prevention, however, it cannot be conducted on the offspring of fish.  For this process to take place, the transfer of maternal immunity must be implemented. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of transferring immunity from the broodstock to the offspring using a polyvalent vaccine against Aeromonas hydrophila, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Pseudomonas fluorescens in Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. Methods: Nile tilapia broodstock, with an average weight of 203g (±SD 23 g) was injected with a vaccine used as a treatment. Example include A. hydrophila monovalent (MA), S. agalactiae monovalent (MS), P. fluorescens monovalent (MP), A. hydrophila and S. agalactiae bivalent (BAS), A. hydrophila and P. fluorescens bivalent (BAP), P. fluorescens and S. agalactiae bivalent (BPS), and A. hydrophila, S. agalactiae, and P. fluorescens polyvalent vaccines (PAPS). While the control was fish that were injected with a PBS solution. The broodstock’s immune response was observed on the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th day, while the immune response and challenge test on the offspring was conducted on the 10th, 20th, 30th, and 40th day during the post-hatching period. Result: The application of PAPS in broodstock could significantly induce the best immune response and immunity to multiple diseases compared to other treatments. The RPS of the PAPS was also higher than the other types of vaccines. This showed that the transfer of immunity from the broodstock to the Nile tilapia offspring could protect it against bacterial diseases such as A. hydrophila, S. agalactiae, and P. fluorescens. Conclusion: The application of PAPS A. hydrophila, S. agalactiae, P. fluorescens vaccines increased the broodstock’s immune response and it was transferred to their offsprings. They were able to produce tilapia seeds that are immune to diseases caused by A. hydrophila, S. agalactiae, and P. fluorescens.

                <p>In this one-year prospective study, Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with or without mania following STN-DBS were compared to investigate risk and etiological factors, clinical management and consequences. Eighteen (16.2%) out of 111 consecutive PD patients developed mania, of whom 17 were males. No preoperative risk factor was identified. Postoperative mania was related to ventral limbic subthalamic stimulation in 15 (83%) patients, and resolved as stimulation was relocated to the sensorimotor STN, besides discontinuation or reduction of dopamine agonists and use of low-dose clozapine in 12 patients, while motor and nonmotor outcomes were similar. These findings underpin the prominent role of limbic subthalamic stimulation in postoperative mania.</p>

                Background: Actual and potential drug–drug interactions of psychotropic drugs in patients of the COVID-19 Medicine Service of the Villa El Salvador Emergency Hospital during the months of February to July, 2021. Methods: The study is deductive, retroprospective, quantitative, applied, cross-sectional observational. The instrument used was a collection card for 86 pharmacotherapeutic follow-ups where psychotropic drugs for anxiety, depression and insomnia were registered. Results: In the actual and potential drug interactions of psychotropic drugs, according to the degree of severity dimension, it was identified that the important indicator represented the highest frequency of 89% of the interactions; according to the type of interaction dimension, it was identified that the pharmacodynamic indicator presented a higher frequency with 53%; according to the clinical evidence dimension, it was identified that the fair indicator had a higher frequency with 73% interactions; in the manifestation dimension, it was identified that the potential indicator presented a higher frequency with 92.2% interactions. In its moment of appearance dimension, it was identified that the quick indicator had a higher prevalence with 5.5% of real interactions. In its causality algorithm dimension, the probable indicator was identified as having the highest frequency with 7.25% of actual interactions. With respect to sex, the male presented 49.9% of potential interactions and in the real interactions, the female sex presented a higher incidence with 4.3% interactions. The average age of the potential interactions was 48.83 years, and the average age of the real interactions was 45.67 years. Sertraline presented 53.2% of potential interactions and in relation to real drug interactions the one that presented the highest frequency was mirtazapine with 3.5% interactions. Conclusion: We conclude that the increase in the prescription of psychotropic drugs is related to a higher probability of interactions.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) in neurons is a prominent feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, researchers have considered that extracellular vesicles (EVs) may play an important role in protein exportation and propagation, and α-syn-containing EVs derived from the central nervous system (CNS) have been detected in peripheral blood. However, mechanistic insights into CNS-derived EVs have not been well-described.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Likely neurogenic EVs were purified from the plasma of PD patients and healthy controls using a well-established immunoprecipitation assay with anti-L1CAM-coated beads. A <i>Prnp-SNCA</i>
<sup>A53T</sup> transgenic PD mouse model was used to evaluate the neuronal pathology induced by PD-derived L1CAM-purified EVs. EV-associated microRNA (miRNA) profiling was used to screen for altered miRNAs in PD-derived L1CAM-purified EVs.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>PD patient-derived L1CAM-purified (likely neurogenic) EVs facilitated α-syn pathology and neuron loss in <i>Prnp-SNCA</i>
<sup>A53T</sup> transgenic PD mice. The miRNA, novel_miR_44438, was significantly increased in the PD group, which promoted α-syn accumulation and neuronal degeneration in a dose-dependent manner. Novel _miR_44438 directly targets NDST1 mRNA and inhibits the function of heparan sulfate, thus preventing exosome biogenesis and α-syn release from exosomes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Novel_miR_44438 in PD-derived L1CAM-purified EVs inhibits the α-syn efflux from neurons thereby promoting the pathological accumulation and aggregation of α-syn. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Knowledge and practice of community pharmacists towards SGLT2 inhibitors [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of oral anti-diabetic drugs which improve glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by preventing the kidney from reabsorbing glucose back to blood. Community pharmacists have long-term relationships with most of their chronic patients, so they play a key role in care for people with diabetes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess pharmacists’ knowledge and practice towards SGLT2 inhibitors. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to meet the study objectives. A convenience sample of 348 community pharmacists in Jordan was recruited. knowledge and practice were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire created for the purpose of this study. Results: A total of 400 community pharmacists were reached, of whom 348 answered the survey (response rate 87%). The results indicated that SGLT2 inhibitors knowledge score among community pharmacists in Jordan was 6.61 (out of 12). Factors like age, gender, location of the pharmacy, years of pharmacists’ experience had no effect on knowledge score; however, pharmacists who attended training courses on diabetes had higher knowledge scores. Additionally, pharmacists’ dispensing practice toward SGLT2 inhibitors had insufficient knowledge, such as lack of knowledge about the superiority of SGLT2 inhibitors over other anti-diabetics and inability to give the best advice to patients. Conclusions: Our findings reflect a moderate knowledge among community pharmacists about SGLT2 inhibitors which may negatively affect the patients’ outcome; thus, continuous education for the pharmacists is essential.

                The crime of electromagnetic records under unauthorized instruction (Article 168-2 and 3 of the Penal Code) requires that the program or the instruction code in question is against the intention of the computer user (counterintentionality) and socially unacceptable (unauthorized), as the requirements of objectivity. The significance or factors to be considered in the requirements of “counterintentionality” and “unauthorized” have not been clarified in practice. This paper examines the requirements of “counterintentionality” and “unauthorized” intent in crimes related to electromagnetic records with the Coinhive case as material, by means of a literature survey and case study. In addition, the significance and scope of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Coinhive case will be clarified.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The structure of the mammalian auditory brainstem is evolutionarily highly plastic, and distinct nuclei arrange in a species-dependent manner. Such anatomical variability is present in the superior olivary complex (SOC) and the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus (LL). Due to the structure–function relationship in the auditory brainstem, the identification of individual nuclei supports the understanding of sound processing. Here, we comparatively describe the nucleus arrangement and the expression of functional markers in the auditory brainstem of the two bat species <i>Phyllostomus discolor</i> and <i>Carollia perspicillata</i>. Using immunofluorescent labeling, we describe the arrangement and identity of the SOC and LL nuclei based on the expression of synaptic markers (vesicular glutamate transporter 1 and glycine transporter 2), calcium-binding proteins, as well as the voltage-gated ion channel subunits Kv1.1 and HCN1. The distribution of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic labeling appears similar between both species and matches with that of other mammals. The detection of calcium-binding proteins indicates species-dependent differences and deviations from other mammals. Kv1.1 and HCN1 show largely the same expression pattern in both species, which diverges from other mammals, indicating functional adaptations in the cellular physiology of bat neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Risk factors for hippocampal cavities in a marginally housed population</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cavities in the hippocampus are morphological variants of uncertain significance. Aberrant neurodevelopment along with vascular and inflammatory etiologies have been proposed. We sought to characterize these cavities and their potential risk factors in a marginally housed population, with high rates of viral infection, addiction, and mental illness. (1) The volume of hippocampal cavities (HCavs) is greater in this highly multimorbid population compared to the general population. (2) Conventional vascular risk factors such as greater age and systolic blood pressure are associated with higher HCav volume. (3) Nonprescribed substance-related risk factors such as stimulant use or dependence, and smoking are associated with increased HCav volume independent of vascular risk factors. This is a retrospective analysis of an ongoing prospective study. We analyzed baseline data, including medical history, physical exam, psychiatric diagnosis, and MRI from a total of 375 participants. Hippocampal cavities were defined as spaces isointense to CSF on T1 MRI sequences, bounded on all sides by hippocampal tissue, with a volume of at least 1 mm<sup>3</sup>. Risk factors were evaluated using negative binomial multiple regression. Stimulant use was reported by 87.3% of participants, with stimulant dependence diagnosed in 83.3% of participants. Prevalence of cavities was 71.6%, with a mean total bilateral HCav volume of 13.89 mm<sup>3</sup>. On average, a 1 mmHg greater systolic blood pressure was associated with a 2.17% greater total HCav volume (95% CI = [0.57%, 3.79%], p = .0076), while each cigarette smoked per day trended toward a 2.69% greater total HCav volume (95% CI = [−0.87%, 5.54%], p = .058). A diagnosis of stimulant dependence was associated with a 95.6% greater total HCav volume (95% CI = [5.39%, 263.19%], p = .0335). Hypertension and diagnosis of stimulant dependence were associated with a greater total volume of HCav.</p>

                Glutamate excitotoxicity during ischemia triggers an intracellular signaling avalanche leading to cell death, yet blocking NMDA receptors directly in human stroke trials failed. In this issue of Neuron, Zong et al. (2022) disrupt downstream NMDAR-TRPM2 coupling to improve stroke outcomes, supporting intracellular NMDAR signaling as an alternate therapeutic target.

                Social modulation of pain sensitivity is considered part of the empathic response. In this issue of Neuron, Zhang at al. (2022) uncover the neurobiological basis of observational pain in mice. They report increased synaptic transmission from the insular cortex to the basolateral amygdala and explore genes mediating this effect.

                In this issue of Neuron, Bharioke et al.

We discuss the implications of these findings for the mechanism of consciousness and anesthetic-induced unconsciousness.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The KASH5 protein involved in meiotic chromosomal movements is a novel dynein activating adaptor</a></h4>

              
                Dynein harnesses ATP hydrolysis to move cargo on microtubules in multiple biological contexts. Dynein meets a unique challenge in meiosis by moving chromosomes tethered to the nuclear envelope to facilitate homolog pairing essential for gametogenesis. Though processive dynein motility requires binding to an activating adaptor, the identity of the activating adaptor required for dynein to move meiotic chromosomes is unknown. We show that the meiosis-specific nuclear-envelope protein KASH5 is a dynein activating adaptor: KASH5 directly binds dynein using a mechanism conserved among activating adaptors and converts dynein into a processive motor. We map the dynein-binding surface of KASH5, identifying mutations that abrogate dynein binding <i>in vitro</i> and disrupt recruitment of the dynein machinery to the nuclear envelope in cultured cells and mouse spermatocytes <i>in vivo</i>. Our study identifies KASH5 as the first transmembrane dynein activating adaptor and provides molecular insights into how it activates dynein during meiosis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Age-associated changes to neuronal dynamics involve a disruption of excitatory/inhibitory balance in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                In the aging brain, many of the alterations underlying cognitive and behavioral decline remain opaque. <i>C. elegans</i> offers a powerful model for aging research, with a simple, well-studied nervous system to further our understanding of the cellular modifications and functional alterations accompanying senescence. We perform multi-neuronal functional imaging across the aged <i>C. elegans</i> nervous system, measuring an age-associated breakdown in system-wide functional organization. At single-cell resolution, we detect shifts in activity dynamics toward higher frequencies. In addition, we measure a specific loss of inhibitory signaling that occurs early in the aging process and alters the systems critical excitatory/inhibitory balance. These effects are recapitulated with mutation of the calcium channel subunit UNC-2/CaV2a. We find that manipulation of inhibitory GABA signaling can partially ameliorate or accelerate the effects of aging. The effects of aging are also partially mitigated by disruption of the insulin signaling pathway, known to increase longevity, or by a reduction of caspase activation. Data from mammals are consistent with our findings, suggesting a conserved shift in the balance of excitatory/inhibitory signaling with age that leads to breakdown in global neuronal dynamics and functional decline.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Semantic relatedness retroactively boosts memory and promotes memory interdependence across episodes</a></h4>

              
                Two fundamental issues in memory research concern when later experiences strengthen or weaken initial memories and when the two memories become linked or remain independent. A promising candidate for explaining these issues is semantic relatedness. Here, across five paired-associate learning experiments (N=1000), we systematically varied the semantic relatedness between initial and later cues, initial and later targets, or both. We found that learning retroactively benefited long-term memory performance for semantically related words (vs. unshown control words), and these benefits increased as a function of relatedness. Critically, memory dependence between initial and later pairs also increased with relatedness, suggesting that pre-existing semantic relationships promote interdependence for memories formed across episodes. We also found that modest retroactive benefits, but not interdependencies, emerged when subjects learned via studying rather than practice testing. These findings demonstrate that semantic relatedness during new learning retroactively strengthens old associations while scaffolding new ones into well-fortified memory traces.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Admixture of evolutionary rates across a butterfly hybrid zone</a></h4>

              
                Hybridization is a major evolutionary force that can erode genetic differentiation between species, whereas reproductive isolation maintains such differentiation. In studying a hybrid zone between the swallowtail butterflies Papilio syfanius and Papilio maackii (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae), we made the unexpected discovery that genomic substitution rates are unequal between the parental species. This phenomenon creates a novel process in hybridization, where genomic regions most affected by gene flow evolve at similar rates between species, while genomic regions with strong reproductive isolation evolve at species-specific rates. Thus, hybridization mixes evolutionary rates in a way similar to its effect on genetic ancestry. Using coalescent theory, we show that the rate-mixing process provides distinct information about levels of gene flow across different parts of genomes, and the degree of rate-mixing can be predicted quantitatively from relative sequence divergence (<i>F<sub>ST</sub></i>) between the hybridizing species at equilibrium. Overall, we demonstrate that reproductive isolation maintains not only genomic differentiation, but also the rate at which differentiation accumulates. Thus, asymmetric rates of evolution provide an additional signature of loci involved in reproductive isolation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The metabolome of Mexican cavefish shows a convergent signature highlighting sugar, antioxidant, and Ageing-Related metabolites</a></h4>

              
                Insights from organisms, which have evolved natural strategies for promoting survivability under extreme environmental pressures, may help guide future research into novel approaches for enhancing human longevity. The cave-adapted Mexican tetra, <i>Astyanax mexicanus</i>, has attracted interest as a model system for <i>metabolic resilience</i>, a term we use to denote the property of maintaining health and longevity under conditions that would be highly deleterious in other organisms (Figure 1). Cave-dwelling populations of Mexican tetra exhibit elevated blood glucose, insulin resistance and hypertrophic visceral adipocytes compared to surface-dwelling counterparts. However, cavefish appear to avoid pathologies typically associated with these conditions, such as accumulation of advanced-glycation-end-products (AGEs) and chronic tissue inflammation. The metabolic strategies underlying the resilience properties of <i>A. mexicanus</i> cavefish, and how they relate to environmental challenges of the cave environment, are poorly understood. Here, we provide an untargeted metabolomics study of long- and short-term fasting in two <i>A. mexicanus</i> cave populations and one surface population. We find that, although the metabolome of cavefish bears many similarities with pathological conditions such as metabolic syndrome, cavefish also exhibit features not commonly associated with a pathological condition, and in some cases considered indicative of an overall robust metabolic condition. These include a reduction in cholesteryl esters and intermediates of protein glycation, and an increase in antioxidants and metabolites associated with hypoxia and longevity. This work suggests that certain metabolic features associated with human pathologies are either not intrinsically harmful, or can be counteracted by reciprocal adaptations. We provide a transparent pipeline for reproducing our analysis and a Shiny app for other researchers to explore and visualize our dataset.

                The cranial endo- and dermal skeletons, which comprise the vertebrate skull, evolved independently over 470 million years ago and form separately during embryogenesis. In mammals, much of the cartilaginous chondrocranium is transient, undergoing endochondral ossification or disappearing, so its role in skull morphogenesis is not well studied and it remains an enigmatic structure. We provide complete three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of the laboratory mouse chondrocranium from embryonic day 13.5 through 17.5 using a novel methodology of uncertainty-guided segmentation of phosphotungstic enhanced 3D microcomputed tomography images with sparse annotation. We evaluate the embryonic mouse chondrocranium and dermatocranium in 3D and delineate the effects of a <i>Fgfr2</i> variant on embryonic chondrocranial cartilages and on their association with forming dermal bones using the <i>Fgfr2c<sup>C342Y/+</sup></i> Crouzon syndrome mouse. We show that the dermatocranium develops outside of and in shapes that conform to the chondrocranium. Results reveal direct effects of the <i>Fgfr2</i> variant on embryonic cartilage, on chondrocranium morphology, and on the association between chondrocranium and dermatocranium development. Histologically we observe a trend of relatively more chondrocytes, larger chondrocytes, and/or more matrix in the <i>Fgfr2c<sup>C342Y/+</sup></i> embryos at all timepoints before the chondrocranium begins to disintegrate at E16.5. The chondrocrania and forming dermatocrania of <i>Fgfr2c<sup>C342Y/+</sup></i> embryos are relatively large, but a contrasting trend begins at E16.5 and continues into early postnatal (P0 and P2) timepoints, with the skulls of older <i>Fgfr2c<sup>C342Y/+</sup></i> mice reduced in most dimensions compared to <i>Fgfr2c<sup>+/+</sup></i> littermates. Our findings have implications for the study and treatment of human craniofacial disease, for understanding the impact of chondrocranial morphology on skull growth, and potentially on the evolution of skull morphology.

Here, we show that treatment with NUsc1, a single-chain variable fragment antibody (scFv) that selectively targets A{beta}Os, prevents the inhibition of long-term potentiation in hippocampal slices and memory impairment induced by A{beta}Os in mice. As a therapeutic approach for intracerebral antibody delivery, we developed an adeno-associated virus vector to drive neuronal expression of NUsc1 (AAV-NUsc1) within the brain. Transduction by AAV-NUsc1 induced NUsc1 expression and secretion in adult human brain slices, and inhibited A{beta}O binding to neurons and A{beta}O-induced loss of dendritic spine loss in primary rat hippocampal cultures. Treatment of mice with AAV-NUsc1 prevented memory impairment induced by A{beta}Os and, importantly, reversed memory deficits in aged APPswe/PS1{Delta}E9 Alzheimers disease model mice. These results support the feasibility of gene-mediated immunotherapy using single-chain antibodies as a potential therapeutic approach in Alzheimers disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A neuron model with unbalanced synaptic weights explains asymmetric effects of ketamine in auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Although new advances in neuroscience allow the study of vocal communication in awake animals, substantial progress in the processing of vocalizations has been made from brains of anaesthetized preparations. Thus, understanding how anaesthetics affect neuronal responses is of paramount importance. Here, we used electrophysiological recordings and computational modelling to study how the auditory cortex of bats responds to vocalizations under anaesthesia and in wakefulness. We found that multifunctional neurons that process echolocation and communication sounds were affected by ketamine anaesthesia in a manner that could not be predicted by known anaesthetic effects. In wakefulness, acoustic contexts (preceding echolocation or communication sequences) led to stimulus-specific suppression of lagging sounds, accentuating neuronal responses to sound transitions. However, under anaesthesia, communication contexts (but not echolocation) led to a global suppression of responses to lagging sounds. Such asymmetric effect was dependent on the frequency composition of the contexts and not on their temporal patterns. We constructed a neuron model that could replicate the data obtained in vivo. In the model, anaesthesia modulates spiking activity in a channel-specific manner, decreasing responses of cortical inputs tuned to high-frequency sounds and increasing adaptation in the respective cortical synapses. Combined, our findings obtained in vivo and in silico reveal that ketamine anaesthesia does not reduce uniformly the neurons responsiveness to low and high frequency sounds. This effect depends on combined mechanisms that unbalance cortical inputs and ultimately affect how auditory cortex neurons respond to natural sounds in anaesthetized preparations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Closed-loop control and recalibration of place cells by optic flow</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the interplay between sensory input, endogenous neural dynamics, and behavioral output is key toward understanding the principles of neural computation. Hippocampal place cells are an ideal system to investigate this closed-loop interaction, as they are influenced by both self-motion (idiothetic) signals and by external sensory landmarks as an animal navigates its environment. To continuously update a position signal on an internal "cognitive map", the hippocampal system integrates self-motion signals over time. In the absence of stable, external landmarks, however, these spatial correlates of neuronal activity can quickly accumulate error and cause the internal representation of position or direction to drift relative to the external environment. We have previously demonstrated that, in addition to their known roles in preventing and/or correcting path-integration error, external landmarks can be used as a putative teaching signal to recalibrate the gain of the path integration system. However, it remains unclear whether idiothetic cues, such as optic flow, exert sufficient influence on the cognitive map to enable recalibration of path integration, or if instead an unambiguous allocentric frame of reference, anchored by polarizing landmark information, is essential for path integration recalibration. Here, we use principles of control theory to demonstrate systematic control of place fields by pure optic flow information in freely moving animals by using a neurally closed-loop virtual reality system that adjusts optic flow speed as a function of real-time decoding of the hippocampal spatial map. Using this "cognitive clamp", we show that we can not only bring the updating of the map under control of the optic flow cues but we can also elicit recalibration of path integration. This finding demonstrates that the brain continuously rebalances the influence of conflicting idiothetic cues to fine-tune the neural dynamics of path integration, and that this recalibration process does not require a top-down, unambiguous position signal from landmarks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Real-time imaging of mitochondrial redox reveals increased mitochondrial oxidative stress associated with amyloid beta aggregates in vivo in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: Reactive oxidative stress is a critical player in the amyloid beta toxicity that contributes to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mitochondrial damage, observed in AD, is one of the main sources of reactive oxygen species. Although abeta causes neuronal mitochondria-associated reactive oxidative stress in vitro, this has never been directly observed in the in vivo living brain. Here, we tested whether abeta plaques and soluble oligomers induce mitochondrial oxidative stress in surrounding neurons in vivo, and whether the neurotoxic effect can be abrogated using mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants. Methods: We expressed a genetically encoded fluorescent ratiometric mitochondria-targeted reporter of oxidative stress in mouse models of the disease, and performed intravital multiphoton microscopy of neuronal mitochondria and A{beta} plaques. Results: For the first time, we demonstrated by direct observation exacerbated mitochondrial oxidative stress in neurons after both abeta plaque deposition and direct application of soluble oligomeric abeta onto the brain, and determined the most likely pathological sequence of events leading to oxidative stress in vivo. Oxidative stress could be inhibited by both blocking calcium influx into mitochondria and treating with the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant SS31. Conclusions: Considering these results, mitochondria-targeted compounds hold promise as neuroprotective drugs for the prevention and/or treatment of AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A GPU-based computational framework that bridges Neuron simulation and Artificial Intelligence</a></h4>

              
                Biophysically detailed multi-compartment models are powerful tools to explore computational principles of the brain and also serve as a theoretical framework to generate algorithms for artificial intelligence (AI) systems. However, the expensive computational cost severely limits the applications in both the neuroscience and AI fields. The major bottleneck during simulating detailed compartment models is the ability of a simulator to solve large systems of linear equations. Here, we present a novel Dendritic Hierarchical Scheduling (DHS) method to markedly accelerate such process. We theoretically prove that the DHS implementation is computationally optimal and accurate. This GPU-based method performs at 2-3 orders of magnitude higher speed than that of the classic serial Hines method in the conventional CPU platform. We build a DeepDendrite framework, which integrates the DHS method and the GPU computing engine of the NEURON simulator and demonstrate applications of DeepDendrite in neuroscience and AI tasks. We investigated how spatial patterns of spine inputs affects neuronal excitability in a detailed human pyramidal neuron model with 25,000 spines; and examined how dendrites protect morphologically detailed neural networks against adversarial attacks in typical image classification tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct hippocampal and cortical contributions in the representation of hierarchies</a></h4>

              
                Humans generate complex hierarchies across a variety of domains, including language and music, and this capacity is often associated with activity in inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Non-human animals have also been shown to represent simple hierarchies in spatial navigation, and human neuroimaging work has implicated the hippocampus in the encoding of items-in-contexts representations, which constitute 2-level hierarchical dependencies. These fields of research use distinct paradigms, leading to disjoint models and precluding cross-species comparisons. Here, we designed a paradigm to integrate both literature strands and show that anterior hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex encode hierarchical context, mimicking findings from animal spatial navigation. Additionally, we replicated classic neurolinguistic findings of 1) left IFG and posterior temporal cortex in the representation of hierarchies and 2) the association between IFG and processing automaticity. We propose that mammals share an evolutionary ancient system to generate simple hierarchies which is complemented in humans by additional capacities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cell-type specific transcriptomic signatures of neocortical circuit organization and their relevance to autism</a></h4>

              
                A prevailing challenge in neuroscience is understanding how diverse neuronal cell types select their synaptic partners to form circuits. In the neocortex, major subclasses of excitatory projection neurons and inhibitory interneurons are conserved across functionally distinct regions. There is evidence these subclasses form circuits that depend primarily on their identity; however, regional cues likely also influence their choice of synaptic partners. We mined the Allen Brain Institute's single-cell RNA-sequencing database of mouse cortical neurons to study the expression of cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs) necessary for synapse formation in two regions: the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) and the primary visual cortex (VISp). We used the Allen's metadata to parse cells by clusters representing major excitatory and inhibitory subclasses that are common to both ALM and VISp. We then performed two types of pairwise differential gene expression analysis: 1) between different neuronal subclasses within the same brain region (ALM or VISp), and 2) between the same neuronal subclass in ALM and VISp. We filtered our results for differentially expressed genes encoding CAMs and developed a novel bioinformatic approach to determine the sets uniquely enriched in each neuronal subclass in ALM, VISp, or both. This analysis provides an organized set of genes that may regulate circuit formation in a cell-type specific manner. Furthermore, it identifies candidate mechanisms for the formation of circuits that are conserved across functionally distinct cortical regions or that are region dependent. Finally, we used the SFARI Human Gene Module to identify CAMs from our analysis that are related to risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). From over 3,000 differentially expressed genes, we found 40 ASD-associated CAMs that are enriched in specific neuronal subclasses in both ALM and VISp. Our analysis provides clear molecular targets for future studies to understand neocortical circuit organization and abnormalities that underly autistic phenotypes.

                The human fetal period is associated with a rapid emergence of body organ functions and systems, including establishment of the functional brain connectome. In order to characterise developmental features of in-utero functional activity, we introduce a novel perspective on resting-state functional networks, which we call "maturational networks", or "matnets". The key feature of this framework is that it incorporates age-related changes in connectivity into network estimation, thereby characterising functional networks as an emerging property of the brain. We find that fetal matnets reveal several spatially distributed patterns of connections with remarkable anatomical specificity. The framework also enables construction of a whole-brain view of maturational relationships across the early brain's functional organisation, which we term the "maturational connectome". We find that the fetal maturational connectome is composed of several groups of maturational networks, among which two groups which are associated with active environmental interaction through perceptual and motor-planning mechanisms, assume a central role.

                Sleep is important for cognitive and physical performance. Sleep deprivation not only affects neural functions but also results in muscular fatigue. A good night's sleep reverses these functional derangements caused by sleep deprivation. The role of sleep in brain function has been extensively studied. However, its role in neuromuscular junction or skeletal muscle morphology is sparsely addressed although skeletal muscle atonia and suspended thermoregulation during rapid eye movement sleep possibly provides a conducive environment for the muscle to rest and repair; somewhat similar to slow-wave sleep for synaptic downscaling. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of 24 h sleep deprivation on the neuromuscular junction morphology and neurochemistry using electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry in the rat soleus muscle. Acute sleep deprivation altered synaptic ultra-structure viz. mitochondria, synaptic vesicle, synaptic proteins, basal lamina, and junctional folds needed for neuromuscular transmission. Further acute sleep deprivation showed the depletion of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and the overactivity of its degrading enzyme acetylcholine esterase at the neuromuscular junction. The impact of sleep deprivation on synaptic homeostasis in the brain has been extensively reported recently. The present evidence from our studies shows new information on the role of sleep on neuromuscular junction homeostasis and its functioning.

                Central neurons express unique repertoires of secreted and transmembrane proteins that define their synaptic connectivity. However, how these molecular programs are regulated remains poorly understood. Our study shows that, in inhibitory GABAergic interneurons in the mouse forebrain, transcription of synaptic organizer molecules is controlled by Nr4a1, a nuclear receptor whose expression is transiently induced by sensory experience and required for normal learning. Nr4a1 exserts opposite effects on local axonal wiring of Parvalbumin- and Somatostatin-positive interneurons that innervate different subcellular domains of their postsynaptic partners. Loss of Nr4a1 activity in these interneurons leads to cell-type-specific transcriptional switches in multiple gene families, including those involved in surface adhesion and repulsion. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which inducible transcription factors dynamically alter the combinatorial synaptic organizing codes for structural plasticity.

                Ectopic expression in fibroblasts of synapsin 1 and synaptophysin is sufficient to generate condensates of vesicles highly reminiscent of synaptic vesicle (SV) clusters and with liquid-like properties. We show that unlike synaptophysin, other major integral SV membrane proteins fail to form condensates with synapsin, but coassemble into the clusters formed by synaptophysin and synapsin in this ectopic expression system. Another vesicle membrane protein, ATG9A, undergoes activity-dependent exo-endocytosis at synapses, raising questions about the relation of ATG9A traffic to the traffic of SVs. We have found that both in fibroblasts and in nerve terminals ATG9A does not coassemble into synaptophysin-positive vesicle condensates but localizes on a distinct class of vesicles that also assembles with synapsin but into a distinct phase. Our findings suggest that ATG9A undergoes differential sorting relative to SV proteins and also point to a dual role of synapsin in controlling clustering at synapses of SVs and ATG9A vesicles.

However, studies of brain development have chiefly quantified fluctuations within regions over time rather than propagations occurring over space. Here, we leveraged advances in neuroimaging and computer vision to track cortical activity propagations in a large sample of youth (n=388). We found that propagations robustly ascend and descend the cortical hierarchy, and that top-down propagations become both more prevalent with cognitive control demands and with development in youth.

	<p>GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain, depolarizes and excites immature neurons because of an initially higher intracellular chloride concentration [Cl&amp;amp;minus;]i due to the delayed expression of the chloride exporter KCC2 at birth. Depolarization-induced calcium rise via NMDA receptors and voltage-dependent calcium channels is instrumental in shaping neuronal circuits and in controlling the excitatory (E)/inhibitory (I) balance in selective brain areas. An E/I imbalance accounts for cognitive impairment observed in several neuropsychiatric disorders. The aim of this review is to summarize recent data on the mechanisms by which alterations of GABAergic signaling alter the E/I balance in cortical and hippocampal neurons in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) and the role of cation-chloride co-transporters in this process. In particular, we discuss the NGF and AD relationship and how mice engineered to express recombinant neutralizing anti-NGF antibodies (AD11 mice), which develop a neurodegenerative pathology reminiscent of that observed in AD patients, exhibit a depolarizing action of GABA due to KCC2 impairment. Treating AD and other forms of dementia with bumetanide, a selective KCC2 antagonist, contributes to re-establishing a proper E/I balance in selective brain areas, leading to amelioration of AD symptoms and the slowing down of disease progression.</p>

	<p>GRIN2B mutations are rare but often associated with patients having severe neurodevelopmental disorders with varying range of symptoms such as intellectual disability, developmental delay and epilepsy. Patient symptoms likely arise from mutations disturbing the role that the encoded NMDA receptor subunit, GluN2B, plays at neuronal connections in the developing nervous system. In this study, we investigated the cell-autonomous effects of putative gain- (GoF) and loss-of-function (LoF) missense GRIN2B mutations on excitatory synapses onto CA1 pyramidal neurons in organotypic hippocampal slices. In the absence of both native GluN2A and GluN2B subunits, functional incorporation into synaptic NMDA receptors was attenuated for GoF mutants, or almost eliminated for LoF GluN2B mutants. NMDA-receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (NMDA-EPSCs) from synaptic GoF GluN1/2B receptors had prolonged decays consistent with their functional classification. Nonetheless, in the presence of native GluN2A, molecular replacement of native GluN2B with GoF and LoF GluN2B mutants all led to similar functional incorporation into synaptic receptors, more rapidly decaying NMDA-EPSCs and greater inhibition by TCN-201, a selective antagonist for GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors. Mechanistic insight was gained from experiments in HEK293T cells, which revealed that GluN2B GoF mutants slowed deactivation in diheteromeric GluN1/2B, but not triheteromeric GluN1/2A/2B receptors. We also show that a disease-associated missense mutation, which severely affects surface expression, causes opposing effects on NMDA-EPSC decay and charge transfer when introduced into GluN2A or GluN2B. Finally, we show that having a single null Grin2b allele has only a modest effect on NMDA-EPSC decay kinetics. Our results demonstrate that functional incorporation of GoF and LoF GluN2B mutants into synaptic receptors and the effects on EPSC decay times are highly dependent on the presence of triheteromeric GluN1/2A/2B NMDA receptors, thereby influencing the functional classification of NMDA receptor variants as GoF or LoF mutations. These findings highlight the complexity of interpreting effects of disease-causing NMDA receptor missense mutations in the context of neuronal function.</p>

	<p>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of brain disorders. In this review, we have investigated potential MEG applications for analysing brain disorders. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNRMEG =2.2 db, SNREEG &amp;amp;lt;1 db) and spatial resolution (SRMEG =2&amp;amp;ndash;3 mm, SREEG =7&amp;amp;ndash;10 mm) is higher for MEG than EEG, thus MEG potentially facilitates accurate monitoring of cortical activity. We found that the direct electrophysiological MEG signals reflected the physiological status of neurological disorders and play a vital role in disease diagnosis. Single-channel connectivity, as well as brain network analysis, using MEG data acquired during resting state and a given task has been used for the diagnosis of neurological disorders such as epilepsy, Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s, Parkinsonism, autism, and schizophrenia. The workflow of MEG and its potential applications in the diagnosis of disease and therapeutic planning are also discussed. We forecast that computer-aided algorithms will play a prominent role in the diagnosis and prediction of neurological diseases in the future. The outcome of this narrative review will aid researchers to utilise MEG in diagnostics.</p>

	<p>The mainstays of glioblastoma treatment, maximal safe resection, radiotherapy preserving neurological function, and temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy have not changed for the past 17 years despite significant advances in the understanding of the genetics and molecular biology of glioblastoma. This review highlights the neurosurgical foundation for glioblastoma therapy. Here, we review the neurosurgeon&amp;amp;rsquo;s role in several new and clinically-approved treatments for glioblastoma. We describe delivery techniques such as blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier disruption and convection-enhanced delivery (CED) that may be used to deliver therapeutic agents to tumor tissue in higher concentrations than oral or intravenous delivery. We mention pivotal clinical trials of immunotherapy for glioblastoma and explain their outcomes. Finally, we take a glimpse at ongoing clinical trials and promising translational studies to predict ways that new therapies may improve the prognosis of patients with glioblastoma.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Emotion regulation (ER) is regarded as a core treatment target for depression and other mental illnesses. In recent years, non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has been extensively used as an intervention for mental illnesses, but there has been no systematic review conducted regarding its effect on emotion regulation. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of NIBS for emotion regulation; (2) Methods: Systematic searches were conducted in Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, and Cochrane Library. We analyzed the effects of NIBS on tasks assessing emotion regulation using a random-effects model, and further explored the moderating role of the following factors on transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) studies by conducting subgroup analyses and meta-regression: target electrode placement, return electrode placement, current intensity, target electrode size, and duration of intervention; (3) Results: A total of 17 studies were included. Our meta-analysis indicated a small but significant effect of NIBS on the downregulation of negative emotions. Separate analyses indicated that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) had a medium and significant effect on the downregulation of negative emotions, whereas tDCS had no significant effect. Subgroup analyses showed that the effect of tDCS was moderated by target and return electrode placemen; (4) Conclusions: These results indicate that NIBS had a positive effect on the downregulation of negative emotions. The stimulation protocols should be carefully considered and the underlying mechanisms should be further explored.</p>

	<p>Suicidality is increased in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet effective interventions are lacking. Developing biologically based approaches for preventing and treating suicidality in ASD hinges on the identification of biomarkers of suicidal ideation (SI). Here, we assessed magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) markers of glutamatergic neurotransmission in ASD youth and young adults. Twenty-eight ASD participants (16&amp;amp;ndash;33 years) underwent 1H-MRS, and metabolites were quantified using LCModel. N-acetylaspartate (NAA), glutamate (Glu), and the NAA/Glu ratio from the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were compared between ASD SI+ (n = 13) and ASD SI&amp;amp;minus; (n = 15) participants. We found that ASD SI+ participants had a higher NAA/Glu ratio compared ASD SI- participants. The NAA/Glu ratio also predicted SI and significantly discriminated between ASD SI+/SI&amp;amp;minus; participants. All analyses including NAA and Glu alone were non-significant. Here, we provide preliminary evidence for the importance of NAA/Glu in ASD with SI, with implications for biomarker discovery. Further mechanistic research into risk and interventional approaches to address SI in ASD are needed.</p>

	<p>Leukoaraiosis (LA) is commonly found in aging healthy people but its pathophysiological mechanism is not entirely known. Furthermore, there is still a lack of effective pathological biomarkers that can be used to identify the early stage of LA. Our aim was to investigate the white matter structural network in asymptomatic patients with the early stage of LA. Tractography data of 35 asymptomatic patients and 20 matched healthy controls (HCs) based on diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) were analysed by using graph theory approaches and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Diffusion parameters measured within the ALAs and HCs were compared. Decreased clustering coefficient and local efficiency values of the overall topological white matter network were observed in the ALAs compared with those of the HCs. Participants in the asymptomatic group also had lower nodal efficiency in the left triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, right calcarine fissure and surrounding cortex, right temporal pole of the superior temporal gyrus and left middle temporal gyrus compared to the ALAs. Moreover, similar hub distributions were found within participants in the two groups. In this study, our data demonstrated a topologic efficiency abnormalities of the structural network in asymptomatic patients with leukoaraiosis. The structural connectome provides potential connectome-based measures that may be helpful for detecting leukoaraiosis before clinical symptoms evolve.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Application of the amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration framework in cognitively intact adults: the CABLE Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (AT[N]) framework has conceptualized Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum as a continuum of disease with evidences of amyloid-related pathologies independent of clinical manifestation. Based on this framework, it is necessary to reveal the distribution and risk factors of AD continuum in the cognitively intact population among different cohorts and races, including the northern Chinese Han population.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This study classified cognitively intact Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and LifestylE (CABLE) participants through the AT(N) scheme. Gaussian mixture models were used to identity the cutoff values of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, which distinguished AD continuum (A + T-N-, A + T + N-, A + T-N+ and A + T + N+) from 1,005 participants (mean age: 61 years; 40% female). Multivariable logistic regressions and Cochran-Armitage trend tests were used to test neuropsychological performance and risk factors for AD continuum.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Approximately one-third of individuals (33.7%) belonged to AD continuum. Four potential modifiable risk factors, including hypertension, thyroid diseases, social isolation and minimal depression symptoms, were identified for AD continuum (odds ratio [OR] ranging from 1.68 to 6.90). A trend toward higher prevalence of AD continuum was associated with a larger number of risk factors (P for trend &lt;0.0001). The risk of AD continuum increased by about two times for each additional modifiable risk factor (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.65–2.24, P &lt; 0.0001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study revealed the distribution and potential risk factors of AD continuum in cognitively intact Han population in northern China, which filled the gap in the area about the performance of the AT(N) framework in the Asian population.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">GGC repeat expansion of RILPL1 is associated with oculopharyngodistal myopathy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is an adult-onset neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive ptosis, dysarthria, ophthalmoplegia, and distal muscle weakness. Recent studies revealed GGC repeat expansions in 5’-UTR of <i>LRP12</i>, <i>GIPC1</i>, and <i>NOTCH2NLC</i> are associated with OPDM. Despite these advances, around 30% of OPDM patients remain genetically undiagnosed. Herein, we aim to investigate genetic basis for undiagnosed OPDM patients in two unrelated Chinese Han families.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Parametric linkage analysis was performed. Long-read sequencing followed by repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction (RP-PCR) and amplicon length polymerase chain reaction (AL-PCR) were used to determine the genetic cause. Targeted methylation sequencing was implemented to detect epigenetic changes. The possible pathogenesis mechanism was investigated by qPCR, immunoblotting, RNA FISH, and immunofluorescence staining of muscle biopsy samples.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The disease locus was mapped to 12q24.3. Subsequently, GGC repeat expansion in the promoter region of <i>RILPL1</i> was identified in six OPDM patients from two families, findings consistent with a founder effect, designated as OPDM type 4 (OPDM4). Targeted methylation sequencing revealed hypermethylation at <i>RILPL1</i> locus in unaffected individuals with ultralong expansion. Analysis of muscle samples showed no significant differences in <i>RILPL1</i> mRNA or RILPL1 protein levels between patients and controls. Public CAGE-seq data indicated that alternative TSSs exist upstream of the RefSeq-annotated <i>RILPL1</i> TSS. Strand-specific RNAseq data revealed bidirectional transcription from the <i>RILPL1</i> locus. Finally, FISH/IF indicated that both sense and antisense transcripts formed RNA foci and were co-localized with hnRNPA2B1 and p62 in the intranuclear inclusions of OPDM4 patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings implicate abnormal GGC repeat expansions in the promoter region of <i>RILPL1</i> as a novel genetic cause for OPDM, and suggest a methylation mechanism and a potential RNA toxicity mechanism are involved in OPDM4 pathogenesis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence and characteristics of referred pain in patients diagnosed with temporomandibular disorders according to the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Referred pain often complicates and delays the diagnosis of temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Elaborating the prevalence and characteristics of TMD-associated referred pain as well as the distribution of referred pain in different TMD classes will significantly improve the diagnostic process. The objectives of the present study were to assess the prevalence and to evaluate the characteristics of referred pain associated with TMD diagnosed according to the DC/TMD. Methods: A total of 252 patients were evaluated using the DC/TMD Axes-I and –II assessment tools. Different modalities were used to treat the diagnosed TMD. Referred pain was diagnosed when the location of the perceived pain in response to palpation extended beyond the boundary of the structure that was examined. For pain locations that were perceived as deep, patients were asked to locate the surface of the area of pain. The result of the assessment was identified as positive if the patient described his perceived pain during the clinical examination as being familiar pain that was experienced in the same location in the last 30 days.  Results: TMD-associated referred pain was recorded in 153 patients (60.7%). The most common referred pain location was the temporal area (45.2%), followed by the ear (42.1%). The referred pain was recorded in disc displacement with reduction with intermittent locking and myofascial pain with referral in all patients (100%). The proportion of patients with referred pain was significantly different between the different TMD diagnostic subgroups (P < 0.001).  The recorded percentage of improvement in the referred pain following the treatment was 50.41% after 3 months and 56.65% after 6 months. Conclusions: Referred pain is a prominent feature of TMD. More studies are required with longer follow-up periods and bigger sample sizes to support the findings of the present study.

                Middle-aged persons with multimorbidity have to take their illnesses into account in their daily work, family and leisure activities. The MuMiA project aims to identify early preventive measures that make it easier for those between 30 and 60 years of age with multiple chronic diseases to manage their illnesses in their everyday lives. An interdisciplinary workshop and interviews with multimorbid middle-aged adults and their principal healthcare providers will be used to collect information on the management of care in the contexts of patients’ daily work, family and leisure activities. Data obtained in the interviews will be coded inductively and analysed using content analysis. Workshop outputs will be transcribed and evaluated by the authors. This study has received ethical approval from the Faculty of Medicine Ethics Committee of Goethe University (2021-47). The project will generate prevention recommendations that reflect the experiences of middle-aged persons living with multimorbidity and the views of their principal healthcare providers. The findings will be disseminated via conferences and peer-reviewed publications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Direct reciprocity between individuals that use different strategy spaces</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Laura Schmid, Christian Hilbe, Krishnendu Chatterjee, Martin A. Nowak</p>

In repeated interactions, players can use strategies that respond to the outcome of previous rounds. Much of the existing literature on direct reciprocity assumes that all competing individuals use the same strategy space. Here, we study both learning and evolutionary dynamics of players that differ in the strategy space they explore. We focus on the infinitely repeated donation game and compare three natural strategy spaces: memory-1 strategies, which consider the last moves of both players, reactive strategies, which respond to the last move of the co-player, and unconditional strategies. These three strategy spaces differ in the memory capacity that is needed. We compute the long term average payoff that is achieved in a pairwise learning process. We find that smaller strategy spaces can dominate larger ones. For weak selection, unconditional players dominate both reactive and memory-1 players. For intermediate selection, reactive players dominate memory-1 players. Only for strong selection and low cost-to-benefit ratio, memory-1 players dominate the others. We observe that the supergame between strategy spaces can be a social dilemma: maximum payoff is achieved if both players explore a larger strategy space, but smaller strategy spaces dominate.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Pre- and postsynaptically expressed spike-timing-dependent plasticity contribute differentially to neuronal learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Beatriz Eymi Pimentel Mizusaki, Sally Si Ying Li, Rui Ponte Costa, Per Jesper Sjöström</p>

A plethora of experimental studies have shown that long-term synaptic plasticity can be expressed pre- or postsynaptically depending on a range of factors such as developmental stage, synapse type, and activity patterns. The functional consequences of this diversity are not clear, although it is understood that whereas postsynaptic expression of plasticity predominantly affects synaptic response amplitude, presynaptic expression alters both synaptic response amplitude and short-term dynamics. In most models of neuronal learning, long-term synaptic plasticity is implemented as changes in connective weights. The consideration of long-term plasticity as a fixed change in amplitude corresponds more closely to post- than to presynaptic expression, which means theoretical outcomes based on this choice of implementation may have a postsynaptic bias. To explore the functional implications of the diversity of expression of long-term synaptic plasticity, we adapted a model of long-term plasticity, more specifically spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), such that it was expressed either independently pre- or postsynaptically, or in a mixture of both ways. We compared pair-based standard STDP models and a biologically tuned triplet STDP model, and investigated the outcomes in a minimal setting, using two different learning schemes: in the first, inputs were triggered at different latencies, and in the second a subset of inputs were temporally correlated. We found that presynaptic changes adjusted the speed of learning, while postsynaptic expression was more efficient at regulating spike timing and frequency. When combining both expression loci, postsynaptic changes amplified the response range, while presynaptic plasticity allowed control over postsynaptic firing rates, potentially providing a form of activity homeostasis. Our findings highlight how the seemingly innocuous choice of implementing synaptic plasticity by single weight modification may unwittingly introduce a postsynaptic bias in modelling outcomes. We conclude that pre- and postsynaptically expressed plasticity are not interchangeable, but enable complimentary functions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Gamma oscillations in primate primary visual cortex are severely attenuated by small stimulus discontinuities</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vinay Shirhatti, Poojya Ravishankar, Supratim Ray</p>

Gamma oscillations (30 to 80 Hz) have been hypothesized to play an important role in feature binding, based on the observation that continuous long bars induce stronger gamma in the visual cortex than bars with a small gap. Recently, many studies have shown that natural images, which have discontinuities in several low-level features, do not induce strong gamma oscillations, questioning their role in feature binding. However, the effect of different discontinuities on gamma has not been well studied. To address this, we recorded spikes and local field potential from 2 monkeys while they were shown gratings with discontinuities in 4 attributes: space, orientation, phase, or contrast. We found that while these discontinuities only had a modest effect on spiking activity, gamma power drastically reduced in all cases, suggesting that gamma could be a resonant phenomenon. An excitatory–inhibitory population model with stimulus-tuned recurrent inputs showed such resonant properties. Therefore, gamma could be a signature of excitation–inhibition balance, which gets disrupted due to discontinuities.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Aberrant induction of p19Arf-mediated cellular senescence contributes to neurodevelopmental defects</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Muriel Rhinn, Irene Zapata-Bodalo, Annabelle Klein, Jean-Luc Plassat, Tania Knauer-Meyer, William M. Keyes</p>

Valproic acid (VPA) is a widely prescribed drug to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and migraine. If taken during pregnancy, however, exposure to the developing embryo can cause birth defects, cognitive impairment, and autism spectrum disorder. How VPA causes these developmental defects remains unknown. We used embryonic mice and human organoids to model key features of VPA drug exposure, including exencephaly, microcephaly, and spinal defects. In the malformed tissues, in which neurogenesis is defective, we find pronounced induction of cellular senescence in the neuroepithelial (NE) cells. Critically, through genetic and functional studies, we identified p19<sup>Arf</sup> as the instrumental mediator of senescence and microcephaly, but, surprisingly, not exencephaly and spinal defects. Together, these findings demonstrate that misregulated senescence in NE cells can contribute to developmental defects.

                Background: Angiosarcoma is a rare soft-tissue sarcoma that can arise in any soft-tissue structure or viscera. Only individual case reports and small series of gastrointestinal angiosarcoma have been reported in the literature. In this paper, we report the first African case of small intestine epithelioid angiosarcoma. Case report: Here, we present the case of a 66-year-old man who presented with melena and anemia. Physical examination showed the presence of two subcutaneous masses on the right and left flanks. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, duodenoscopy and jejunoscopy revealed multiple purpuric and hemorrhagic nodules and masses, some of which were bleeding. Pathological study of the ampullary formation and of a subcutaneous nodule concluded to the diagnosis of epithelioid angiosarcoma. Blood transfusions and interventional endoscopy by argan plasma coagulation were required due to a continued drop in hemoglobin. A drop in hemoglobin persisted and the patient died within 10 days. Conclusions: Angiosarcoma has a very poor prognosis due to delayed prognosis and insufficient therapeutic management. Interventional endoscopy to control bleeding can be considered in localized forms. Chemotherapy may help to prolong survival in metastatic and disseminated angiosarcoma. Further studies should be conducted to improve the prognosis.

                Background: More than four million people die each year in the month following surgery, and many more experience complications such as acute kidney injury. Some of these outcomes may be prevented through early identification of at-risk patients and through intraoperative risk mitigation. Telemedicine has revolutionized the way at-risk patients are identified in critical care, but intraoperative telemedicine services are not widely used in anesthesiology. Clinicians in telemedicine settings may assist with risk stratification and brainstorm risk mitigation strategies while clinicians in the operating room are busy performing other patient care tasks. Machine learning tools may help clinicians in telemedicine settings leverage the abundant electronic health data available in the perioperative period. The primary hypothesis for this study is that anesthesiology clinicians can predict postoperative complications more accurately with machine learning assistance than without machine learning assistance. Methods: This investigation is a sub-study nested within the TECTONICS randomized clinical trial (NCT03923699). As part of TECTONICS, study team members who are anesthesiology clinicians working in a telemedicine setting are currently reviewing ongoing surgical cases and documenting how likely they feel the patient is to experience 30-day in-hospital death or acute kidney injury. For patients who are included in this sub-study, these case reviews will be randomized to be performed with access to a display showing machine learning predictions for the postoperative complications or without access to the display. The accuracy of the predictions will be compared across these two groups. Conclusion: Successful completion of this study will help define the role of machine learning not only for intraoperative telemedicine, but for other risk assessment tasks before, during, and after surgery.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Lifestyle Affects Amyloid Burden and Cognition Differently in Men and Women</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Evidence on associations of lifestyle factors with Alzheimer's pathology and cognition are ambiguous, potentially because they rarely addressed inter-relationships of factors and sex effects. While considering these aspects, we examined the relationships of lifestyle factors with brain amyloid burden and cognition.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied 178 cognitively normal individuals (women, 49%; 65.0 [7.6] years) and 54 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (women, 35%; 71.3 [8.3] years) enrolled in a prospective study of volunteers who completed <sup>18</sup>F-Flutemetamol amyloid positron emission tomography. Using structural equation modeling, we examined associations between latent constructs representing metabolic/vascular risk, physical activity, and cognitive activity with global amyloid burden and cognitive performance. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of sex in this model.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Overall, higher cognitive activity was associated with better cognitive performance and higher physical activity was associated with lower amyloid burden. The latter association was weakened to a nonsignificant level after excluding multivariate outliers. Examination of the moderating effect of sex in the model revealed an inverse association of metabolic/vascular risk with cognition in men, whereas in women metabolic/vascular risk trended toward increased amyloid burden. Furthermore, a significant inverse association between physical activity and amyloid burden was found only in men. Inheritance of an APOE4 allele was associated with higher amyloid burden only in women.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Sex modifies effects of certain lifestyle-related factors on amyloid burden and cognition. Notably, our results suggest that the negative impact of metabolic/vascular risk influences the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease through distinct paths in women and men.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Open biopsy and drainage for breast abscess caused by cholesterol granuloma is beneficial rather than breast core biopsy [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Cholesterol granuloma is a rare non-infectious disease. Currently, there are no established guidelines, leaving the clinician to decide the best practice for each patient. A 43-year-old woman presented to the Surgery Clinic at Siloam General Hospital, Tangerang, Banten, Indonesia, with the primary complaint of a painful mass located in her left breast over the previous week before being admitted to the hospital. The mass was found abruptly and was accompanied by severe pain and fever. On inspection, peau d’orange, nipple retraction, tenderness, and warmth of the skin were observed. Ultrasonography suggested a malignant mass. The primary diagnosis was breast cancer, with a secondary differential diagnosis of breast abscess. An open biopsy was chosen because a breast abscess was the possible diagnosis. The biopsy results showed characteristics of cholesterol granuloma. Following the operation, the pain score was notably reduced as the operation showed a satisfactory result. The primary purpose of this case report was to illustrate a case of breast abscess caused by cholesterol granuloma, in which open excisional biopsy and drainage was superior for pain reduction and faster recovery.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An evaluation of the three measurable cardinal objectives of the National Youth Service Corps programme: a survey dataset [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The National Youth Service Corps programme is, among other targets, aimed at promoting national inclusiveness and tolerance in a culturally heterogeneous society. Despite the importance of this programme, little has been done to evaluate its degree of success. Where evaluations are done, they are never made public. There is a need for the NYSC programme, just like all other public programmes, to be evaluated for transparency, accountability and decision-making. From an evaluation of the three measurable objectives of the NYSC programme, this dataset bridges this gap. Methods: This dataset was collected from Nigerian graduates that completed their national service between 2012 and 2021. The data was collected through an electronic survey posted to various online platforms hosting National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members of the various sets and batches. The data collection aimed to evaluate the three cardinal objectives of the programme. After three years of data collection (from 2019 to 2021), responses were obtained from 19,278 participants that met the eligibility criteria. The data is an Excel (.xlsx) document with 19,278 cases and 95 variables. Descriptive statistics such as frequency counts and simple percentages were used to summarise the data. However, charts are further used to illustrate the demographic attributes of the respondents. The dataset is broad and covers all the 36 states in Nigeria plus the Federal Capital Territory. Results: The data set has many reuse potentials because it contains information on camp activities (such as parades, military drills, redeployment, quality of food, and facilities, among others), primary assignments and community service engagements of corps members. Conclusions: The data can offer a complete evaluation of how the (NYSC) has attained three of its four cardinal objectives. A series of relationships can further be determined and tested using inferential statistics among the variables included in the dataset.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Investigating audible and ultrasonic noise in modern animal facilities [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The environmental housing conditions of laboratory animals are important for both welfare and reliable, reproducible data. Guidelines currently exist for factors such as lighting cycles, temperature, humidity, and noise, however, for the latter the current guidelines may overlook important details. In the case of the most common laboratory species, the mouse, the range of frequencies they can hear is far higher than that of humans. The current guidelines briefly mention that ultrasonic (>20 kHz) frequencies can adversely affect mice, and that the acoustic environment should be checked, though no recommendations are provided relating to acceptable levels of ultrasonic noise. Methods: To investigate the ultrasonic environment in a large mouse breeding facility (the Mary Lyon Centre at MRC Harwell), we compared two systems, the Hottinger Bruel and Kjaer PULSE sound analyser, and an Avisoft Bioacoustics system. Potential noise sources were selected; we used the PULSE system to undertake real-time Fourier analysis of noise up to 100 kHz, and the Avisoft system to record noise up to 125 kHz for later analysis. The microphones from both systems were positioned consistently at the same distance from the source and environmental conditions were identical. In order to investigate our result further, a third system, the AudioMoth (Open Acoustic Devices), was also used for recording. We used DeepSqueak software for most of the recording analysis and, in some cases, we also undertook further spectral analysis using RX8 (iZotope, USA). Results: We found that both systems can detect a range of ultrasonic noise sources, and here discuss the benefits and limitations of each approach. Conclusions: We conclude that measuring the acoustic environment of animal facilities, including ultrasonic frequencies that may adversely affect the animals housed, will contribute to minimising disruption to animal welfare and perturbations in scientific research.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The central complex in the brain of insects provides a neural network for sensorimotor processing that is essential for spatial navigation and locomotion and plays a role in sleep control. Studies on the neurochemical architecture of the central complex have been performed especially in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melangoaster</i> and the desert locust, <i>Schistocerca gregaria</i>. In several insect species, myoinhibitory peptides (MIPs) are involved in circadian control and sleep-wake regulation. To identify neurons that might underlie these functions, we investigated the distribution of MIPs in the central complex of the locust. <i>In silico</i> transcript analysis suggests the presence of eight different MIPs in the desert locust. Through immunolabeling, we identified five systems of central-complex neurons that express MIP-like peptides. Two systems constitute columnar neurons of the protocerebral bridge and the lower division of the central body, while the other three systems are columnar neurons (two systems) and tangential neurons (one system) of the upper division of the central body. The innervation pattern and cell count of two systems of columnar neurons revealed the existence of 18 instead of 16 columns of the protocerebral bridge. Immunostaining of preparations containing intracellularly stained single cells allowed us to further specify subtypes of labeled columnar neurons. Double-label experiments showed that three systems of MIP-immunostained columnar neurons are also locustatachykinin-immunoreactive. No colocalization was found with serotonin immunostaining. The data provide novel insights into the architecture of the locust central complex and suggest that MIPs play a prominent role within the central-complex network.</p>

                Nausea is an unpleasant sensation of visceral malaise that remains poorly understood at a molecular and cellular level. Zhang et al. uncover brainstem inhibitory neurons that suppress nausea-related behaviors through selective blockade of nausea-promoting, GDF15 responsive-excitatory neurons. Nausea-suppressing neurons can be pharmacologically engaged by the gut hormone glucose insulinotropic peptide (GIP).

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Receptor editing constrains development of phosphatidyl choline-specific B cells in VH12-transgenic mice</a></h4>

              
                Worth et al. show that impairing receptor editing by dnRAG1 transgene expression in HC VH12 transgenic mice enforces BCR reactivity to phosphatidyl choline (PtC). Sequencing suggests that, after positive selection based on HC pairing and PtC binding, receptor editing further reduces PtC+ B cells. Likely RAG-independent type 2 gene replacements are also identified.

                Kiani Shabestari et al. show that genetic absence of microglia in Alzheimer’s disease mice causes a shift from parenchymal amyloid plaques to cerebral amyloid angiopathy, brain calcification and hemorrhages, and premature lethality. Adult microglial transplantation rescues these pathological changes, demonstrating that microglia protect the brain against detrimental Alzheimer’s disease co-pathologies.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">TRPV1 SUMOylation suppresses itch by inhibiting TRPV1 interaction with H1 receptors</a></h4>

              
                Using a multidisciplinary approach, Gao et al. define the mechanism of TRPV1 regulation of histaminergic itch. Histamine promotes a direct binding of H1R to TRPV1 via TRPV1 deSUMOylation, which enhances H1R-TRPV1 functional coupling in sensory neurons and itching behaviors. Disrupting the H1R-TRPV1 interaction with blocking peptides suppresses histaminergic itch in vivo.

                Hirano et al. show how the RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) NANOS2 and DND1 regulate target mRNA selection. They find that NANOS2 helps DND1 form a ternary complex on the target mRNAs and that NANOS2 recruits the CNOT complex to mRNAs to suppress their expression, suggesting that NANOS2 works as a second-layer RBP.
