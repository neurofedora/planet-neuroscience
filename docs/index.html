<p>Pretrained Transformer-based language models (LMs) display remarkable natural
language generation capabilities. With their immense potential, controlling
text generation of such LMs is getting attention. While there are studies that
seek to control high-level attributes (such as sentiment and topic) of
generated text, there is still a lack of more precise control over its content
at the word- and phrase-level. Here, we propose Content-Conditioner (CoCon) to
control an LM's output text with a target content, at a fine-grained level. In
our self-supervised approach, the CoCon block learns to help the LM complete a
partially-observed text sequence by conditioning with content inputs that are
withheld from the LM. Through experiments, we show that CoCon can naturally
incorporate target content into generated texts and control high-level text
attributes in a zero-shot manner.

<p>It was recently observed that the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ genetic algorithm
can comparably easily escape the local optimum of the jump functions benchmark.
Consequently, this algorithm can optimize the jump function with jump size $k$
in an expected runtime of only $n^{(k + 1)/2}k^{-k/2}e^{O(k)}$ fitness
evaluations (Antipov, Doerr, Karavaev (GECCO 2020)). To obtain this
performance, however, a non-standard parameter setting depending on the jump
size $k$ was used.
</p>
<p>To overcome this difficulty, we propose to choose two parameters of the
$(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ genetic algorithm randomly from a power-law
distribution. Via a mathematical runtime analysis, we show that this algorithm
with natural instance-independent choices of the distribution parameters on all
jump functions with jump size at most $n/4$ has a performance close to what the
best instance-specific parameters in the previous work obtained. This price for
instance-independence can be made as small as an $O(n\log(n))$ factor. Given
the difficulty of the jump problem and the runtime losses from using mildly
suboptimal fixed parameters (also discussed in this work), this appears to be a
fair price.

<p>This paper proposes that the thalamus is the site of a wave excitation, whose
function is to represent the locations of things around the animal. Neurons
couple to the wave as transmitters and receivers. The wave acts as an analogue
representation of local space. This has benefits over a purely neural
representation of space. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis;
both theoretical, concerning efficient Bayesian inference in the brain, and
empirical, concerning the neuro-anatomy of the thalamus. Across all species,
the most basic function of the brain is to coordinate movements in space. To
represent positions in space only by neural firing rates would be complex and
inefficient. It is possible that that the brain represents 3D space in a direct
and natural way, by a 3D wave

<p>Markovian tasks can be characterised by a state space and a transition
matrix. In mammals, the firing of populations of place or grid cells in the
hippocampal formation are thought to represent the probability distribution
over state space. Grid firing patterns are suggested to be eigenvectors of a
transition matrix reflecting diffusion across states, allowing simple
prediction of future state distributions, by replacing matrix multiplication
with elementwise multiplication by eigenvalues. Here we extend this analysis to
any translation-invariant directed transition structure (displacement and
diffusion), showing that a single set of eigenvectors supports prediction via
displacement-specific eigenvalues. This unifies the prediction framework with
traditional models of grid cells firing driven by self-motion to perform path
integration. We show that the complex eigenstructure of directed transitions
corresponds to the Discrete Fourier Transform, the eigenvalues encode
displacement via the Fourier Shift Theorem, and the Fourier components are
analogous to "velocity-controlled oscillators" in oscillatory interference
models. The resulting model supports computationally efficient prediction with
directed transitions in spatial and non-spatial tasks and provides an
explanation for theta phase precession and path integration in grid cell
firing. We also discuss the efficient generalisation of our approach to deal
with local changes in transition structure and its contribution to behavioural
policy via a "sense of direction" corresponding to prediction of the effects of
fixed ratios of actions.

<p>The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is one of the best-known
combinatorial optimisation problems. However, many real-world problems are
composed of several interacting components. The Traveling Thief Problem (TTP)
addresses such interactions by combining two combinatorial optimisation
problems, namely the TSP and the Knapsack Problem (KP). Recently, a new problem
called the node weight dependent Traveling Salesperson Problem (W-TSP) has been
introduced where nodes have weights that influence the cost of the tour. In
this paper, we compare W-TSP and TTP. We investigate the structure of the
optimised tours for W-TSP and TTP and the impact of using each others fitness
function. Our experimental results suggest (1) that the W-TSP often can be
solved better using the TTP fitness function and (2) final W-TSP and TTP
solutions show different distributions when compared with optimal TSP or
weighted greedy solutions.

<p>The use of black-box optimization for the design of new biological sequences
is an emerging research area with potentially revolutionary impact. The cost
and latency of wet-lab experiments requires methods that find good sequences in
few experimental rounds of large batches of sequences--a setting that
off-the-shelf black-box optimization methods are ill-equipped to handle. We
find that the performance of existing methods varies drastically across
optimization tasks, posing a significant obstacle to real-world applications.
To improve robustness, we propose Population-Based Black-Box Optimization
(P3BO), which generates batches of sequences by sampling from an ensemble of
methods. The number of sequences sampled from any method is proportional to the
quality of sequences it previously proposed, allowing P3BO to combine the
strengths of individual methods while hedging against their innate brittleness.
Adapting the hyper-parameters of each of the methods online using evolutionary
optimization further improves performance. Through extensive experiments on
in-silico optimization tasks, we show that P3BO outperforms any single method
in its population, proposing higher quality sequences as well as more diverse
batches. As such, P3BO and Adaptive-P3BO are a crucial step towards deploying
ML to real-world sequence design.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03226">Brain-inspired global-local hybrid learning towards human-like intelligence. (arXiv:2006.03226v1 [cs.NE])</a></h4>

<p>The combination of neuroscience-oriented and computer-science-oriented
approaches is the most promising method to develop artificial general
intelligence (AGI) that can learn general tasks similar to humans. Currently,
two main routes of learning exist, including neuroscience-inspired methods,
represented by local synaptic plasticity, and machine-learning methods,
represented by backpropagation. Both have advantages and complement each other,
but neither can solve all learning problems well. Integrating these two methods
into one network may provide better learning abilities for general tasks. Here,
we report a hybrid spiking neural network model that integrates the two
approaches by introducing a meta-local module and a two-phase causality
modelling method. The model can not only optimize local plasticity rules, but
also receive top-down supervision information. In addition to flexibly
supporting multiple spike-based coding schemes, we demonstrate that this model
facilitates learning of many general tasks, including fault-tolerance learning,
few-shot learning and multiple-task learning, and show its efficiency on the
Tianjic neuromorphic platform. This work provides a new route for
brain-inspired computing and facilitates AGI development.

<p>Recent studies have shown that the choice of activation function can
significantly affect the performance of deep learning networks. However, the
benefits of novel activation functions have been inconsistent and
task-dependent, and therefore the rectified linear unit (ReLU) is still the
most commonly used. This paper proposes a technique for customizing activation
functions automatically, resulting in reliable improvements in performance.
Evolutionary search is used to discover the general form of the function, and
gradient descent to optimize its parameters for different parts of the network
and over the learning process. Experiments with three different neural network
architectures on the CIFAR-100 image classification dataset show that this
approach is effective. It discovers different activation functions for
different architectures, and consistently improves accuracy over ReLU and other
recently proposed activation functions by significant margins. The approach can
therefore be used as an automated optimization step in applying deep learning
to new tasks.

<p>A paper in the recent Artificial Life journal special issue on open-ended
evolution (OEE) presents a simple evolving computational system that, it is
claimed, satisfies all proposed requirements for OEE (Hintze, 2019). Analysis
and discussion of the system are used to support the further claims that
complexity and diversity are the crucial features of open-endedness, and that
we should concentrate on providing proper definitions for those terms rather
than engaging in "the quest for open-endedness for the sake of open-endedness"
(Hintze, 2019, p. 205). While I wholeheartedly support the pursuit of precise
definitions of complexity and diversity in relation to OEE research, I
emphatically reject the suggestion that OEE is not a worthy research topic in
its own right. In the same issue of the journal, I presented a "high-level
conceptual framework to help orient the discussion and implementation of
open-endedness in evolutionary systems" (Taylor, 2019). In the current brief
contribution I apply my framework to Hinzte's model to understand its
limitations. In so doing, I demonstrate the importance of studying

<p>In the current research of neural networks, the activation function is
manually specified by human and not able to change themselves during training.
This paper focus on how to make the activation function trainable for deep
neural networks. We use series and linear combination of different activation
functions make activation functions continuously variable. Also, we test the
performance of CNNs with Fourier series simulated activation(Fourier-CNN) and
CNNs with linear combined activation function (LC-CNN) on Cifar-10 dataset. The
result shows our trainable activation function reveals better performance than
the most used ReLU activation function. Finally, we improves the performance of
Fourier-CNN with Autoencoder, and test the performance of PSO algorithm in
optimizing the parameters of networks

<p>Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms, and MAP-Elites (ME) in particular, have
proven very useful for a broad range of applications including enabling real
robots to recover quickly from joint damage, solving strongly deceptive maze
tasks or evolving robot morphologies to discover new gaits. However, present
implementations of MAP-Elites and other QD algorithms seem to be limited to
low-dimensional controllers with far fewer parameters than modern deep neural
network models. In this paper, we propose to leverage the efficiency of
Evolution Strategies (ES) to scale MAP-Elites to high-dimensional controllers
parameterized by large neural networks. We design and evaluate a new hybrid
algorithm called MAP-Elites with Evolution Strategies (ME-ES) for post-damage
recovery in a difficult high-dimensional control task where traditional ME
fails. Additionally, we show that ME-ES performs efficient exploration, on par
with state-of-the-art exploration algorithms in high-dimensional control tasks
with strongly deceptive rewards.

<p>We propose new machine learning schemes for solving high dimensional
nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Relying on the classical
backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) representation of PDEs, our
algorithms estimate simultaneously the solution and its gradient by deep neural
networks. These approximations are performed at each time step from the
minimization of loss functions defined recursively by backward induction. The
methodology is extended to variational inequalities arising in optimal stopping
problems. We analyze the convergence of the deep learning schemes and provide
error estimates in terms of the universal approximation of neural networks.
Numerical results show that our algorithms give very good results till
dimension 50 (and certainly above), for both PDEs and variational inequalities
problems. For the PDEs resolution, our results are very similar to those
obtained by the recent method in \cite{weinan2017deep} when the latter
converges to the right solution or does not diverge. Numerical tests indicate
that the proposed methods are not stuck in poor local minimaas it can be the
case with the algorithm designed in \cite{weinan2017deep}, and no divergence is
experienced. The only limitation seems to be due to the inability of the
considered deep neural networks to represent a solution with a too complex
structure in high dimension.

<p>Dysregulated expression of several <i>OPRM1 </i> splice variant mRNAs in the medial prefrontal cortex of male human heroin abusers was recaptured in heroin self‐administering male rats, suggesting potential roles of the <i>OPRM1 </i> splice variants in heroin addiction that could be mechanistically explored using the rat heroin self‐administration model.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Heroin, a mu agonist, acts through the mu opioid receptor. The mu opioid receptor gene, <i>OPRM1, </i> undergoes extensive alternative splicing, creating an array of splice variants that are conserved from rodent to humans. Increasing evidence suggests that these <i>OPRM1 </i> splice variants are pharmacologically important in mediating various actions of mu opioids, including analgesia, tolerance, physical dependence, rewarding behavior, as well as addiction. In the present study, we examine expression of the <i>OPRM1 </i> splice variant mRNAs in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), one of the major brain regions involved in decision‐making and drug‐seeking behaviors, of male human heroin abusers and male rats that developed stable heroin‐seeking behavior using an intravenous heroin self‐administration (SA) model. The results show similar expression profiles among multiple <i>OPRM1 </i> splice variants in both human control subjects and saline control rats, illustrating conservation of <i>OPRM1 </i> alternative splicing from rodent to humans. Moreover, the expressions of several <i>OPRM1 </i> splice variant mRNAs were dysregulated in the postmortem mPFCs from heroin abusers compared to the control subjects. Similar patterns were observed in the rat heroin SA model. These findings suggest potential roles of the <i>OPRM1 </i> splice variants in heroin addiction that could be mechanistically explored using the rat heroin SA model.</p>

<p>We examined the effects of zonisamide on transplanted human dopaminergic neurons in the rat striatum and found that zonisamide facilitates the survival of dopamine neurons, an effect that may be related to an increase in the expression of SLIT‐and NTRK‐like protein 6 in rat striatum.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The transplantation of dopaminergic (DA) progenitors derived from pluripotent stem cells improves the behavior of Parkinson's disease model animals. However, the survival of DA progenitors is low, and the final yield of DA neurons is only approximately 0.3%–2% the number of transplanted cells. Zonisamide (ZNS) increases the number of survived DA neurons upon the transplantation of mouse‐induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell‐derived DA progenitors in the rat striatum. In this study, we induced DA progenitors from human iPS cells and transplanted them into the striatum of female rats with daily administration of ZNS. The number of survived DA neurons was evaluated 1 and 4 months after transplantation by immunohistochemistry, which revealed that the number of survived DA neurons was significantly increased with the administration of ZNS. To assess the mechanism of action of ZNS, we performed a gene expression analysis to compare the gene expression profiles in striatum treated with or without ZNS. The analysis revealed that the expression of SLIT‐and NTRK‐like protein 6 (SLITRK6) was upregulated in rat striatum treated with ZNS. In conclusion, ZNS promotes the survival of DA neurons after the transplantation of human‐iPS cell‐derived DA progenitors in the rat striatum. SLITRK6 is suggested to be involved in this supportive effect of ZNS by modulating the environment of the host brain.</p>

<p>In less than 6 months, the severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus type 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has spread worldwide infecting nearly 6 million people and killing over 350,000. Initially thought to be restricted to the respiratory system, we now understand that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) also involves multiple other organs including the central and peripheral nervous system. The number of recognized neurologic manifestations of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is rapidly accumulating. These may result from a variety of mechanisms including virus‐induced hyper‐inflammatory and hypercoagulable states, direct virus infection of the CNS, and post‐infectious immune mediated processes. Example of COVID‐19 CNS disease include encephalopathy, encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, meningitis, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, venous sinus thrombosis and endothelialitis. In the peripheral nervous system COVID‐19 is associated with dysfunction of smell and taste, muscle injury, the Guillain‐Barre syndrome and its variants. Due to its worldwide distribution and multifactorial pathogenic mechanisms, COVID‐19 poses a global threat to the entire nervous system. While our understanding of SARS‐CoV‐2 neuropathogenesis is still incomplete and our knowledge is evolving rapidly, we hope that this review will provide a useful framework and help neurologists in understanding the many neurologic facets of COVID‐19.</p>

<p>The identification of progression in multiple sclerosis is typically retrospective. Given the profound burden of progressive multiple sclerosis, and the recent development of effective treatments for these patients, there is a need to establish measures capable of identifying progressive multiple sclerosis early in the disease course. Starting from recent pathological findings, this review assesses the state‐of‐the‐art of potential measures able to predict progressive multiple sclerosis. Future promising biomarkers, that might shed light on mechanisms of progression are also discussed. Finally, expansion of the concept of progressive multiple sclerosis, by including an assessment of cognition, patient‐reported outcomes and comorbidities, is considered.</p>

The cochlea encodes sound intensities ranging over six orders of magnitude which is collectively achieved by functionally diverse spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). However, the mechanisms enabling the SGNs to cover specific fractions of the audible intensity range remain elusive. Here we tested the hypothesis that intensity information, fully contained in the receptor potential of the presynaptic inner hair cell (IHC), is fractionated via heterogeneous synapses. We studied the transfer function of individual active zones (AZs) using dual-color Rhod-FF and iGluSnFR imaging of Ca2+ and glutamate release. AZs differed in the voltage dependence of release: AZs residing at the IHCs' pillar (abneural) side activate at more hyperpolarized potentials and typically showed tight control of release by few Ca2+-channels. We conclude that heterogeneity of voltage dependence and release-site coupling of Ca2+-channels among the AZs varies synaptic transfer within individual IHCs and, thereby, likely contributes to the functional diversity of SGNs.

Rationale: Addiction to methamphetamine (MA) is a public health issue in the United States. While psychostimulant use disorders are heritable, their genetic basis remains poorly understood. We previously identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1 (Hnrnph1; H1) as a quantitative trait gene underlying sensitivity to MA-induced locomotor activity. Mice heterozygous for a frameshift deletion in the first coding exon of H1 (H1+/-) showed reduced MA-induced locomotor activity, dopamine release, and dose-dependent differences in MA conditioned place preference. However, the effects of H1+/- on innate and MA-modulated reward sensitivity are not known. Objectives: We examined innate reward sensitivity and modulation by MA in H1+/- mice via intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS). Methods: We used intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) of the medial forebrain bundle to assess shifts in reward sensitivity following acute, ascending doses of MA (0.5-4.0 mg/kg, i.p.) at 10 min or 2 h post-MA. We also assessed video-recorded behaviors during ICSS testing sessions. Results: Ten min post-MA, H1+/- mice displayed reduced maximum response rates, H1+/- females had lower M50 values than wild-type females, and H1+/- influenced ICSS responding relative to maximum control rates (MCR). Two h post-MA, higher response rates were observed in females, irrespective of genotype. There was a dose-dependent reduction in distance to the response wheel 10 min post-MA and reduced immobility time in the perimeter corners both 10 min and 2 h post-MA. Conclusions: H1+/- mice displayed altered MA-induced reward modulation in a time-, sex-, and dose-dependent manner. This expands the set of MA-induced phenotypes observed in H1+/- mice.

Speech processing relies on interactions between auditory and motor systems and is asymmetrically organized in the human brain. The left auditory system is specialized for processing of phonemes, whereas the right is specialized for processing of pitch changes in speech that affect prosody. In speakers of tonal languages, however, processing of pitch (i.e., tone) changes that alter word meaning is left-lateralized. This indicates that linguistic function and language experience shape auditory speech processing asymmetries; their effect on auditory-motor speech processing remains unknown, however. Here, we investigated the asymmetry of motor contributions to auditory speech processing in speakers of tonal and non-tonal languages. We temporarily disrupted the left or right speech motor cortex using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and measured the impact of these disruptions on auditory processing of phoneme and tone changes in sequences of syllables using electroencephalography (EEG). We found that disruption of the speech motor cortex in the left, but not the right hemisphere, impaired processing of phoneme changes in both language groups equally. In contrast, the effect of motor disruptions on processing of tone changes differed in tonal and non-tonal language groups: disruption of the left speech motor cortex significantly impaired processing of tone changes in tonal language speakers, whereas disruption of the right speech motor cortex modulated processing of tone changes in non-tonal speakers. We conclude that the contribution of the left and right speech motor cortex to auditory speech processing is determined by the functional role of the acoustic cues in the listener's native language.

Cerebellar involvement in Alzheimers disease (AD) has not been studied to the extent that cortical neuropathological changes have. Historical and recent histopathological literature demonstrate cerebellar AD pathology while functional investigation has demonstrated disrupted intrinsic cortical-cerebellar connectivity in AD. Additionally, olfactory deficits occur early in AD, prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. The neurological basis for the involvement of the cerebellum and olfactory system in the disease course remain unclear. 18F-fludeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) data from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were analyzed to characterize metabolism in the cerebellum and olfactory region of AD, mild-cognitive impaired (MCI), and age-matched cognitively normal (CN) controls. In contrast to known parietal and temporal lobe FDG hypo-metabolism within the default mode network in AD, a significant FDG hyper-metabolism was found in the cerebellum and olfactory cortical regions (including the piriform cortex, olfactory tubercle, anterior olfactory nucleus, and nucleus accumbens shell). The increase in cerebellum glucose utilization was shown also in late- verses early-MCI patients. The cerebellar and olfactory regions both contain inhibitory distal and inter-neuronal connections that are vulnerable to disruption in AD. The hyper-metabolism in the cerebellum and olfactory structures may reflect disruption of local and system-wide inhibitory networks due to AD neurodegeneration, suggesting a hypothetical mechanism for susceptibility of the olfactory system to early AD pathology.

Impulsivity is a key trait in the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) and substance use disorder (SUD). MDD is a chronic illness characterized by sadness, insomnia, and loss of interest. SUD is a chronic and relapsing disorder characterized by the consumption of drugs despite their negative consequences. Among drugs of abuse, cocaine is the most consumed psychostimulant. Animal studies demonstrated that increased impulsivity predicts predisposition to acquire cocaine self-administration (SA) behaviour with an increased cocaine-intake. Moreover, early-life stress represents a vulnerability factor to develop depressive disorders and drug addiction. Maternal separation with early weaning (MSEW) is an animal model that allows examining the impact of early-life stress on cocaine abuse. In this study, we aimed to explore changes in MSEW-induced impulsivity to determine potential associations between depression-like and cocaine-seeking behaviours in male and female mice. We also evaluated possible alterations in the AMPA receptors (AMPArs) composition and glutamatergic neurotransmission. We exposed mice to MSEW and the behavioural tests were performed during adulthood. Moreover, GluA1, GluA2 mRNA and protein expression were evaluated in the medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC). Results showed higher impulsive cocaine-seeking in females, independently the MSEW, as well as an increase in GluA1 and GluA2 protein expression. Moreover, MSEW induced downregulation of Gria2 and increased the GluA1/GluA2 ratio, only in male mice. In conclusion, female mice expressed higher mPFC glutamatergic function, which potentiated their impulsivity during cocaine SA. Also, data indicated that MSEW alters glutamatergic function in mPFC of male mice, increasing the glutamatergic excitability.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.05.136598v1?rss=1">Pain sensitivity does not differ between obese and healthy weight individuals</a></h4>

There is emerging evidence suggesting a relationship between obesity and chronic pain. We investigated whether pain-free obese individuals display altered pain responses to acute noxious stimuli, thus raising the possibility of greater pain sensitivity and potential susceptibility for chronic pain development. Psychophysical and anthropometric data were collected from 39 individuals with an obese body mass index (BMI) classification (BMI [≥] 30) and 40 age/sex-matched individuals of a healthy BMI (BMI&lt;24.9). Since BMI may be an inaccurate index of obesity, additional anthropometric parameters of central adiposity, and percent body fat (BF%) were examined. Pain responses to supra-threshold noxious heat and cold stimuli were examined. Subjects provided pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings to noxious heat (49{degrees}C) applied at varying durations (5s, 12s, 30s) and locations (ventral forearm/lower leg). Cold pain ratings, thresholds, and tolerances were obtained following immersion of the hand in a cold-water bath (0-2{degrees}C). Between-group differences in pain responses, as well as relationships between pain responses and obesity parameters were examined. Importantly, confounds that may influence pain such as anxiety, depression, impulsivity, sleepiness, and quality of life were assessed. No between-group differences in pain sensitivity to noxious heat and cold stimuli were found. After controlling for sex, no relationships were found between BMI, central adiposity, or BF% and pain responses to noxious heat or cold stimuli. These results indicate that obesity, BF%, and central adiposity have little influence on pain sensitivity in obese individuals. Accordingly, it is unlikely that obesity alone increases susceptibility for chronic pain development via amplification of nociceptive processes.

Mitochondrial health plays a crucial role in human brain development and diseases. However, the evaluation of mitochondrial health in the brain is not incorporated into clinical practice due to ethical and logistical concerns. As a result, the development of targeted mitochondrial therapeutics remains a significant challenge due to the lack of appropriate patient-derived brain tissues. To address these unmet needs, we developed cerebral organoids (COs) from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and monitored mitochondrial health from the primary, reprogrammed and differentiated stages. Our results show preserved mitochondrial genetics, function and treatment responses across PBMCs to iPSCs to COs, and measurable neuronal activity in the COs. We expect our approach will serve as a model for more widespread evaluation of mitochondrial health relevant to a wide range of human diseases using readily accessible patient peripheral (PBMCs) and stem-cell derived brain tissue samples.

Treatments of neurodegenerative diseases require biologic drugs to be actively transported across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To answer outstanding questions regarding transport mechanisms, we determined how and where transcytosis occurs at the BBB. Using two-photon microscopy, we characterized the transport of therapeutic nanoparticles at all steps of delivery to the brain at the nanoscale resolution in vivo. Transferrin receptor-targeted nanoparticles were taken up by endothelium at capillaries and venules, but not at arterioles. The nanoparticles moved unobstructed within endothelial cells, but transcytosis across the BBB occurred only at post-capillary venules, where endothelial and glial basement membranes form a perivascular space that can accommodate biologics. In comparison, transcytosis was absent in capillaries with closely apposed basement membranes. Thus, post-capillary venules, not capillaries, provide an entry point for the transport of large molecules across the BBB, and targeting therapeutic agents to this locus may be an effective way for treating brain disorders.

The role of the cerebellum in speech perception remains a mystery. Given its uniform architecture, we tested the hypothesis that it implements a domain-general predictive mechanism whose role in speech processing is determined by connectivity. We used standard and coactivation neuroimaging meta-analyses of speech perception studies without motor responses, with (n = 72) or without (n = 92) cerebellum activity. We compared these to speech production studies (n = 175). Results show multiple, distinct regions of perception- and production-related activity throughout the cerebellum with some overlap. Each task had distinct patterns of cortico-cerebellar connectivity. Perception regions/connections were associated with task-related terms mined from thousands of neuroimaging studies that were neither speech nor domain-specific but were prediction related. Finally, when the cerebellum was active, there was less cortical activity compared to when it was inactive, a marker of predictive processing. Results suggest that the cerebellum implements a domain-general mechanism related to prediction during passive speech perception.

In the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau pathology first develops in the entorhinal cortex (EC), then spreads to the hippocampus and at later stages, to the neocortex. Pathology in the neocortex correlates with impaired cognitive performance. Overall, tau pathology correlates well with neurodegeneration but the spatial and temporal association between tau pathology and overt volume loss is unclear. Using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with tensor-based morphometry (TBM) we mapped the spatio-temporal pattern of structural changes in a mouse model of AD-like progressive tauopathy. A novel, co-registered in vivo MRI atlas identified particular regions in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) that had significant volume reduction. The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and pre-/para-subiculum (PPS) had the most significant atrophy at the early stage, but atrophy then spread into the hippocampus, most notably, the CA1, dentate gyrus (DG) and subiculum (Sub). TBM-related atrophy in the DG and Sub preceded overt cell loss that has been reported in ex vivo studies in the same mouse model. By unifying an ex vivo 3D reconstruction of tau pathology with the TBM-MRI results we mapped the progression of atrophy in the MTL with the corresponding spread of tau pathology. Our study shows that there is an association between the spread of tau pathology and TBM-related atrophy from the EC to the hippocampus, but atrophy in the DG and Sub preceded overt cell loss.

While it is widely accepted that motor sequence learning (MSL) is supported by a prefrontal-mediated interaction between hippocampal and striatal networks, it remains unknown whether the functional responses of these networks can be modulated in humans with targeted experimental interventions. The present proof-of-concept study employed a comprehensive multimodal neuroimaging approach, including functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR spectroscopy, to investigate whether individually-tailored theta-burst stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex can modulate responses in the hippocampus and striatum during motor learning. Our results indicate that stimulation influenced task-related connectivity patterns within hippocampo-frontal and striatal networks. Stimulation also altered the relationship between the levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the stimulated prefrontal cortex and learning-related changes in both activity and connectivity in fronto-striato-hippocampal networks. This study provides the first experimental evidence that brain stimulation can alter motor learning-related functional responses in the striatum and hippocampus.

Background: The maintenance of items in working memory (WM) relies on a widespread network of brain areas where synchronization between electrophysiological recordings may reflect functional coupling. Methods: A patient performed a WM task where a string of letters was presented all at once, thus separating the encoding period from the maintenance period. We recorded sEEG from the hippocampus, temporo-parietal ECoG from a 64-contact grid electrode, and scalp EEG. Results: Power spectral density (PSD) showed a clear task dependence: PSD in the posterior parietal lobe (10 Hz) and in the hippocampus (20 Hz) peaked towards the end of the maintenance period. Inter-area synchronization was characterized by the phase locking value (PLV). WM maintenance enhanced PLV between hippocampal sEEG and scalp EEG specifically in the theta range [6 7] Hz. PLV from hippocampus to parietal cortex increased during maintenance in the [9 10] Hz alpha and the 20 Hz range. When analyzing the information flow to and from auditory cortex by Granger causality, the flow was from auditory cortex to hippocampus with a peak in the [8 18] Hz range while letters were presented, and this flow was subsequently reversed during maintenance, while letters were maintained in memory. Conclusions: The increased functional interaction between hippocampus and cortex through synchronized oscillatory activity and the directed information flow provide physiological basis for reverberation of memory items during maintenance. This points to a network for working memory that is bound by coherent oscillations involving cortical areas and hippocampus.

Entrainment of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) circadian clock in the brain to environmental light cycles is a form of neural plasticity which involves acute daily clock resetting, and long-term changes in endogenous clock period. Elucidating mechanisms of entrainment is critical for understanding how circadian clocks maintain alignment of internal rhythms with the external environment. However, studying how the SCN clock per se behaves throughout entrainment at the molecular level remains technically challenging. Here we report a novel experimental system that precisely employs periodic optogenetic stimulation to drive circadian entrainment of multiple SCN brain slices while recording circadian rhythms in molecular output with bioluminescence. Using this system, we demonstrate entrainment of the SCN clock ex vivo and show that many forms of circadian clock plasticity in behavior is intrinsic to the SCN molecular clock plasticity induced through encoding different light cycle periods and seasonal variations in the day length.

Mind wandering (MW) is a subjective, cognitive phenomenon, in which thoughts move away from the task towards an internal train of thoughts, possibly during phases of neuronal sleep-like activity (local sleep, LS). MW decreases cortical processing of external stimuli and is assumed to decouple attention from the external world. Here, we directly tested how indicators of LS, cortical processing and attentional selection change in a pop-out visual search task during phases of MW. Participants brain activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography, MW was assessed via self-report using randomly interspersed probes. As expected, MW worsened performance being accompanied by a decrease in high frequency activity (HFA, 80-150Hz) and an increase in slow wave activity (SWA, 1-6Hz), consistent with the occurrence of LS. In contrast, visual attentional selection as indexed by the N2pc component was enhanced during MW with the N2pc amplitude being directly linked to participants performance. This observation clearly contradicts accounts of attentional decoupling predicting a decrease in attention-related responses to external stimuli during MW. Together our results suggest that MW occurs during phases of LS with processes of attentional target selection being upregulated, potentially to compensate for the mental distraction during MW.

More than 50 genetic loci have been identified as being associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and many of these are involved in immune pathways and lipid metabolism. Therefore, we performed a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) of immune-relevant cells, to study the mis-regulation of genes implicated in AD. We used expression and genetic data from naive and induced CD14+ monocytes and two GWAS of AD to study genetically controlled gene expression in monocytes at different stages of differentiation and compared the results with those from TWAS of brain and blood. We identified nine genes with statistically independent TWAS signals, seven are known AD risk genes from GWAS: BIN1, PTK2B, SPI1, MS4A4A, MS4A6E, APOE and PVR and two, LACTB2 and PLIN2/ADRP, are novel candidate genes for AD. Three genes, SPI1, PLIN2 and LACTB2, are TWAS significant specifically in monocytes. LACTB2 is a mitochondrial endoribonuclease and PLIN2/ADRP associates with intracellular neutral lipid storage droplets (LSDs) which have been shown to play a role in the regulation of the of immune response.

Neurons communicate by the activity-dependent release of small-molecule neurotransmitters packaged into synaptic vesicles (SVs). Although many molecules have been identified as neurotransmitters, technical limitations have precluded a full metabolomic analysis of synaptic vesicle content. Here, we present a workflow to rapidly isolate SVs and to interrogate their metabolic contents at a high-resolution using mass spectrometry. We validated the enrichment of glutamate in SVs of primary cortical neurons using targeted polar metabolomics. Unbiased and extensive global profiling of SVs isolated from these neurons revealed that the only detectable polar metabolites they contain are the established neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA. Finally, we adapted the approach to enable quick capture of SVs directly from brain tissue and determined the neurotransmitter profiles of diverse brain regions in a cell-type specific manner. The speed, robustness, and precision of this method to interrogate SV contents will facilitate novel insights into the chemical basis of neurotransmission.

General anesthesia is characterized by reversible loss of consciousness accompanied by transient amnesia. Yet, long-term memory impairment is an undesirable side-effect. How different types of general anesthetics (GAs) affect the hippocampus, a brain region central to memory formation and consolidation, is poorly understood. Using extracellular recordings, chronic 2-photon imaging and behavioral analysis, we monitor the effects of isoflurane (Iso), medetomidine/midazolam/fentanyl (MMF), and ketamine/xylazine (Keta/Xyl) on network activity and structural spine dynamics in the hippocampal CA1 area of adult mice. GAs robustly reduced spiking activity, decorrelated cellular ensembles, albeit with distinct activity signatures, and altered spine dynamics. Iso anesthesia most closely resembled wakefulness, and network alterations recovered more readily than with Keta/Xyl and MMF. Correspondingly, memory consolidation was impaired after exposure to Keta/Xyl and MMF, but not Iso. Thus, different anesthetics distinctly alter hippocampal network dynamics, synaptic connectivity, and memory consolidation, with implications for GA strategy appraisal in animal research and clinical settings.

Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion is associated with vascular dementia (VaD). Cerebral hypoperfusion may initiate complex molecular and cellular inflammatory pathways that contribute to long term cognitive impairment and memory loss. Here we used a bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) mouse model of VaD to investigate its effect on the innate immune response particularly the inflammasome signaling pathway. Comprehensive analyses revealed that chronic cerebral hypoperfusion induces a complex temporal expression and activation of inflammasome components and their products (IL1b and IL18) in different brain regions, and promotes activation of apoptotic and pyroptotic cell death pathways. Glial cell activation, white matter lesion formation and hippocampal neuronal loss also occurred in a spatiotemporal manner. Moreover, in AIM2 knockout mice we observed attenuated inflammasome-mediated production of proinflammatory cytokines, apoptosis and pyroptosis, as well as resistance to chronic microglial activation, myelin breakdown, hippocampal neuronal loss, and behavioural and cognitive deficits following BCAS. Hence, we have demonstrated that activation of the AIM2 inflammasome substantially contributes to the pathophysiology of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion-induced brain injury and may therefore represent a promising therapeutic target for attenuating cognitive impairment in VaD.

Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the commonest type of focal epilepsy in adult humans. In refractory TLE, patients are indicated for unilateral resection of the affected hippocampus (hippocampectomy), which generally does not cause any cognitive impairment. Once adult hippocampus is a region of endogenous neurogenesis, we have hypothesized that a compensatory increase in hippocampal neurogenesis might occur in the remaining hippocampus after unilateral hippocampectomy. To test this hypothesis, we performed unilateral hippocampectomy in adult Wistar rats (n=12). Sham animals were not hippocampectomized (n=6). Animals were deeply anesthetized and adjacent cortex and hippocampus of the left hemisphere were completely removed. They were perfused at 15 (G15, n=6) or 30 (G30, n=6) days post-surgery. Behavioral tests were performed to address possible cognitive impairments. We did not find any cognitive impairment in the hippocampectomized animals. Histopathology was performed using thionine staining and mature neurons and migratory neuroblasts were immunolabeled using anti-NeuN and anti-doublecortin (DCX) antibodies, respectively. The remaining hippocampus presented higher numbers of DCX positive cells compared to control (p&lt;0.001) at both G15 and G30. The results suggest increased compensatory adult neurogenesis following experimental unilateral hippocampectomy in adult rats, which may contribute to absence of cognitive impairments.

Fluorescence imaging over large areas of the brain in freely behaving animals would allow researchers to better understand the relationship between brain activity and behavior; however, traditional microscopes capable of high spatial resolution and large fields of view (FOVs) require large and heavy lenses that restrict animal movement. While lensless imaging has the potential to achieve both high spatial resolution and large FOV with a thin lightweight device, lensless imaging has yet to be achieved in vivo due to two principal challenges: (a) biological tissue typically has lower contrast than resolution targets, and (b) illumination and filtering must be integrated into this non-traditional device architecture. Here, we show that in vivo fluorescence imaging is possible with a thin lensless microscope by optimizing the phase mask and computational reconstruction algorithms, and integrating fiber optic illumination and thin-film color filters. This technology is an important step towards high-resolution, large-FOV fluorescence imaging in freely behaving animals.

<p>by Yu Hu, Kai Wang, Mingyao Li</p>

The emergence of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technology has made it possible to measure gene expression variations at cellular level. This breakthrough enables the investigation of a wider range of problems including analysis of splicing heterogeneity among individual cells. However, compared to bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq data are much noisier due to high technical variability and low sequencing depth. Here we propose SCATS (Single-Cell Analysis of Transcript Splicing) for differential splicing analysis in scRNA-seq, which achieves high sensitivity at low coverage by accounting for technical noise. SCATS models scRNA-seq data either with or without Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs). For non-UMI data, SCATS explicitly models technical noise by accounting for capture efficiency and amplification bias through the use of external spike-ins; for UMI data, SCATS models capture efficiency and further accounts for transcriptional burstiness. A key aspect of SCATS lies in its ability to group “exons” that originate from the same isoform(s). Grouping exons is essential in splicing analysis of scRNA-seq data as it naturally aggregates spliced reads across different exons, making it possible to detect splicing events even when sequencing depth is low. To evaluate the performance of SCATS, we analyzed both simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets and compared with existing methods including Census and DEXSeq. We show that SCATS has well controlled type I error rate, and is more powerful than existing methods, especially when splicing difference is small. In contrast, Census suffers from severe type I error inflation, whereas DEXSeq is more conservative. When applied to mouse brain scRNA-seq datasets, SCATS identified more differential splicing events with subtle difference across cell types compared to Census and DEXSeq. With the increasing adoption of scRNA-seq, we believe SCATS will be well-suited for various splicing studies. The implementation of SCATS can be downloaded from https://github.com/huyustats/SCATS.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4NVGgnWxTVw" width="1" />

<p>by David Conesa, Blas Echebarria, Angelina Peñaranda, Inmaculada R. Cantalapiedra, Yohannes Shiferaw, Enrique Alvarez-Lacalle</p>

Ventricular contraction is roughly proportional to the amount of calcium released from the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum (SR) during systole. While it is rather straightforward to measure calcium levels and contractibility under different physiological conditions, the complexity of calcium handling during systole and diastole has made the prediction of its release at steady state impossible. Here we approach the problem analyzing the evolution of intracellular and extracellular calcium fluxes during a single beat which is away from homeostatic balance. Using an in-silico subcellular model of rabbit ventricular myocyte, we show that the high dimensional nonlinear problem of finding the steady state can be reduced to a two-variable general equilibrium condition where pre-systolic calcium level in the cytosol and in the SR must fulfill simultaneously two different equalities. This renders calcium homeostasis as a problem that can be studied in terms of its equilibrium structure, leading to precise predictions of steady state from single-beat measurements. We show how changes in ion channels modify the general equilibrium, as shocks would do in general equilibrium macroeconomic models. This allows us to predict when an enhanced entrance of calcium in the cell reduces its contractibility and explain why SERCA gene therapy, a change in calcium handling to treat heart failure, might fail to improve contraction even when it successfully increases SERCA expression.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mu2DBZQtspw" width="1" />

Group A <i>Streptococcus</i> (GAS) skin infections are caused by a diverse array of strain types and are highly prevalent in disadvantaged populations. The role of strain-specific immunity in preventing GAS infections is poorly understood, representing a critical knowledge gap in vaccine development. A recent GAS murine challenge study showed evidence that sterilising strain-specific and enduring immunity required two skin infections by the same GAS strain within three weeks. This mechanism of developing enduring immunity may be a significant impediment to the accumulation of immunity in populations. We used an agent-based mathematical model of GAS transmission to investigate the epidemiological consequences of enduring strain-specific immunity developing only after two infections with the same strain within a specified interval. Accounting for uncertainty when correlating murine timeframes to humans, we varied this maximum inter-infection interval from 3 to 420 weeks to assess its impact on prevalence and strain diversity, and considered additional scenarios where no maximum inter-infection interval was specified. Model outputs were compared with longitudinal GAS surveillance observations from northern Australia, a region with endemic infection. We also assessed the likely impact of a targeted strain-specific multivalent vaccine in this context. Our model produced patterns of transmission consistent with observations when the maximum inter-infection interval for developing enduring immunity was 19 weeks. Our vaccine analysis suggests that the leading multivalent GAS vaccine may have limited impact on the prevalence of GAS in populations in northern Australia if strain-specific immunity requires repeated episodes of infection. Our results suggest that observed GAS epidemiology from disease endemic settings is consistent with enduring strain-specific immunity being dependent on repeated infections with the same strain, and provide additional motivation for relevant human studies to confirm the human immune response to GAS skin infection.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/47TFyc1oQ4k" width="1" />

Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are vascular lesions predominantly developing in the central nervous system (CNS), with no effective treatments other than surgery. Loss-of-function mutation in CCM1/krev interaction trapped 1 (KRIT1), CCM2, or CCM3/programmed cell death 10 (PDCD10) causes lesions that are characterized by abnormal vascular integrity. Vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), a major regulator of endothelial cell (EC) junctional integrity is strongly disorganized in ECs lining the CCM lesions. We report here that microRNA-27a (miR-27a), a negative regulator of VE-cadherin, is elevated in ECs isolated from mouse brains developing early CCM lesions and in cultured ECs with CCM1 or CCM2 depletion. Furthermore, we show miR-27a acts downstream of kruppel-like factor (KLF)2 and KLF4, two known key transcription factors involved in CCM lesion development. Using CD5-2 (a target site blocker [TSB]) to prevent the miR-27a/VE-cadherin mRNA interaction, we present a potential therapy to increase VE-cadherin expression and thus rescue the abnormal vascular integrity. In CCM1- or CCM2-depleted ECs, CD5-2 reduces monolayer permeability, and in <i>Ccm1</i> heterozygous mice, it restores dermal vessel barrier function. In a neonatal mouse model of CCM disease, CD5-2 normalizes vasculature and reduces vascular leakage in the lesions, inhibits the development of large lesions, and significantly reduces the size of established lesions in the hindbrain. Furthermore, CD5-2 limits the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the lesion area. Our work has established that VE-cadherin is a potential therapeutic target for normalization of the vasculature and highlights that targeting miR-27a/VE-cadherin interaction by CD5-2 is a potential novel therapy for the devastating disease, CCM.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/a7Bn3ZKf8Nc" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Cataglyphis </i> ants are known for their outstanding navigational abilities. They return to their inconspicuous nest after far‐reaching foraging trips using path integration, and whenever available, learn and memorize visual features of panoramic sceneries. To achieve this, the ants combine directional visual information from celestial cues and panoramic scenes with distance information from an intrinsic odometer. The largely vision‐based navigation in <i>Cataglyphis </i> requires sophisticated neuronal networks to process the broad repertoire of visual stimuli. Although <i>Cataglyphis </i> ants have been subjected to many neuroethological studies, little is known about the general neuronal organization of their central brain and the visual pathways beyond major circuits. Here, we provide a comprehensive, three‐dimensional neuronal map of synapse‐rich neuropils in the brain of <i>Cataglyphis nodus </i> including major connecting fiber systems. In addition, we examined neuronal tracts underlying the processing of visual information in more detail. This study revealed a total of 33 brain neuropils and 30 neuronal fiber tracts including six distinct tracts between the optic lobes and the cerebrum. We also discuss the importance of comparative studies on insect brain architecture for a profound understanding of neuronal networks and their function.</p>

<p>Neoplastic or dysplastic neuronal tissue in the brain stem and cerebellum can become epileptogenic in pediatric patients. However, it is unknown whether such tissue may transform intrinsic properties of the human cerebellum, making it capable of generating epileptic population activity. We noninvasively detected epileptiform signals unaveraged in a pediatric patient with epilepsy due to a tumor in the middle cerebellar peduncle. Analysis of generators of the signals revealed that the cerebellum ipsilateral and contralateral to the tumor was the dominant interictal spike generator and could initiate ictal activity, suggesting that human cerebellum may become capable of intrinsically generating epileptic activity.

<p>Reinforcement learning is a popular machine learning paradigm which can find
near optimal solutions to complex problems. Most often, these procedures
involve function approximation using neural networks with gradient based
updates to optimise weights for the problem being considered. While this common
approach generally works well, there are other update mechanisms which are
largely unexplored in reinforcement learning. One such mechanism is Extreme
Learning Machines. These were initially proposed to drastically improve the
training speed of neural networks and have since seen many applications. Here
we attempt to apply extreme learning machines to a reinforcement learning
problem in the same manner as gradient based updates. This new algorithm is
called Extreme Q-Learning Machine (EQLM). We compare its performance to a
typical Q-Network on the cart-pole task - a benchmark reinforcement learning
problem - and show EQLM has similar long-term learning performance to a
Q-Network.

<p>Reservoir Computing (RC) is a well-known strategy for designing Recurrent
Neural Networks featured by striking efficiency of training. The crucial aspect
of RC is to properly instantiate the hidden recurrent layer that serves as
dynamical memory to the system. In this respect, the common recipe is to create
a pool of randomly and sparsely connected recurrent neurons. While the aspect
of sparsity in the design of RC systems has been debated in the literature, it
is nowadays understood mainly as a way to enhance the efficiency of
computation, exploiting sparse matrix operations. In this paper, we empirically
investigate the role of sparsity in RC network design under the perspective of
the richness of the developed temporal representations. We analyze both
sparsity in the recurrent connections, and in the connections from the input to
the reservoir. Our results point out that sparsity, in particular in
input-reservoir connections, has a major role in developing internal temporal
representations that have a longer short-term memory of past inputs and a
higher dimension.

<p>Throughout life, we might seek a calling, companions, skills, entertainment,
truth, self-knowledge, beauty, and edification. The practice of curiosity can
be viewed as an extended and open-ended search for valuable information with
hidden identity and location in a complex space of interconnected information.
Despite its importance, curiosity has been challenging to computationally model
because the practice of curiosity often flourishes without specific goals,
external reward, or immediate feedback. Here, we show how network science,
statistical physics, and philosophy can be integrated into an approach that
coheres with and expands the psychological taxonomies of specific-diversive and
perceptual-epistemic curiosity. Using this interdisciplinary approach, we
distill functional modes of curious information seeking as searching movements
in information space. The kinesthetic model of curiosity offers a vibrant
counterpart to the deliberative predictions of model-based reinforcement
learning. In doing so, this model unearths new computational opportunities for
identifying what makes curiosity curious.

<p>The study presents a neural network, which uses filters based on logistic
mapping (LogNNet). LogNNet has a feedforward network structure, but possesses
the properties of reservoir neural networks. The input weight matrix, set by a
recurrent logistic mapping, forms the kernels that transform the input space to
the higher-dimensional feature space. The most effective MNIST handwritten
digit recognition occurs under chaotic behavior of logistic map. An advantage
of LogNNet implementation on IoT Devices is the significant savings in used
memory (more than 10 times) compared to other neural networks. The presented
network architecture uses an array of weights with a total memory size from 1
kB to 29 kB and achieves a classification accuracy of 80.3-96.3 %.

<p>In past few years, linear rectified unit activation functions have shown its
significance in the neural networks, surpassing the performance of sigmoid
activations. RELU (Nair &amp; Hinton, 2010), ELU (Clevert et al., 2015), PRELU (He
et al., 2015), LRELU (Maas et al., 2013), SRELU (Jin et al., 2016),
ThresholdedRELU, all these linear rectified activation functions have its own
significance over others in some aspect. Most of the time these activation
functions suffer from bias shift problem due to non-zero output mean, and high
weight update problem in deep complex networks due to unit gradient, which
results in slower training, and high variance in model prediction respectively.
In this paper, we propose, "Thresholded exponential rectified linear unit"
(TERELU) activation function that works better in alleviating in overfitting:
large weight update problem. Along with alleviating overfitting problem, this
method also gives good amount of non-linearity as compared to other linear
rectifiers. We will show better performance on the various datasets using
neural networks, considering TERELU activation method compared to other
activations.

<p>Recent characterisations of self-organising systems depend upon the presence
of a Markov blanket: a statistical boundary that mediates the interactions
between what is inside of and outside of a system. We leverage this idea to
provide an analysis of partitions in neuronal systems. This is applicable to
brain architectures at multiple scales, enabling partitions into single
neurons, brain regions, and brain-wide networks. This treatment is based upon
the canonical micro-circuitry used in empirical studies of effective
connectivity, so as to speak directly to practical applications. This depends
upon the dynamic coupling between functional units, whose form recapitulates
that of a Markov blanket at each level. The nuance afforded by partitioning
neural systems in this way highlights certain limitations of modular
perspectives of brain function that only consider a single level of
description.

<p>Transfer learning entails taking an artificial neural network (ANN) that is
trained on a source dataset and adapting it to a new target dataset. While this
has been shown to be quite powerful, its use has generally been restricted by
architectural constraints. Previously, in order to reuse and adapt an ANN's
internal weights and structure, the underlying topology of the ANN being
transferred across tasks must remain mostly the same while a new output layer
is attached, discarding the old output layer's weights. This work introduces
network-aware adaptive structure transfer learning (N-ASTL), an advancement
over prior efforts to remove this restriction. N-ASTL utilizes statistical
information related to the source network's topology and weight distribution in
order to inform how new input and output neurons are to be integrated into the
existing structure. Results show improvements over prior state-of-the-art,
including the ability to transfer in challenging real-world datasets not
previously possible and improved generalization over RNNs trained without
transfer.

<p>For the gradient computation across the time domain in Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs) training, two different approaches have been independently
studied. The first is to compute the gradients with respect to the change in
spike activation (activation-based methods), and the second is to compute the
gradients with respect to the change in spike timing (timing-based methods). In
this work, we present a comparative study of the two methods and propose a new
supervised learning method that combines them. The proposed method utilizes
each individual spike more effectively by shifting spike timings as in the
timing-based methods as wells as generating and removing spikes as in the
activation-based methods. Experimental results showed that the proposed method
achieves higher performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency than the
previous approaches.

<p>Multi-modal multi-objective optimization problems (MMMOPs) have multiple
solution vectors mapping to the same objective vector. For MMMOPs, it is
important to discover equivalent solutions associated with each point in the
Pareto-Front for allowing end-users to make informed decisions. Prevalent
multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are incapable of searching for multiple
solution subsets, whereas, algorithms designed for MMMOPs demonstrate degraded
performance in the objective space. This motivates the design of better
algorithms for addressing MMMOPs. The present work highlights the disadvantage
of using crowding distance in the decision space when solving MMMOPs.
Subsequently, an evolutionary framework, called graph Laplacian based
Optimization using Reference vector assisted Decomposition (LORD), is proposed,
which is the first algorithm to use decomposition in both objective and
decision space for dealing with MMMOPs. Its filtering step is further extended
to present LORD-II algorithm, which demonstrates its dynamics on multi-modal
many-objective problems. The efficacy of the frameworks are established by
comparing their performance on 34 test instances (obtained from the CEC 2019
multi-modal multi-objective test suite) with the state-of-the-art algorithms
for MMMOPs and other multi- and many-objective evolutionary algorithms. The
manuscript is concluded mentioning the limitations of the proposed frameworks
and future directions to design still better algorithms for MMMOPs.

<p>A new method for improving the optimization performance of a state-of-the-art
differential evolution (DE) variant is proposed in this paper. The technique
can increase the exploration by adopting the long-tailed property of the Cauchy
distribution, which helps the algorithm to generate a trial vector with great
diversity. Compared to the previous approaches, the proposed approach perturbs
a target vector instead of a mutant vector based on a jumping rate. We applied
the proposed approach to LSHADE-RSP ranked second place in the CEC 2018
competition on single objective real-valued optimization. A set of 30 different
and difficult optimization problems is used to evaluate the optimization
performance of the improved LSHADE-RSP. Our experimental results verify that
the improved LSHADE-RSP significantly outperformed not only its predecessor
LSHADE-RSP but also several cutting-edge DE variants in terms of convergence
speed and solution accuracy.

<p>Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been popularized in many science and
technological areas due to their capacity to solve many complex pattern
matching problems. That is the case of Virtual Screening, a research area that
studies how to identify those molecular compounds with the highest probability
to present biological activity for a therapeutic target. Due to the vast number
of small organic compounds and the thousands of targets for which such
large-scale screening can potentially be carried out, there has been an
increasing interest in the research community to increase both, processing
speed and energy efficiency in the screening of molecular databases. In this
work, we present a classification model describing each molecule with a single
energy-based vector and propose a machine-learning system based on the use of
ANNs. Different ANNs are studied with respect to their suitability to identify
biochemical similarities. Also, a high-performance and energy-efficient
hardware acceleration platform based on the use of stochastic computing is
proposed for the ANN implementation. This platform is of utility when screening
vast libraries of compounds. As a result, the proposed model showed appreciable
improvements with respect previously published works in terms of the main
relevant characteristics (accuracy, speed and energy-efficiency).

<p>While deep neural networks (DNNs) are being increasingly used to make
predictions from high-dimensional, complex data, they are widely seen as
uninterpretable "black boxes", since it can be difficult to discover what input
information is used to make predictions. This ability is particularly important
for applications in cognitive neuroscience and neuroinformatics. A saliency map
is a common approach for producing interpretable visualizations of the relative
importance of input features for a prediction. However, many methods for
creating these maps fail due to focusing too much on the input or being
extremely sensitive to small input noise. It is also challenging to
quantitatively evaluate how well saliency maps correspond to the truly relevant
input information. In this paper, we develop two quantitative evaluation
procedures for saliency methods, using the fact that the Human Connectome
Project (HCP) dataset contains functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
data from multiple tasks per subject to create ground truth saliency maps. We
then introduce an adversarial training method that makes DNNs robust to small
input noise, and demonstrate that it measurably improves interpretability.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05488">Brain-inspired self-organization with cellular neuromorphic computing for multimodal unsupervised learning. (arXiv:2004.05488v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>Cortical plasticity is one of the main features that enable our capability to
learn and adapt in our environment. Indeed, the cerebral cortex has the ability
to self-organize itself through two distinct forms of plasticity: the
structural plasticity that creates (sprouting) or cuts (pruning) synaptic
connections between neurons, and the synaptic plasticity that modifies the
synaptic connections strength. These mechanisms are very likely at the basis of
an extremely interesting characteristic of the human brain development: the
multimodal association. [...] To model such a behavior, Edelman and Damasio
proposed respectively the Reentry and the Convergence Divergence Zone
frameworks where bi-directional neural communications can lead to both
multimodal fusion (convergence) and inter-modal activation (divergence). [...]
In this paper, we build a brain-inspired neural system based on the Reentry
principles, using Self-Organizing Maps and Hebbian-like learning. We propose
and compare different computational methods for unsupervised learning and
inference, then quantify the gain of both convergence and divergence mechanisms
in a multimodal classification task. The divergence mechanism is used to label
one modality based on the other, while the convergence mechanism is used to
improve the overall accuracy of the system. We perform our experiments on a
constructed written/spoken digits database and a DVS/EMG hand gestures
database. Finally, we implement our system on the Iterative Grid, a cellular
neuromorphic architecture that enables distributed computing with local
connectivity. We show the gain of the so-called hardware plasticity induced by
our model, where the system's topology is not fixed by the user but learned
along the system's experience through self-organization.

<p>Despite progress in training neural networks for lossy image compression,
current approaches fail to maintain both perceptual quality and abstract
features at very low bitrates. Encouraged by recent success in learning
discrete representations with Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders
(VQ-VAEs), we motivate the use of a hierarchy of VQ-VAEs to attain high factors
of compression. We show that the combination of stochastic quantization and
hierarchical latent structure aids likelihood-based image compression. This
leads us to introduce a novel objective for training hierarchical VQ-VAEs. Our
resulting scheme produces a Markovian series of latent variables that
reconstruct images of high-perceptual quality which retain semantically
meaningful features. We provide qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the
CelebA and MNIST datasets.

<p>Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is a brain-inspired, event-driven machine
learning algorithm that has recognized potential in producing
ultra-high-energy-efficient hardware. Among existing SNNs, unsupervised SNNs
are based on synaptic plasticity and considered to have more potential in
imitating the learning process of biological brain. Most unsupervised SNNs are
trained through competitive learning with Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity
(STDP). However, the STDP-based SNNs are limited by slow learning speed and/or
constrained learning capability. In this paper, to overcome these limitations,
we: 1) designed a high-parallelism network architecture, inspired by the
Inception module in the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) literature; 2) extended
a widely used vote-based spike decoding scheme to a Vote-for-All (VFA) decoding
layer to reduce the information loss in the spike decoding; 3) proposed to use
adaptive repolarization (i.e. resetting) in the spiking neuron model to enhance
the spiking activities and thus further accelerate the network's learning. We
evaluated our contributions on the two established benchmark datasets
(MNIST/EMNIST). Our experimental results show that our architecture exhibits
superior performance than widely used Fully-Connected (FC) and
Locally-Connected (LC) architectures. Our SNN not only achieves comparable
results with the state-of-the-art unsupervised SNNs (95.64%/80.11% accuracy on
the MNIST/EMNISE dataset), but also shows superior learning efficiency and
robustness against hardware damage. Our SNN trained with only hundreds of
iterations can achieve a great classification accuracy, and random destruction
of large numbers of synapses and neurons only leads to negligible performance
degradation.

<p>We propose a numerical method for solving high dimensional fully nonlinear
partial differential equations (PDEs). Our algorithm estimates simultaneously
by backward time induction the solution and its gradient by multi-layer neural
networks, while the Hessian is approximated by automatic differentiation of the
gradient at previous step. This methodology extends to the fully nonlinear case
the approach recently proposed in \cite{HPW19} for semi-linear PDEs. Numerical
tests illustrate the performance and accuracy of our method on several examples
in high dimension with nonlinearity on the Hessian term including a linear
quadratic control problem with control on the diffusion coefficient,
Monge-Amp{\`e}re equation and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in portfolio
optimization.

<p>State-of-the-art simulations of detailed neural models follow the Bulk
Synchronous Parallel execution model. Execution is divided in equidistant
communication intervals, equivalent to the shortest synaptic delay in the
network. Neurons stepping is performed independently, with collective
communication guiding synchronization and exchange of synaptic events.
</p>
<p>The interpolation step size is fixed and chosen based on some prior knowledge
of the fastest possible dynamics in the system. However, simulations driven by
stiff dynamics or a wide range of time scales - such as multiscale simulations
of neural networks - struggle with fixed step interpolation methods, yielding
excessive computation of intervals of quasi-constant activity, inaccurate
interpolation of periods of high volatility solution, and being incapable of
handling unknown or distinct time constants. A common alternative is the usage
of adaptive stepping methods, however they have been deemed inefficient in
parallel executions due to computational load imbalance at the synchronization
barriers that characterize the BSP execution model.
</p>
<p>We introduce a distributed fully-asynchronous execution model that removes
global synchronization, allowing for longer variable timestep interpolations.
Asynchronicity is provided by active point-to-point communication notifying
neurons' time advancement to synaptic connectivities. Time stepping is driven
by scheduled neuron advancements based on synaptic delays across neurons,
yielding an "exhaustive yet not speculative" adaptive-step execution. Execution
benchmarks on 64 Cray XE6 compute nodes demonstrate a reduced number of
interpolation steps, higher numerical accuracy and lower time to solution,
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Efficiency is shown to be
activity-dependent, with scaling of the algorithm demonstrated on a simulation
of a laboratory experiment.

Here, the authors show that single-atom Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic PtGa works as an active and selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation even at 600 °C for 96 h without deactivation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/ajD05WUYlb0" width="1" />

<p>The modification of methyltransferase-like (METTL) enzymes plays important roles in various cellular responses by regulating microRNA expression. However, how m6A modification is involved in stress granule (SG) formation in the early stage of acute ischemic stroke by affecting the biogenesis processing of microRNAs remains unclear. Here, we established a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in rats and an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) model in primary cortical neurons and PC12 cells to explore the potential mechanism between m6A modification and SG formation. The in vivo results showed that the level of infarction and apoptosis increased while SG formation decreased significantly within the ischemic cortex with improved reperfusion time after 2 h of ischemia. Consistent with the in vivo data, an inverse association between the apoptosis level and SG formation was observed in PC12 cells during the reperfusion period after 6 h of OGD stimulation. Both in vivo and in vitro results showed that the expression of METTL3 protein, m6A and miR-335 was significantly decreased with the reperfusion period. Overexpression of the METTL3 and METTL3 gene-knockdown in PC12 cells were achieved via plasmid transfection and CRISPR-Cas9 technology, respectively. Overexpression or knockdown of METTL3 in oxygen-glucose deprivation of PC12 cells resulted in functional maturation of miR-335, SG formation and apoptosis levels. In addition, we found that miR-335 enhanced SG formation through degradation of the mRNA of the eukaryotic translation termination factor (Erf1). In conclusion, we found that METTL3-mediated m6A methylation increases the maturation of miR-335, which promotes SG formation and reduces the apoptosis level of injury neurons and cells, and provides a potential therapeutic strategy for AIS.</p>

<p>Background: Hypothermia attenuates microglial activation and exerts a potential neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemic-reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. In this in vitro study, a model of oxygen-glucose deprivation, followed by recovery (OGD/R), was used to investigate whether hypothermia exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis properties via enhanced ubiquitination and down-regulation of voltage-dependent anion channel 3 (VDAC3) expression.</p><p>Methods: BV2 microglia were cultured under OGD for 4 h following reperfusion with or without hypothermia for 2, 4, or 8 h. M1 and M2 microglia markers [inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase (Arg)1] were detected using immunofluorescence. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, interleukin (IL)-1β], and anti-inflammatory factor (IL-10) were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was assayed by JC-1 staining using a flow cytometer. Expression of caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, and VDAC3 were assessed using western blot analysis. The cellular locations and interactions of ubiquitin and VDAC3 were identified using double immunofluorescence staining and immunoprecipitation (IP) assay. Also, the level of the VDAC3 mRNA was determined using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).</p><p>Results: Hypothermia inhibited the OGD/R–induced microglia activation and differentiation into the M1 type with pro-inflammatory effect, whereas it promoted differentiation to the M2 type with anti-inflammatory effect. Hypothermia attenuated OGD/R-induced loss of Δψm, as well as the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins. Compared to normothermia, hypothermia increased the level of ubiquitinated VDAC3 in the BV2 microglia at both 2 and 8 h of reperfusion. Furthermore, hypothermia did not attenuate VDAC3 mRNA expression in OGD/R-induced microglia.</p><p>Conclusions: Hypothermia treatment during reperfusion, attenuated OGD/R-induced inflammation, and apoptosis in BV2 microglia. This might be due to the promotion of VDAC3 ubiquitination, identifying VDAC3 as a new target of hypothermia.</p>

<p>Epileptogenesis is a common consequence of brain insults, however, the prevention or delay of the epileptogenic process remains an important unmet medical challenge. Overexpression of glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) is proposed as a pathological hallmark in the hippocampus of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and we previously demonstrated in rodent epilepsy models that augmentation of glycine suppressed chronic seizures and altered acute seizure thresholds. In the present study we evaluated the effect of the GlyT1 inhibitor, sarcosine (aka N-methylglycine), on epileptogenesis and also investigated possible mechanisms. We developed a modified rapid kindling model of epileptogenesis in rats combined with seizure score monitoring to evaluate the antiepileptogenic effect of sarcosine. We used immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis for the evaluation of GlyT1 expression and epigenetic changes of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in the epileptogenic hippocampi of rats, and further evaluated expression changes in enzymes involved in the regulation of DNA methylation, ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1), DNA-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), and DNMT3a. Our results demonstrated: (i) experimental evidence that sarcosine (3 g/kg, i.p. daily) suppressed kindling epileptogenesis in rats; (ii) the sarcosine-induced antiepileptogenic effect was accompanied by a suppressed hippocampal GlyT1 expression as well as a reduction of hippocampal 5mC levels and a corresponding increase in 5hmC; and (iii) sarcosine treatment caused differential expression changes of TET1 and DNMTs. Together, these findings suggest that sarcosine has unprecedented disease-modifying properties in a kindling model of epileptogenesis in rats, which was associated with altered hippocampal DNA methylation. Thus, manipulation of the glycine system is a potential therapeutic approach to attenuate the development of epilepsy.</p>

<p>Progressive functional deterioration and loss of neurons underlies neurological diseases and constitutes an important cause of disability and death worldwide. The causes of various types of neurological diseases often share several critical nerve-related cellular mechanisms and pathological features, particularly the neuroinflammatory response in the nervous system. A rapidly growing body of evidence indicates that various microRNAs play pivotal roles in these processes in neurological diseases and might be viable therapeutic targets. Among these microRNAs, microRNA-146a (miR-146a) stands out due to the rapid increase in recent literature on its mechanistic involvement in neurological diseases. In this review, we summarize and highlight the critical role of miR-146a in neurological diseases. MiR-146a polymorphisms are associated with the risk of neurological disease. Alterations in miR-146a expression levels are crucial events in the pathogenesis of numerous neurological diseases that are spatially and temporally diverse. Additionally, the target genes of miR-146a are involved in the regulation of pathophysiological processes in neurological diseases, particularly the neuroinflammatory response. In summary, miR-146a mainly plays a critical role in neuroinflammation during the progression of neurological diseases and might be a prospective biomarker and therapeutic target. Understanding the mechanisms by which miR-146a affects the neuroinflammatory response in different neurological injuries, different cell types, and even different stages of certain neurological diseases will pave the way for its use as a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Although many scholars deem non-invasive measures of neurophysiology to have promise in assessing learning, these measures are currently not widely applied, neither in educational settings nor in training. How can non-invasive neurophysiology provide insight into learning and how should research on this topic move forward to ensure valid applications? The current article addresses these questions by discussing the mechanisms underlying neurophysiological changes during learning followed by a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis of non-invasive neurophysiology in learning and training. This type of analysis can provide a structured examination of factors relevant to the current state and future of a field. The findings of the SWOT analysis indicate that the field of neurophysiology in learning and training is developing rapidly. By leveraging the opportunities of neurophysiology in learning and training (while bearing in mind weaknesses, threats, and strengths) the field can move forward in promising directions. Suggestions for opportunities for future work are provided to ensure valid and effective application of non-invasive neurophysiology in a wide range of learning and training settings.</p>

<p>To summarize the distribution of glioma location within a patient population, registration of individual MR images to anatomical reference space is required. In this study, we quantified the accuracy of MR image registration to anatomical reference space with linear and non-linear transformations using estimated tumor targets of glioblastoma and lower-grade glioma, and anatomical landmarks at pre- and post-operative time-points using six commonly used registration packages (FSL, SPM5, DARTEL, ANTs, Elastix, and NiftyReg). Routine clinical pre- and post-operative, post-contrast T1-weighted images of 20 patients with glioblastoma and 20 with lower-grade glioma were collected. The 2009a Montreal Neurological Institute brain template was used as anatomical reference space. Tumors were manually segmented in the patient space and corresponding healthy tissue was delineated as a target volume in the anatomical reference space. Accuracy of the tumor alignment was quantified using the Dice score and the Hausdorff distance. To measure the accuracy of general brain alignment, anatomical landmarks were placed in patient and in anatomical reference space, and the landmark distance after registration was quantified. Lower-grade gliomas were registered more accurately than glioblastoma. Registration accuracy for pre- and post-operative MR images did not differ. SPM5 and DARTEL registered tumors most accurate, and FSL least accurate. Non-linear transformations resulted in more accurate general brain alignment than linear transformations, but tumor alignment was similar between linear and non-linear transformation. We conclude that linear transformation suffices to summarize glioma locations in anatomical reference space.</p>

<p>Aging is the major risk factor of the most common (∼95% of cases) sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Accumulating data indicate middle age as a critical period for the relevant pathological processes, however, the question of when AD starts to develop remains open. It has been reported only recently that in the early postnatal period—when brain development is completing—preconditions for a decrease in cognitive abilities and for accelerated aging can form. Here, we hypothesized that specific features of early postnatal brain development may be considered some of the prerequisites of AD development at an advanced age. To test this hypothesis, we used OXYS rats, which are a suitable model of sporadic AD. The duration of gestation, litter size, and weight at birth were lower in OXYS rats compared to control Wistar rats. The shortened duration of gestation may result in developmental retardation. Indeed, we noted decreased locomotor activity and increased anxiety in OXYS rats already at a young age: possible signs of altered brain development. We demonstrated retardation of the peak of postnatal neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of OXYS rats. Delayed neuronal maturation led to alterations of mossy-fiber formation: a shortened suprapyramidal bundle and longer infrapyramidal bundle, less pronounced fasciculation of granule cells’ axons, and smaller size and irregular shape of nuclei in the CA3 pyramidal layer. These changes were accompanied by altered astrocytic migration. The observed features of early development may be considered some of the risk factors of the AD-like pathology that manifests itself in OXYS rats late in life.</p>

<p>Dysfunction within large-scale brain networks as the basis for movement disorders is an accepted hypothesis. The treatment options for restoring network function are limited. Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation are now being studied to modify the network. Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is also a portable, cost-effective, and non-invasive way of network modulation. Transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial alternating current stimulation have been studied in Parkinson’s disease, dystonia, tremor, and ataxia. Transcranial pulsed current stimulation and transcranial random noise stimulation are not yet studied enough. The literature in the use of these techniques is intriguing, yet many unanswered questions remain. In this review, we highlight the studies using these four potential tES techniques and their electrophysiological basis and consider the therapeutic implication in the field of movement disorders. The objectives are to consolidate the current literature, demonstrate that these methods are feasible, and encourage the application of such techniques in the near future.</p>

<p>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Currently, there is no promising treatment that improves prognosis significantly. While a thorough investigation of the pathological process within the primary site of injury in the brain has been conducted by the research field, the focus was mainly on gray matter injury, which partly accounted for the failure of discovery of clinically efficacious treatments. It is not until recent years that white matter (WM) injury in the brain after subcortical ICH was examined. As WM tracts form networks between different regions, damage to fibers should impair brain connectivity, resulting in functional impairment. Although WM changes have been demonstrated in the brain after ICH, alterations distant from the initial injury site down in the spinal cord are unclear. This longitudinal study, for the first time, revealed prolonged morphological changes of the contralesional dorsal corticospinal tract (CST) in the spinal cord 5 weeks after experimental ICH in mice by confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, implying that the structural integrity of the CST was compromised extensively after ICH. Given the important role of CST in motor function, future translational studies targeting motor recovery should delineate the treatment effects on CST integrity.</p>

<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established therapy for the management of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, DBS is indicated as the disease progresses and motor complications derived from pharmacological therapy arise. Here, we evaluate the potential of DBS prior to levodopa (L-Dopa) in improving quality of life (QoL), challenging the state of the art for DBS therapy. We present data on clinical manifestation, decision finding during early indication to DBS, and trajectories after DBS. We further discuss current paradigms for DBS and hypothesize on possible mechanisms. Six patients, between 50 and 67 years old, presenting at least 5 years of PD symptoms, and without L-Dopa therapy initiation, received subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS implantation. In the six PD cases, indication for DBS was not driven by motor complications, as supported by current guidelines, but by relevant QoL impairment and patient’s reluctance to initiate L-Dopa treatment. All patients treated with STN-DBS prior to L-Dopa presented improvement in motor and non-motor symptoms and significant QoL improvement. All patients reduced the intake of dopamine agonists, and five are currently free from L-Dopa medication, with no reported adverse events. We introduce a multicenter observational study to investigate whether early DBS treatment may affect the natural course of PD. Early application of DBS instead of L-Dopa administration could have a pathophysiological basis and be prompted by a significant incline on QoL through disease progression; however, the clinical value of this proposed paradigm shift should be addressed in clinical trials aimed at modulating the natural course of PD.</p>

<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) contributes to hypocoagulopathy associated with prolonged bleeding and hemorrhagic progression. Bloodletting puncture therapy at hand twelve Jing-well points (BL-HTWP) has been applied as a first aid measure in various emergent neurological diseases, but the detailed mechanisms of the modulation between the central nervous system and systemic circulation after acute TBI in rodents remain unclear. To investigate whether BL-HTWP stimulation modulates hypocoagulable state and exerts neuroprotective effect, experimental TBI model of mice was produced by the controlled cortical impactor (CCI), and treatment with BL-HTWP was immediately made after CCI. Then, the effects of BL-HTWP on the neurological function, cerebral perfusion state, coagulable state, and cerebrovascular histopathology post-acute TBI were determined, respectively. Results showed that BL-HTWP treatment attenuated cerebral hypoperfusion and improve neurological recovery post-acute TBI. Furthermore, BL-HTWP stimulation reversed acute TBI-induced hypocoagulable state, reduced vasogenic edema and cytotoxic edema by regulating multiple hallmarks of coagulopathy in TBI. Therefore, we conclude for the first time that hypocoagulopathic state occurs after acute experimental TBI, and the neuroprotective effect of BL-HTWP relies on, at least in part, the modulation of hypocoagulable state. BL-HTWP therapy may be a promising strategy for acute severe TBI in the future.</p>

<p>Conflict-control is a core function of cognitive control. Although numerous studies have considered cognitive control to be domain-general, the shared and distinct brain responses to different types of incongruence or conflict remain unclear. Using a hybrid flanker task, the present study explored the temporal dynamics of brain activation to three types of incongruence: flanker interference, rule-based response switch (rule-switch), and action-based response switch (response-alternation). The results showed that: (1) all three types of incongruence evoked larger N2 amplitudes than the congruent condition in the frontal region, with the N2 amplitudes and topographical distribution of the N2 effect differing between the different types of incongruence; and (2) in the P300 time window, the flanker interference condition yielded the most delayed P300 latency, whereas the rule-switch and response-alternation conditions yielded smaller P300 amplitudes with a longer interval from P300 peak to a keypress. These findings suggest that different types of incongruence are first monitored similarly by the cognitive control system and then resolved differently.</p>

<p>Language learning relies on both short-term and long-term memory. Phonological short-term memory (pSTM) is thought to play an important role in the learning of novel word forms. However, language learners may differ in their ability to maintain word representations in pSTM during interfering auditory input. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate how pSTM capacity in better and poorer pSTM groups is linked to language learning and the maintenance of pseudowords in pSTM. In particular, MEG was recorded while participants maintained pseudowords in pSTM by covert speech rehearsal, and while these brain representations were probed by presenting auditory pseudowords with first or third syllables matching or mismatching the rehearsed item. A control condition included identical stimuli but no rehearsal. Differences in response strength between matching and mismatching syllables were interpreted as the phonological mapping negativity (PMN). While PMN for the first syllable was found in both groups, it was observed for the third syllable only in the group with better pSTM. This suggests that individuals with better pSTM maintained representations of trisyllabic pseudowords more accurately during interference than individuals with poorer pSTM. Importantly, the group with better pSTM learned words faster in a paired-associate word learning task, linking the PMN findings to language learning.</p>

<p>Neuroimaging evidence suggests that the development of the hippocampus, a brain structure critical for memory function, contributes to the improvements of episodic memory between middle childhood to adulthood. However, investigations on age differences in hippocampal activation and functional connectivity and their contributions to the development of memory have yielded mixed results. Given the known structural and functional heterogeneity along the long axis of the hippocampus, we investigated age differences in the activation and functional connectivity in hippocampal subregions with a cross-sectional sample of 96 participants ages 8–25 years. We found that anterior and posterior hippocampus supported memory formation, and there was overall stability in memory-related hippocampal activation with age. Without taking account of memory outcome, direct contrast between subregions showed higher functional connectivity of anterior, compared to the posterior hippocampus, with regions in the inferior frontal and lateral temporal lobes, and higher functional connectivity of posterior, compared to the anterior hippocampus, with regions in the medial and superior frontal, inferior parietal, and occipital lobes. A direct contrast between the memory-related connectivity patterns of anterior and posterior hippocampus identified a region in the medial frontal cortex, with which anterior and posterior hippocampus was differentially functionally connected. Finally, we identified age differences in memory-related differential hippocampal functional connectivity with several frontal and visual/sensory cortices, underscoring the importance of examining age differences in the patterns of hippocampal connectivity. Moreover, the specific patterns of differential anterior and posterior functional connectivity indicate an increase in the functional specialization along the long axis of the hippocampus and a dynamic shift in hippocampal connectivity patterns that supports memory development.</p>

<p>Semantic verbal fluency is among the most employed tasks in cognitive aging research and substantial work is devoted to understanding the underlying mechanisms behind age-related differences at the neural and behavioral levels. The present investigation aimed to evaluate the role of moderating variables, such as age, sex, MMSE, and proxies of cognitive reserve (CR) on the hemodynamic response evoked by semantic verbal fluency in healthy young and healthy older adults. So far, no study has been conducted to this end. To elucidate the exclusive effect of the mentioned variables on brain activation during semantic fluency, finger tapping was included as a control task. Results showed that disregarding adjustments for age, older adults displayed important parietal activations during semantic fluency as well as during finger-tapping. Specifically, the anterior intra-parietal sulcus (IPS) and left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) were areas activated in both tasks in the older group. Younger adults, only displayed parietal activations related to age and sex when these demographics were employed as predictors. Concerning proxies of CR in semantic fluency, the only vocabulary was an important moderator in both age groups. Higher vocabulary scores were associated with lesser activation in occipital areas. Education did not show significant correlations with brain activity during semantic fluency in any of the groups. However, both CR proxies were significantly correlated to brain activations of older adults during finger tapping. Specifically, vocabulary was associated with frontal regions, while education correlated with parietal lobe and cingulate gyrus. Finally, the effects of MMSE were mostly observed on brain activation of older adults in both tasks. These findings demonstrate that the effects of moderating variables on shaping brain activation are intricate and not exclusive of complex verbal tasks. Thus, before adjusting for “nuisance variables,” their importance needs to be established. This is especially true for samples including older adults for whom a motor task may be a demanding operation due to normal age-related processes of dedifferentiation.</p>

<p>Psychological stress is increasingly associated with alterations in performance and affect. Yet, the relationship between experimentally induced psychological stress and neural indices of performance monitoring and error processing, as well as response inhibition, are unclear. Using scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs), we tested the relationship between experimental stress, using the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), and the error-related negativity (ERN), error positivity (Pe), and N2 ERP components. A final sample of 71 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to go through the TSST (n = 36; 18 female) or a brief mindfulness relaxation exercise (n = 35; 16 female) immediately followed by a go/no-go task while electroencephalogram (EEG) data were collected. Salivary cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure confirmed increased physiological stress in the TSST group relative to control. Reaction times, accuracy, and post-error slowing did not differ by stress group. Two-group (TSST, control) by 2-trial type (correct, incorrect for ERN/Pe; go correct, no-go correct for N2) repeated measures ANOVAs for the ERN, Pe, and N2 showed the expected main effects of trial type; neither the ERN nor the N2 ERP components showed interactions with the stress manipulation. In contrast, the Pe component showed a significant Group by Trial interaction, with reduced Pe amplitude following the stress condition relative to control. Pe amplitude did not, however, correlate with cortisol reactivity. Findings suggest a reduction in Pe amplitude following experimental stress that may be associated with reduced error awareness or attention to errors following the TSST. Given the variability in the extant literature on the relationship between experimentally induced stress and neurophysiological reflections of performance monitoring, we provide another point of data and conclude that better understanding of moderating variables is needed followed by high-powered replication studies to get at the nuance that is not yet understood in the relationship between induced stress and performance monitoring/response inhibition processes.</p>

<p>Objective: Assessing brain connectivity from electrophysiological signals is of great relevance in neuroscience, but results are still debated and depend crucially on how connectivity is defined and on mathematical instruments utilized. Aim of this work is to assess the capacity of bivariate Transfer Entropy (TE) to evaluate connectivity, using data generated from simple neural mass models of connected Regions of Interest (ROIs).</p><p>Approach: Signals simulating mean field potentials were generated assuming two, three or four ROIs, connected via excitatory or by-synaptic inhibitory links. We investigated whether the presence of a statistically significant connection can be detected and if connection strength can be quantified.</p><p>Main Results: Results suggest that TE can reliably estimate the strength of connectivity if neural populations work in their linear regions, and if the epoch lengths are longer than 10 s. In case of multivariate networks, some spurious connections can emerge (i.e., a statistically significant TE even in the absence of a true connection); however, quite a good correlation between TE and synaptic strength is still preserved. Moreover, TE appears more robust for distal regions (longer delays) compared with proximal regions (smaller delays): an approximate a priori knowledge on this delay can improve the procedure. Finally, non-linear phenomena affect the assessment of connectivity, since they may significantly reduce TE estimation: information transmission between two ROIs may be weak, due to non-linear phenomena, even if a strong causal connection is present.</p><p>Significance: Changes in functional connectivity during different tasks or brain conditions, might not always reflect a true change in the connecting network, but rather a change in information transmission. A limitation of the work is the use of bivariate TE. In perspective, the use of multivariate TE can improve estimation and reduce some of the problems encountered in the present study.</p>

<p>As we move through an environment the positions of surrounding objects relative to our body constantly change. Maintaining orientation requires spatial updating, the continuous monitoring of self-motion cues to update external locations. This ability critically depends on the integration of visual, proprioceptive, kinesthetic, and vestibular information. During weightlessness gravity no longer acts as an essential reference, creating a discrepancy between vestibular, visual and sensorimotor signals. Here, we explore the effects of repeated bouts of microgravity and hypergravity on spatial updating performance during parabolic flight. Ten healthy participants (four women, six men) took part in a parabolic flight campaign that comprised a total of 31 parabolas. Each parabola created about 20–25 s of 0 g, preceded and followed by about 20 s of hypergravity (1.8 g). Participants performed a visual-spatial updating task in seated position during 15 parabolas. The task included two updating conditions simulating virtual forward movements of different lengths (short and long), and a static condition with no movement that served as a control condition. Two trials were performed during each phase of the parabola, i.e., at 1 g before the start of the parabola, at 1.8 g during the acceleration phase of the parabola, and during 0 g. Our data demonstrate that 0 g and 1.8 g impaired pointing performance for long updating trials as indicated by increased variability of pointing errors compared to 1 g. In contrast, we found no support for any changes for short updating and static conditions, suggesting that a certain degree of task complexity is required to affect pointing errors. These findings are important for operational requirements during spaceflight because spatial updating is pivotal for navigation when vision is poor or unreliable and objects go out of sight, for example during extravehicular activities in space or the exploration of unfamiliar environments. Future studies should compare the effects on spatial updating during seated and free-floating conditions, and determine at which g-threshold decrements in spatial updating performance emerge.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, affecting two-thirds of people with dementia in the world. To date, no disease-modifying treatments are available to stop or delay the progression of AD. This chronic neurodegenerative disease is dominated by a strong innate immune response, whereby microglia plays a central role as the main resident macrophage of the brain. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in microglial genes and associated with a delayed onset of AD, highlighting the important role of these cells on the onset and/or progression of the disease. These findings have increased the interest in targeting microglia-associated neuroinflammation as a potentially disease-modifying therapeutic approach for AD. In this review we provide an overview on the contribution of microglia to the pathophysiology of AD, focusing on the main regulatory pathways controlling microglial population dynamics during the neuroinflammatory response, such as the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), its ligands (the colony-stimulating factor 1 and interleukin 34) and the transcription factor PU.1. We also discuss the current therapeutic strategies targeting proliferation to modulate microglia-associated neuroinflammation and their potential impact on peripheral immune cell populations in the short and long-term. Understanding the effects of immunomodulatory approaches on microglia and other immune cell types might be critical for developing specific, effective, and safe therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Single neurons, as the basic unit of the brain, consist of a cell body and processes, including dendrites and axons. Even neurons of the same type show various subtle process characteristics to fit into the diverse neural circuits. Different cell types of neurons form complicated circuits in the brain. Therefore, detailed neuronal morphology is required to understand normal neuronal function and pathological mechanisms, such as those that occur in autism. Here, we developed a strategy to sparsely label the same type of neurons throughout the whole brain and tested its application in an autistic animal model—Shank3 knockout (KO) mice. To achieve this, we designed an adeno-associated virus (AAV) that expresses Cre recombinase-dependent regular and membrane-targeted enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under a human synapsin 1 promoter and verified it in several Cre transgenic mice. We could sparsely label the projection neurons in multiple brain areas by retro-ocular injection of the virus into CaMKIIα-Cre mice. Then, we analyzed the morphology of the projection neurons in Shank3 KO mice with this method. We found differential dendritic complexity and dendritic spine changes in projection neurons in Shank3 KO mice crossed with CaMKIIα-Cre mice compared with littermate control mice in the striatum, cortex, and hippocampus. By combining this method with various Cre mouse lines crossed with mouse models of disease, we can screen the morphological traits of distinct types of neurons throughout the whole brain that will help us to understand the exact role of the specific cell types of neurons not only in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) mouse models but also in other psychiatric disorder mouse models.</p>

<p>Successful completion of sensory decision-making requires focusing on relevant stimuli, adequate signal/noise ratio for stimulus discrimination, and stimulus valence evaluation. Different brain regions are postulated to play a role in these computations; however, evidence suggests that sensory and decision-making circuits are required to interact through a common neuronal pathway to elicit a context-adequate behavioral response. Recently, the basal forebrain (BF) region has emerged as a good candidate, since its heterogeneous projecting neurons innervate most of the cortical mantle and sensory processing circuits modulating different aspects of the sensory decision-making process. Moreover, evidence indicates that the BF plays an important role in attention and in fast modulation of neuronal activity that enhance visual and olfactory sensory perception. Here, we study in awake mice the involvement of BF in initiation and completion of trials in a reward-driven olfactory detection task. Using tetrode recordings, we find that BF neurons (including cholinergics) are recruited during sensory discrimination, reward, and interestingly slightly before trial initiation in successful discrimination trials. The precue neuronal activity was correlated with animal performance, indicating that this circuit could play an important role in adaptive context-dependent behavioral responses.</p>

<p>Gestational exposure to valproic acid (VPA) is known to cause behavioral deficits of sociability, matching similar alterations in human autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Available data are scarce on the neuromorphological changes in VPA-exposed animals. Here, we focused on alterations of the dopaminergic system, which is implicated in motivation and reward, with relevance to social cohesion. Whole brains from 7-day-old mice born to mothers given a single injection of VPA (400 mg/kg b.wt.) on E13.5 were immunostained against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). They were scanned using the iDISCO method with a laser light-sheet microscope, and the reconstructed images were analyzed in 3D for quantitative morphometry. A marked reduction of mesotelencephalic (MT) axonal fascicles together with a widening of the MT tract were observed in VPA treated mice, while other major brain tracts appeared anatomically intact. We also found a reduction in the abundance of dopaminergic ventral tegmental (VTA) neurons, accompanied by diminished tissue level of DA in ventrobasal telencephalic regions (including the nucleus accumbens (NAc), olfactory tubercle, BST, substantia innominata). Such a reduction of DA was not observed in the non-limbic caudate-putamen. Conversely, the abundance of TH+ cells in the substantia nigra (SN) was increased, presumably due to a compensatory mechanism or to an altered distribution of TH+ neurons occupying the SN and the VTA. The findings suggest that defasciculation of the MT tract and neuronal loss in VTA, followed by diminished dopaminergic input to the ventrobasal telencephalon at a critical time point of embryonic development (E13-E14) may hinder the patterning of certain brain centers underlying decision making and sociability.</p>

<p>Background: The imbalance between the production and clearance of alpha-synuclein and its consequent accumulation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The diminished clearance of alpha-synuclein may be partly attributable to impaired interstitial fluid, which can be reflected by the extent of dilated perivascular space (dPVS).

The dPVS was evaluated in different brain regions on axial T2-weighted images, and dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging data was used to elucidate the extent of dopaminergic neuronal degeneration. Patients with PD were further divided into two groups (SN + PD and SN − PD groups) according to whether dPVS was observed in the substantia nigra (SN). DAT uptake values and clinical scales were compared between the patients with PD and HCs and against dPVS scores. We also investigated the correlation between baseline dPVS scores and longitudinal DAT changes.</p><p>Results: Relative to the HCs, patients with PD had more dPVS in the SN and basal ganglia (BG). PD patients with dPVS in the SN region exhibited greater expression of tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid (P = 0.038) and a trend towards decreased DAT binding (P = 0.086) relative to those without SN dPVS. No correlations were found between dPVS scores and DAT uptake values or between dPVS scores and longitudinal DAT changes.</p><p>Conclusion: The dPVS in the SN of patients with PD may reflect the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and the appearance of α-synuclein insoluble aggregates known as Lewy bodies. Neurodegeneration is accompanied by neuroinflammation mediated by cytokines and chemokines produced by the activated microglia. Several studies demonstrated that such an inflammatory process is an early event, and contributes to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunctions. α-synuclein fibrillization and aggregation activate microglia and contribute to disease onset and progression. Mutations in different genes exacerbate the inflammatory phenotype in the monogenic compared to sporadic forms of PD. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) with selected radiopharmaceuticals allow in vivo imaging of molecular modifications in the brain of living subjects. Several publications showed a reduction of dopaminergic terminals and dopamine (DA) content in the basal ganglia, starting from the early stages of the disease. Moreover, non-dopaminergic neuronal pathways are also affected, as shown by in vivo studies with serotonergic and glutamatergic radiotracers. The role played by the immune system during illness progression could be investigated with PET ligands that target the microglia/macrophage Translocator protein (TSPO) receptor. These agents have been used in PD patients and rodent models, although often without attempting correlations with other molecular or functional parameters. For example, neurodegeneration and brain plasticity can be monitored using the metabolic marker 2-Deoxy-2-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoroglucose ([<sup>18</sup>F]-FDG), while oxidative stress can be probed using the copper-labeled diacetyl-bis(N-methyl-thiosemicarbazone) ([Cu]-ATSM) radioligand, whose striatal-specific binding ratio in PD patients seems to correlate with a disease rating scale and motor scores. Also, structural and functional modifications during disease progression may be evaluated by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), using different parameters as iron content or cerebral volume. In this review article, we propose an overview of in vivo clinical and non-clinical imaging research on neuroinflammation as an emerging marker of early PD. We also discuss how multimodal-imaging approaches could provide more insights into the role of the inflammatory process and related events in PD development.</p>

Introduction<p>While Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is divided into severity stages, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remains a solitary construct despite clinical and prognostic heterogeneity. This study aimed to characterize differences in genetic, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), neuroimaging, and neuropsychological markers across clinician-derived MCI stages.</p>Methods<p>Vanderbilt Memory &amp; Aging Project participants with MCI were categorized into 3 severity subtypes at screening based on neuropsychological assessment, functional assessment, and Clinical Dementia Rating interview, including mild (n = 18, 75 ± 8 years), moderate (n = 89 72 ± 7 years), and severe subtypes (n = 18, 78 ± 8 years). At enrollment, participants underwent neuropsychological testing, 3T brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and optional fasting lumbar puncture to obtain CSF. Neuropsychological testing and MRI were repeated at 18-months, 3-years, and 5-years with a mean follow-up time of 3.3 years. Ordinary least square regressions examined cross-sectional associations between MCI severity and apolipoprotein E (APOE)-ε4 status, CSF biomarkers of amyloid beta (Aβ), phosphorylated tau, total tau, and synaptic dysfunction (neurogranin), baseline neuroimaging biomarkers, and baseline neuropsychological performance. Longitudinal associations between baseline MCI severity and neuroimaging and neuropsychological trajectory were assessed using linear mixed effects models with random intercepts and slopes and a follow-up time interaction. Analyses adjusted for baseline age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and intracranial volume for MRI models.</p>Results<p>Stages differed at baseline on APOE-ε4 status (early &lt; middle = late; p-values &lt; 0.03) and CSF Aβ (early &gt; middle = late), phosphorylated and total tau (early = middle &lt; late; p-values &lt; 0.05), and neurogranin concentrations (early = middle &lt; late; p-values &lt; 0.05). MCI stage related to greater longitudinal cognitive decline, hippocampal atrophy, and inferior lateral ventricle dilation (early &lt; late; p-values &lt; 0.03).</p>Discussion<p>Clinician staging of MCI severity yielded longitudinal cognitive trajectory and structural neuroimaging differences in regions susceptible to AD neuropathology and neurodegeneration. As expected, participants with more severe MCI symptoms at study entry had greater cognitive decline and gray matter atrophy over time. Differences are likely attributable to baseline differences in amyloidosis, tau, and synaptic dysfunction. MCI staging may provide insight into underlying pathology, prognosis, and therapeutic targets.</p>

<p>Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the early phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of early intervention for MCI is to decrease the rate of conversion from MCI to AD. However, the efficacy of multiple interventions in MCI, and the optimal methods of delivery, remain controversial. We aimed to compare and rank the treatment methods for MCI in AD, in order to find an optimal intervention for MCI and a way to prevent or delay the occurrence of AD.</p><p>Methods: Pair-wise and network meta-analysis were conducted to integrate the treatment effectiveness through direct and indirect evidence. Four English databases and three Chinese databases were searched for international registers of eligible published, single or double blind, randomized controlled trials up to September 31st 2019. We included nine comparative interventions: pharmacological therapies which incorporated cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI), ginkgo, nimodipine, and Chinese medicine; non-pharmacological therapies comprising of acupuncture, music therapy, exercise therapy, and nutrition therapy; and a placebo group. The primary outcome was the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. The secondary outcome was the AD Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog).</p><p>Results: Twenty-eight trials were eligible, including 6,863 participants. In the direct meta-analysis, as for the Mini-Mental State Examination scale, the ChEIs (MD: −0.38; 95% CI: −0.74, −0.01), Chinese medicine (MD: −0.31; 95% CI: −0.75, 0.13), exercise therapy (MD: −0.50; 95% CI: −0.65, −0.35), music therapy (MD: −1.71; 95% CI: −4.49, 1.07), were statistically more efficient than placebo. For AD Assessment Scalecognitive subscale outcome, ChEIs (MD: 1.20; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.68), Acupuncture (MD: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.28, 1.44), Chinese medicine (MD: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.73) and exercise (MD: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.73) were better than placebo. In the network meta-analysis, the MMSE outcome ranked music therapy (59%) as the best and Acupuncture (26%) as second. Nutrition and Ginkgo treatment had the lowest rank among all interventions. For ADAS-cog outcome, acupuncture (52) ranked the best.</p><p>Conclusion: Among the nine treatments studied, music therapy appears to be the best treatment for MCI, followed by acupuncture. Our study provides new insights into potential clinical treatments for MCI due to AD, and may aid the development of guidelines for MCI in AD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57663">Diverse nucleosome site-selectivity among histone deacetylase complexes</a></h4>

Histone acetylation regulates chromatin structure and gene expression and is removed by histone deacetylases (HDACs). HDACs are commonly found in various protein complexes to confer distinct cellular functions, but how the multi-subunit complexes influence deacetylase activities and site-selectivities in chromatin is poorly understood. Previously we reported the results of studies on the HDAC1 containing CoREST complex and acetylated nucleosome substrates which revealed a notable preference for deacetylation of histone H3 acetyl-Lys9 vs. acetyl-Lys14 (M. Wu et al, 2018). Here we analyze the enzymatic properties of five class I HDAC complexes: CoREST, NuRD, Sin3B, MiDAC and SMRT with site-specific acetylated nucleosome substrates. Our results demonstrate that these HDAC complexes show a wide variety of deacetylase rates in a site-selective manner. A Gly13 in the histone H3 tail is responsible for a sharp reduction in deacetylase activity of the CoREST complex for H3K14ac. These studies provide a framework for connecting enzymatic and biological functions of specific HDAC complexes.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56942">Flexible motor sequence generation during stereotyped escape responses</a></h4>

Complex animal behaviors arise from a flexible combination of stereotyped motor primitives. Here we use the escape responses of the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> to study how a nervous system dynamically explores the action space. The initiation of the escape responses is predictable: the animal moves away from a potential threat, a mechanical or thermal stimulus. But the motor sequence and the timing that follow are variable. We report that a feedforward excitation between neurons encoding distinct motor states underlies robust motor sequence generation, while mutual inhibition between these neurons controls the flexibility of timing in a motor sequence. Electrical synapses contribute to feedforward coupling whereas glutamatergic synapses contribute to inhibition. We conclude that <i>C. elegans</i> generates robust and flexible motor sequences by combining an excitatory coupling and a winner-take-all operation via mutual inhibition between motor modules.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55913">An image-based data-driven analysis of cellular architecture in a developing tissue</a></h4>

Quantitative microscopy is becoming increasingly crucial in efforts to disentangle the complexity of organogenesis, yet adoption of the potent new toolbox provided by modern data science has been slow, primarily because it is often not directly applicable to developmental imaging data. We tackle this issue with a newly developed algorithm that uses point cloud-based morphometry to unpack the rich information encoded in 3D image data into a straightforward numerical representation. This enabled us to employ data science tools, including machine learning, to analyze and integrate cell morphology, intracellular organization, gene expression and annotated contextual knowledge. We apply these techniques to construct and explore a quantitative atlas of cellular architecture for the zebrafish posterior lateral line primordium, an experimentally tractable model of complex self-organized organogenesis. In doing so, we are able to retrieve both previously established and novel biologically relevant patterns, demonstrating the potential of our data-driven approach.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55438">Mechanisms of nucleotide selection by telomerase</a></h4>

Telomerase extends telomere sequences at chromosomal ends to protect genomic DNA. During this process it must select the correct nucleotide from a pool of nucleotides with various sugars and base pairing properties, which is critically important for the proper capping of telomeric sequences by shelterin. Unfortunately, how telomerase selects correct nucleotides is unknown. Here, we determined structures of <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) throughout its catalytic cycle and mapped the active site residues responsible for nucleoside selection, metal coordination, triphosphate binding, and RNA template stabilization. We found that TERT inserts a mismatch or ribonucleotide ~1 in 10,000 and ~1 in 14,000 insertion events, respectively. At biological ribonucleotide concentrations, these rates translate to ~40 ribonucleotides inserted per 10 kilobases. Human telomerase assays determined a conserved tyrosine steric gate regulates ribonucleotide insertion into telomeres. Cumulatively, our work provides insight into how telomerase selects the proper nucleotide to maintain telomere integrity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51779">TGFβ signaling is required for tenocyte recruitment and functional neonatal tendon regeneration</a></h4>

Tendon injuries are common with poor healing potential. The paucity of therapies for tendon injuries is due to our limited understanding of the cells and molecular pathways that drive tendon regeneration. Using a mouse model of neonatal tendon regeneration, we identified TGFβ signaling as a major molecular pathway that drives neonatal tendon regeneration. Through targeted gene deletion, small molecule inhibition, and lineage tracing, we elucidated TGFβ-dependent and  TGFβ-independent mechanisms underlying tendon regeneration. Importantly, functional recovery depended on canonical TGFβ signaling and loss of function is due to impaired tenogenic cell recruitment from both <i>Scleraxis</i>-lineage and non-<i>Scleraxis</i>-lineage sources.  We show that TGFβ signaling is directly required in neonatal tenocytes for recruitment and that TGFβ ligand is positively regulated in tendons. Collectively, these results show a functional role for canonical TGFβ signaling in tendon regeneration and offer new insights toward the divergent cellular activities that distinguish regenerative vs fibrotic healing.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated during physiological bouts of synaptic activity and as a consequence of pathological conditions in the central nervous system. How neurons respond to and distinguish between ROS in these different contexts is currently unknown. In Drosophila mutants with enhanced JNK activity, lower levels of ROS are observed and these animals are resistant to both changes in ROS and changes in synapse morphology induced by oxidative stress. In wild type flies, disrupting JNK-AP-1 signalling perturbs redox homeostasis suggesting JNK activity positively regulates neuronal antioxidant defense. We validated this hypothesis in mammalian neurons, finding that JNK activity regulates the expression of the antioxidant gene Srxn-1, in a c-Jun dependent manner. We describe a conserved 'adaptive' role for neuronal JNK in the maintenance of redox homeostasis that is relevant to several neurodegenerative diseases.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting motoneurons in a motor-unit (MU) dependent manner. Glial dysfunction contributes to numerous aspects of the disease. At the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), early alterations in perisynaptic Schwann cell (PSC), glial cells at this synapse, may impact their ability to regulate NMJ stability and repair. Indeed, muscarinic receptors (mAChR) regulate the repair phenotype of PSCs and are overactivated at disease-resistant NMJs (Soleus muscle) in SOD1G37R mice. However, it remains unknown whether this is the case at disease-vulnerable NMJs and whether it translates into an impairment of PSC-dependent repair mechanisms. We used Soleus and Sternomastoid muscles from SOD1G37R mice and performed Ca2+-imaging to monitor PSC activity and used immunohistochemistry to analyze their repair and phagocytic properties. We show that PSC mAChR-dependent activity was transiently increased at disease-vulnerable NMJs (Sternomastoid muscle). Furthermore, PSCs from both muscles extended disorganized processes from denervated NMJs and failed to initiate or guide nerve terminal sprouts at disease-vulnerable NMJs, a phenomenon essential for compensatory reinnervation. This was accompanied by a failure of numerous PSCs to upregulate Galectin-3 (MAC-2), a marker of glial axonal debris phagocytosis, upon NMJ denervation in SOD1 mice. Finally, differences in these PSC-dependent NMJ repair mechanisms were MU-type dependent, thus reflecting MU vulnerability in ALS. Together, these results reveal that neuron-glia communication is ubiquitously altered at the NMJ in ALS. This appears to prevent PSCs from adopting a repair phenotype, resulting in a maladapted response to denervation at the NMJ in ALS.

Auditory de-afferentation, a permanent reduction in the number of inner-hair-cells and auditory-nerve synapses due to cochlear synaptopathy or damage, can reliably be quantified using temporal bone histology and immunostaining. There is, however, an urgent need for non-invasive markers of synaptopathy to study its perceptual consequences in live humans and to develop effective therapeutic interventions. While animal studies have identified candidate auditory-evoked-potential (AEP) based markers for synaptopathy, their interpretation in humans has suffered from translational issues related to neural generator differences, unknown hearing-damage histopathologies or measurement sensitivity. To render AEP-based markers of synaptopathy more robust and differential to the synaptopathy aspect of sensorineural hearing loss, we followed a combined computational and experimental approach. Starting from the known characteristics of auditory-nerve physiology, we optimized the stimulus envelope for envelope-following-responses (EFRs) to optimally and synchronously stimulate the available auditory-nerve population and consequently generate a strong AEP. We additionally used model simulations to explore which stimuli evoked a response which was sensitive to synaptopathy, while being insensitive to possible co-existing outer-hair-cell pathologies. We compared the model-predicted trends to AEPs recorded in younger and older listeners (N=44, 24f) who either had normal or impaired audiograms. We conclude that optimal stimulation paradigms for EFR-based quantification of synaptopathy should have sharply rising envelope shapes, a minimal plateau duration of 1.7-2.1 ms for a 120 Hz modulation rate, and inter-peak intervals which contain near-zero amplitudes. From our recorded conditions, the optimal EFR-evoking stimulus had a rectangular envelope shape with a 25% duty cycle and a 95% modulation depth.

Spatial memory has been closely related to the medial temporal lobe (MTL), and theta-oscillations are thought to play a key role. However, it remains difficult to investigate medio-temporal lobe (MTL) activation related to spatial memory with non-invasive electrophysiological methods in humans. Here, we combined the virtual delayed-matching-to-place (DMP) task, reverse-translated from the watermaze DMP task in rats, with high-density electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. Healthy young volunteers performed this computerised task in a virtual circular arena, which contained a hidden target whose location moved to a new place every four trials, allowing the assessment of rapid memory formation. Using behavioural measures as predictor variables for source reconstructed frequency specific EEG power, we found that inter-individual differences in search preference during probe trials, a measure of 1-trial place learning known from rodent studies to be particularly hippocampus dependent, correlated predominantly with distinct theta-band oscillations (approx. 7 Hz), particularly in the right temporal lobe, the right striatum and inferior occipital cortex or cerebellum. Notably, this pattern was found with very high consistency during both encoding and retrieval/expression, but not in control analyses and could not be explained by motor confounds. Alpha-activity in sensorimotor and parietal cortex contralateral to the hand used for navigation also correlated with search preference, which likely reflected movement-related factors associated with task performance. Relating inter-individual differences in ongoing brain activity to behaviour in a continuous rapid place learning task that is suitable for a variety of populations, we could demonstrate that memory related theta-band activity in temporal lobe can be measured with EEG recordings, revealing a presumed network of MTL, striatum and cerebellum and/or inferior occipital cortex that may interact through theta oscillations. This approach holds great potential for further studies investigating the interactions within this network during encoding and retrieval, as well as neuromodulatory impacts and age-related changes.

The structure of the adult brain is the result of complex physical mechanisms acting through development. Accordingly, the brain's spatial embedding plays a key role in its structural and functional organization, including the gradient-like patterning of gene expression that encodes the molecular underpinning of functional specialization. But we do not understand how this transcriptional heterogeneity is spatially organized across the major alterations in brain geometry that occur through development. Here we investigate the spatial embedding of transcriptional patterns of over 1800 genes across seven time points through mouse-brain development using data from the Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas. We find that transcriptional similarity decreases exponentially with distance across all developmental time points, with a correlation length scale that satisfies a power-law scaling relationship with a linear dimension of brain size. This scaling suggests that the mouse brain achieves a characteristic spatial balance between local transcriptional similarity (within functionally specialized brain areas) and longer-range diversity (between functionally specialized brain areas) throughout its development. Extrapolating this mouse-developmental scaling relationship to predict the correlation length of gene expression in the human cortex yields a slight overestimate, consistent with the human cortex being more molecularly diverse and functionally specialized than the mouse brain. We develop a simple model of brain growth as spatially autocorrelated gene-expression gradients that expand through development, which captures key features of the mouse developmental data. Complementing the well-known exponential distance rule for structural connectivity, our findings thus characterize an exponential distance rule for transcriptional gradients that scales across mouse-brain development, providing new understanding of the molecular patterns underlying the functional specialization in the brain.

Social isolation is a growing public health concern across the lifespan. Specifically, isolation early in life, during critical periods of brain development, increases the risk of psychiatric disorders later in life. Previous studies of isolation models in mice have shown distinct neurological abnormalities in various regions of the brain, but the mechanism linking the experience of isolation to these phenotypes is unclear. In this study, we show that {Delta}FosB, a long-lived transcription factor associated with chronic stress responses and drug-induced neuroplasticity, is upregulated in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of adult C57BL/6J mice isolated for two weeks post-weaning. Additionally, a related transcription factor, FosB, is also increased in the medial prefrontal cortex in socially isolated females. These results show that short-term isolation during the critical post-weaning period has long-lasting and sex-dependent effects on gene expression in brain.

Multiphoton microscopy has emerged as the primary imaging tool for studying the structural and functional dynamics of neural circuits in brain tissue, which is highly scattering to light. Recently, three-photon microscopy has enabled high-resolution fluorescence imaging of neurons in deeper brain areas that lie beyond the reach of conventional two-photon microscopy, which is typically limited to ~450 microns. Three-photon imaging of neuronal calcium signals, through the genetically-encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6, has been used to successfully record neuronal activity in deeper neocortical layers and parts of the hippocampus. Bulk-loading cells in deeper cortical layers with synthetic calcium indicators could provide an alternative strategy for labelling that obviates dependence on viral tropism and promoter penetration. Here we report a strategy for visualized injection of a calcium dye, Oregon Green BAPTA-1 AM (OGB-1 AM), at 500-600 microns below the surface of the mouse visual cortex in vivo. We demonstrate successful OGB-1 AM loading of cells in cortical layers 5-6 and subsequent three-photon imaging of orientation- and direction- selective visual responses from these cells.

Ventral pallidum (VP) neurons scale firing increases to reward value and decrease firing to aversive cues. Anatomical connectivity suggests a critical role for the VP in threat-related behavior. Here we tested whether firing decreases in VP neurons conform to relative threat by recording single units while male rats discriminated cues predicting unique foot shock probabilities. Rats behavior and VP single unit firing discriminated danger, uncertainty and safety cues. We found that two VP populations (Low firing and Intermediate firing) signaled relative threat, proportionally decreased firing according shock probability: danger &lt; uncertainty &lt; safety. Low firing neurons showed reward firing increases, consistent with a general signal for relative value. Intermediate firing neurons were unresponsive to reward, revealing a specific signal for relative threat. The results suggest an integral role for the VP in threat-related behavior.

Working memory (WM) is an online memory system that is critical for holding information in a rapidly accessible state during ongoing cognitive processing. Thus, there is strong value in methods that provide a temporally-resolved index of WM load. While univariate EEG signals have been identified that vary with WM load, recent advances in multivariate analytic approaches suggest that there may be rich sources of information that do not generate reliable univariate signatures. Here, using data from 4 published studies (n = 286 and &gt;250,000 trials), we demonstrate that multivariate analysis of EEG voltage topography provides a sensitive index of the number of items stored in WM that generalizes to novel human observers. Moreover, multivariate load detection can provide robust information at the single-trial level, exceeding the sensitivity of extant univariate approaches. We show that this method tracks WM load in a manner that is (1) independent of the spatial position of the memoranda, (2) precise enough to differentiate item-by-item increments in the number of stored items, (3) generalizable across distinct tasks and stimulus displays and (4) correlated with individual differences in WM behavior. Thus, this approach provides a powerful complement to univariate analytic approaches, enabling temporally-resolved tracking of online memory storage in humans.

Oscillations in the beta/low gamma range (10-45 Hz) are recorded in diverse neural structures. They have successfully been modeled as sparsely synchronized oscillations arising from reciprocal interactions between randomly connected excitatory (E) pyramidal cells and local interneurons (I). The synchronization of spatially distant oscillatory spiking E-I modules has been well studied in the rate model framework but less so for modules of spiking neurons. Here, we first show that previously proposed modifications of rate models provide a quantitative description of spiking E-I modules of Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (EIF) neurons. This allows us to analyze the dynamical regimes of sparsely synchronized oscillatory E-I modules connected by long-range excitatory interactions, for two modules, as well as for a chain of such modules. For modules with a large number of neurons (&gt;105), we obtain results similar to previously obtained ones based on the classic deterministic Wilson-Cowan rate model, with the added bonus that the results quantitatively describe simulations of spiking EIF neurons. However, for modules with a moderate (~104) number of neurons, stochastic variations in the spike emission of neurons are important and need to be taken into account. On the one hand, they modify the oscillations in a way that tends to promote synchronization between different modules. On the other hand, independent fluctuations on different modules tend to disrupt synchronization. The correlations between distant oscillatory modules can be described by stochastic equations for the oscillator phases that have been intensely studied in other contexts. On shorter distances, we develop a description that also takes into account amplitude modes and that quantitatively accounts for our simulation data. Stochastic dephasing of neighboring modules produces transient phase gradients and the transient appearance of phase waves. We propose that these stochastically-induced phase waves provide an explanative framework for the observations of traveling waves in the cortex during beta oscillations.

Targeted sequencing of genomic regions is a cost- and time-efficient approach for screening patient cohorts. We present a fast and efficient workflow to analyze highly imbalanced, targeted next-generation sequencing data generated using molecular inversion probe (MIP) capture. Our Snakemake pipeline performs sample demultiplexing, overlap paired-end merging, alignment, MIP-arm trimming, variant calling, coverage analysis and report generation. Further, we support the analysis of probes specifically designed to capture certain structural variants and can assign sex using Y-chromosome-unique probes. In a user-friendly HTML report, we summarize all these results including covered, incomplete or missing regions, called variants and their predicted effects. We developed and tested our pipeline using the hemophilia A &amp; B MIP design from the “My Life, Our Future” initiative.

<p>by Federico Sevlever, Juan Pablo Di Bella, Alejandra C. Ventura</p>

Negative cooperativity is a phenomenon in which the binding of a first ligand or substrate molecule decreases the rate of subsequent binding. This definition is not exclusive to ligand-receptor binding, it holds whenever two or more molecules undergo two successive binding events. Negative cooperativity turns the binding curve more graded and cannot be distinguished from two independent and different binding events based on equilibrium measurements only. The need of kinetic data for this purpose was already reported. Here, we study the binding response as a function of the amount of ligand, at different times, from very early times since ligand is added and until equilibrium is reached. Over those binding curves measured at different times, we compute the dynamic range: the fold change required in input to elicit a change from 10 to 90% of maximum output, finding that it evolves in time differently and controlled by different parameters in the two situations that are identical in equilibrium. Deciphering which is the microscopic model that leads to a given binding curve adds understanding on the molecular mechanisms at play, and thus, is a valuable tool. The methods developed in this article were tested both with simulated and experimental data, showing to be robust to noise and experimental constraints.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oqA0bKDI_Zg" width="1" />

<p>by Jan Domański, Mark S. P. Sansom, Phillip J. Stansfeld, Robert B. Best</p>

Transmembrane helix association is a fundamental step in the folding of helical membrane proteins. The prototypical example of this association is formation of the glycophorin dimer. While its structure and stability have been well-characterized experimentally, the detailed assembly mechanism is harder to obtain. Here, we use all-atom simulations within phospholipid membrane to study glycophorin association. We find that initial association results in the formation of a non-native intermediate, separated by a significant free energy barrier from the dimer with a native binding interface. We have used transition-path sampling to determine the association mechanism. We find that the mechanism of the initial bimolecular association to form the intermediate state can be mediated by many possible contacts, but seems to be particularly favoured by formation of non-native contacts between the C-termini of the two helices. On the other hand, the contacts which are key to determining progression from the intermediate to the native state are those which define the native binding interface, reminiscent of the role played by native contacts in determining folding of globular proteins. As a check on the simulations, we have computed association and dissociation rates from the transition-path sampling. We obtain results in reasonable accord with available experimental data, after correcting for differences in native state stability. Our results yield an atomistic description of the mechanism for a simple prototype of helical membrane protein folding.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1Sn_ospOBpI" width="1" />

<p>by Abolfazl Ramezanpour, Alireza Mashaghi</p>

We study the time evolution of symptoms (signs) with some defects in the dynamics of a reaction network as a (microscopic) model for the progress of disease phenotypes. To this end, we take a large population of reaction networks and follow the stochastic dynamics of the system to see how the development of defects affects the macroscopic states of the signs probability distribution. We start from some plausible definitions for the healthy and disease states along with a dynamical model for the emergence of diseases by a reverse simulated annealing algorithm. The healthy state is defined as a state of maximum objective function, which here is the sum of mutual information between a subset of signal variables and the subset of assigned response variables. A disease phenotype is defined with two parameters controlling the rate of mutations in reactions and the rate of accepting mutations that reduce the objective function. The model can provide the time dependence of the sign probabilities given a disease phenotype. This allows us to obtain the accuracy of diagnosis as a function of time by using a probabilistic model of signs and diseases. The trade-off between the diagnosis accuracy (increasing in time) and the objective function (decreasing in time) can be used to suggest an optimal time for medical intervention. Our model would be useful in particular for a dynamical (history-based) diagnostic problem, to estimate the likelihood of a disease hypothesis given the temporal evolution of the signs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XR2oyGCJvwU" width="1" />

<p>by Zhenxing Wu, Kai Zhao</p>

Most sensory systems are remarkable in their temporal precision, reflected in such phrases as “a flash of light” or “a twig snap”. Yet taste is complicated by the transport processes of stimuli through the papilla matrix to reach taste receptors, processes that are poorly understood. We computationally modeled the surface of the human tongue as a microfiber porous medium and found that time-concentration profiles within the papilla zone rise with significant delay that well match experimental ratings of perceived taste intensity to a range of sweet and salty stimuli for both rapid pulses and longer sip-and-hold exposures. Diffusivity of these taste stimuli, determined mostly by molecular size, correlates greatly with time and slope to reach peak intensity: smaller molecular size may lead to quicker taste perception. Our study demonstrates the novelty of modeling the human tongue as a porous material to drastically simplify computational approaches and that peripheral transport processes may significantly affect the temporal profile of taste perception, at least to sweet and salty compounds.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KX7gG3hdNbw" width="1" />

<p>by Luke Sargent, Yating Liu, Wilson Leung, Nathan T. Mortimer, David Lopatto, Jeremy Goecks, Sarah C. R. Elgin</p>

Scientists are sequencing new genomes at an increasing rate with the goal of associating genome contents with phenotypic traits. After a new genome is sequenced and assembled, structural gene annotation is often the first step in analysis. Despite advances in computational gene prediction algorithms, most eukaryotic genomes still benefit from manual gene annotation. This requires access to good genome browsers to enable annotators to visualize and evaluate multiple lines of evidence (e.g., sequence similarity, RNA sequencing [RNA-Seq] results, gene predictions, repeats) and necessitates many volunteers to participate in the work. To address the technical barriers to creating genome browsers, the Genomics Education Partnership (GEP; https://gep.wustl.edu/) has partnered with the Galaxy Project (https://galaxyproject.org) to develop G-OnRamp (http://g-onramp.org), a web-based platform for creating UCSC Genome Browser Assembly Hubs and JBrowse genome browsers. G-OnRamp also converts a JBrowse instance into an Apollo instance for collaborative genome annotations in research and educational settings. The genome browsers produced can be transferred to the CyVerse Data Store for long-term access. G-OnRamp enables researchers to easily visualize their experimental results, educators to create Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) centered on genome annotation, and students to participate in genomics research. In the process, students learn about genes/genomes and about how to utilize large datasets. Development of G-OnRamp was guided by extensive user feedback. Sixty-five researchers/educators from &gt;40 institutions participated through in-person workshops, which produced &gt;20 genome browsers now available for research and education. Genome browsers generated for four parasitoid wasp species have been used in a CURE engaging students at 15 colleges and universities. Our assessment results in the classroom demonstrate that the genome browsers produced by G-OnRamp are effective tools for engaging undergraduates in research and in enabling their contributions to the scientific literature in genomics. Expansion of such genomics research/education partnerships will be beneficial to researchers, faculty, and students alike.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZONxdZNiNI0" width="1" />

<p>by Dirke Imig, Nadine Pollak, Frank Allgöwer, Markus Rehm</p>

Apoptotic cell death can be initiated through the extrinsic and intrinsic signaling pathways. While cell cycle progression promotes the responsiveness to intrinsic apoptosis induced by genotoxic stress or spindle poisons, this has not yet been studied conclusively for extrinsic apoptosis. Here, we combined fluorescence-based time-lapse monitoring of cell cycle progression and cell death execution by long-term time-lapse microscopy with sampling-based mathematical modeling to study cell cycle dependency of TRAIL-induced extrinsic apoptosis in NCI-H460/geminin cells. In particular, we investigated the interaction of cell death timing and progression of cell cycle states. We not only found that TRAIL prolongs cycle progression, but in reverse also that cell cycle progression affects the kinetics of TRAIL-induced apoptosis: Cells exposed to TRAIL in G<sub>1</sub> died significantly faster than cells stimulated in S/G<sub>2</sub>/M. The connection between cell cycle state and apoptosis progression was captured by developing a mathematical model, for which parameter estimation revealed that apoptosis progression decelerates in the second half of the cell cycle. Similar results were also obtained when studying HCT-116 cells. Our results therefore reject the null hypothesis of independence between cell cycle progression and extrinsic apoptosis and, supported by simulations and experiments of synchronized cell populations, suggest that unwanted escape from TRAIL-induced apoptosis can be reduced by enriching the fraction of cells in G<sub>1</sub> phase. Besides novel insight into the interrelation of cell cycle progression and extrinsic apoptosis signaling kinetics, our findings are therefore also relevant for optimizing future TRAIL-based treatment strategies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LkmNTZ3OmGA" width="1" />

<p>by Raphael Vallat, Vyoma D. Shah, Susan Redline, Peter Attia, Matthew P. Walker</p>

Why does poor-quality sleep lead to atherosclerosis? In a diverse sample of over 1,600 individuals, we describe a pathway wherein sleep fragmentation raises inflammatory-related white blood cell counts (neutrophils and monocytes), thereby increasing atherosclerosis severity, even when other common risk factors have been accounted for. Improving sleep quality may thus represent one preventive strategy for lowering inflammatory status and thus atherosclerosis risk, reinforcing public health policies focused on sleep health.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Jgmps9lVGhE" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Early childhood is characterized by vast changes in behaviors supported by the hippocampus and an increased susceptibility of the hippocampus to environmental influences. Thus, it is an important time to investigate the development of the hippocampus. Existing research suggests subregions of the hippocampus (i.e., head, body, tail) have dissociable functions and that the relations between subregions and cognitive abilities vary across development. However, longitudinal research examining age‐related changes in subregions in humans, particularly during early childhood (i.e., 4–6 years), is limited. Using a large sample of 184 healthy 4‐ to 8‐year‐old children, the present study is the first to characterize developmental changes in hippocampal subregion volume from early‐ to mid‐childhood. Results reveal differential developmental trajectories in hippocampal head, body, and tail during this period. Specifically, head volume showed a quadratic pattern of change, and both body and tail showed linear increases, resulting in a pattern of cubic change for total hippocampal volume. Further, main effects of sex on hippocampal volume (males &gt; females) and hemispheric differences in developmental trajectories were observed. These findings provide an improved understanding of the development of the hippocampus and have important implications for research investigating a range of cognitive abilities and behaviors.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25799?af=R">Radiologically Isolated Syndrome: 10‐Year Risk Estimate of a Clinical Event</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We have previously identified male sex, younger age, and the presence of spinal cord lesions as independent factors that increase the 5‐year risk for evolution from radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) to multiple sclerosis. We investigate here risk factors for the development of a clinical event using a 10‐year, multi‐national, retrospectively‐identified RIS dataset.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>RIS subjects were identified according to 2009 RIS criteria and longitudinally followed as part of a worldwide cohort study. We analyzed data from 21 individual databases from 5 different countries. Associations between clinical and MRI characteristics, and the risk of developing a first clinical event were determined using multivariate Cox regression models.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Additional follow‐up data was available in 277/451 RIS subjects (86% female). Mean age at RIS diagnosis was 37.2 y (range:11–74 y) with a median clinical follow‐up of 6.7 years. The cumulative probability of a first clinical event at 10 years was 51.2%. Age, positive CSF, infratentorial lesions on MRI, and spinal cord lesions, were baseline independent predictors associated with a subsequent clinical event. The presence of gadolinium enhancing lesions during follow‐up was also associated with the risk of a seminal event. Reason for MRI and gadolinium enhancing lesions at baseline did not influence the risk of a subsequent clinical event.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Approximately half of individuals with RIS experience a first clinical event within 10 years of the index MRI. The identification of independent predictors of risk for symptom onset may guide education and clinical management of individuals with RIS.</p>

<p>There is an unmet need to identify biomarkers sensitive to change in rare, slowly progressive neuromuscular diseases. Quantitative MRI of muscle may offer this opportunity, is non‐invasive and can be carried out almost independent of patient‐cooperation and disease severity.</p>
<p>Muscle fat content correlates with muscle function in neuromuscular diseases, and changes in fat content precede changes in function, which suggests that muscle MRI is a strong biomarker candidate to predict prognosis and treatment efficacy. In this paper, we review the evidence suggesting that muscle MRI may be an important biomarker for diagnosis and to monitor change in disease severity.</p>

<p>We screened 662 subjects comprising 462 essential tremor, ET (285 sporadic, 125 with family history and 52 probands from well‐characterized ET pedigrees and 200 controls and identified pathogenic <i>NOTCH2NLC </i> GGC repeat expansions in four sporadic ET patients. Two patients were followed up for over a decade: one with 90 repeats remained an ET phenotype that did not evolve after forty years, while another patient with 107 repeats developed motor symptoms and cognitive impairment after 8 to 10舁years. Neuroimaging in this patient revealed severe leukoencephalopathy; diffusion‐weighted imaging hyperintensity in the corticomedullary junction and skin biopsy revealed intranuclear inclusions suggestive of intranuclear inclusion body disease (NIID). No GGC repeats above 60舁units were detected in familial ET cases and controls, though four ET patients carried 47–53 “intermediate” repeats. <i>NOTCH2NLC </i> GGC repeat expansions can be associated with sporadic ET. Carriers presenting with a pure ET phenotype may or may not convert to NIID up to four decades after initial tremor onset.</p>

Objectives<p>Previous research has provided evidence that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can reduce severity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, the exact mechanism of this effect is still unknown. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy has demonstrated low levels of brain metabolites in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), amygdala, and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in individuals with ASD. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of anodal tDCS on social functioning of individuals with ASD, as measured by the social subscale of the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), through correlations between pretreatment and posttreatment concentrations of brain metabolites in the areas of interest (DLPFC, ACC, amygdala, and locus coeruleus) and scores on the ATEC social subscale.</p>Methods<p>Ten participants with ASD were administered 1 mA anodal tDCS to the left DLPFC for 20 min over five consecutive days. Measures of the ATEC social subscale and the concentrations of brain metabolites were performed before and immediately after the treatment.</p>Results<p>The results showed a significant decrease between pretreatment and immediately posttreatment in the ATEC social subscale scores, significant increases in N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) and myoinositol (mI)/Cr concentrations, and a decrease in choline (Cho)/Cr concentrations in the left DLPFC and locus coeruleus after tDCS treatment. Significant associations between decreased ATEC social subscale scores and changed concentrations in NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, and mI/Cr in the locus coeruleus were positive.</p>Conclusion<p>Findings suggest that beneficial effects of tDCS in ASD may be due to changes in neuronal and glia cell activity and synaptogenesis in the brain network of individuals with ASD. Further studies with larger sample sizes and control groups are warranted.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00556">LRRK2-Related Parkinson’s Disease Due to Altered Endolysosomal Biology With Variable Lewy Body Pathology: A Hypothesis</a></h4>

<p>Mutations in the gene encoding for leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are associated with both familial and sporadic Parkinson’s disease (PD). LRRK2 encodes a large protein comprised of a GTPase and a kinase domain. All pathogenic variants converge on enhancing LRRK2 kinase substrate phosphorylation, and distinct LRRK2 kinase inhibitors are currently in various stages of clinical trials. Although the precise pathophysiological functions of LRRK2 remain largely unknown, PD-associated mutants have been shown to alter various intracellular vesicular trafficking pathways, especially those related to endolysosomal protein degradation events. In addition, biochemical studies have identified a subset of Rab proteins, small GTPases required for all vesicular trafficking steps, as substrate proteins for the LRRK2 kinase activity in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the impact of such phosphorylation on neurodegenerative mechanisms underlying LRRK2-related PD, especially with respect to deregulated Rab-mediated endolysosomal membrane trafficking and protein degradation events. Surprisingly, a significant proportion of PD patients due to LRRK2 mutations display neuronal cell loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta in the absence of any apparent α-synuclein-containing Lewy body neuropathology. These findings suggest that endolysosomal alterations mediated by pathogenic LRRK2 per se are not sufficient to cause α-synuclein aggregation. Here, we will review current knowledge about the link between pathogenic LRRK2, Rab protein phosphorylation and endolysosomal trafficking alterations, and we will propose a testable working model whereby LRRK2-related PD may present with variable LB pathology.</p>

Objective<p>During presurgical evaluation for focal epilepsy patients, the evidence supporting the use of high frequency oscillations (HFOs) for delineating the epileptogenic zone (EZ) increased over the past decade. This study aims to develop and validate an integrated automatic detection, classification and imaging pipeline of HFOs with stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) to narrow the gap between HFOs quantitative analysis and clinical application.</p>Methods<p>The proposed pipeline includes stages of channel inclusion, candidate HFOs detection and automatic labeling with four trained convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers and HFOs sorting based on occurrence rate and imaging. We first evaluated the initial detector using an open simulated dataset. After that, we validated our full algorithm in a 20-patient cohort against three assumptions based on previous studies. Classified HFOs results were compared with seizure onset zone (SOZ) channels for their concordance. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the corresponding area under the curve (AUC) were calculated representing the prediction ability of the labeled HFOs outputs for SOZ.</p>Results<p>The initial detector demonstrated satisfactory performance on the simulated dataset. The four CNN classifiers converged quickly during training, and the accuracies on the validation dataset were above 95%. The localization value of HFOs was significantly improved by HFOs classification. The AUC values of the 20 testing patients increased after HFO classification, indicating a satisfactory prediction value of the proposed algorithm for EZ identification.</p>Conclusion<p>Our detector can provide robust HFOs analysis results revealing EZ at the individual level, which may ultimately push forward the transitioning of HFOs analysis into a meaningful part of the presurgical evaluation and surgical planning.</p>

<p>The fruit fly compound eye is a premier experimental system for modeling human neurodegenerative diseases. The disruption of the retinal geometry has been historically assessed using time-consuming and poorly reliable techniques such as histology or pseudopupil manual counting. Recent semiautomated quantification approaches rely either on manual region-of-interest delimitation or engineered features to estimate the extent of degeneration. This work presents a fully automated classification pipeline of bright-field images based on orientated gradient descriptors and machine learning techniques. An initial region-of-interest extraction is performed, applying morphological kernels and Euclidean distance-to-centroid thresholding. Image classification algorithms are trained on these regions (support vector machine, decision trees, random forest, and convolutional neural network), and their performance is evaluated on independent, unseen datasets. The combinations of oriented gradient + gaussian kernel Support Vector Machine [0.97 accuracy and 0.98 area under the curve (AUC)] and fine-tuned pre-trained convolutional neural network (0.98 accuracy and 0.99 AUC) yielded the best results overall. The proposed method provides a robust quantification framework that can be generalized to address the loss of regularity in biological patterns similar to the Drosophila eye surface and speeds up the processing of large sample batches.</p>

Background<p>We aimed to construct and validate a nomogram model based on the combination of radiomic features and satellite sign number for predicting intracerebral hematoma expansion.</p>Methods<p>A total of 129 patients from two institutions were enrolled in this study. The preprocessed initial CT images were used for radiomic feature extraction. The ANOVA-Kruskal–Wallis test and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression were applied to identify candidate radiomic features and construct the Radscore. A nomogram model was developed by integrating the Radscore with a satellite sign number. The discrimination performance of the proposed model was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the predictive accuracy was assessed via a calibration curve. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and Kaplan–Meier (KM) survival analysis were performed to evaluate the clinical value of the model.</p>Results<p>Four optimal features were ultimately selected and contributed to the Radscore construction. A positive correlation was observed between the satellite sign number and Radscore (Pearson’s r: 0.451). The nomogram model showed the best performance with high area under the curves in both training cohort (0.881, sensitivity: 0.973; specificity: 0.787) and external validation cohort (0.857, sensitivity: 0.950; specificity: 0.766). The calibration curve, DCA, and KM analysis indicated the high accuracy and clinical usefulness of the nomogram model for hematoma expansion prediction.</p>Conclusion<p>A nomogram model of integrated radiomic signature and satellite sign number based on noncontrast CT images could serve as a reliable and convenient measurement of hematoma expansion prediction.</p>

<p>Polyglutamine (polyQ) spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are the most prevalent subset of SCAs and share the aberrant expansion of Q-encoding CAG repeats within the coding sequences of disease-responsible genes as their common genetic cause. These polyQ SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, and SCA17) are inherited neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the progressive atrophy of the cerebellum and connected regions of the nervous system, which leads to loss of fine muscle movement coordination. Upon the expansion of polyQ repeats, the mutated proteins typically accumulate disproportionately in the neuronal nucleus, where they sequester various target molecules, including transcription factors and other nuclear proteins. However, it is not yet clearly understood how CAG repeat expansion takes place or how expanded polyQ proteins accumulate in the nucleus. In this article, we review the current knowledge on the molecular and cellular bases of nuclear proteotoxicity of polyQ proteins in SCAs and present our perspectives on the remaining issues surrounding these diseases.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00325">Multimodal MRI Longitudinal Assessment of White and Gray Matter in Different SPG Types of Hereditary Spastic Paraparesis</a></h4>

<p>Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) are a group of genetically and clinically heterogeneous neurologic disorders. Hereby we describe a relatively large group of patients (pts) affected by HSP studied at baseline (31 pts) and at follow-up (mean period 28.9 ± 8.4 months; 23 pts) with multimodal advanced MRI: high-resolution T1 images for voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). An age-matched healthy control (HC) group underwent the same neuroimaging protocol in a time schedule matched with the HSP patients. At baseline, VBM showed gray matter (GM) reduction in HSP in the right pre-frontal cortex and bilaterally in the thalami. MRS at baseline depicted in HSP patients compared to the HC group reduction of NAA/Cr ratio in the right pre-frontal region, increase of Cho/Cr ratio in the right pre-central regions, and increase of mI/Cr ratio on the left pre-central area. At cross-sectional follow-up analysis and longitudinal evaluation, no VBM and MRS statistically significant results were obtained. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis showed widespread DTI brain white matter (WM) alterations in patients compared to HC at baseline, which are characterized by reduction of fractional anisotropy (FA) and increase of mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity, as confirmed on cross-analysis of the follow-up dataset. A longitudinal analysis with TBSS in HSP patients did not show significant variations, while upon applying region-based analysis we found increased FA and decreased MD and AD in specific brain WM fiber complex during follow-up. The changes were not correlated with the clinical presentation (pure vs complicated HSP), motor function, and motility indexes or history of specific treatments (botulinum toxin). In conclusion, the cross-sectional analysis of the multiparametric MRI data in our HSP patients confirmed the non-prominent involvement of the cortex in the primary motor regions but rather of other more associative areas. On the contrary, DTI demonstrated a widespread involvement of the brain WM, including the primary motor regions, which was confirmed at follow-up. The longitudinal analysis revealed an apparent inversion of tendency when considering the expected evolution of a neurodegenerative process: we detected an increase of FA and a decrease of MD and AD. These time-related modifications may suggest a repair attempt by the residual central WM fibers, which requires confirmation with a larger group of patients and with a longer time interval.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00194">Neurophysiological Correlates of Gait in the Human Basal Ganglia and the PPN Region in Parkinson’s Disease</a></h4>

<p>This study aimed to characterize the neurophysiological correlates of gait in the human pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) region and the globus pallidus internus (GPi) in Parkinson’s disease (PD) cohort. Though much is known about the PPN region through animal studies, there are limited physiological recordings from ambulatory humans. The PPN has recently garnered interest as a potential deep brain stimulation (DBS) target for improving gait and freezing of gait (FoG) in PD. We used bidirectional neurostimulators to record from the human PPN region and GPi in a small cohort of severely affected PD subjects with FoG despite optimized dopaminergic medications. Five subjects, with confirmed on-dopaminergic medication FoG, were implanted with bilateral GPi and bilateral PPN region DBS electrodes. Electrophysiological recordings were obtained during various gait tasks for 5 months postoperatively in both the off- and on-medication conditions (obtained during the no stimulation condition). The results revealed suppression of low beta power in the GPi and a 1–8 Hz modulation in the PPN region which correlated with human gait. The PPN feature correlated with walking speed. GPi beta desynchronization and PPN low-frequency synchronization were observed as subjects progressed from rest to ambulatory tasks. Our findings add to our understanding of the neurophysiology underpinning gait and will likely contribute to the development of novel therapies for abnormal gait in PD.</p><p>Clinical Trial Registration:Clinicaltrials.gov identifier; NCT02318927.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00157">Methylene Blue Prevents Retinal Damage Caused by Perinatal Asphyxia in the Rat</a></h4>

<p>Perinatal asphyxia (PA) is responsible for a large proportion of neonatal deaths and numerous neurological sequelae, including visual dysfunction and blindness. In PA, the retina is exposed to ischemia/reoxygenation, which results in nitric oxide (NO) overproduction and neurotoxicity. We hypothesized that methylene blue (MB), a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, and free-radical scavenger currently used in the clinic, may block this pathway and prevent PA-induced retinal degeneration. Male rat pups were subjected to an experimental model of PA. Four groups were studied: normally delivered (CTL), normally delivered treated with 2 mg Kg-1 MB (MB), exposed to PA for 20 min at 37°C (PA), and exposed to PA and, then, treated with MB (PA-MB). Scotopic electroretinography performed 45 days after birth showed that PA animals had significant defects in the a- and b-waves and oscillatory potentials (OP). The same animals presented a significant increase in the thickness of the inner retina and a large number of TUNEL-positive cells. All these physiological and morphological parameters were significantly prevented by the treatment with MB. Gene expression analysis demonstrated significant increases in iNOS, MMP9, and VEGF in the eyes of PA animals, which were prevented by MB treatment. In conclusion, MB regulates key players of inflammation, matrix remodeling, gliosis, and angiogenesis in the eye and could be used as a treatment to prevent the deleterious visual consequences of PA. Given its safety profile and low cost, MB may be used clinically in places where alternative treatments may be unavailable.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00125">Huntingtin-Associated Protein 1 in Mouse Hypothalamus Stabilizes Glucocorticoid Receptor in Stress Response</a></h4>

<p>Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (Hap1) was initially identified as a brain-enriched protein that binds to the Huntington’s disease protein, huntingtin. Unlike huntingtin that is ubiquitously expressed in the brain, Hap1 is enriched in the brain with the highest expression level in the hypothalamus. The selective enrichment of Hap1 in the hypothalamus suggests that Hap1 may play a specific role in hypothalamic function that can regulate metabolism and stress response. Here we report that Hap1 is colocalized and interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in mouse hypothalamic neurons. Genetic depletion of Hap1 reduced the expression level of GR in the hypothalamus. Dexamethasone, a GR agonist, treatment or fasting of mice induced stress, resulting in increased expression of Hap1 in the hypothalamus. However, when Hap1 was absent, these treatments promoted GR reduction in the hypothalamus. In cultured cells, loss of Hap1 shortened the half-life of GR. These findings suggest that Hap1 stabilizes GR in the cytoplasm and that Hap1 dysfunction or deficiency may alter animal’s stress response.</p>

<p>The coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is a single-pass transmembrane cell adhesion molecule (CAM). CAR is expressed in numerous mammalian tissues including the brain, heart, lung, and testes. In epithelial cells, CAR functions are typical of the quintessential roles of numerous CAMs. However, in the brain the multiple roles of CAR are poorly understood. To better understand the physiological role of CAR in the adult brain, characterizing its location is a primordial step to advance our knowledge of its functions. In addition, CAR is responsible for the attachment, internalization, and retrograde transport of canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vectors, which have found a niche in the mapping of neuronal circuits and gene transfer to treat and model neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence to document the global location of CAR in the healthy, young adult mouse brain. Globally, we found that CAR is expressed by maturing and mature neurons in the brain parenchyma and located on the soma and on projections. While CAR occasionally colocalizes with glial fibrillary acidic protein, this overlap was restricted to areas that are associated with adult neurogenesis.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. However, other non-dopaminergic neuronal systems such as the serotonergic system are also involved. Serotonergic dysfunction is associated with non-motor symptoms and complications, including anxiety, depression, dementia, and sleep disturbances. This pathology reduces patient quality of life. Interaction between the serotonergic and other neurotransmitters systems such as dopamine, noradrenaline, glutamate, and GABA controls the activity of striatal neurons and are particularly interesting for understanding the pathophysiology of PD. Moreover, serotonergic dysfunction also causes motor symptoms. Interestingly, serotonergic neurons play an important role in the effects of L-DOPA in advanced PD stages. Serotonergic terminals can convert L-DOPA to dopamine, which mediates dopamine release as a “false” transmitter. The lack of any autoregulatory feedback control in serotonergic neurons to regulate L-DOPA-derived dopamine release contributes to the appearance of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). This mechanism may also be involved in the development of graft-induced dyskinesias (GID), possibly due to the inclusion of serotonin neurons in the grafted tissue. Consistent with this, the administration of serotonergic agonists suppressed LID. In this review article, we summarize the interactions between the serotonergic and other systems. We also discuss the role of the serotonergic system in LID and if therapeutic approaches specifically targeting this system may constitute an effective strategy in PD.</p>

Background<p>Recently, TDP-43 has been recognized as a common proteinopathy in the “oldest old” and a neuropathological comorbidity in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, since it has a low concentration in cerebrospinal fluid, the presence of TDP-43 in AD is rarely investigated in vivo.</p>Methods<p>Twenty-four patients with amyloid PET confirmed AD and 15 healthy controls (HCs) were included in this study. TDP-43 level in plasma neuronal-derived exosomes (NDEs) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.</p>Results<p>TDP-43 level was elevated in patients with AD compared with HCs (median 1.08 ng/ml, IQR 0.72–1.37 ng/ml vs. median 0.66 ng/ml, IQR 0.48–0.76 ng/ml, P = 0.002). There was no correlation between TDP-43 level and cognitive function, neuropsychiatric symptoms or APOE genotype in patients with AD.</p>Conclusion<p>This study demonstrated increased TDP-43 accumulation in AD patients by examining plasma NDEs, which may provide a window into the effects of TDP-43 on AD progression.</p>

<p>Mobile phone use has rapidly increased worldwide, and pregnant women are passively or actively exposed to the associated electromagnetic radiation. Maternal cell phone exposure is related to behavioral difficulties in young offspring. However, whether prenatal mobile phone exposure can predispose the elderly offspring to cognitive impairment is unclear. The enriched environment (EE) has shown positive effects on cognition in an immature brain, but its impact on aging offspring after prenatal cell phone exposure is unknown. This study aimed to investigate whether prenatal exposure to mobile phone exerts long-term effects on cognition in elderly rat offspring and whether EE during adulthood can rescue cognitive impairment by altering the synaptic plasticity. Pregnant rats were subjected to prenatal short-term or long-term cell phone exposure and offspring rats were randomly assigned to standard or EE. Spatial learning and memory were investigated using Morris water maze (MWM) in elderly rat offspring. Hippocampal cellular morphology was assessed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and synaptic ultrastructure was evaluated with transmission electron microscopy. Expression of synaptophysin (SYN), postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were detected by western blot. The results demonstrated that prenatal long-term but not short-term exposure to mobile phone lead to cognitive impairment, morphological changes in the hippocampal cells, reduced synaptic number, decreased SYN, PSD-95, and BDNF expression in elderly offspring, which were alleviated by postnatal EE housing. These findings suggest that prenatal long-term mobile phone exposure may pose life-long adverse effects on elderly offspring and impair cognition by disrupting the synaptic plasticity, which may be reversed by postnatal EE housing.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58130">Specialization of the chromatin remodeler RSC to mobilize partially-unwrapped nucleosomes</a></h4>

SWI/SNF-family chromatin remodeling complexes, such as <i>S. cerevisiae</i> RSC, slide and eject nucleosomes to regulate transcription. Within nucleosomes, stiff DNA sequences confer spontaneous partial unwrapping, prompting whether and how SWI/SNF-family remodelers are specialized to remodel partially-unwrapped nucleosomes. <i>RSC1</i> and <i>RSC2</i> are orthologs of mammalian <i>PBRM1</i> (polybromo) which define two separate RSC sub-complexes. Remarkably, <i>in vitro</i> the Rsc1-containing complex remodels partially-unwrapped nucleosomes much better than does the Rsc2-containing complex. Moreover, a <i>rsc1</i>Δ mutation, but not <i>rsc2</i>Δ, is lethal with histone mutations that confer partial unwrapping. Rsc1/2 isoforms both cooperate with the DNA-binding proteins Rsc3/30 and the HMG protein, Hmo1, to remodel partially-unwrapped nucleosomes, but show differential reliance on these factors. Notably, genetic impairment of these factors strongly reduces the expression of genes with wide nucleosome-deficient regions (e.g. ribosomal protein genes), known to harbor partially-unwrapped nucleosomes. Taken together, Rsc1/2 isoforms are specialized through composition and interactions to manage and remodel partially-unwrapped nucleosomes.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57571">Activity-dependent tuning of intrinsic excitability in mouse and human neurogliaform cells</a></h4>

The ability to modulate the efficacy of synaptic communication between neurons constitutes an essential property critical for normal brain function. Animal models have proved invaluable in revealing a wealth of diverse cellular mechanisms underlying varied plasticity modes. However, to what extent these processes are mirrored in humans is largely uncharted thus questioning their relevance in human circuit function. In this study, we focus on neurogliaform cells, that possess specialized physiological features enabling them to impart a widespread inhibitory influence on neural activity. We demonstrate that this prominent neuronal subtype, embedded in both mouse and human neural circuits, undergo remarkably similar activity-dependent modulation manifesting as epochs of enhanced intrinsic excitability. In principle, these evolutionary conserved plasticity routes likely tune the extent of neurogliaform cell mediated inhibition thus constituting canonical circuit mechanisms underlying human cognitive processing and behavior.

Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are proton-gated members of the epithelial sodium channel/degenerin (ENaC/DEG) superfamily of ion channels and are expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. The homotrimeric splice variant ASIC1a has been implicated in nociception, fear memory, mood disorders and ischemia. Here we extract full-length chicken ASIC1 (cASIC1) from cell membranes using styrene maleic acid (SMA) copolymer, elucidating structures of ASIC1 channels in both high pH resting and low pH desensitized conformations by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The structures of resting and desensitized channels reveal a reentrant loop at the amino terminus of ASIC1 that includes the highly conserved 'His-Gly' (HG) motif. The reentrant loop lines the lower ion permeation pathway and buttresses the 'Gly-Ala-Ser' (GAS) constriction, thus providing a structural explanation for the role of the His-Gly dipeptide in the structure and function of ASICs.

In a previous study, we established a forward genetic screen to identify genes required for multicellular development in the choanoflagellate, <i>Salpingoeca rosetta </i>(Levin et al., 2014). Yet, the paucity of reverse genetic tools for choanoflagellates has hampered direct tests of gene function and impeded the establishment of choanoflagellates as a model for reconstructing the origin of their closest living relatives, the animals. Here we establish CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in <i>S. rosetta</i> by engineering a selectable marker to enrich for edited cells. We then use genome editing to disrupt the coding sequence of a <i>S. rosetta </i>C-type lectin gene, <i>rosetteless</i>, and thereby demonstrate its necessity for multicellular rosette development. This work advances <i>S. rosetta</i> as a model system in which to investigate how genes identified from genetic screens and genomic surveys function in choanoflagellates and evolved as critical regulators of animal biology.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53470">Microstructural organization of human insula is linked to its macrofunctional circuitry and predicts cognitive control</a></h4>

The human insular cortex is a heterogeneous brain structure which plays an integrative role in guiding behavior. The cytoarchitectonic organization of the human insula has been investigated over the last century using postmortem brains but there has been little progress in noninvasive <i>in vivo</i> mapping of its microstructure and large-scale functional circuitry. Quantitative modeling of multi-shell diffusion MRI data from 413 participants revealed that human insula microstructure differs significantly across subdivisions that serve distinct cognitive and affective functions. Insular microstructural organization was mirrored in its functionally interconnected circuits with the anterior cingulate cortex that anchors the salience network, a system important for adaptive switching of cognitive control systems. Furthermore, insular microstructural features, confirmed in Macaca mulatta, were linked to behavior and predicted individual differences in cognitive control ability. Our findings open new possibilities for probing psychiatric and neurological disorders impacted by insular cortex dysfunction, including autism, schizophrenia, and fronto-temporal dementia.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52134">Hippocampal neural stem cells facilitate access from circulation via apical cytoplasmic processes</a></h4>

Blood vessels (BVs) are considered an integral component of neural stem cells (NSCs) niches. NSCs in the dentate gyrus (DG) have enigmatic elaborated apical cellular processes that are associated with BVs. Whether this contact serves as a mechanism for delivering circulating molecules is not known. Here we uncovered a previously unrecognized communication route allowing exclusive direct access of blood-borne substances to hippocampal NSCs. BBB-impermeable fluorescent tracer injected transcardially to mice is selectively uptaken by DG NSCs within a minute, via the vessel-associated apical processes. These processes, measured &gt;30nm in diameter, establish direct membrane-to-membrane contact with endothelial cells in specialized areas of irregular endothelial basement membrane and enriched with vesicular activity. Doxorubicin, a brain-impermeable chemotherapeutic agent, is also readily and selectively uptaken by NSCs and reduces their proliferation, which might explain its problematic anti-neurogenic or cognitive side-effect. The newly-discovered NSC-BV communication route explains how circulatory neurogenic mediators are 'sensed' by NSCs.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50933">Feedback contribution to surface motion perception in the human early visual cortex</a></h4>

Human visual surface perception has neural correlates in early visual cortex, but the role of feedback during surface segmentation in human early visual cortex remains unknown. Feedback projections preferentially enter superficial and deep anatomical layers, which provides a hypothesis for the cortical depth distribution of fMRI activity related to feedback. Using ultra-high field fMRI, we report a depth distribution of activation in line with feedback during the (illusory) perception of surface motion. Our results fit with a signal re-entering in superficial depths of V1, followed by a feedforward sweep of the re-entered information through V2 and V3. The magnitude and sign of the BOLD response strongly depended on the presence of texture in the background, and was additionally modulated by the presence of illusory motion perception compatible with feedback. In summary, the present study demonstrates the potential of depth-resolved fMRI in tackling biomechanical questions on perception.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/48730">Circuits that encode and guide alcohol-associated preference</a></h4>

A powerful feature of adaptive memory is its inherent flexibility. Alcohol and other addictive substances can remold neural circuits important for memory to reduce this flexibility. However, the mechanism through which pertinent circuits are selected and shaped remains unclear. We show that circuits required for alcohol-associated preference shift from population level dopaminergic activation to select dopamine neurons that predict behavioral choice in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. During memory expression, subsets of dopamine neurons directly and indirectly modulate the activity of interconnected glutamatergic and cholinergic mushroom body output neurons (MBON). Transsynaptic tracing of neurons important for memory expression revealed a convergent center of memory consolidation within the mushroom body (MB) implicated in arousal, and a structure outside the MB implicated in integration of naïve and learned responses. These findings provide a circuit framework through which dopamine neuronal activation shifts from reward delivery to cue onset, and provide insight into the maladaptive nature of memory.

Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are a class of disorders affecting brain development and function and are characterized by wide genetic and clinical variability. In this review, we discuss the multiple factors that influence the clinical presentation of NDDs, with particular attention to gene vulnerability, mutational load, and the two-hit model. Despite the complex architecture of mutational events associated with NDDs, the various proteins involved appear to converge on common pathways, such as synaptic plasticity/function, chromatin remodelers and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway.

Molecular quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses are increasingly popular to explore the genetic architecture of complex traits, but existing studies do not leverage shared regulatory patterns and suffer from a large multiplicity burden, which hampers the detection of weak signals such as <i>trans</i> associations. Here, we present a fully multivariate proteomic QTL (pQTL) analysis performed with our recently proposed Bayesian method LOCUS on data from two clinical cohorts, with plasma protein levels quantified by mass-spectrometry and aptamer-based assays. Our two-stage study identifies 136 pQTL associations in the first cohort, of which &gt;80% replicate in the second independent cohort and have significant enrichment with functional genomic elements and disease risk loci. Moreover, 78% of the pQTLs whose protein abundance was quantified by both proteomic techniques are confirmed across assays. Our thorough comparisons with standard univariate QTL mapping on (1) these data and (2) synthetic data emulating the real data show how LOCUS borrows strength across correlated protein levels and markers on a genome-wide scale to effectively increase statistical power. Notably, 15% of the pQTLs uncovered by LOCUS would be missed by the univariate approach, including several <i>trans</i> and pleiotropic hits with successful independent validation. Finally, the analysis of extensive clinical data from the two cohorts indicates that the genetically-driven proteins identified by LOCUS are enriched in associations with low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia and might therefore act as endophenotypes for metabolic diseases. While considerations on the clinical role of the pQTLs are beyond the scope of our work, these findings generate useful hypotheses to be explored in future research; all results are accessible online from our searchable database. Thanks to its efficient variational Bayes implementation, LOCUS can analyse jointly thousands of traits and millions of markers. Its applicability goes beyond pQTL studies, opening new perspectives for large-scale genome-wide association and QTL analyses.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hypoxic/ischemic insult, a leading cause of functional brain defects, has been extensively studied in both clinical and experimental animal research, including its etiology, neuropathogenesis, and pharmacological interventions. Transient sublethal hypoxia (TSH) is a common clinical occurrence in the perinatal period. However, its effect on early developing brains remains poorly understood. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of TSH on the dendrite and dendritic spine formation, neuronal and synaptic activity, and cognitive behavior of early postnatal Day 1 rat pups. While TSH showed no obvious effect on gross brain morphology, neuron cell density, or glial activation in the hippocampus, we found transient hypoxia did cause significant changes in neuronal structure and function. In brains exposed to TSH, hippocampal neurons developed shorter and thinner dendrites, with decreased dendritic spine density, and reduced strength in excitatory synaptic transmission. Moreover, TSH‐treated rats showed impaired cognitive performance in spatial learning and memory. Our findings demonstrate that TSH in newborn rats can cause significant impairments in synaptic formation and function, and long‐lasting brain functional deficits. Therefore, this study provides a useful animal model for the study of TSH on early developing brains and to explore potential pharmaceutical interventions for patients subjected to TSH insult.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Pharmaco‐refractory focal motor epileptic seizures pose a significant challenge. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a recently recognized therapeutic option for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. To identify the specific target for focal motor seizures, we evaluate the modulatory effects of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation because of the critical role of STN in cortico‐subcortical motor processing.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Seven patients with epilepsy with refractory seizures who underwent chronic stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) monitoring were studied in presurgical evaluation. Seizure onset zone was hypothesized to be partially involved in the motor areas in 6 patients. For each patient, one electrode was temporally implanted into the STN that was ipsilateral to the seizure onset zone. The cortical–subcortical seizure propagation was systemically evaluated. The simultaneously electrophysiological responses over distributed cortical areas to STN stimulation at varied frequencies were quantitatively assessed.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We observed the consistent downstream propagation of seizures from the motor cortex toward the ipsilateral STN and remarkable cortical responses on motor cortex to single‐pulse STN stimulation. Furthermore, we showed frequency‐dependent upstream modulatory effect of STN stimulation on motor cortex specifically. In contrast to the enhanced effects of low frequency stimulation, high‐frequency stimulation of the STN can significantly reduce interictal spikes, high‐frequency oscillations over motor cortex disclosing effective connections to the STN.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This result showed that the STN is not only engaged in as a propagation network of focal motor seizures but STN stimulation can profoundly modulate the epileptic activity of motor cortex in humans, suggesting a mechanism‐based alternative for patients suffering from refractory focal motor seizures.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Glycogen storage diseases (GSDs) are severe human disorders resulting from abnormal glucose metabolism, and all previously described GSDs segregate as autosomal recessive or X‐linked traits. In this study, we aimed to molecularly characterize the first family with a dominant GSD.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We describe a dominant GSD family with 13 affected members presenting with adult‐onset muscle weakness, and we provide clinical, metabolic, histological, and ultrastructural data. We performed exome sequencing to uncover the causative gene, and functional experiments in the cell model and on recombinant proteins to investigate the pathogenic effect of the identified mutation.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified a heterozygous missense mutation in <i>PYGM </i> segregating with the disease in the family. <i>PYGM </i> codes for myophosphorylase, the enzyme catalyzing the initial step of glycogen breakdown. Enzymatic tests revealed that the <i>PYGM </i> mutation impairs the AMP‐independent myophosphorylase activity, whereas the AMP‐dependent activity was preserved. Further functional investigations demonstrated an altered conformation and aggregation of mutant myophosphorylase, and the concurrent accumulation of the intermediate filament desmin in the myofibers of the patients.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, this study describes the first example of a dominant glycogen storage disease in humans, and elucidates the underlying pathomechanisms by deciphering the sequence of events from the PYGM mutation to the accumulation of glycogen in the muscle fibers. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>We reconstructed the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans </i> adult hermaphrodite pharyngeal nervous system from serial section electron micrographs to generate a weighted pharyngeal connectome. We subjected the pharyngeal wiring diagram to a set of visual, graph theoretic, statistical, and fluorescent‐reporter analyses, revealing a shallow neural structure. Together, our study shows that most pharyngeal neurons exhibit sensory‐motor characteristics, similar to primitive nervous systems comprised of “ur‐neurons.”

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Detailed anatomical maps of individual organs and entire animals have served as invaluable entry points for ensuing dissection of their evolution, development, and function. The pharynx of the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans </i> is a simple neuromuscular organ with a self‐contained, autonomously acting nervous system, composed of 20 neurons that fall into 14 anatomically distinct types. Using serial electron micrograph (EM) reconstruction, we re‐evaluate here the connectome of the pharyngeal nervous system, providing a novel and more detailed view of its structure and predicted function. Contrasting the previous classification of pharyngeal neurons into distinct inter‐ and motor neuron classes, we provide evidence that most pharyngeal neurons are also likely sensory neurons and most, if not all, pharyngeal neurons also classify as motor neurons. Together with the extensive cross‐connectivity among pharyngeal neurons, which is more widespread than previously realized, the sensory‐motor characteristics of most neurons define a shallow network architecture of the pharyngeal connectome. Network analysis reveals that the patterns of neuronal connections are organized into putative computational modules that reflect the known functional domains of the pharynx. Compared with the somatic nervous system, pharyngeal neurons both physically associate with a larger fraction of their neighbors and create synapses with a greater proportion of their neighbors. We speculate that the overall architecture of the pharyngeal nervous system may be reminiscent of the architecture of ancestral, primitive nervous systems.</p>

<p>Similar to patients with Major depressive disorder (MDD), healthy subjects at risk for depression show hyperactivation of the amygdala as a response to negative emotional expressions. The medial prefrontal cortex is responsible for amygdala control. Analyzing a large cohort of healthy subjects, we aimed to delineate malfunction in amygdala regulation by the medial prefrontal cortex in subjects at increased risk for depression, i.e., with a family history of affective disorders or a personal history of childhood maltreatment. We included a total of 342 healthy subjects from the FOR2107 cohort (www.for2107.de). An emotional face-matching task was used to identify the medial prefrontal cortex and right amygdala. Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) was conducted and neural coupling parameters were obtained for healthy controls with and without particular risk factors for depression. We assigned a genetic risk if subjects had a first-degree relative with an affective disorder and an environmental risk if subjects experienced childhood maltreatment. We then compared amygdala inhibition during emotion processing between groups. Amygdala inhibition by the medial prefrontal cortex was present in subjects without those two risk factors, as indicated by negative model parameter estimates. Having a genetic risk (i.e., a family history) did not result in changes in amygdala inhibition compared to no risk subjects. In contrast, childhood maltreatment as environmental risk has led to a significant reduction of amygdala inhibition by the medial prefrontal cortex. We propose a mechanistic explanation for the amygdala hyperactivity in subjects with particular risk for depression, in particular childhood maltreatment, caused by a malfunctioned amygdala downregulation via the medial prefrontal cortex. As childhood maltreatment is a major environmentalrisk factor for depression, we emphasize the importance of this potential early biomarker.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive cognitive decline associated with global brain damage. Initially, intracellular paired helical filaments composed by hyperphosphorylated tau and extracellular deposits of amyloid-β (Aβ) were postulated as the causing factors of the synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal death, detected in AD patients. Therefore, the vast majority of clinical trials were focused on targeting Aβ and tau directly, but no effective treatment has been reported so far. Consequently, only palliative treatments are currently available for AD patients. Over recent years, several studies have suggested the involvement of the purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2X7R), a plasma membrane ionotropic ATP-gated receptor, in the AD brain pathology. In this line, altered expression levels and function of P2X7R were found both in AD patients and AD mouse models. Consequently, genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of P2X7R ameliorated the hallmarks and symptoms of different AD mouse models. In this review, we provide an overview of the current knowledge about the role of the P2X7R in AD.</p>

<p>Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) dysregulation has been implicated in nigral dopaminergic neurodegeneration, one of the main pathological features of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The two isoforms, GSK-3α and GSK-3β, have both been suggested to play a detrimental role in neuronal death. To date, several studies have focused on the role of GSK-3β on PD pathogenesis, while the role of GSK-3α has been largely overlooked. Here, we report in situ observations that both GSK-3α and GSK-3β are dephosphorylated at a negatively acting regulatory serine, indicating kinase activation, selectively in nigral dopaminergic neurons following exposure of mice to 1-methyl-4-pheny-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). To identify whether GSK-3α and GSK-3β display functional redundancy in regulating parkinsonian dopaminergic cell death, we analysed dopaminergic neuron-specific Gsk3a null (Gsk3a<sup>ΔDat</sup>) and Gsk3b null (Gsk3b<sup>ΔDat</sup>) mice, respectively. We found that Gsk3b<sup>ΔDat</sup>, but not Gsk3a<sup>ΔDat</sup>, showed significant resistance to MPTP insult, revealing non-redundancy of GSK-3α and GSK-3β in PD pathogenesis. In addition, we tested the neuroprotective effect of tideglusib, the most clinically advanced inhibitor of GSK-3, in the MPTP model of PD. Administration of higher doses (200 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg) of tideglusib exhibited significant neuroprotection, whereas 50 mg/kg tideglusib failed to prevent dopaminergic neurodegeneration from MPTP toxicity. Administration of 200 mg/kg tideglusib improved motor symptoms of MPTP-treated mice. Together, these data demonstrate GSK-3β and not GSK-3α is critical for parkinsonian neurodegeneration. Our data support the view that GSK-3β acts as a potential therapeutic target in PD and tideglusib would be a candidate drug for PD neuroprotective therapy.</p>

<p>Tubulinopathies are a group of recently described diseases characterized by mutations in the tubulin genes. Mutations in TUBB4A produce diseases such as dystonia type 4 (DYT4) and hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum (H-ABC), which are clinically diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We propose the taiep rat as the first animal model for tubulinopathies. The spontaneous mutant suffers from a syndrome related to a central leukodystrophy and characterized by tremor, ataxia, immobility, epilepsy, and paralysis. The pathological signs presented by these rats and the morphological changes we found by our longitudinal MRI study are similar to those of patients with mutations in TUBB4A. The diffuse atrophy we found in brain, cerebellum and spinal cord is related to the changes detectable in many human tubulinopathies and in particular in H-ABC patients, where myelin degeneration at the level of putamen and cerebellum is a clinical trademark of the disease. We performed Tubb4a exon analysis to corroborate the genetic defect and formulated hypotheses about the effect of amino acid 302 change on protein physiology. Optical microscopy of taiep rat cerebella and spinal cord confirmed the optical density loss in white matter associated with myelin loss, despite the persistence of neural fibers.</p>

<p>Subcellular protein delivery is especially important in signal transduction and cell behavior, and is typically achieved by localization signals within the protein. However, protein delivery can also rely on localization of mRNAs that are translated at target sites. Although once considered heretical, RNA localization has proven to be highly conserved in eukaryotes. RNA localization and localized translation are especially relevant in polarized cells like neurons where neurites extend dozens to hundreds of centimeters away from the soma. Local translation confers dendrites and axons the capacity to respond to their environment in an acute manner without fully relying on somatic signals. The relevance of local protein synthesis in neuron development, maintenance and disease has not been fully acknowledged until recent years, partly due to the limited amount of locally produced proteins. For instance, in hippocampal neurons levels of newly synthesized somatic proteins can be more than 20–30 times greater than translation levels of neuritic proteins. Thus local translation events can be easily overlooked under the microscope. Here we describe an object-based analysis used to visualize and quantify local RNA translation sites in neurites. Newly synthesized proteins are tagged with puromycin and endogenous RNAs labeled with SYTO. After imaging, signals corresponding to neuritic RNAs and proteins are filtered with a Laplacian operator to enhance the edges. Resulting pixels are converted into objects and selected by automatic masking followed by signal smoothing. Objects corresponding to RNA or protein and colocalized objects (RNA and protein) are quantified along individual neurites. Colocalization between RNA and protein in neurites correspond to newly synthesized proteins arising from localized RNAs and represent localized translation sites. To test the validity of our analyses we have compared control neurons to Aβ<sub>1</sub><sub>–</sub><sub>42</sub>-treated neurons. Aβ is involved in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease and was previously reported to induce local translation in axons and dendrites which in turn contributes to the disease. We have observed that Aβ increases the synthesis of neuritic proteins as well as the fraction of translating RNAs in distal sites of the neurite, suggesting an induction of local protein synthesis. Our results thus confirm previous reports and validate our quantification method.</p>

<p>Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most common type of focal epilepsy. It is frequently associated with abnormal MRI findings, which are caused by underlying cellular, structural, and chemical changes at the micro-scale. In the current study, it is investigated to which extent these alterations correspond to imaging features detected by high resolution magnetic resonance imaging in the intrahippocampal kainate mouse model of MTLE. Fixed hippocampal and whole-brain sections of mouse brain tissue from nine animals under physiological and chronically epileptic conditions were examined using structural and diffusion-weighted MRI. Microstructural details were investigated based on a direct comparison with immunohistochemical analyses of the same specimen. Within the hippocampal formation, diffusion streamlines could be visualized corresponding to dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells and granule cells, as well as mossy fibers and Schaffer collaterals. Statistically significant changes in diffusivities, fractional anisotropy, and diffusion orientations could be detected in tissue samples from chronically epileptic animals compared to healthy controls, corresponding to microstructural alterations (degeneration of pyramidal cells, dispersion of the granule cell layer, and sprouting of mossy fibers). The diffusion parameters were significantly correlated with histologically determined cell densities. These findings demonstrate that high-resolution diffusion-weighted MRI can resolve subtle microstructural changes in epileptic hippocampal tissue corresponding to histopathological features in MTLE.</p>

<p>Sensory stimulation is an attractive paradigm for studying brain activity using various optical-, ultrasound- and MRI-based functional neuroimaging methods. Optoacoustics has been recently suggested as a powerful new tool for scalable mapping of multiple hemodynamic parameters with rich contrast and previously unachievable spatio-temporal resolution. Yet, its utility for studying the processing of peripheral inputs at the whole brain level has so far not been quantified. We employed volumetric multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography (vMSOT) to non-invasively monitor the HbO, HbR, and HbT dynamics across the mouse somatosensory cortex evoked by electrical paw stimuli. We show that elevated contralateral activation is preserved in the HbO map (invisible to MRI) under isoflurane anesthesia. Brain activation is shown to be predominantly confined to the somatosensory cortex, with strongest activation in the hindpaw region of the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. Furthermore, vMSOT detected the presence of an initial dip in the contralateral hindpaw region in the delta HbO channel. Sensorimotor cortical activity was identified over all other regions in HbT and HbO but not in HbR. Pearson’s correlation mapping enabled localizing the response to the sensorimotor cortex further highlighting the ability of vMSOT to bridge over imaging performance deficiencies of other functional neuroimaging modalities.</p>

<p>Early brain development from infancy through childhood is closely related to the development of cognition and behavior in later life. Human brain connectome is a novel framework for describing topological organization of the developing brain. Resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), with a natural scanning environment, low cost, and high portability, is considered as an emerging imaging technique and has shown valuable potential in exploring brain network architecture and its changes during the development. Here, we review the recent advances involving typical and atypical development of the brain connectome from neonates to children using resting-state fNIRS imaging. This review highlights that the combination of brain connectome and resting-state fNIRS imaging offers a promising framework for understanding human brain development.</p>

<p>Background: Stress-induced cellular changes in limbic brain structures contribute to the development of various psychopathologies. In vivo detection of these microstructural changes may help us to develop objective biomarkers for psychiatric disorders. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an advanced neuroimaging technique that enables the non-invasive examination of white matter integrity and provides insights into the microstructure of pathways connecting brain areas.</p><p>Objective: Our aim was to examine the temporal dynamics of stress-induced structural changes with repeated in vivo DTI scans and correlate them with behavioral alterations.</p><p>Methods: Out of 32 young adult male rats, 16 were exposed to daily immobilization stress for 3 weeks. Four DTI measurements were done: one before the stress exposure (baseline), two scans during the stress (acute and chronic phases), and a last one 2 weeks after the end of the stress protocol (recovery). We used a 4.7T small-animal MRI system and examined 18 gray and white matter structures calculating the following parameters: fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). T2-weighted images were used for volumetry. Cognitive performance and anxiety levels of the animals were assessed in the Morris water maze, novel object recognition, open field, and elevated plus maze tests.</p><p>Results: Reduced FA and increased MD and RD values were found in the corpus callosum and external capsule of stressed rats. Stress increased RD in the anterior commissure and reduced MD and RD in the amygdala. We observed time-dependent changes in several DTI parameters as the rats matured, but we found no evidence of stress-induced volumetric alterations in the brains. Stressed rats displayed cognitive impairments and we found numerous correlations between the cognitive performance of the animals and between various DTI metrics of the inferior colliculus, corpus callosum, anterior commissure, and amygdala.</p><p>Conclusions: Our data provide further support to the translational value of DTI studies and suggest that chronic stress exposure results in similar white matter microstructural alterations that have been documented in stress-related psychiatric disorders. These DTI findings imply microstructural abnormalities in the brain, which may underlie the cognitive deficits that are often present in stress-related mental disorders.</p>

<p>Restricted interests (RIs) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are clinically impairing interests of unusual focus or intensity. They are a subtype of restricted and repetitive behaviors which are one of two diagnostic criteria for the disorder. Despite the near ubiquity of RIs in ASD, the neural basis for their development is not well understood. However, recent cognitive neuroscience findings from nonclinical samples and from individuals with ASD shed light on neural mechanisms that may explain the emergence of RIs. We propose the nexus model of RIs in ASD, a novel conceptualization of this symptom domain that suggests that RIs may reflect a co-opting of brain systems that typically serve to integrate complex attention, memory, semantic, and social communication functions during development. The nexus model of RIs hypothesizes that when social communicative development is compromised, brain functions typically located within the lateral surface of cortex may expand into social processing brain systems and alter cortical representations of various cognitive functions during development. These changes, in turn, promote the development of RIs as an alternative process mediated by these brain networks. The nexus model of RIs makes testable predictions about reciprocal relations between the impaired development of social communication and the emergence of RIs in ASD and suggests novel avenues for treatment development.</p>

<p>Despite its impact on everyday functioning, spatial perspective-taking has rarely been investigated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and previous findings are surprisingly sparse and inconsistent. In the present study, we aimed to investigate spatial perspective-taking abilities in children and adolescents with ASD without intellectual disabilities, comparing them with a group of typically developing (TD) peers. Our objectives were: (i) to test similarities and differences between these groups in a spatial perspective-taking task; and (ii) to see whether similar or different underlying processes (i.e., fine and gross motor skills, and visuospatial abilities) might account for the groups’ performance in the spatial perspective-taking task. A group of children with ASD (N = 36) was compared with a TD group (N = 39), aged from 8 to 16 years. Participants were administered tasks assessing spatial perspective-taking, fine and gross motor skills, visuo-constructive abilities, visuospatial working memory, visual imagery, and mental rotation. Our results revealed that the ASD group had more difficulty with the spatial perspective-taking task than the TD group. The two groups also had some shared and some different processes that predicted their perspective-taking performance: a significant predictive effect of fine motor skills and visuospatial working memory emerged for both groups, while gross motor skills (i.e., walking heel-to-toe) and visuospatial imagery only revealed a role in the TD group. These findings suggest that different abilities might account for the two groups’ performance in the spatial perspective-taking task. Gross motor skills and complex visuospatial abilities seem to be more important in sustaining spatial perspective-taking ability in typical development than in the event of ASD. Some of the clinical and educational implications of these findings are discussed.</p>

<p>Background: The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in both hemispheres have a central integrative function for motor control and behavior.

<p>Eye-to-eye contact is a spontaneous behavior between interacting partners that occurs naturally during social interactions. However, individuals differ with respect to eye gaze behaviors such as frequency of eye-to-eye contacts, and these variations may reflect underlying differences in social behavior in the population. While the use of eye signaling to indicate a shared object of attention in joint attention tasks has been well-studied, the effects of the natural variation in establishing eye contact during joint attention have not been isolated. Here, we investigate this question using a novel two-person joint attention task. Participants were not instructed regarding the use of eye contacts; thus all mutual eye contact events between interacting partners that occurred during the joint attention task were spontaneous and varied with respect to frequency. We predicted that joint attention systems would be modulated by differences in the social behavior across participant pairs, which could be measured by the frequency of eye contact behavior. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning and eye-tracking to measure the neural signals associated with joint attention in interacting dyads and to record the number of eye contact events between them. Participants engaged in a social joint attention task in which real partners used eye gaze to direct each other’s attention to specific targets. Findings were compared to a non-social joint attention task in which an LED cue directed both partners’ attention to the same target. The social joint attention condition showed greater activity in right temporoparietal junction than the non-social condition, replicating prior joint attention results. Eye-contact frequency modulated the joint attention activity, revealing bilateral activity in social and high level visual areas associated with partners who made more eye contact. Additionally, when the number of mutual eye contact events was used to classify each pair as either “high eye contact” or “low eye contact” dyads, cross-brain coherence analysis revealed greater coherence between high eye contact dyads than low eye contact dyads in these same areas. Together, findings suggest that variation in social behavior as measured by eye contact modulates activity in a subunit of the network associated with joint attention.</p>

<p>cAMP is a positive regulator tightly involved in certain types of synaptic plasticity and related memory functions. However, its spatiotemporal roles at the synaptic and neural circuit levels remain elusive. Using a combination of a cAMP optogenetics approach and voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging with electrophysiological recording, we define a novel capacity of postsynaptic cAMP in enabling dentate gyrus long-term potentiation (LTP) and depolarization in acutely prepared murine hippocampal slices. To manipulate cAMP levels at medial perforant path to granule neuron (MPP-DG) synapses by light, we generated transgenic (Tg) mice expressing photoactivatable adenylyl cyclase (PAC) in DG granule neurons. Using these Tg(CMV-Camk2a-RFP/bPAC)3Koka mice, we recorded field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) from MPP-DG synapses and found that photoactivation of PAC during tetanic stimulation enabled synaptic potentiation that persisted for at least 30 min. This form of LTP was induced without the need for GABA receptor blockade that is typically required for inducing DG plasticity. The paired-pulse ratio (PPR) remained unchanged, indicating the cAMP-dependent LTP was likely postsynaptic. By employing fast fluorescent voltage-sensitive dye (VSD: di-4-ANEPPS) and fluorescence imaging, we found that photoactivation of the PAC actuator enhanced the intensity and extent of dentate gyrus depolarization triggered following tetanic stimulation. These results demonstrate that the elevation of cAMP in granule neurons is capable of rapidly enhancing synaptic strength and neuronal depolarization. The powerful actions of cAMP are consistent with this second messenger having a critical role in the regulation of synaptic function.</p>

<p>Stroke is one of the major devastating diseases with no effective medical therapeutics. Because of the high rate of disability and mortality among stroke patients, new treatments are urgently required to decrease brain damage following a stroke. In recent years, the inflammasome is a novel breakthrough point that plays an important role in the stroke, and the inhibition of inflammasome may be an effective method for stroke treatment. Briefly, inflammasome is a multi-protein complex that causes activation of caspase-1 and subsequent production of pro-inflammatory factors including interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-1β. Among them, the NLRP3 inflammasome is the most typical inflammasome, which can detect cell damage and mediate inflammatory response to tissue damage in ischemic stroke. The NLRP3 inflammasome has become a key mediator of post-ischemic inflammation, leading to a cascade of inflammatory reactions and cell death eventually. Thus, NLRP3 inflammasome is an ideal therapeutic target due to its important role in the inflammatory response after ischemic stroke. In this mini review article, we will summarize the structure, assembly, and regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome, the role of NLRP3 inflammasome in ischemic stroke, and several treatments targeting NLRP3 inflammasome in ischemic stroke. The further understanding of the mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome in patients with ischemic stroke will provide novel targets for the treatment of cerebral ischemic stroke patients.</p>

<p>Inflammatory processes occurring in the perinatal period may affect different brain regions, resulting in neurologic sequelae. Injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at different neurodevelopmental stages produces long-term consequences in several brain structures, but there is scarce evidence regarding alterations in the cerebellum. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term consequences on the cerebellum of a systemic inflammatory process induced by neonatal LPS injection. For this, neonatal rats were randomly assigned to three different groups: naïve, sham, and LPS. Saline (sham group) or LPS solution (1 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected on alternate postnatal days (PN) PN1, PN3, PN5, and PN7. Spontaneous activity was evaluated with the open field test in adulthood. The cerebellum was evaluated for different parameters: microglial and Purkinje cell densities, oxidative stress levels, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) mRNA expression. Our results show that administration of LPS did not result in altered spontaneous activity in adult animals. Our data also indicate increased oxidative stress in the cerebellum, as evidenced by an increase in superoxide fluorescence by dihydroethidium (DHE) indicator. Stereological analyses indicated increased microglial density in the cerebellum that was not accompanied by Purkinje cell loss or altered TNF-α expression in adult animals. Interestingly, Purkinje cells ectopically positioned in the granular and molecular layers of the cerebellum were observed in animals of the LPS group. Our data suggest that neonatal LPS exposure causes persistent cellular and molecular changes to the cerebellum, indicating the susceptibility of this region to systemic inflammatory insults in infancy. Further investigation of the consequences of these changes and the development of strategies to avoid those should be subject of future studies.</p>

<p>The mammalian neurovascular unit (NVU) is comprised of neurons, glia, and vascular cells. The NVU is the nexus between the cardiovascular and central nervous system (CNS). The central component of the NVU is the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which consists of a monolayer of tightly connected endothelial cells covered by pericytes and further surrounded by astrocytic endfeet. In addition to preventing the diffusion of toxic species into the CNS, the BBB endothelium serves as a dynamic regulatory system facilitating the transport of molecules from the bloodstream to the brain and vis versa. The structural integrity and transport functions of the BBB are maintained, in part, by an orchestra of membrane receptors and transporters including members of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Here, we provide an overview of GPCRs known to regulate mammalian BBB structure and function and discuss how dysregulation of these pathways plays a role in various neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Insects that transmit many of the world’s deadliest animal diseases, for instance trypanosomosis, find their suitable hosts and avoid non-preferred hosts mostly through olfactory cues. The waterbuck repellent blend (WRB) comprising geranylacetone, guaiacol, pentanoic acid, and δ-octalactone derived from waterbuck skin odor is a repellent to some savannah-adapted tsetse flies and reduces trap catches of riverine species. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with detection and coding of the repellent odors remain to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that WRB inhibited blood feeding in both Glossina pallidipes Austen, 1903 and Glossina fuscipes fuscipes Newstead, 1910. Using the DREAM (Deorphanization of Receptors based on Expression Alterations in odorant receptor mRNA levels) technique, combined with ortholog comparison and molecular docking, we predicted the putative odorant receptors (ORs) for the WRB in G. f. fuscipes, a non-model insect. We show that exposure of G. f. fuscipes in vivo to WRB odorant resulted in up- and downregulation of mRNA transcript of several ORs. The WRB component with strong feeding inhibition altered mRNA transcript differently as compared to an attractant odor, showing these two odors of opposing valence already segregate at the cellular and molecular levels. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the predicted ligand–OR binding pockets consisted mostly of hydrophobic residues with a few hydrogen bonds but a stable interaction. Finally, our electrophysiological response showed the olfactory sensory neurons of G. f. fuscipes tuned to the tsetse repellent components in different sensitivity and selectivity.</p>

Background<p>Multiparity – grand multiparity (i.e., five or more childbirths) in particular – has been reported to have an association with increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia or related cognitive decline in women. However, the pathological links underlying this relationship are still unknown. This study was conducted to examine the relationships of multiparity with cerebral amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, brain atrophy, and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs).</p>Methods<p>In this study, total of 237 older women with 148 cognitively normal and 89 mild cognitive impairment from the Korean Brain Aging Study for Early Diagnosis and Prediction of Alzheimer’s Disease (KBASE) were included. Participants underwent clinical and neuropsychological assessments in addition to <sup>11</sup>C-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The associations of parity with Aβ deposition, hippocampal volume, cortical volume, WMH volume and mini-mental status examination (MMSE) score were examined.</p>Results<p>Participants with grand multiparity showed significantly reduced adjusted hippocampal volume, spatial pattern of atrophy for recognition of AD volume and spatial pattern of atrophy for recognition of brain aging volume even after controlling for potential confounders. Furthermore, MMSE score was also significantly lower in this group. In contrast, grand multiparity did not show any association with global Aβ retention, Aβ positivity rate, or WMH volume, regardless of covariates.</p>Conclusion<p>Our findings suggest that grand multiparity contributes to cognitive decline or increased dementia risk in older women by aggravating amyloid-independent hippocampal or cortical atrophy.</p>

<p>Age-related structural and functional changes in the hippocampus can have a severe impact on hippocampal-dependent memory performance. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a real-world spatial exploration and learning intervention would improve hippocampal-dependent memory performance in healthy older adults. We developed a scavenger hunt task that participants performed over the course of a 4-week behavioral intervention period. Following this intervention, participants’ lure discrimination index (LDI) on the Mnemonic Similarity Task was significantly higher than it was at baseline and greater than that of a No-Contact Control Group, while traditional recognition scores remained relatively unchanged. These results point to the viability of a spatial exploration intervention for improving hippocampal-dependent memory in older adults.</p>

<p>It is increasingly becoming apparent that cerebrovascular dysfunction contributes to the pathogenic processes involved in vascular dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders. Under these pathologic conditions, the degeneration of cerebral blood vessels is frequently accompanied by a loss of mural cells from the vascular walls. Vascular mural cells play pivotal roles in cerebrovascular functions, such as regulation of cerebral blood flow and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Therefore, cerebrovascular mural cell impairment is involved in the pathophysiology of vascular-related encephalopathies, and protecting these cells is essential for maintaining brain health. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying mural cell abnormalities is incomplete. Several reports have indicated that dysregulated transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling is involved in the development of cerebral arteriopathies. These studies have specifically suggested the involvement of TGFβ overproduction. Although cerebrovascular toxicity via vascular fibrosis by extracellular matrix accumulation or amyloid deposition is known to occur with enhanced TGFβ production, whether increased TGFβ results in the degeneration of vascular mural cells in vivo remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that chronic TGFβ1 overproduction causes a dropout of mural cells and reduces their coverage on cerebral vessels in both smooth muscle cells and pericytes. Mural cell degeneration was also accompanied by vascular luminal dilation. TGFβ1 overproduction in astrocytes significantly increased TGFβ1 content in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and increased TGFβ signaling-regulated gene expression in both pial arteries and brain capillaries. These results indicate that TGFβ is an important effector that mediates mural cell abnormalities under pathological conditions related to cerebral arteriopathies.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58515">Functional specification of CCK+ interneurons by alternative isoforms of Kv4.3 auxiliary subunits</a></h4>

CCK-expressing interneurons (CCK+INs) are crucial for controlling hippocampal activity. We found two firing phenotypes of CCK+INs in rat hippocampal CA3 area; either possessing a previously undetected membrane potential-dependent firing or regular firing phenotype, due to different low-voltage-activated potassium currents. These different excitability properties destine the two types for distinct functions, because the former is essentially silenced during realistic 8–15 Hz oscillations. By contrast, the general intrinsic excitability, morphology and gene-profiles of the two types were surprisingly similar. Even the expression of Kv4.3 channels were comparable, despite evidences showing that Kv4.3-mediated currents underlie the distinct firing properties. Instead, the firing phenotypes were correlated with the presence of distinct isoforms of Kv4 auxiliary subunits (KChIP1 vs. KChIP4e and DPP6S). Our results reveal the underlying mechanisms of two previously unknown types of CCK+INs and demonstrate that alternative splicing of few genes, which may be viewed as a minor change in the cells’ whole transcriptome, can determine cell-type identity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58359">Synaptotagmin-1 is the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for fast striatal dopamine release</a></h4>

Dopamine powerfully controls neural circuits through neuromodulation. In the vertebrate striatum, dopamine adjusts cellular functions to regulate behaviors across broad time scales, but how the dopamine secretory system is built to support fast and slow neuromodulation is not known. Here, we set out to identify Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggering mechanisms for dopamine release. We find that synchronous dopamine secretion is abolished in acute brain slices of conditional knockout mice in which Synaptotagmin-1 is removed from dopamine neurons. This indicates that Synaptotagmin-1 is the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for fast dopamine release. Remarkably, dopamine release induced by strong depolarization and asynchronous release during stimulus trains are unaffected by Synaptotagmin-1 knockout. Microdialysis further reveals that these modes and action potential-independent release provide significant amounts of extracellular dopamine in vivo. We propose that the molecular machinery for dopamine secretion has evolved to support fast and slow signaling modes, with fast release requiring the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor Synaptotagmin-1.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58305">Damage-responsive, maturity-silenced enhancers regulate multiple genes that direct regeneration in <i>Drosophila</i></a></h4>

Like tissues of many organisms, <i>Drosophila</i> imaginal discs lose the ability to regenerate as they mature. This loss of regenerative capacity coincides with reduced damage-responsive expression of multiple genes needed for regeneration. We previously showed that two such genes, <i>wg</i> and <i>Wnt6</i>, are regulated by a single damage-responsive enhancer that becomes progressively inactivated via Polycomb-mediated silencing as discs mature (Harris et al., 2016). Here we explore the generality of this mechanism and identify additional damage-responsive, maturity-silenced (DRMS) enhancers, some near genes known to be required for regeneration such as <i>Mmp1</i>, and others near genes that we now show function in regeneration. Using a novel GAL4-independent ablation system we characterize two DRMS-associated genes, <i>apontic</i> (<i>apt</i>), which curtails regeneration and CG9752/<i>asperous (aspr)</i>, which promotes it. This mechanism of suppressing regeneration by silencing damage-responsive enhancers at multiple loci can be partially overcome by reducing activity of the chromatin regulator <i>extra sex combs</i> (<i>esc</i>).

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56754">A size principle for recruitment of <i>Drosophila</i> leg motor neurons</a></h4>

To move the body, the brain must precisely coordinate patterns of activity among diverse populations of motor neurons. Here, we use <i>in vivo</i> calcium imaging, electrophysiology, and behavior to understand how genetically-identified motor neurons control flexion of the fruit fly tibia. We find that leg motor neurons exhibit a coordinated gradient of anatomical, physiological, and functional properties. Large, fast motor neurons control high force, ballistic movements while small, slow motor neurons control low force, postural movements. Intermediate neurons fall between these two extremes. This hierarchical organization resembles the size principle, first proposed as a mechanism for establishing recruitment order among vertebrate motor neurons. Recordings in behaving flies confirmed that motor neurons are typically recruited in order from slow to fast. However, we also find that fast, intermediate, and slow motor neurons receive distinct proprioceptive feedback signals, suggesting that the size principle is not the only mechanism that dictates motor neuron recruitment. Overall, this work reveals the functional organization of the fly leg motor system and establishes <i>Drosophila</i> as a tractable system for investigating neural mechanisms of limb motor control.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54341">A conserved RNA degradation complex required for spreading and epigenetic inheritance of heterochromatin</a></h4>

Heterochromatic domains containing histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me) can be epigenetically inherited independently of underlying DNA sequence. To gain insight into the mechanisms that mediate epigenetic inheritance, we used a <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> inducible heterochromatin formation system to perform a genetic screen for mutations that abolish heterochromatin inheritance without affecting its establishment. We identified mutations in several pathways, including the conserved and essential Rix1-associated complex (henceforth the rixosome), which contains RNA endonuclease and polynucleotide kinase activities with known roles in ribosomal RNA processing. We show that the rixosome is required for spreading and epigenetic inheritance of heterochromatin in fission yeast. Viable rixosome mutations that disrupt its association with Swi6/HP1 fail to localize to heterochromatin, lead to accumulation of heterochromatic RNAs, and block spreading of H3K9me and silencing into actively transcribed regions. These findings reveal a new pathway for degradation of heterochromatic RNAs with essential roles in heterochromatin spreading and inheritance.

PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 are newly identified mechano-sensitive ion channels that exhibit a preference for calcium in response to mechanical stimuli. In this study, we discovered the vital roles of <i>pezo-1</i>, the sole <i>PIEZO</i> ortholog in <i>C. elegans,</i> in regulating reproduction. A number of deletion alleles as well as a putative gain-of-function mutant of PEZO-1 caused a severe reduction in brood size. <i>In vivo</i> observations showed that oocytes undergo a variety of transit defects as they enter and exit the spermatheca during ovulation. Post ovulation oocytes were frequently damaged during spermathecal contraction. However, the calcium signaling was not dramatically changed in the <i>pezo-1</i> mutants during ovulation. Loss of PEZO-1 also revealed an inability of self-sperm to properly navigate back to the spermatheca after being pushed out of the spermatheca during ovulation. These findings suggest that PEZO-1 acts in different reproductive tissues to promote proper ovulation and fertilization in <i>C. elegans</i>.

Ketamine exerts rapid antidepressant action in depressed and treatment-resistant depressed patients within hours. At the same time, ketamine elicits a unique form of functional synaptic plasticity that shares several attributes and molecular mechanisms with well-characterized forms of homeostatic synaptic scaling. Lithium is a widely used mood stabilizer also proposed to act via synaptic scaling for its antimanic effects. Several studies to date have identified specific forms of homeostatic synaptic plasticity that are elicited by these drugs used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders. In the last two decades, extensive work on homeostatic synaptic plasticity mechanisms have shown that they diverge from classical synaptic plasticity mechanisms that process and store information and thus present a novel avenue for synaptic regulation with limited direct interference with cognitive processes. In this review, we discuss the intersection of the findings from neuropsychiatric treatments and homeostatic plasticity studies to highlight a potentially wider paradigm for treatment advance.

<p>by Florent Meyniel</p>

Learning in a changing, uncertain environment is a difficult problem. A popular solution is to predict future observations and then use surprising outcomes to update those predictions. However, humans also have a sense of confidence that characterizes the precision of their predictions. Bayesian models use a confidence-weighting principle to regulate learning: for a given surprise, the update is smaller when the confidence about the prediction was higher. Prior behavioral evidence indicates that human learning adheres to this confidence-weighting principle. Here, we explored the human brain dynamics sub-tending the confidence-weighting of learning using magneto-encephalography (MEG). During our volatile probability learning task, subjects’ confidence reports conformed with Bayesian inference. MEG revealed several stimulus-evoked brain responses whose amplitude reflected surprise, and some of them were further shaped by confidence: surprise amplified the stimulus-evoked response whereas confidence dampened it. Confidence about predictions also modulated several aspects of the brain state: pupil-linked arousal and beta-range (15–30 Hz) oscillations. The brain state in turn modulated specific stimulus-evoked surprise responses following the confidence-weighting principle. Our results thus indicate that there exist, in the human brain, signals reflecting surprise that are dampened by confidence in a way that is appropriate for learning according to Bayesian inference. They also suggest a mechanism for confidence-weighted learning: confidence about predictions would modulate intrinsic properties of the brain state to amplify or dampen surprise responses evoked by discrepant observations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cCqNonMiEZE" width="1" />

Interpretations of elevated blood levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) for drug-induced liver injury often assume that the biomarker is released passively from dying cells. However, the mechanisms driving that release have not been explored experimentally. The usefulness of ALT and related biomarkers will improve by developing mechanism-based explanations of elevated levels that can be expanded and elaborated incrementally. We provide the means to challenge the ability of closely related model mechanisms to generate patterns of simulated hepatic injury and ALT release that scale (or not) to be quantitatively similar to the wet-lab validation targets, which are elevated plasma ALT values following acetaminophen (APAP) exposure in mice. We build on a published model mechanism that helps explain the generation of characteristic spatiotemporal features of APAP hepatotoxicity within hepatic lobules. Discrete event and agent-oriented software methods are most prominent. We instantiate and leverage a small constellation of concrete model mechanisms. Their details during execution help bring into focus ways in which particular sources of uncertainty become entangled with cause-effect details within and across several levels. We scale ALT amounts in virtual mice directly to target plasma ALT values in individual mice. A virtual experiment comprises a set of Monte Carlo simulations. We challenge the sufficiency of four potentially explanatory theories for ALT release. The first of the tested model theories failed to achieve the initial validation target, but each of the three others succeeded. Results for one of the three model mechanisms matched all target ALT values quantitatively. It explains how ALT externalization is the combined consequence of lobular-location-dependent drug-induced cellular damage and hepatocyte death. Falsification of one (or more) of the model mechanisms provides new knowledge and incrementally shrinks the constellation of model mechanisms.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuromodulatory regions that detect salience, such as amygdala and ventral tegmental area (VTA), have distinct effects on memory. Yet, questions remain about how these modulatory regions target subregions across the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe (MTL) cortex. Here, we sought to characterize how VTA and amygdala subregions (i.e., basolateral amygdala and central‐medial amygdala) interact with hippocampus head, body, and tail, as well as cortical MTL areas of perirhinal cortex and parahippocampal cortex in a task‐free state. To quantify these interactions, we used high‐resolution resting state fMRI and characterized pair‐wise, partial correlations across regions‐of‐interest. We found that basolateral amygdala showed greater functional coupling with hippocampus head, hippocampus tail, and perirhinal cortex when compared to either VTA or central‐medial amygdala. Furthermore, the VTA showed greater functional coupling with hippocampus tail when compared to central‐medial amygdala. There were no significant differences in functional coupling with hippocampus body and parahippocampal cortex. These results support a framework by which neuromodulatory regions do not indiscriminately influence all MTL subregions equally, but rather bias information processing to discrete MTL targets. These findings provide a more specified model of the intrinsic properties of systems underlying MTL neuromodulation. This emphasizes the need to consider heterogeneity both across and within neuromodulatory systems to better understand affective memory.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hippocampal circuitry has been posited to be fundamental to positive symptoms in psychosis, but its contributions to other factors important for outcome remains unclear. We hypothesized that longitudinal changes in the hippocampal circuit and concomitant changes of intracortical microstructure are altered in first episode psychosis (FEP) patients and that such changes are associated with negative symptoms and verbal memory. Longitudinal brain scans (2–4 visits over 3–15 months) were acquired for 27 FEP and 29 age‐ and sex‐matched healthy controls. Quantitative T1 maps, sensitive to myelin content, were used to sample the microstructure of the hippocampal subfields and output circuitry (fimbria, alveus, fornix, mammillary bodies), and intracortical regions. Dynamic anatomical covariance in pair‐wise regional trajectories were assessed for each subject, and graph theory was used to calculate a participation coefficient metric that quantifies the similarity/divergence between hippocampal and intracortical microstructure. The mean participation coefficient of the hippocampus was significantly reduced in FEP patients compared with controls, reflecting differences in output hippocampal regions. Importantly, lower participation coefficient of the hippocampal circuit was associated with worse negative symptoms, a relationship that was mediated by changes in verbal memory. This study provides evidence for reduced hippocampal centrality in FEP and concomitant changes in intracortical anatomy. Myelin‐rich output regions of the hippocampus may be an important biological trigger in early psychosis, with cascading effects on broader cortical networks and resultant clinical profiles.</p>

<p>Here, we show that the hemiellipsoid body of the true crab <i>Neohelice granulata </i> shares many of the insect mushroom body characters. In this brain center, which has previously been shown to reflect context‐dependent memory, we identified the presence of microglomeruli‐like complexes, input and output regions, aminergic innervation, adult neurogenesis, and elevated expression of proteins necessary for memory processes. <i>In vivo </i> calcium imaging suggests that, as in insect mushroom bodies, stimuli of different nature can trigger divergent neuronal activity patterns in the output region. The study provides a series of data that is parsimonious with a shared organization of memory centers across crustaceans and insects.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hypothesis of a common origin for high‐order memory centers in bilateral animals presents the question of how different brain structures, such as the vertebrate hippocampus and the arthropod mushroom bodies, are both structurally and functionally comparable. Obtaining evidence to support the hypothesis that crustaceans possess structures equivalent to the mushroom bodies that play a role in associative memories has proved challenging. Structural evidence supports that the hemiellipsoid bodies of hermit crabs, crayfish and lobsters, spiny lobsters, and shrimps are homologous to insect mushroom bodies. Although a preliminary description and functional evidence supporting such homology in true crabs (Brachyura) has recently been shown, other authors consider the identification of a possible mushroom body homologue in Brachyura as problematic. Here we present morphological and immunohistochemical data in <i>Neohelice granulata </i> supporting that crabs possess well‐developed hemiellipsoid bodies that are resolved as mushroom bodies‐like structures. <i>Neohelice </i> exhibits a peduncle‐like tract, from which processes project into proximal and distal domains with different neuronal specializations. The proximal domains exhibit spines and <i>en passant </i>‐like processes and are proposed here as regions mainly receiving inputs. The distal domains exhibit a “trauben”‐like compartmentalized structure with bulky terminal specializations and are proposed here as output regions. In addition, we found microglomeruli‐like complexes, adult neurogenesis, aminergic innervation, and elevated expression of proteins necessary for memory processes. Finally, <i>in vivo </i> calcium imaging suggests that, as in insect mushroom bodies, the output regions exhibit stimulus‐specific activity. Our results support the shared organization of memory centers across crustaceans and insects.</p>

<p>We examined the visual response properties of genetically targeted neurons in retina, optic tectum, and torus longitudinalis of larval zebrafish. Functional characterization of dimming responsive neurons within these visual areas revealed responses with varied photosensitivity profiles, including: 1) low sensitivity neurons that selectively respond to large light decrements, 2) high sensitivity neurons that selectively encode small decrements, and 3) broad sensitivity neurons that respond to a wide range of light decrements. Our data support a model in which parallel OFF channels generated in the retina remain segregated across three stages of visual processing.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Vertebrate retinas contain circuits specialized to encode light level decrements. This information is transmitted to the brain by dimming‐sensitive OFF retinal ganglion cells (OFF‐RGCs) that respond to light decrements with increased firing. It is known that OFF‐RGCs with distinct photosensitivity profiles form parallel visual channels to the vertebrate brain, yet how these channels are processed by first‐ and higher‐order brain areas has not been well characterized in any species. To address this question in the larval zebrafish visual system we examined the visual response properties of a genetically identified population of tectal neurons with a defined axonal projection to a second order visual area: <i>id2b:gal4‐ </i>positive torus longitudinalis projection neurons (TLPNs). TLPNs responded consistently to whole‐field dimming stimuli and exhibited the strongest responses when dimming was preceded by low light levels. Functional characterization of OFF‐RGC terminals in tectum revealed responses that varied in their photosensitivities: 1) low sensitivity OFF‐RGCs that selectively respond to large light decrements, 2) high sensitivity OFF‐RGCs that selectively encode small decrements, and 3) broad sensitivity OFF‐RGCs that respond to a wide range of light decrements. Diverse photosensitivity profiles were also observed using pan‐neuronal calcium imaging to identify dimming‐responsive neurons in both tectum and torus longitudinalis. Together these data support a model in which parallel OFF channels generated in the retina remain segregated across three stages of visual processing. Segregated OFF channels with different sensitivities may allow specific aspects of dimming‐evoked behaviors to be modulated by ambient light levels.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Myopia is induced when a growing eye wears a diffuser that deprives it of detailed spatial vision (form deprivation, FD). In chickens with optic nerve section (ONS), FD myopia still occurs, suggesting that the signals underlying myopia reside within the eye. As avian eyes differ from mammals, we asked whether local mechanisms also underlie FD myopia in a mammalian model. Young guinea pigs underwent either sham surgery followed by FD (SHAM+FD, n=7); or ONS followed by FD (ONS+FD, n=7); or ONS without FD (ONS, n=9). FD was initiated 3 days after surgery with a diffuser that was worn on the surgically treated eye for 14 days. Animals with ONS+FD developed ‐8.9 D of relative myopia and elongated by 135 μm more than in their untreated eyes after 2 weeks of FD. These changes were significantly greater than those in SHAM+FD animals (‐5.5 D and 40 μm of elongation after 14 days of FD), and reflected exaggerated elongation of the posterior chamber. The myopia reversed when FD was discontinued, despite ONS, but eyes did not recover back to normal (30 days after surgery, ONS+FD eyes still retained ‐3 D of relative myopia when SHAM+FD animals had returned to normal). No long‐term residual myopia was present after ONS alone, ruling out a surgical artefact. Although the gross mechanism signaling myopic ocular growth and its recovery in the young mammalian eye does not require an intact optic nerve, its fine‐tuning is disrupted by ONS.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Pigment epithelium‐derived factor (PEDF) is a multifunctional protein which was initially described in the retina, although it is also present in other tissues. It functions as an antioxidant agent promoting neuronal survival. Recently, a PEDF receptor has shown an elevated binding affinity for PEDF. There are no relevant data regarding the distribution of both proteins in the brain, therefore the main goal of this work was to investigate the spatiotemporal presence of PEDF and PEDFR in the adult mouse brain, and to determine the PEDF blood level in mouse and human. The localization of both proteins was analyzed by different experimental methods such as immunohistochemistry, western‐blotting, and also by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. Differential expression was found in some telencephalic structures and positive signals for both proteins were detected in the cerebellum. The magnitude of the PEDFR labeling pattern was higher than PEDF and included some cortical and subventricular areas. Age‐dependent changes in intensity of both protein immunoreactions were found in the cortical and hippocampal areas with greater reactivity between 4 and 8 months of age, whilst others, like the subventricular zones, these differences were more evident for PEDFR. Although ubiquitous presence was not found in the brain for these two proteins, their relevant functions must not be underestimated. It has been described that PEDF plays an important role in neuroprotection and data provided in the present work represents the first extensive study to understand the relevance of these two proteins in specific brain areas.</p>

<p>This study describes the anatomy of a cell bridge (CB) variant consisting of the fusion of the mouse nodose ganglion (NG) and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG). This anastomosis was tubular shaped and significantly more prevalent in the ganglionic masses from males (38%) than females (21%). It contained a mixed of vagal afferents (blue, tyrosine hydroxylase [TH] positive, Hand2 negative, and isolectin B4 negative; purple, TH negative, Hand2 negative, and isolectin B4 positive; gray, TH negative, Hand2 negative, and isolectin B4 negative) and postganglionic sympathetic neurons (green, TH positive and Hand2 positive). The two populations of neurons abruptly replaced each other in the middle of the cell bridge. The practical implications of our observations are discussed with respect to studies of the mouse vagal afferents, an area of research of increasing popularity.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>While autonomic ganglia have been extensively studied in rats instead of mice, there is renewed interest in the anatomy of the mouse autonomic nervous system. This study examined the prevalence and anatomical features of a cell bridge linking two autonomic ganglia of the neck, namely, the nodose ganglion (NG) and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) in a cohort of C57BL/6J mice. We identified a cell bridge between the NG and the cranial pole of the SCG. This cell bridge was tubular shaped with an average length and width of 700 and 240 μm, respectively. The cell bridge was frequently unilateral and significantly more prevalent in the ganglionic masses from males (38%) than females (21%). On each of its extremities, it contained a mixed of vagal afferents and postganglionic sympathetic neurons. The two populations of neurons abruptly replaced each other in the middle of the cell bridge. We examined the mRNA expression for selected autonomic markers in samples of the NG with or without cell bridge. Our results indicated that the cell bridge was enriched in both markers of postganglionic sympathetic and vagal afferents neurons. Lastly, using FluoroGold microinjection into the NG, we found that the existence of a cell bridge may occasionally lead to the inadvertent contamination of the SCG. In summary, this study describes the anatomy of a cell bridge variant consisting of the fusion of the mouse NG and SCG. The practical implications of our observations are discussed with respect to studies of the mouse vagal afferents, an area of research of increasing popularity.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56991">Dithranol targets keratinocytes, their crosstalk with neutrophils and inhibits the IL-36 inflammatory loop in psoriasis</a></h4>

Despite the introduction of biologics, topical dithranol (anthralin) has remained one of the most effective anti-psoriatic agents. Serial biopsies from human psoriatic lesions and both the c-Jun/JunB and imiquimod psoriasis mouse model allowed us to study the therapeutic mechanism of this drug. Top differentially expressed genes in the early response to dithranol belonged to keratinocyte and epidermal differentiation pathways and IL-1 family members (i.e. <i>IL36RN)</i> but not elements of the IL-17/IL-23 axis. In human psoriatic response to dithranol, rapid decrease in expression of keratinocyte differentiation regulators (e.g. involucrin, <i>SERPINB7</i> and <i>SERPINB13</i>), antimicrobial peptides (e.g. ß-defensins like <i>DEFB4A, DEFB4B, DEFB103A,</i> S100 proteins like <i>S100A7, S100A12</i>), chemotactic factors for neutrophils (e.g. <i>CXCL5, CXCL8</i>) and neutrophilic infiltration was followed with much delay by reduction in T cell infiltration. Targeting keratinocytes rather than immune cells may be an alternative approach in particular for topical anti-psoriatic treatment, an area with high need for new drugs.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56890">Diverse homeostatic and immunomodulatory roles of immune cells in the developing mouse lung at single cell resolution</a></h4>

At birth, the lungs rapidly transition from a pathogen-free, hypoxic environment to a pathogen-rich, rhythmically distended air-liquid interface. Although many studies have focused on the adult lung, the perinatal lung remains unexplored. Here, we present an atlas of the murine lung immune compartment during early postnatal development. We show that the late embryonic lung is dominated by specialized proliferative macrophages with a surprising physical interaction with the developing vasculature. These macrophages disappear after birth and are replaced by a dynamic mixture of macrophage subtypes, dendritic cells, granulocytes, and lymphocytes. Detailed characterization of macrophage diversity revealed an orchestration of distinct subpopulations across postnatal development to fill context-specific functions in tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, and immunity. These data both broaden the putative roles for immune cells in the developing lung and provide a framework for understanding how external insults alter immune cell phenotype during a period of rapid lung growth and heightened vulnerability.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56601">Hyperalignment: Modeling shared information encoded in idiosyncratic cortical topographies</a></h4>

Information that is shared across brains is encoded in idiosyncratic fine-scale functional topographies. Hyperalignment captures shared information by projecting pattern vectors for neural responses and connectivities into a common, high-dimensional information space, rather than by aligning topographies in a canonical anatomical space. Individual transformation matrices project information from individual anatomical spaces into the common model information space, preserving the geometry of pairwise dissimilarities between pattern vectors, and model cortical topography as mixtures of overlapping, individual-specific topographic basis functions, rather than as contiguous functional areas. The fundamental property of brain function that is preserved across brains is information content, rather than the functional properties of local features that support that content. In this Perspective, we present the conceptual framework that motivates hyperalignment, its computational underpinnings for joint modeling of a common information space and idiosyncratic cortical topographies, and discuss implications for understanding the structure of cortical functional architecture.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56159">Dynamic metastable long-living droplets formed by sticker-spacer proteins</a></h4>

Multivalent biopolymers phase separate into membrane-less organelles (MLOs) which exhibit liquid-like behavior. Here, we explore formation of prototypical MOs from multivalent proteins on various time and length scales and show that the kinetically arrested metastable multi-droplet state is a dynamic outcome of the interplay between two competing processes: a diffusion-limited encounter between proteins, and the exhaustion of available valencies within smaller clusters. Clusters with satisfied valencies cannot coalesce readily, resulting in metastable, long-living droplets. In the regime of dense clusters akin to phase-separation, we observe co-existing assemblies, in contrast to the single, large equilibrium-like cluster. A system-spanning network encompassing all multivalent proteins was only observed at high concentrations and large interaction valencies. In the regime favoring large clusters, we observe a slow-down in the dynamics of the condensed phase, potentially resulting in loss of function. Therefore, metastability could be a hallmark of dynamic functional droplets formed by sticker-spacer proteins.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55745">Lysosome activity is modulated by multiple longevity pathways and is important for lifespan extension in <i>C. elegans</i></a></h4>

Lysosomes play important roles in cellular degradation to maintain cell homeostasis. In order to understand whether and how lysosomes alter with age and contribute to lifespan regulation, we characterized multiple properties of lysosomes during the aging process in <i>C. elegans</i>. We uncovered age-dependent alterations in lysosomal morphology, motility, acidity and degradation activity, all of which indicate a decline in lysosome function with age. The age-associated lysosomal changes are suppressed in the long-lived mutants <i>daf-2</i>, <i>eat-2</i> and <i>isp-1</i>, which extend lifespan by inhibiting insulin/IGF-1 signaling, reducing food intake and impairing mitochondrial function, respectively. We found that 43 lysosome genes exhibit reduced expression with age, including genes encoding subunits of the proton pump V-ATPase and cathepsin proteases. The expression of lysosome genes is upregulated in the long-lived mutants, and this upregulation requires the functions of DAF-16/FOXO and SKN-1/NRF2 transcription factors. Impairing lysosome function affects clearance of aggregate-prone proteins and disrupts lifespan extension in <i>daf-2</i>, <i>eat-2</i> and <i>isp-1</i> worms. Our data indicate that lysosome function is modulated by multiple longevity pathways and is important for lifespan extension.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55470">Temperature compensation in a small rhythmic circuit</a></h4>

Temperature affects the conductances and kinetics of the ionic channels that underlie neuronal activity. Each membrane conductance has a different characteristic temperature sensitivity, which raises the question of how neurons and neuronal circuits can operate robustly over wide temperature ranges. To address this, we employed computational models of the pyloric network of crabs and lobsters. We produced multiple different models that exhibit a triphasic pyloric rhythm over a range of temperatures and explored the dynamics of their currents and how they change with temperature. Temperature can produce smooth changes in the relative contributions of the currents to neural activity so that neurons and networks undergo graceful transitions in the mechanisms that give rise to their activity patterns. Moreover, responses of the models to deletions of a current can be different at high and low temperatures, indicating that even a well-defined genetic or pharmacological manipulation may produce qualitatively distinct effects depending on the temperature.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54954">MARCH5 mediates NOXA-dependent MCL1 degradation driven by kinase inhibitors and integrated stress response activation</a></h4>

MCL1 has critical antiapoptotic functions and its levels are tightly regulated by ubiquitylation and degradation, but mechanisms that drive this degradation, particularly in solid tumors, remain to be established. We show here in prostate cancer cells that increased NOXA, mediated by kinase inhibitor activation of an integrated stress response, drives the degradation of MCL1, and identify the mitochondria-associated ubiquitin ligase MARCH5 as the primary mediator of this NOXA-dependent MCL1 degradation. Therapies that enhance MARCH5-mediated MCL1 degradation markedly enhance apoptosis in response to a BH3 mimetic agent targeting BCLXL, which may provide for a broadly effective therapy in solid tumors. Conversely, increased MCL1 in response to MARCH5 loss does not sensitize to BH3 mimetic drugs targeting MCL1, but instead also sensitizes to BCLXL inhibition, revealing a codependence between MARCH5 and MCL1 that may also be exploited in tumors with <i>MARCH5</i> genomic loss.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53913">TMEM95 is a sperm membrane protein essential for mammalian fertilization</a></h4>

The fusion of gamete membranes during fertilization is an essential process for sexual reproduction. Despite its importance, only three proteins are known to be indispensable for sperm-egg membrane fusion: the sperm proteins IZUMO1 and SPACA6, and the egg protein JUNO. Here we demonstrate that another sperm protein, TMEM95, is necessary for sperm-egg interaction. TMEM95 ablation in mice caused complete male-specific infertility. Sperm lacking this protein were morphologically normal exhibited normal motility, and could penetrate the zona pellucida and bind to the oolemma. However, once bound to the oolemma, TMEM95-deficient sperm were unable to fuse with the egg membrane or penetrate into the ooplasm, and fertilization could only be achieved by mechanical injection of one sperm into the ooplasm, thereby bypassing membrane fusion. These data demonstrate that TMEM95 is essential for mammalian fertilization.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51260">Dopaminergic modulation of the exploration/exploitation trade-off in human decision-making</a></h4>

Involvement of dopamine in regulating exploration during decision-making has long been hypothesized, but direct causal evidence in humans is still lacking. Here, we use a combination of computational modeling, pharmacological intervention and functional magnetic resonance imaging to address this issue. Thirty-one healthy male participants performed a restless four-armed bandit task in a within-subjects design under three drug conditions: 150 mg of the dopamine precursor L-dopa, 2 mg of the D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol, and placebo. Choices were best explained by an extension of an established Bayesian learning model accounting for perseveration, directed exploration and random exploration. Modeling revealed attenuated directed exploration under L-dopa, while neural signatures of exploration, exploitation and prediction error were unaffected. Instead, L-dopa attenuated neural representations of overall uncertainty in insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Our results highlight the computational role of these regions in exploration and suggest that dopamine modulates how this circuit tracks accumulating uncertainty during decision-making.

PTP is primarily caused by an increase in the readily releasable vesicle pool. PTP is associated with an increase in the docked vesicle pool, revealing a structural correlate of presynaptic plasticity.

Enlarged endosomes are an early cytopathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Knupp et al. deplete the AD risk gene SORL1, a sorting receptor, in hiPSCs and report endosome enlargement in differentiated neurons but not microglia. Endosome enlargement is not dependent on amyloidogenic processing of APP but affects its trafficking within neurons.

Huckins et al. apply transcriptomic imputation to the PGC-PTSD GWAS to reveal tissue-gene associations. The results suggest substantial genetic heterogeneity based on ancestry, cohort type (military versus civilian), and sex. Results—especially the predicted downregulation of SNRNP35 in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex—are validated by findings in humans, cell culture, and mice.

Takahashi et al. show that NAT1 is crucial for the self-renewal and neural differentiation of primed PSCs. Loss of NAT1 induced significant increase of HERV-H transcripts. NAT1 promotes the translation of TUT7, which controls HERV-H expression. Taken together, the NAT1/TUT7/HERV-H axis plays important roles in neural differentiation of PSCs.

Takeishi et al. biofabricate human livers for transplantation using human hepatocytes, biliary epithelial cells, and vascular endothelial cells. All originate from induced pluripotent stem cells, human mesenchymal cells, and fibroblasts. The organ-like microenvironment further matures some liver functions and produces tissue structures similar to those found in human livers.

Mehta et al. use APOBEC3A to demonstrate that HMCES responds to ssDNA abasic sites in cells and prevents replication fork collapse. APOBEC3A-induced abasic sites slow both leading and lagging strand polymerization, and HMCES engagement prevents further fork slowing because of the action of TLS polymerases zeta (Polζ) and kappa (Polκ).

Fast purinergic signaling is mediated by ATP-gated P2X receptors. Salm et al. perform functional screening with a genome-wide ORF collection and identify TMEM163, which modulates the channel properties and pharmacology of P2XRs and ATP-evoked behavior. They propose TMEM163 as a critical modulator of fast purinergic signaling.

Alternative splicing contributes to all steps of brain development. Farini et al. show that maturation of the cerebellum involves a dynamic splicing program that mainly affects synaptic genes. Precocious dysregulation of this program by Sam68 ablation alters cerebellar neuronal connectivity and results in defective motor coordination and social behavior.

Becker et al. demonstrate that CAFs present with a pro-glycolytic phenotype, which helps to fuel the metabolism of breast cancer cells and promotes tumor growth. Chronic hypoxia induces the metabolic rewiring of normal fibroblasts toward a CAF-like, pro-glycolytic phenotype. These microenvironmental changes enabled the epigenetic alterations and expression of key glycolytic enzymes in CAFs.

CTTNBP2, an autism-associated cytoskeleton regulator, controls dendritic spine formation and maintenance. Using mouse genetic models, Shih et al. show that Cttnbp2 deficiency impairs the synaptic targeting of a set of zinc-regulated autism-associated genes and results in autism-like behaviors. Zinc supplementation and D-cycloserine ameliorate neuronal and behavioral defects of Cttnbp2 mutant mice.

Wesely et al. report that AML-iPSC-derived hematopoietic cells are hierarchically organized and contain cells with hallmark features of LSCs (iLSCs). Through integrative genomic studies of bulk and single-cell transcriptomes and chromatin accessibility, they derive a LSC gene signature and identify RUNX1 as an AML LSC dependency with therapeutic implications.

den Brave et al. show that the Hsp40 chaperone Apj1 promotes Hsp70-dependent disaggregation of intra-nuclear protein aggregates. This Hsp104-independent disaggregation activity promotes proteolytic turnover and competes with substrate refolding. Co-ordinated disaggregation with turnover protects against potential toxicity of solubilized proteins.

<p>by Giulio Ruffini, Ricardo Salvador, Ehsan Tadayon, Roser Sanchez-Todo, Alvaro Pascual-Leone, Emiliano Santarnecchi</p>

Several decades of research suggest that weak electric fields may influence neural processing, including those induced by neuronal activity and proposed as a substrate for a potential new cellular communication system, i.e., ephaptic transmission. Here we aim to model mesoscopic ephaptic activity in the human brain and explore its trajectory during aging by characterizing the electric field generated by cortical dipoles using realistic finite element modeling. Extrapolating from electrophysiological measurements, we first observe that modeled endogenous field magnitudes are comparable to those in measurements of weak but functionally relevant self-generated fields and to those produced by noninvasive transcranial brain stimulation, and therefore possibly able to modulate neuronal activity. Then, to evaluate the role of these fields in the human cortex in large MRI databases, we adapt an interaction approximation that considers the relative orientation of neuron and field to estimate the membrane potential perturbation in pyramidal cells. We use this approximation to define a simplified metric (EMOD1) that weights dipole coupling as a function of distance and relative orientation between emitter and receiver and evaluate it in a sample of 401 realistic human brain models from healthy subjects aged 16–83. Results reveal that ephaptic coupling, in the simplified mesoscopic modeling approach used here, significantly decreases with age, with higher involvement of sensorimotor regions and medial brain structures. This study suggests that by providing the means for fast and direct interaction between neurons, ephaptic modulation may contribute to the complexity of human function for cognition and behavior, and its modification across the lifespan and in response to pathology.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qqipGVcY2wg" width="1" />

J-domain proteins (JDPs), obligatory Hsp70 cochaperones, play critical roles in protein homeostasis. They promote key allosteric transitions that stabilize Hsp70 interaction with substrate polypeptides upon hydrolysis of its bound ATP. Although a recent crystal structure revealed the physical mode of interaction between a J-domain and an Hsp70, the structural and dynamic consequences of J-domain action once bound and how Hsp70s discriminate among its multiple JDP partners remain enigmatic. We combined free energy simulations, biochemical assays and evolutionary analyses to address these issues. Our results indicate that the invariant aspartate of the J-domain perturbs a conserved intramolecular Hsp70 network of contacts that crosses domains. This perturbation leads to destabilization of the domain-domain interface—thereby promoting the allosteric transition that triggers ATP hydrolysis. While this mechanistic step is driven by conserved residues, evolutionarily variable residues are key to initial JDP/Hsp70 recognition—via electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged surfaces. We speculate that these variable residues allow an Hsp70 to discriminate amongst JDP partners, as many of them have coevolved. Together, our data points to a two-step mode of J-domain action, a recognition stage followed by a mechanistic stage.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QKhvBg2Ay6I" width="1" />

<p>by Miguel Capllonch-Juan, Francisco Sepulveda</p>

Artificial electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves for sensory feedback restoration can greatly benefit from computational models for simulation-based neural implant design in order to reduce the trial-and-error approach usually taken, thus potentially significantly reducing research and development costs and time. To this end, we built a computational model of a peripheral nerve trunk in which the interstitial space between the fibers and the tissues was modelled using a resistor network, thus enabling distance-dependent ephaptic coupling between myelinated axons and between fascicles as well. We used the model to simulate a) the stimulation of a nerve trunk model with a cuff electrode, and b) the propagation of action potentials along the axons. Results were used to investigate the effect of ephaptic interactions on recruitment and selectivity stemming from artificial (i.e., neural implant) stimulation and on the relative timing between action potentials during propagation. Ephaptic coupling was found to increase the number of fibers that are activated by artificial stimulation, thus reducing the artificial currents required for axonal recruitment, and it was found to reduce and shift the range of optimal stimulation amplitudes for maximum inter-fascicular selectivity. During propagation, while fibers of similar diameters tended to lock their action potentials and reduce their conduction velocities, as expected from previous knowledge on bundles of identical axons, the presence of many other fibers of different diameters was found to make their interactions weaker and unstable.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9LYYJGiFpOs" width="1" />

We study the pathogenesis of <i>Francisella tularensis</i> infection with an experimental mouse model, agent-based computation and mathematical analysis. Following inhalational exposure to <i>Francisella tularensis</i> SCHU S4, a small initial number of bacteria enter lung host cells and proliferate inside them, eventually destroying the host cell and releasing numerous copies that infect other cells. Our analysis of disease progression is based on a stochastic model of a population of infectious agents inside one host cell, extending the birth-and-death process by the occurrence of catastrophes: cell rupture events that affect all bacteria in a cell simultaneously. Closed expressions are obtained for the survival function of an infected cell, the number of bacteria released as a function of time after infection, and the total bacterial load. We compare our mathematical analysis with the results of agent-based computation and, making use of approximate Bayesian statistical inference, with experimental measurements carried out after murine aerosol infection with the virulent SCHU S4 strain of the bacterium <i>Francisella tularensis</i>, that infects alveolar macrophages. The posterior distribution of the rate of replication of intracellular bacteria is consistent with the estimate that the time between rounds of bacterial division is less than 6 hours <i>in vivo</i>.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4LaLP1GtotU" width="1" />

<p>by Lei Xiong, Kai Zhao, Yu Cao, Hao-Han Guo, Jin-Xiu Pan, Xiao Yang, Xiao Ren, Lin Mei, Wen-Cheng Xiong</p>

The nuclear lamina protein lamin A/C is a key component of the nuclear envelope. Mutations in the lamin A/C gene (<i>LMNA</i>) are identified in patients with various types of laminopathy-containing diseases, which have features of accelerated aging and osteoporosis. However, the underlying mechanisms for laminopathy-associated osteoporosis remain largely unclear. Here, we provide evidence that loss of lamin A/C in skeletal muscles, but not osteoblast (OB)-lineage cells, results in not only muscle aging–like deficit but also trabecular bone loss, a feature of osteoporosis. The latter is due in large part to elevated bone resorption. Further cellular studies show an increase of osteoclast (OC) differentiation in cocultures of bone marrow macrophages/monocytes (BMMs) and OBs after treatment with the conditioned medium (CM) from lamin A/C–deficient muscle cells. Antibody array screening analysis of the CM proteins identifies interleukin (IL)-6, whose expression is markedly increased in lamin A/C–deficient muscles. Inhibition of IL-6 by its blocking antibody in BMM-OB cocultures diminishes the increase of osteoclastogenesis. Knockout (KO) of IL-6 in muscle lamin A/C–KO mice diminishes the deficits in trabecular bone mass but not muscle. Further mechanistic studies reveal an elevation of cellular senescence marked by senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), p16<sup>Ink4a</sup>, and p53 in lamin A/C–deficient muscles and C2C12 muscle cells, and the p16<sup>Ink4a</sup> may induce senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and IL-6 expression. Taken together, these results suggest a critical role for skeletal muscle lamin A/C to prevent cellular senescence, IL-6 expression, hyperosteoclastogenesis, and trabecular bone loss, uncovering a pathological mechanism underlying the link between muscle aging/senescence and osteoporosis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/orKeAPv1UCs" width="1" />

Data-driven research in biomedical science requires structured, computable data. Increasingly, these data are created with support from automated text mining. Text-mining tools have rapidly matured: although not perfect, they now frequently provide outstanding results. We describe 10 straightforward writing tips—and a web tool, PubReCheck—guiding authors to help address the most common cases that remain difficult for text-mining tools. We anticipate these guides will help authors’ work be found more readily and used more widely, ultimately increasing the impact of their work and the overall benefit to both authors and readers. PubReCheck is available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubrecheck.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/jph2sfXU3Xo" width="1" />

<p>Early life stress (ELS) induces long‐lasting social behavior deficits.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Trauma during critical periods of development can induce long‐lasting adverse effects. To study neural aberrations resulting from early life stress (ELS), many studies utilize rodent maternal separation, whereby pups are intermittently deprived of maternal care necessary for proper development. This can produce adulthood behavioral deficits related to anxiety, reward, and social behavior. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) encodes aspects of anxiety‐like and social behaviors, and also undergoes developmental maturation during the early postnatal period, rendering it vulnerable to effects of ELS. Mice underwent maternal separation (separation 4 hr/day during postnatal day (PD)2–5 and 8 hr/day on PD6‐16) with early weaning on PD17, which induced behavioral deficits in adulthood performance on two‐part social interaction task designed to test social motivation (choice between a same‐sex novel conspecific or an empty cup) and social novelty preference (choice between the original‐novel conspecific vs. a new‐novel conspecific). We used chemogenetics to non‐selectively silence or activate neurons in the BNST to examine its role in social motivation and social novelty preference, in mice with or without the history of ELS. Manipulation of BNST produced differing social behavior effects in non‐stressed versus ELS mice; social motivation was decreased in non‐stressed mice following BNST activation, but unchanged following BNST silencing, while ELS mice showed no change in social behavior after BNST activation, but exhibited enhancement of social motivation—for which they were deficient prior—following BNST silencing. Findings emphasize the BNST as a potential therapeutic target for social anxiety disorders instigated by childhood trauma.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Whole brain neuroanatomy using tera‐voxel light‐microscopic data sets is of much current interest. A fundamental problem in this field is the mapping of individual brain data sets to a reference space. Previous work has not rigorously quantified in‐vivo to ex‐vivo distortions in brain geometry from tissue processing. Further, existing approaches focus on registering unimodal volumetric data; however, given the increasing interest in the marmoset model for neuroscience research and the importance of addressing individual brain architecture variations, new algorithms are necessary to cross‐register multimodal data sets including MRIs and multiple histological series. Here we present a computational approach for same‐subject multimodal MRI‐guided reconstruction of a series of consecutive histological sections, jointly with diffeomorphic mapping to a reference atlas. We quantify the scale change during different stages of brain histological processing using the Jacobian determinant of the diffeomorphic transformations involved. By mapping the final image stacks to the ex‐vivo post‐fixation MRI, we show that (a) tape‐transfer assisted histological sections can be reassembled accurately into 3D volumes with a local scale change of 2.0 ± 0.4% per axis dimension; in contrast, (b) tissue perfusion/fixation as assessed by mapping the in‐vivo MRIs to the ex‐vivo post fixation MRIs shows a larger median absolute scale change of 6.9 ± 2.1% per axis dimension. This is the first systematic quantification of local metric distortions associated with whole‐brain histological processing, and we expect that the results will generalize to other species. These local scale changes will be important for computing local properties to create reference brain maps.</p>

Perceptual rivalry is characterized by spontaneous alternations in perceptual state in response to ambiguous or conflicting sensory input.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This review in memoriam of Jack Pettigrew provides an overview of past and current research into the phenomenon of multistable perception across multiple animal species. Multistable perception is characterized by two or more perceptual interpretations spontaneously alternating, or rivaling, when animals are exposed to stimuli with inherent sensory ambiguity. There is a wide array of ambiguous stimuli across sensory modalities, ranging from the configural changes observed in simple line drawings, such as the famous Necker cube, to the alternating perception of entire visual scenes that can be instigated by interocular conflict. The latter phenomenon, called binocular rivalry, in particular caught the attention of the late Jack Pettigrew, who combined his interest in the neuronal basis of perception with a unique comparative biological approach that considered ambiguous sensation as a fundamental problem of sensory systems that has shaped the brain throughout evolution. Here, we examine the research findings on visual perceptual alternation and suppression in a wide variety of species including insects, fish, reptiles, and primates. We highlight several interesting commonalities across species and behavioral indicators of perceptual alternation. In addition, we show how the comparative approach provides new avenues for understanding how the brain suppresses opposing sensory signals and generates alternations in perceptual dominance.</p>

<h2>Graphical Abstract</h2>
<p>Unlike the geniculocortical pathway which interconnects only between the lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex (V1), the pulvinar has long been known to interconnect with most if not all of visual cortex. Here we show that pulvinar interconnectivity is actually more dominant with higher visual cortex (V2) than with V1. Thus, the pulvinocortical pathway does not likely play as big a role in directly modulating V1 activity as previously thought.

</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The extrageniculate visual pathway, which carries visual information from the retina through the superficial layers of the superior colliculus and the pulvinar, is poorly understood. The pulvinar is thought to modulate information flow between cortical areas, and has been implicated in cognitive tasks like directing visually guided actions. In order to better understand the underlying circuitry, we performed retrograde injections of modified rabies virus in the visual cortex and pulvinar of the Long‐Evans rat. We found a relatively small population of cells projecting to primary visual cortex (V1), compared to a much larger population projecting to higher visual cortex. Reciprocal corticothalamic projections showed a similar result, implying that pulvinar does not play as big a role in directly modulating rodent V1 activity as previously thought.</p>

<p>In the resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we used a Granger causality analysis (GCA) to identify direction of information flow and whether the impact of that flow was excitatory or inhibitory of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in patients with obsessive‐compulsive disorder (OCD). Results showed decreased amplitude of low‐frequency fluctuation in left pregenual ACC (pACC) in patients than controls. There was significantly decreased excitatory output from the left pACC to both right dorsal superior frontal gyrus (dSFG) and left precuneus in patients compared with controls. Patients also had decreased inhibitory input to left pACC from left ventral SFG and left thalamus and caudate relative to controls. In patients, path coefficients of GCA from left pACC to right dSFG showed significant negative correlations with obsession and anxiety ratings. Decreased spontaneous neural activity and altered effective connectivity of pACC with widely distributed cortical circuitry, and associations with clinical ratings highlight the importance of pACC functional alteration in OCD.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling neuropsychiatric disorder whose neurobiological basis remains unclear. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have reported functional and structural alterations of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in OCD. In this study, we explored the functional activity of subregions of the ACC and effective connectivity (EC) between ACC subregions and the whole brain in OCD. We used a Granger causality analysis (GCA) to identify the direction of information flow and whether the impact of that flow was excitatory or inhibitory. We performed resting‐state functional MRI in 31 patients with OCD and 36 healthy controls and analyzed the amplitude of low‐frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and coefficient‐based GCA. The left pregenual ACC (pACC) in patients with OCD showed decreased ALFF relative to controls. There was significantly decreased excitatory output from the left pACC to both right dorsal superior frontal gyrus (dSFG) and left precuneus in patients compared with controls. Patients also had decreased inhibitory input to left pACC from left ventral SFG and left thalamus and caudate relative to controls. Results were similar in drug‐naive patients and those with prior but not current psychopharmacological treatment. In patients, path coefficients of GCA from left pACC to right dSFG showed significant negative correlations with obsession and anxiety ratings. Decreased spontaneous neural activity and altered EC of pACC with widely distributed cortical circuitry, and associations with clinical ratings highlight the importance of pACC functional alteration in OCD.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Voltage‐gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Ca<sub>V</sub>) channels are crucial for neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission upon depolarization. Their properties <i>in vivo </i> are modulated by their interaction with a variety of scaffolding proteins. Such interactions can influence the function and localization of Ca<sub>V</sub> channels, as well as their coupling to intracellular second messengers and regulatory pathways, thus amplifying their signaling potential. Among these scaffolding proteins, a subset of PDZ (postsynaptic density‐95, Drosophila discs‐large, and zona occludens)‐domain containing proteins play diverse roles in modulating Ca<sub>V</sub> channel properties. At the presynaptic terminal, PDZ proteins enrich Ca<sub>V</sub> channels in the active zone, enabling neurotransmitter release by maintaining a tight and vital link between channels and vesicles. In the postsynaptic density, these interactions are essential in regulating dendritic spine morphology and postsynaptic signaling cascades. In this review, we highlight the studies that demonstrate dynamic regulations of neuronal Ca<sub>V</sub> channels by PDZ proteins. We discuss the role of PDZ proteins in controlling channel activity, regulating channel cell surface density, and influencing channel‐mediated downstream signaling events. We highlight the importance of PDZ protein regulations of Ca<sub>V</sub> channels and evaluate the link between this regulatory effect and human disease.</p>

<p>We compared post‐ictal hypoperfusion ASL MRI data in epilepsy patients to healthy controls to determine the location of the seizure onset zone (SOZ). This comparison identified the clinically suspected SOZ in 59% of patients. These findings matched our previous subtraction ASL MRI study (Gaxiola‐Valdez et al., 2017).</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI can provide seizure onset zone (SOZ) localizing information in up to 80% of patients. Clinical implementation of this technique is limited by the need to obtain two scans per patient: a postictal scan that is subtracted from an interictal scan. We aimed to determine whether it is possible to limit the number of ASL scans to one per patient by comparing patient postictal ASL scans to baseline scans of 100 healthy controls. Eighteen patients aged 20–55 years underwent ASL MRI &lt;90 min after a seizure and during the interictal period. Each postictal cerebral blood flow (CBF) map was statistically compared to average baseline CBF maps from 100 healthy controls (pvcASL; patient postictal CBF vs. control baseline CBF). The pvcASL maps were compared to subtraction ASL maps (sASL; patient baseline CBF minus patient postictal CBF). Postictal CBF reductions from pvcASL and sASL maps were seen in 17 of 18 (94.4%) and 14 of 18 (77.8%) patients, respectively. Maximal postictal hypoperfusion seen in pvcASL and sASL maps was concordant with the SOZ in 10 of 17 (59%) and 12 of 14 (86%) patients, respectively. In seven patients, both pvcASL and sASL maps showed similar results. In two patients, sASL showed no significant hypoperfusion, while pvcASL showed significant hypoperfusion concordant with the SOZ. We conclude that pvcASL is clinically useful and although it may have a lower overall concordance rate than sASL, pvcASL does provide localizing or lateralizing information for specific cases that would be otherwise missed through sASL.</p>

<p>Alterations in serotonergic transmission have been related to a major predisposition to develop psychiatric pathologies, such as depression. We took advantage of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) 2 deficient rats, characterized by a complete absence of serotonin in the brain, to evaluate whether a vulnerable genotype may influence the reaction to an acute stressor. In this context, we investigated if the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) genomic pathway activation was altered by the lack of serotonin in the central nervous system. Moreover, we analyzed the transcription pattern of the clock genes that can be affected by acute stressors. Adult wild type (TPH2<sup>+/+</sup>) and TPH2-deficient (TPH2<sup>−/−</sup>) male rats were sacrificed after exposure to one single session of acute restraint stress. Protein and gene expression analyses were conducted in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The acute stress enhanced the translocation of GRs in the nucleus of TPH2<sup>+/+</sup> animals. This effect was blunted in TPH2<sup>−/−</sup> rats, suggesting an impairment of the GR genomic mechanism. This alteration was mirrored in the expression of GR-responsive genes: acute stress led to the up-regulation of GR-target gene expression in TPH2<sup>+/+</sup>, but not in TPH2<sup>−/−</sup> animals. Finally, clock genes were differently modulated in the two genotypes after the acute restraint stress. Overall our findings suggest that the absence of serotonin within the brain interferes with the ability of the HPA axis to correctly modulate the response to acute stress, by altering the nuclear mechanisms of the GR and modulation of clock genes expression.</p>

<p>Myopia is a substantial public health problem worldwide. In the myopic retina, distant images are focused in front of the photoreceptors. The cells and mechanisms for retinal signaling that account either for emmetropization (i.e., normal refraction) or for refractive errors have remained elusive. Gap junctions play a key component in enhancement of signal transmission in visual pathways. AII amacrine cells (ACs), coupled by connexin36, segregate signals into ON and OFF pathways. Coupling between AII ACs is actively modulated through phosphorylation at serine 293 via dopamine in the mouse retina. In this study, form deprivation mouse myopia models were used to evaluate the expression patterns of connexin36-positive plaques (structural assay) and the state of connexin36 phosphorylation (functional assay) in AII ACs, which was green fluorescent protein-expressing in the Fam81a mouse line. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed dopaminergic synapse and gap junction pathways of AII ACs were downregulated in the myopic retina, although Gjd2 mRNA expression remained the same. Compared with the normal refractive eye, phosphorylation of connexin36 was increased in the myopic retina, but expression of connexin36 remained unchanged. This increased phosphorylation of Cx36 could indicate increased functional gap junction coupling of AII ACs in the myopic retina, a possible adaptation to adjust to the altered noisy signaling status.</p>

In this review, we approach Parkinson’s disease (PD) in the context of an evolutionary mismatch of central nervous system functions. The neurons at risk have hyperbranched axons, extensive transmitter release sites, display spontaneous spiking, and elevated mitochondrial stress. They function in networks largely unchanged throughout vertebrate evolution, but now connecting to the expanded human cortex. Their breakdown is favoured by longevity. At the cellular level, mitochondrial dysfunction starts at the synapses, then involves axons and cell bodies.

Barbar et al. identify CD49f as a novel surface marker expressed by human astrocytes that can purify hiPSC-astrocytes and primary fetal astrocytes. CD49f+ hiPSC-astrocytes respond to pro-inflammatory stimuli and become A1 reactive astrocytes, which are dysfunctional and secrete neurotoxic factors that induce apoptosis in human and rodent neurons.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent evidence implicates endogenous pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) in the aversive effect of nicotine. In the present study, we assessed if nicotine‐induced conditioned place preference (CPP) or affective signs of nicotine withdrawal would be altered in the absence of PACAP and if there were any sex‐related differences in these responses. Male and female mice lacking PACAP and their wild‐type controls were tested for baseline place preference on day 1, received conditioning with saline or nicotine (1 mg/kg) on alternate days for 6 days and were then tested for CPP the next day. Mice were then exposed to four additional conditioning and were tested again for nicotine‐induced CPP 24 hr later. Controls were conditioned with saline in both chambers and tested similarly. All mice were then, 96 hr later, challenged with mecamylamine (3 mg/kg), and tested for anxiety‐like behaviors 30 min later. Mice were then, 2 hr later, forced to swim for 15 min and then tested for depression‐like behaviors 24 hr later. Our results showed that male but not female mice lacking PACAP expressed a significant CPP that was comparable to their wild‐type controls. In contrast, male but not female mice lacking PACAP exhibited reduced anxiety‐ and depression‐like behaviors compared to their wild‐type controls following the mecamylamine challenge. These results suggest that endogenous PACAP is involved in affective signs of nicotine withdrawal, but there is a sex‐related difference in this response.</p>

<p>Locations of waking/arousal‐related cell groups of the brainstem and caudal diencephalon at which general anesthetics exert anesthetic actions. They include the pontomesencephalic reticular formation (PRF), locus coeruleus (LC), parabrachial nucleus (PB), tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) and orexin‐containing cells of the lateral hypothalamus.  General anesthetics have been shown to suppress the activity of each of these structures to induce anesthesia whereas their activation (e.g., by electrical stimulation) hastens the recovery from anesthesia.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We review evidence challenging the hypothesis that memories are processed or consolidated in sleep. We argue that the brain is in an unconscious state in sleep, akin to general anesthesia, and hence is incapable of meaningful cognitive processing – the sole purview of waking consciousness. At minimum, the encoding of memories in sleep would require that waking events are faithfully transferred to and reproduced in sleep. Remarkably, however, this has never been demonstrated, as waking experiences are never truly replicated in sleep but rather appear in very altered or distorted forms. General anesthetics (GAs) exert their effects through endogenous sleep‐wake control systems and accordingly GAs and sleep share several common features: sensory blockade, immobility, amnesia and lack of awareness (unconsciousness). The loss of consciousness in non‐REM (NREM) sleep or to GAs is characterized by: (1) delta oscillations throughout the cortex; (2) marked reductions in neural activity (from waking) over widespread regions of the cortex, most pronounced in frontal and parietal cortices; and (3) a significant disruption of the functional connectivity of thalamocortical and corticocortical networks, particularly those involved in “higher order” cognitive functions. Several (experimental) reports in animals and humans have shown that disrupting the activity of the cortex, particularly the orbitofrontal cortex, severely impairs higher order cognitive and executive functions. The profound and widespread deactivation of the cortex in the unconscious states of NREM sleep or GA would be expected to produce an equivalent, or undoubtedly a much greater, disruptive effect on mnemonic and cognitive functions. In conclusion, we contend that the unconscious, severely altered state of the brain in NREM sleep would negate any possibility of cognitive processing in NREM sleep.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Rett Syndrome, <i>CDKL5 </i>‐Deficiency Disorder, <i>FOXG1 </i> Disorder, and <i>MECP2 </i> Duplication Disorder are Developmental Encephalopathies with shared and distinct features. Though historically linked, no direct comparison has been performed. The first head‐to‐head comparison of clinical features in these conditions is presented.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Comprehensive clinical information was collected from 793 individuals enrolled in the Rett Syndrome and Related Disorders Natural History Study. Clinical features including clinical severity, regression, and seizures were cross‐sectionally compared between diagnoses to test the hypothesis that these are 4 distinct disorders.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Distinct patterns of clinical severity, seizure onset age, and regression were present. Individuals with <i>CDKL5 </i>‐Deficency Disorder were the most severely affected and had the youngest age of seizure onset (2 months) whereas children with <i>MECP2 </i>‐duplication syndrome had the oldest median age of seizure onset (64 months) and lowest severity scores. Rett syndrome and <i>FOGX1 </i> were intermediate in both features. Smaller head circumference correlates with increased severity in all disorders and earlier age of seizure onset in MECP2‐duplication syndrome. Developmental regression occurred in all Rett syndrome participants (median 18 months) but only 23–34% of the other disorders. Seizure incidence prior to the baseline visit was highest for <i>CDKL5 </i>‐Deficency Disorder (96.2%) and lowest for Rett syndrome (47.5%). Other clinical features including seizure types and frequency differed amongst groups.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>While these Developmental Encephalopathies share many clinical features, clear differences in severity, regression, and seizures warrant considering them as unique disorders. These results will aid in the development of disease specific severity scales, precise therapeutics, and future clinical trials.</p>

<p>Studies of the phenotype and population distribution of rare genetic forms of parkinsonism are required, now that gene‐targeting approaches for Parkinson's disease have reached the clinical trial stage. We evaluated the frequencies of <i>PRKN </i>, <i>PINK1 </i>, and <i>DJ‐1 </i> mutations in a cohort of 1587 cases.

<p>by Martín Carballo-Pacheco, Michael D. Nicholson, Elin E. Lilja, Rosalind J. Allen, Bartlomiej Waclaw</p>

Phenotypic delay—the time delay between genetic mutation and expression of the corresponding phenotype—is generally neglected in evolutionary models, yet recent work suggests that it may be more common than previously assumed. Here, we use computer simulations and theory to investigate the significance of phenotypic delay for the evolution of bacterial resistance to antibiotics. We consider three mechanisms which could potentially cause phenotypic delay: effective polyploidy, dilution of antibiotic-sensitive molecules and accumulation of resistance-enhancing molecules. We find that the accumulation of resistant molecules is relevant only within a narrow parameter range, but both the dilution of sensitive molecules and effective polyploidy can cause phenotypic delay over a wide range of parameters. We further investigate whether these mechanisms could affect population survival under drug treatment and thereby explain observed discrepancies in mutation rates estimated by Luria-Delbrück fluctuation tests. While the effective polyploidy mechanism does not affect population survival, the dilution of sensitive molecules leads both to decreased probability of survival under drug treatment and underestimation of mutation rates in fluctuation tests. The dilution mechanism also changes the shape of the Luria-Delbrück distribution of mutant numbers, and we show that this modified distribution provides an improved fit to previously published experimental data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cTXAdBu9x_Y" width="1" />

<p>by Tyler A. Joseph, Liat Shenhav, Joao B. Xavier, Eran Halperin, Itsik Pe’er</p>

Dynamic changes in microbial communities play an important role in human health and disease. Specifically, deciphering how microbial species in a community interact with each other and their environment can elucidate mechanisms of disease, a problem typically investigated using tools from community ecology. Yet, such methods require measurements of absolute densities, whereas typical datasets only provide estimates of relative abundances. Here, we systematically investigate models of microbial dynamics in the simplex of relative abundances. We derive a new nonlinear dynamical system for microbial dynamics, termed “compositional” Lotka-Volterra (cLV), unifying approaches using generalized Lotka-Volterra (gLV) equations from community ecology and compositional data analysis. On three real datasets, we demonstrate that cLV recapitulates interactions between relative abundances implied by gLV. Moreover, we show that cLV is as accurate as gLV in forecasting microbial trajectories in terms of relative abundances. We further compare cLV to two other models of relative abundance dynamics motivated by common assumptions in the literature—a linear model in a log-ratio transformed space, and a linear model in the space of relative abundances—and provide evidence that cLV more accurately describes community trajectories over time. Finally, we investigate when information about direct effects can be recovered from relative data that naively provide information about only indirect effects. Our results suggest that strong effects may be recoverable from relative data, but more subtle effects are challenging to identify.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uCOijCLgqwg" width="1" />

<p>by M-Hossein Moeinzadeh, Jun Yang, Evgeny Muzychenko, Giuseppe Gallone, David Heller, Knut Reinert, Stefan Haas, Martin Vingron</p>

Reconstructing haplotypes from sequencing data is one of the major challenges in genetics. Haplotypes play a crucial role in many analyses, including genome-wide association studies and population genetics. Haplotype reconstruction becomes more difficult for higher numbers of homologous chromosomes, as it is often the case for polyploid plants. This complexity is compounded further by higher heterozygosity, which denotes the frequent presence of variants between haplotypes. We have designed <i>Ranbow</i>, a new tool for haplotype reconstruction of polyploid genome from short read sequencing data. <i>Ranbow</i> integrates all types of small variants in bi- and multi-allelic sites to reconstruct haplotypes. To evaluate <i>Ranbow</i> and currently available competing methods on real data, we have created and released a real gold standard dataset from sweet potato sequencing data. Our evaluations on real and simulated data clearly show <i>Ranbow</i>’s superior performance in terms of accuracy, haplotype length, memory usage, and running time. Specifically, <i>Ranbow</i> is one order of magnitude faster than the next best method. The efficiency and accuracy of <i>Ranbow</i> makes whole genome haplotype reconstruction of complex genome with higher ploidy feasible.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/04uZOmXwKcs" width="1" />

<p>by Yuval Hart, Maryam Vaziri-Pashkam, L. Mahadevan</p>

The ability to infer intention lies at the basis of many social interactions played out via motor actions. We consider a simple paradigm of this ability in humans using data from experiments simulating an antagonistic game between an Attacker and a Blocker. Evidence shows early inference of an Attacker move by as much as 100ms but the nature of the informational cues signaling the impending move remains unknown. We show that the transition to action has the hallmark of a critical transition that is accompanied by early warning signals. These early warning signals occur as much as 130 ms before motion ensues—showing a sharp rise in motion autocorrelation at lag-1 and a sharp rise in the autocorrelation decay time. The early warning signals further correlate strongly with Blocker response times. We analyze the variance of the motion near the point of transition and find that it diverges in a manner consistent with the dynamics of a fold-transition. To test if humans can recognize and act upon these early warning signals, we simulate the dynamics of fold-transition events and ask people to recognize the onset of directional motion: participants react faster to fold-transition dynamics than to its uncorrelated counterpart. Together, our findings suggest that people can recognize the intent and onset of motion by inferring its early warning signals.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vm9oxoW9JN0" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Dysfunctional social behavior is a major clinical feature of mood, anxiety, autism spectrum, and substance‐related disorders, and may dramatically contribute to the poor outcome of these diseases. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying social behavior deficits are still largely unknown. The corticotropin‐releasing factor (CRF) system, a major coordinator of the stress response, has been hypothesized to modulate social behavior. CRF signaling is mediated by two receptor types, termed CRF<sub>1</sub> and CRF<sub>2</sub>. Using the three‐chamber task for sociability (i.e., preference for an unfamiliar conspecific vs. an object), this study demonstrates that CRF<sub>2</sub> receptor null mutation (CRF<sub>2</sub>−/−) reduces sociability in female mice <i>but </i> increases it in male mice. Both female and male CRF<sub>2</sub>−/− mice display a preference for social odor cues over neutral cues, indicating that sex‐ and CRF<sub>2</sub> receptor‐dependent sociability is not due to altered olfaction or impaired social cues discrimination. Moreover, treatment with the CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor‐preferring antagonist, antalarmin, consistently induces sociability in non‐social mice but disrupts it in social mice, independently of CRF<sub>2</sub> receptor deficiency. Sex, CRF<sub>2</sub> receptor deficiency, or antalarmin affect locomotor activity during the three‐chamber test. However, throughout the study CRF<sub>1</sub> and CRF<sub>2</sub> receptor‐linked sociability is independent of locomotor activity. The present findings highlight major functions for the CRF system in the regulation of social behavior. Moreover, they provide initial evidence of sex‐linked roles for the CRF<sub>1</sub> and the CRF<sub>2</sub> receptor, emphasizing the importance of sex as a major biological variable to be taken into consideration in preclinical and clinical studies.</p>

<p>Many animals, just like humans, are able to categorize objects based on physical appearance. In humans, training improves performance in such tasks by distorting perceived similarity at the category boundary, a nonlinear effect termed categorical perception (CP). Here we sought evidence for a comparable effect in a lower vertebrate. Based on stimuli generated using a novel image morphing technique, we describe a series of visual discrimination experiments demonstrating CP of facial patterns in a reef fish, providing insight into the evolutionary origins and neural bases of this ability.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Categorical perception (CP) is the phenomenon by which a smoothly varying stimulus property undergoes a nonlinear transformation during processing in the brain. Consequently, the stimuli are perceived as belonging to distinct categories separated by a sharp boundary. Originally thought to be largely innate, the discovery of CP in tasks such as novel image discrimination has piqued the interest of cognitive scientists because it provides compelling evidence that learning can shape a category's perceptual boundaries. CP has been particularly closely studied in human face perception. In nonprimates, there is evidence for CP for sound and color discrimination, but not for image or face discrimination. Here, we investigate the potential for learned CP in a lower vertebrate, the damselfish <i>Pomacentrus amboinensis. </i> Specifically, we tested whether the ability of these fish to discriminate complex facial patterns tracked categorical rather than metric differences in the stimuli. We first trained the fish to discriminate sets of two facial patterns. Next, we morphed between these patterns and determined the just noticeable difference (JND) between a morph and original image. Finally, we tested for CP by analyzing the discrimination ability of the fish for pairs of JND stimuli along the spectrum of morphs between two original images. Discrimination performance was significant for the image pair straddling the boundary between categories, and chance for equivalent stimulus pairs on either side, thus producing the classic “category boundary” effect. Our results reveal how perception can be influenced in a top‐down manner even in the absence of a visual cortex.</p>

Abstract
<p>Humans can reason at an abstract level and structure information into abstract categories, but the underlying neural processes have remained unknown. Recent experimental data provide the hint that this is likely to involve specific subareas of the brain from which structural information can be decoded. Based on this data, we introduce the concept of assembly projections, a general principle for attaching structural information to content in generic networks of spiking neurons. According to the assembly projections principle, structure-encoding assemblies emerge and are dynamically attached to content representations through Hebbian plasticity mechanisms. This model provides the basis for explaining a number of experimental data and provides a basis for modeling abstract computational operations of the brain.</p>

Abstract
<p>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been recently demonstrated to induce neuroprotective and synaptotrophic effects on lesioned neurons. Hitherto, the administration of VEGF in different animal models of lesion or disease has been conducted following a chronic protocol of administration. We questioned whether a single dose of VEGF, administered intraventricularly, could induce long-term neurotrophic effects on injured motoneurons. For this purpose, we performed in cats the axotomy of abducens motoneurons and the injection of VEGF into the fourth ventricle in the same surgical session and investigated the discharge characteristics of axotomized and treated motoneurons by single-unit extracellular recordings in the chronic alert preparation. We found that injured motoneurons treated with a single VEGF application discharged with normal characteristics, showing neuronal eye position (EP) and velocity sensitivities similar to control, thereby preventing the axotomy-induced alterations. These effects were present for a prolonged period of time (50 d) after VEGF administration. By confocal immunofluorescence we also showed that the synaptic stripping that ensues lesion was not present, rather motoneurons showed a normal synaptic coverage. Moreover, we demonstrated that VEGF did not lead to any angiogenic response pointing to a direct action of the factor on neurons. In summary, a single dose of VEFG administered just after motoneuron axotomy is able to prevent for a long time the axotomy-induced firing and synaptic alterations without any associated vascular sprouting. We consider that these data are of great relevance due to the potentiality of VEGF as a therapeutic agent in neuronal lesions and diseases.</p>

Abstract
<p>The mu-opioid receptor (MOR) modulates nociceptive pathways and reward processing, and mediates the strong analgesic and addictive properties of both medicinal as well as abused opioid drugs. MOR function has been extensively studied, and tools to manipulate or visualize the receptor protein are available. However, circuit mechanisms underlying MOR-mediated effects are less known, because genetic access to MOR-expressing neurons is lacking. Here we report the generation of a knock-in <i>Oprm1</i>-Cre mouse line, which allows targeting and manipulating MOR opioid-responsive neurons. A cDNA encoding a T2A cleavable peptide and Cre recombinase fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP/Cre) was inserted downstream of the <i>Oprm1</i> gene sequence. The resulting <i>Oprm1-</i>Cre line shows intact <i>Oprm1</i> gene transcription. MOR and EGFP/Cre proteins are coexpressed in the same neurons, and localized in cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, respectively. MOR signaling is unaltered, demonstrated by maintained DAMGO-induced G-protein activation, and <i>in vivo</i> MOR function is preserved as indicated by normal morphine-induced analgesia, hyperlocomotion, and sensitization. The Cre recombinase efficiently drives the expression of Cre-dependent reporter genes, shown by local virally mediated expression in the medial habenula and brain-wide fluorescence on breeding with tdTomato reporter mice, the latter showing a distribution patterns typical of MOR expression. Finally, we demonstrate that optogenetic activation of MOR neurons in the ventral tegmental area of <i>Oprm1</i>-Cre mice evokes strong avoidance behavior, as anticipated from the literature. The <i>Oprm1</i>-Cre line is therefore an excellent tool for both mapping and functional studies of MOR-positive neurons, and will be of broad interest for opioid, pain, and addiction research.</p>

Abstract
<p>People often fail to individuate members of social outgroups, a phenomenon known as the outgroup homogeneity effect. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) repetition suppression to investigate the neural representation underlying this effect. In a preregistered study, White human perceivers (<i>N </i>=<i> </i>29) responded to pairs of faces depicting White or Black targets. In each pair, the second face depicted either the same target as the first face, a different target from the same race, or a scrambled face outline. We localized face-selective neural regions via an independent task, and demonstrated that neural activity in the fusiform face area (FFA) distinguished different faces only when targets belonged to the perceivers’ racial ingroup (White). By contrast, face-selective cortex did not discriminate between other-race individuals. Moreover, across two studies (total <i>N </i>=<i> </i>67) perceivers were slower to discriminate between different outgroup members and remembered them to a lesser extent. Together, these results suggest that the outgroup homogeneity effect arises when early-to-mid-level visual processing results in an erroneous overlap of representations of outgroup members.</p>

Abstract
<p>Trigeminal neuropathic pain (TNP) is often resistant to current pharmacotherapy, and there is a pressing need to develop more efficacious treatments. Capsaicin is a pungent ingredient of chili peppers and specifically activates transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV1), a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable ion channel. Topical capsaicin invariably induces burning pain. Paradoxically, the transient pain is often followed by prolonged attenuation of the preexisting pathologic pain from the same region. However, the mechanisms underlying capsaicin-induced analgesia are not well understood. Although the reports of the involvement of TRPV1 and TRPV1+ afferents in neuropathic pain are controversial, we recently demonstrated that TRPV1 and TRPV1+ afferents are involved in mechanical hyperalgesia in mice with chronic constriction injury of the infraorbital nerve (ION-CCI). Consistently, chemogenetic inhibition of TRPV1-lineage (TRPV1-LN) afferents attenuated mechanical hyperalgesia and ongoing pain. In mice with ION-CCI, we found that a single focal injection of capsaicin into facial skin led to attenuation of mechanical hyperalgesia over two weeks. Capsaicin treatment also attenuated secondary hyperalgesia in extraterritorial mandibular skin. Furthermore, capsaicin treatment decreased ongoing pain. Longitudinal <i>in vivo</i> two-photon imaging of cutaneous nerve fibers showed that such capsaicin-induced analgesia is correlated with cutaneous nerve terminal density. Furthermore, preventing capsaicin-induced ablation of afferent terminals by co-administration of capsaicin with MDL28170, an inhibitor of calpain, abolished capsaicin-induced analgesia. These results suggest that a single focal injection of capsaicin induces long-lasting analgesia for neuropathic pain via selective ablation of TRPV1+ afferent terminals and that TRPV1+ afferents contribute to the maintenance of TNP.</p>

Abstract
<p>In a similar manner to other learning paradigms, intact muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) neurotransmission or protein synthesis regulation in the anterior insular cortex (aIC) is necessary for appetitive taste learning. Here we describe a parallel local molecular pathway, where GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor control of mAChR activation causes upregulation of miRNA-182 and quinone reductase 2 (QR2) mRNA destabilization in the rodent aIC. Damage to long-term memory by prevention of this process, with the use of mAChR antagonist scopolamine before novel taste learning, can be rescued by local QR2 inhibition, demonstrating that QR2 acts downstream of local muscarinic activation. Furthermore, we prove for the first time the presence of endogenous QR2 cofactors in the brain, establishing QR2 as a functional reductase there. In turn, we show that QR2 activity causes the generation of reactive oxygen species, leading to modulation in Kv2.1 redox state. QR2 expression reduction therefore is a previously unaccounted mode of mAChR-mediated inflammation reduction, and thus adds QR2 to the cadre of redox modulators in the brain. The concomitant reduction in QR2 activity during memory consolidation suggests a complementary mechanism to the well established molecular processes of this phase, by which the cortex gleans important information from general sensory stimuli. This places QR2 as a promising new target to tackle neurodegenerative inflammation and the associated impediment of novel memory formation in diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To evaluate disease symptoms, and clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and to perform longitudinal volumetric MRI analyses in a European multicenter cohort of pediatric anti–N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDARE) patients.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied 38 children with NMDARE (median age = 12.9 years, range =1–18) and a total of 82 MRI scans for volumetric MRI analyses compared to matched healthy controls. Mixed‐effect models and brain volume <i>z </i> scores were applied to estimate longitudinal brain volume development. Ordinal logistic regression and ordinal mixed models were used to predict disease outcome and severity.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Initial MRI scans showed abnormal findings in 15 of 38 (39.5%) patients, mostly white matter T2/fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensities. Volumetric MRI analyses revealed reductions of whole brain and gray matter as well as hippocampal and basal ganglia volumes in NMDARE children. Longitudinal mixed‐effect models and <i>z </i> score transformation showed failure of age‐expected brain growth in patients. Importantly, patients with abnormal MRI findings at onset were more likely to have poor outcome (Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score &gt; 1, incidence rate ratio = 3.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.31–9.31, <i>p </i> = 0.012) compared to patients with normal MRI. Ordinal logistic regression models corrected for time from onset confirmed abnormal MRI at onset (odds ratio [OR] = 9.90, 95% CI = 2.51–17.28, <i>p </i> = 0.009), a presentation with sensorimotor deficits (OR = 13.71, 95% CI = 2.68–24.73, <i>p </i> = 0.015), and a treatment delay &gt; 4 weeks (OR = 5.15, 95% CI = 0.47–9.82, <i>p </i> = 0.031) as independent predictors of poor clinical outcome.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Children with NMDARE exhibit significant brain volume loss and failure of age‐expected brain growth. Abnormal MRI findings, a clinical presentation with sensorimotor deficits, and a treatment delay &gt; 4 weeks are associated with worse clinical outcome. These characteristics represent promising prognostic biomarkers in pediatric NMDARE. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>Over the past decade, theta-burst stimulation (TBS) has become a focus of interest in neurostimulatory research. Compared to conventional repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), TBS produces more robust changes in cortical excitability (CE). There is also some evidence of an analgesic effect of the method. Previously published studies have suggested that different TBS parameters elicit opposite effects of TBS on CE. While intermittent TBS (iTBS) facilitates CE, continuous TBS (cTBS) attenuates it. However, prolonged TBS (pTBS) with twice the number of stimuli produces the opposite effect. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study with healthy subjects (n = 24), we investigated the effects of various pTBS (cTBS, iTBS, and placebo TBS) over the right motor cortex on CE and pain perception. Changes in resting motor thresholds (RMTs) and absolute motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes were assessed before and at two time-points (0–5 min; 40–45 min) after pTBS. Tactile and thermal pain thresholds were measured before and 5 min after application. Compared to the placebo, prolonged cTBS (pcTBS) transiently increased MEP amplitudes, while no significant changes were found after prolonged iTBS. However, the facilitation of CE after pcTBS did not induce a parallel analgesic effect. We confirmed that pcTBS with twice the duration converts the conventional inhibitory effect into a facilitatory one. Despite the short-term boost of CE following pcTBS, a corresponding analgesic effect was not demonstrated. Therefore, the results indicate a more complex regulation of pain, which cannot be explained entirely by the modulation of excitability.</p>

<p>Brain derived exosomes (BDEs) are extracellular nanovesicles that are collectively released by all cell lineages of the central nervous system and contain cargo from their original cells. They are emerging as key mediators of communication and waste management among neurons, glial cells and connective tissue during both physiological and pathological conditions in the brain. We review the rapidly growing frontier of BDEs biology in recent years including the involvement of exosomes in neuronal development, maintenance and communication through their multiple signaling functions. Particularly, we highlight the important role of exosomes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), both as a pathogenic agent and as a disease biomarker. Our understanding of such unique nanovesicles may offer not only answers about the (patho) physiological course in AD and associated neurodegenerative diseases but also ideal methods to develop these vesicles as vehicles for drug delivery or as tools to monitor brain diseases in a non-invasive manner because crossing the blood brain barrier is an inherent capability of exosomes. BDEs have potential as biomarkers and as therapeutic tools for AD and related brain disorders in the near future.</p>

<p>Genetic analyses of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have revealed a strong association between mutations in genes encoding many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), including TARDBP, FUS, hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2B1, MATR3, ATXN2, TAF15, TIA-1, and EWSR1, and disease onset/progression. RBPs are a group of evolutionally conserved proteins that participate in multiple steps of RNA metabolism, including splicing, polyadenylation, mRNA stability, localization, and translation. Dysregulation of RBPs, as a consequence of gene mutations, impaired nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, posttranslational modification (PTM), aggregation, and sequestration by abnormal RNA foci, has been shown to be involved in neurodegeneration and the development of ALS. While the exact mechanism by which dysregulated RBPs contribute to ALS remains elusive, emerging evidence supports the notion that both a loss of function and/or a gain of toxic function of these ALS-linked RBPs play a significant role in disease pathogenesis through facilitating abnormal protein interaction, causing aberrant RNA metabolism, and by disturbing ribonucleoprotein granule dynamics and phase transition. In this review article, we summarize the current knowledge on the molecular mechanism by which RBPs are dysregulated and the influence of defective RBPs on cellular homeostasis during the development of ALS. The strategies of ongoing clinical trials targeting RBPs and/or relevant processes are also discussed in the present review.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00198">Visual Feedback of Object Motion Direction Influences the Timing of Grip Force Modulation During Object Manipulation</a></h4>

<p>During manipulation, object slipping is prevented by modulating the grip force (GF) in synchrony with motion-related inertial forces, i.e., load force (LF). However, due to conduction delays of the sensory system, GF must be modulated in advance based on predictions of LF changes. It has been proposed that such predictive force control relies on internal representations, i.e., internal models, of the relation between the dynamic of the environment and movement kinematics. Somatosensory and visual feedback plays a primary role in building these internal representations. For instance, it has been shown that manipulation-dependent somatosensory signals contribute to building internal representations of gravity in normal and altered gravitational contexts. Furthermore, delaying the timing of visual feedback of object displacement has been shown to affect GF. Here, we explored whether and the extent to which spatial features of visual feedback movement, such as motion direction, may contribute to GF control. If this were the case, a spatial mismatch between actual (somatosensory) and visual feedback of object motion would elicit changes in GF modulation. We tested this hypothesis by asking participants to generate vertical object movements while visual feedback of object position was congruent (0° rotation) or incongruent (180° or 90°) with the actual object displacement. The role of vision on GF control was quantified by the temporal shift of GF modulation as a function of visual feedback orientation and actual object motion direction. GF control was affected by visual feedback when this was incongruent in the vertical (180°), but not horizontal dimension. Importantly, 180° visual feedback rotation delayed and anticipated GF modulation during upward and downward actual movements, respectively. Our findings suggest that during manipulation, spatial features of visual feedback motion are used to predict upcoming LF changes. Furthermore, the present study provides evidence that an internal model of gravity contributes to GF control by influencing sensory reweighting processes during object manipulation.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00187">Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation With the Theta-Band Portion of the Temporally-Aligned Speech Envelope Improves Speech-in-Noise Comprehension</a></h4>

<p>Transcranial alternating current stimulation with the speech envelope can modulate the comprehension of speech in noise. The modulation stems from the theta- but not the delta-band portion of the speech envelope, and likely reflects the entrainment of neural activity in the theta frequency band, which may aid the parsing of the speech stream. The influence of the current stimulation on speech comprehension can vary with the time delay between the current waveform and the audio signal. While this effect has been investigated for current stimulation based on the entire speech envelope, it has not yet been measured when the current waveform follows the theta-band portion of the speech envelope. Here, we show that transcranial current stimulation with the speech envelope filtered in the theta frequency band improves speech comprehension as compared to a sham stimulus. The improvement occurs when there is no time delay between the current and the speech stimulus, as well as when the temporal delay is comparatively short, 90 ms. In contrast, longer delays, as well as negative delays, do not impact speech-in-noise comprehension. Moreover, we find that the improvement of speech comprehension at no or small delays of the current stimulation is consistent across participants. Our findings suggest that cortical entrainment to speech is most influenced through current stimulation that follows the speech envelope with at most a small delay. They also open a path to enhancing the perception of speech in noise, an issue that is particularly important for people with hearing impairment.</p>

<p>Recent research into axon-glial interactions in the nervous system has made a compelling case that glial cells have a relevant role in the metabolic support of axons, and that, in the case of myelinating cells, this role is independent of myelination itself. In this mini-review article, we summarize some of those observations and focus on Schwann cells (SC), drawing parallels between glia of the central and peripheral nervous systems (PNS), pointing out limitations in current knowledge, and discussing its potential clinical relevance. First, we introduce SC, their development and main roles, and follow with an evolutionary perspective of glial metabolic function. Then we provide evidence of the myelin-independent aspects of axonal support and their coupling to neuronal metabolism. Finally, we address the opportunity to use SC-axon metabolic interactions as therapeutic targets to treat peripheral neuropathies.</p>

<p>The ability of new neurons to promote repair of brain circuitry depends on their capacity to re-establish afferent and efferent connections with the host. In this review article, we give an overview of past and current efforts to restore damaged connectivity in the adult mammalian brain using implants of fetal neuroblasts or stem cell-derived neuronal precursors, with a focus on strategies aimed to repair damaged basal ganglia circuitry induced by lesions that mimic the pathology seen in humans affected by Parkinson’s or Huntington’s disease. Early work performed in rodents showed that neuroblasts obtained from striatal primordia or fetal ventral mesencephalon can become anatomically and functionally integrated into lesioned striatal and nigral circuitry, establish afferent and efferent connections with the lesioned host, and reverse the lesion-induced behavioral impairments. Recent progress in the generation of striatal and nigral progenitors from pluripotent stem cells have provided compelling evidence that they can survive and mature in the lesioned brain and re-establish afferent and efferent axonal connectivity with a remarkable degree of specificity. The studies of cell-based circuitry repair are now entering a new phase. The introduction of genetic and virus-based techniques for brain connectomics has opened entirely new possibilities for studies of graft-host integration and connectivity, and the access to more refined experimental techniques, such as chemo- and optogenetics, has provided new powerful tools to study the capacity of grafted neurons to impact the function of the host brain. Progress in this field will help to guide the efforts to develop therapeutic strategies for cell-based repair in Huntington’s and Parkinson’s disease and other neurodegenerative conditions involving damage to basal ganglia circuitry.</p>

<p>Although Alzheimer’s disease presents homogeneous histopathology, it causes several clinical phenotypes depending on brain regions involved. Beside the most abundant memory variant, several atypical variants exist. Among them posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is associated with severe visuospatial/visuoperceptual deficits in the absence of significant primary ocular disease. Here, we report for the first time a case of Capgras delusion—a delusional misidentification syndrome, where patients think that familiar persons are replaced by identical “doubles” or an impostor—in a patient with PCA. The 57-year-old female patient was diagnosed with PCA and developed Capgras delusion 8 years after first symptoms. The patient did not recognize her husband, misidentified him as a stranger, and perceived him as a threat. Such misidentifications did not happen for other persons. Events could be interrupted by reassuring the husband’s identity by the patient’s female friend or children. We applied in-depth multimodal neuroimaging phenotyping and used single-subject voxel-based morphometry to identify atrophy changes specifically related to the development of the Capgras delusion. The latter, based on structural T1 magnetic resonance imaging, revealed progressive gray matter volume decline in occipital and temporoparietal areas, involving more the right than the left hemisphere, especially at the beginning. Correspondingly, the right fusiform gyrus was already affected by atrophy at baseline, whereas the left fusiform gyrus became involved in the further disease course. At baseline, glucose hypometabolism as measured by positron emission tomography (PET) with F18-fluorodesoxyglucose (FDG-PET) was evident in the parietooccipital cortex, more pronounced right-sided, and in the right frontotemporal cortex. Amyloid accumulation as assessed by PET with F18-florbetaben was found in the gray matter of the neocortex indicating underlying Alzheimer’s disease. Appearance of the Capgras delusion was related to atrophy in the right posterior cingulate gyrus/precuneus, as well as right middle frontal gyrus/frontal eye field, supporting right frontal areas as particularly relevant for Capgras delusion. Atrophy in these regions respectively might affect the default mode and dorsal attention networks as shown by meta-analytical co-activation and resting state functional connectivity analyses. This case elucidates the brain-behavior relationship in PCA and Capgras delusion.</p>

<p>Aerobic exercise has both neuroprotective and neurorehabilitative benefits. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood and need to be investigated, especially in postmenopausal women, who are at increased risk of age-related disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and stroke. To advance our understanding of the potential neurological benefits of aerobic exercise in aging women, we examined anatomical and functional responses that may differentiate women of varying cardiorespiratory fitness using neuroimaging and neurophysiology. A total of 35 healthy postmenopausal women were recruited (59 ± 3 years) and cardiorespiratory fitness estimated (22–70 mL/kg/min). Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to assess -aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate (Glu) receptor function in the primary motor cortex (M1), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to quantify GABA and Glu concentrations in M1. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess mean cortical thickness (MCT) of sensorimotor and frontal regions, while the microstructure of sensorimotor and other white matter tracts was evaluated through diffusion tensor imaging. Regression analysis revealed that higher fitness levels were associated with improved microstructure in pre-motor and sensory tracts, and the hippocampal cingulum. Fitness level was not associated with MCT, MRS, or neurophysiology measures. These data indicate that, in postmenopausal women, higher cardiorespiratory fitness is linked with preserved selective white matter microstructure, particularly in areas that influence sensorimotor control and memory.</p>

Tasaka et al. show that the temporal association cortex (TeA) receives monosynaptic inputs from widespread cortical and subcortical regions. TeA shows strong functional connectivity to the primary auditory cortex. In the context of motherhood, TeA plays an important role in encoding and perceiving pup ultrasonic vocalizations by mothers.

Yoshimatsu et al. show that larval zebrafish rely on single UV cones at a time to support visual prey capture. For this, zebrafish combine molecular, cellular, and circuit tuning to regionally boost detectability of prey in their acute zone. The mechanisms of this specialization tally with those of the primate fovea.

<p>by Cameron Meaney, Sander Rhebergen, Mohammad Kohandel</p>

Tumour hypoxia is a well-studied phenomenon with implications in cancer progression, treatment resistance, and patient survival. While a clear adverse prognosticator, hypoxia is also a theoretically ideal target for guided drug delivery. This idea has lead to the development of hypoxia-activated prodrugs (HAPs): a class of chemotherapeutics which remain inactive in the body until metabolized within hypoxic regions. In theory, these drugs have the potential for increased tumour selectivity and have therefore been the focus of numerous preclinical studies. Unfortunately, HAPs have had mixed results in clinical trials, necessitating further study in order to harness their therapeutic potential. One possible avenue for the improvement of HAPs is through the selective application of anti angiogenic agents (AAs) to improve drug delivery. Such techniques have been used in combination with other conventional chemotherapeutics to great effect in many studies. A further benefit is theoretically achieved through nanocell administration of the combination, though this idea has not been the subject of any experimental or mathematical studies to date. In the following, a mathematical model is outlined and used to compare the predicted efficacies of separate vs. nanocell administration for AAs and HAPs in tumours. The model is experimentally motivated, both in mathematical form and parameter values. Preliminary results of the model are highlighted throughout which qualitatively agree with existing experimental evidence. The novel prediction of our model is an improvement in the efficacy of AA/HAP combination therapies when administered through nanocells as opposed to separately. While this study specifically models treatment on glioblastoma, similar analyses could be performed for other vascularized tumours, making the results potentially applicable to a range of tumour types.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CIXvvwFFclE" width="1" />

<p>by Xin Yuan, Conor W. Sipe, Miyuki Suzawa, Michelle L. Bland, Sarah E. Siegrist</p>

Dietary nutrients provide macromolecules necessary for organism growth and development. In response to animal feeding, evolutionarily conserved growth signaling pathways are activated, leading to increased rates of cell proliferation and tissue growth. It remains unclear how different cell types within developing tissues coordinate growth in response to dietary nutrients and whether coordinated growth of different cell types is necessary for proper tissue function. Here, we report that <i>Drosophila</i> neural stem cells, known as neuroblasts, reactivate from developmental quiescence in a dietary-nutrient–dependent manner. Neuroblast reactivation in the brain requires nonautonomous activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) signaling from cortex glia and tracheal processes, both of which are closely associated with neuroblasts. Furthermore, PI3-kinase activation in neuroblasts is required nonautonomously for glial membrane expansion and robust neuroblast–glial contact. Finally, PI3-kinase is required cell autonomously for nutrient-dependent growth of neuroblasts, glia, and trachea. Of the 7 <i>Drosophila</i> insulin-like peptides (Dilps), we find that Dilp-2 is required for PI3-kinase activation and growth coordination between neuroblasts and glia in the brain. Dilp-2 induces brain cortex glia to initiate membrane growth and make first contact with quiescent neuroblasts. After contact, neuroblasts increase in size and reenter S-phase. Once reactivated from quiescence, neuroblasts promote growth of cortex glia, which, in turn, form a selective membrane barrier around neuroblasts and their newborn progeny. Our results highlight the importance of bidirectional growth signaling between neural stem cells and surrounding cell types in the brain in response to nutrition and demonstrate how coordinated growth among different cell types drives tissue morphogenesis and function.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/pBqX1ztcA14" width="1" />

<p>by Neele S. Dellschaft, George Hutchinson, Simon Shah, Nia W. Jones, Chris Bradley, Lopa Leach, Craig Platt, Richard Bowtell, Penny A. Gowland</p>

We have used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to provide important new insights into the function of the human placenta in utero. We have measured slow net flow and high net oxygenation in the placenta in vivo, which are consistent with efficient delivery of oxygen from mother to fetus. Our experimental evidence substantiates previous hypotheses on the effects of spiral artery remodelling in utero and also indicates rapid venous drainage from the placenta, which is important because this outflow has been largely neglected in the past. Furthermore, beyond Braxton Hicks contractions, which involve the entire uterus, we have identified a new physiological phenomenon, the ‘utero-placental pump’, by which the placenta and underlying uterine wall contract independently of the rest of the uterus, expelling maternal blood from the intervillous space.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/A0htTTl-kOU" width="1" />

<p>The brain vasculature develops by angiogenesis from preformed blood vessels in the cephalic mesenchyme. Here we show that in addition, avascular cells expressing primitive erythroid, hemangioblast, and endothelial makers exist in the developing cephalic mesenchyme and neuroepithelium where they generate angiogenic, vasculogenic, and hemogenic foci. From E10.5 to E13.5, the neuroepithelial vasculogenic foci were an additional source of blood vessel formation in the developing brain.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Vascular structures in the developing brain are thought to form via angiogenesis from preformed blood vessels in the cephalic mesenchyme. Immunohistochemical studies of developing mouse brain from E10.5 to E13.5 revealed the presence of avascular blood islands of primitive erythroid cells expressing hemangioblast markers (Flk1, Tal1/Scl1, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, vascular endothelial‐cadherin, and CD34) and an endothelial marker recognized by <i>Griffonia simplicifolia </i> isolectin B4 (IB4) in the cephalic mesenchyme. These cells formed a perineural vascular plexus from which angiogenic sprouts originated and penetrated the neuroepithelium. In addition, avascular isolated cells expressing primitive erythroid, hemangioblast and endothelial makers were visible in the neuroepithelium where they generated vasculogenic and hemogenic foci. From E10.5 to E13.5, these vasculogenic foci were a source of new blood vessel formation in the developing brain. In vitro, cultured E13.5 brain endothelial cells contained hemogenic endothelial cells capable of generating erythroid cells. Similar cells were present in primary cultures of dissociated cells from E10.5 embryonic head. Our results provide new evidence that the brain vasculature, like that of the yolk sac and the eye choriocapillaris and hyaloid vascular systems, develops at least in part via hemovasculogenesis, a process in which vasculogenesis and hematopoiesis occur simultaneously.</p>

<p>Subjective effects of initial opioid misuse were assessed in two samples of opioid misusers that included low‐level users who never met criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD) and heavier users with OUD.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Attempts to identify opioid users with increased risk of escalating to opioid use disorder (OUD) have had limited success. Retrospectively assessed subjective effects of initial opioid misuse were compared in a pilot sample of opioid misusers (nonmedical use ≤60 times lifetime) who had never met criteria for OUD (<i>N </i> = 14) and heroin‐addicted individuals in treatment for OUD (<i>N </i> = 15). Relative to opioid misusers without a lifetime OUD diagnosis, individuals with OUD reported greater euphoria and other positive emotions, activation, pruritus, and internalizing symptoms. Consistent with these findings, proxy Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI) Amphetamine Group, and Morphine Benzedrine Group scale mean item scores were significantly higher in those with OUD. Replication was attempted in opioid misusers with (<i>N </i> = 25) and without OUD (<i>N </i> = 25) who were assessed as part of an ongoing genetic study. We observed similar significant between‐group differences in individual subjective effect items and ARCI scale mean item scores in the replication sample. We, thus confirm findings from prior reports that retrospectively assessed subjective responses to initial opioid exposure differ significantly between opioid users who do, and do not, progress to OUD. Our report extends these findings in comparisons limited to opioid misusers. Additional research will be necessary to examine prospectively whether the assessment of subjective effects after initial use has predictive utility in the identification of individuals more likely to progress to OUD.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess the association between REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and other determinants and incident impulse control disorder behaviors (ICBs) in patients with early Parkinson’s disease (PD) using longitudinal data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>401 newly‐diagnosed PD patients were prospectively evaluated at baseline (BL), month 6, and annually for 5 years. Probable RBD (pRBD) was assessed with the RBD Screening Questionnaire and dichotomized using a cut‐off value ≥6. The association of BL and time‐dependent (TD) pRBD and other covariates with the development of ICB symptoms, was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression and general estimating equations logistic regression. Models considered adjustment for age, sex, MDS‐UPDRS III, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS‐15), RBD medication use, total levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD), and dopamine agonist (DA) and antidepressant medication use.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Both baseline pRBD and TD pRBD were not associated with an increased risk for incident ICB symptoms after adjustment for covariates (adjusted HR=1.17, p=0.458 and HR=1.27, p=0.257 respectively). In a modified‐TD pRBD model (i.e., considering subjects as pRBD onward from the first time point with RBDSQ score ≥6), the risk for incident ICB symptoms was higher in pRBD in unadjusted (HR=1.48, p=0.038), but not adjusted (HR=1.29, p=0.202) models. TD DA use (HR=1.64, p=0.039), TD GDS‐15 score (HR=1.12, p&lt;0.001), and male sex (year 3: HR=2.10,p=0.009; year 4: HR=3.04,p=0.006; year 5: HR=4.40,p=0.007) were associated with increased ICB symptom risk.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>pRBD is not clearly associated with ICB symptom development in early PD, in contrast to DA use, depression, and male sex.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cognitive problems, especially disturbances in episodic memory, and hippocampal sclerosis are common in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), but little is known about the relationship of hippocampal morphology with memory. We aimed to relate hippocampal surface‐shape patterns to verbal and visual learning.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed hippocampal surface shapes on high‐resolution magnetic resonance images and the Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery in 145 unilateral refractory TLE patients undergoing epilepsy surgery, a validation set of 55 unilateral refractory TLE patients, and 39 age‐ and sex‐matched healthy volunteers.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Both left TLE (LTLE) and right TLE (RTLE) patients had lower verbal (LTLE 44 ± 11; RTLE 45 ± 10) and visual learning (LTLE 34 ± 8, RTLE 30 ± 8) scores than healthy controls (verbal 58 ± 8, visual 39 ± 6; <i>p </i> &lt; 0.001). Verbal learning was more impaired the greater the atrophy of the left superolateral hippocampal head. In contrast, visual memory was worse with greater bilateral inferomedial hippocampal atrophy. Postsurgical verbal memory decline was more common in LTLE than in RTLE (reliable change index in LTLE 27% vs RTLE 7%, <i>p </i> = 0.006), whereas there were no differences in postsurgical visual memory decline between those groups. Preoperative atrophy of the left hippocampal tail predicted postsurgical verbal memory decline.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Memory deficits in TLE are associated with specific morphological alterations of the hippocampus, which could help stratify TLE patients into those at high versus low risk of presurgical or postsurgical memory deficits. This knowledge could improve planning and prognosis of selective epilepsy surgery and neuropsychological counseling in TLE. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>The amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been extensively studied as the precursor of the β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide, the major component of the senile plaques found in the brain of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. However, the function of APP per se in neuronal physiology remains to be fully elucidated. APP is expressed at high levels in the brain. It resembles a cell adhesion molecule or a membrane receptor, suggesting that its function relies on cell-cell interaction and/or activation of intracellular signaling pathways. In this respect, the APP intracellular domain (AICD) was reported to act as a transcriptional regulator. Here, we used a transcriptome-based approach to identify the genes transcriptionally regulated by APP in the rodent embryonic cortex and on maturation of primary cortical neurons. Surprisingly, the overall transcriptional changes were subtle, but a more detailed analysis pointed to genes clustered in neuronal-activity dependent pathways. In particular, we observed a decreased transcription of neuronal PAS domain protein 4 (NPAS4) in APP–/– neurons. NPAS4 is an inducible transcription factor (ITF) regulated by neuronal depolarization. The downregulation of NPAS4 co-occurs with an increased production of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA and a reduced expression of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors α1. CRISPR-Cas-mediated silencing of NPAS4 in neurons led to similar observations. Patch-clamp investigation did not reveal any functional decrease of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors activity, but long-term potentiation (LTP) measurement supported an increased GABA component in synaptic transmission of APP–/– mice. Together, NPAS4 appears to be a downstream target involved in APP-dependent regulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission.</p>

<p>Although best known for its role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), tau is expressed throughout brain development, although it remains unclear when and which cell types this expression occurs and how it affects disease states in both fetal and neonatal periods. We thus sought to map tau mRNA and protein expression in the developing human brain at the cellular level using a combination of existing single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNAseq) data, RNA <i>in situ</i> hybridization (RNAscope), and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Using sc-RNAseq, we found that tau mRNA expression begins in radial glia but increases dramatically as migrating neuronal precursors mature. Specifically, <i>TBR1</i><sup>+</sup> maturing neurons and <i>SYN</i><sup>+</sup> mature neurons showed significantly higher mRNA expression than <i>GFAP</i><sup>+</sup>/<i>NES</i><sup>+</sup> radial glia or <i>TBR2</i><sup>+</sup> intermediate progenitors. By RNAscope, we found low levels of tau mRNA in subventricular zone (SVZ) radial glia and deep white matter intermediate progenitors, with an increase in more superficially located maturing and mature neurons. By total-tau IHC, the germinal matrix and SVZ showed little protein expression, although both RNAscope and sc-RNAseq showed mRNA, and Western blotting revealed significantly less protein in those areas compared with more mature regions. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cortical organoids showed a similar tau expression pattern by sc-RNAseq and RNAscope. Our results indicate that tau increases with neuronal maturation in both the developing fetal brain and iPSC-derived organoids and forms a basis for future research on regulatory mechanisms triggering the onset of tau gene transcription and translation, which may represent potential therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative tauopathies and neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Preclinical evidence with nilotinib, a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‐approved drug for leukemia, indicates improvement in Alzheimer's disease phenotypes. We investigated whether nilotinib is safe, and detectable in cerebrospinal fluid, and alters biomarkers and clinical decline in Alzheimer's disease.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This single‐center, phase 2, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study investigated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of nilotinib, and measured biomarkers in participants with mild to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. The diagnosis was supported by cerebrospinal fluid or amyloid positron emission tomography biomarkers. Nilotinib 150 mg versus matching placebo was taken orally once daily for 26 weeks followed by nilotinib 300 mg versus placebo for another 26 weeks.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of the 37 individuals enrolled, 27 were women and the mean (SD) age was 70.7 (6.48) years. Nilotinib was well‐tolerated, although more adverse events, particularly mood swings, were noted with the 300 mg dose. In the nilotinib group, central nervous system (CNS) amyloid burden was significantly reduced in the frontal lobe compared to the placebo group. Cerebrospinal fluid Aβ40 was reduced at 6 months and Aβ42 was reduced at 12 months in the nilotinib group compared to the placebo. Hippocampal volume loss was attenuated (−27%) at 12 months and phospho‐tau‐181 was reduced at 6 months and 12 months in the nilotinib group.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Nilotinib is safe and achieves pharmacologically relevant cerebrospinal fluid concentrations. Biomarkers of disease were altered in response to nilotinib treatment. These data support a larger, longer, multicenter study to determine the safety and efficacy of nilotinib in Alzheimer's disease. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Every year, millions of Australian Bogong moths (<i>Agrotis infusa </i>) complete an astonishing journey: In Spring, they migrate over 1,000 km from their breeding grounds to the alpine regions of the Snowy Mountains, where they endure the hot summer in the cool climate of alpine caves. In autumn, the moths return to their breeding grounds, where they mate, lay eggs and die. These moths can use visual cues in combination with the geomagnetic field to guide their flight, but how these cues are processed and integrated into the brain to drive migratory behavior is unknown. To generate an access point for functional studies, we provide a detailed description of the Bogong moth's brain. Based on immunohistochemical stainings against synapsin and serotonin (5HT), we describe the overall layout as well as the fine structure of all major neuropils, including the regions that have previously been implicated in compass‐based navigation. The resulting average brain atlas consists of 3D reconstructions of 25 separate neuropils, comprising the most detailed account of a moth brain to date. Our results show that the Bogong moth brain follows the typical lepidopteran ground pattern, with no major specializations that can be attributed to their spectacular migratory lifestyle. These findings suggest that migratory behavior does not require widespread modifications of brain structure, but might be achievable via small adjustments of neural circuitry in key brain areas. Locating these subtle changes will be a challenging task for the future, for which our study provides an essential anatomical framework.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cross‐modal auditory influence on cell activity in the primary visual cortex emerging at short latencies raises the possibility that the first‐order visual thalamic nucleus, which is considered dedicated to unimodal visual processing, could contribute to cross‐modal sensory processing, as has been indicated in the auditory and somatosensory systems. To test this hypothesis, the effects of sound stimulation on visual cell activity in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus were examined in anesthetized rats, using juxta‐cellular recording and labeling techniques. Visual responses evoked by light (white LED) were modulated by sound (noise burst) given simultaneously or 50–400 ms after the light, even though sound stimuli alone did not evoke cell activity. Alterations of visual response were observed in 71% of cells (57/80) with regard to response magnitude, latency, and/or burst spiking. Suppression predominated in response magnitude modulation, but de novo responses were also induced by combined stimulation. Sound affected not only onset responses but also late responses. Late responses were modulated by sound given before or after onset responses. Further, visual responses evoked by the second light stimulation of a double flash with a 150–700 ms interval were also modulated by sound given together with the first light stimulation. In morphological analysis of labeled cells projection cells comparable to X‐, Y‐, and W‐like cells and interneurons were all susceptible to auditory influence. These findings suggest that the first‐order visual thalamic nucleus incorporates auditory influence into parallel and complex thalamic visual processing for cross‐modal modulation of visual attention and perception.</p>

<p>The marrow cavity, trabecular bone, and the periosteum are all innervated by myelinated spinal afferent nerve endings, and both peptidergic and nonpeptidergic unmyelinated spinal afferent nerve endings, and there is heterogeneity with respect to their morphology.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>While sensory and sympathetic neurons are known to innervate bone, previous studies have found it difficult to unequivocally identify and characterize only those that are of sensory origin. In this study, we have utilized an <i>in vivo </i> anterograde tracing technique to selectively label spinal afferent (sensory) nerve endings that innervate the periosteum and marrow cavity of murine long bones. Unilateral injections of dextran–biotin (anterograde tracer; 20% in saline, 50–100 nl) were made into L3–L5 dorsal root ganglia. After a 10‐day recovery period to allow sufficient time for selective anterograde transport of the tracer to nerve terminal endings in bone, the periosteum (whole‐mount) and underlying bone were collected, processed to reveal anterograde labeling, and immuno‐labeled with antibodies directed against protein gene product (pan‐neuronal marker; PGP9.5), tyrosine hydroxylase (sympathetic neuron marker; TH), calcitonin gene‐related protein (peptidergic nociceptor marker; CGRP), and/or neurofilament 200 (myelinated axon marker; NF200). Anterograde‐labeled nerve endings were dispersed throughout the periosteum and marrow cavity and could be identified in close apposition to blood vessels and at sites distant from them. The periosteum and the marrow cavity were each innervated by myelinated (NF200+) sensory neurons, and unmyelinated (NF200‑) sensory neurons that were either peptidergic (CGRP+) or nonpeptidergic (CGRP‑). Spinal afferent nerve endings did not express TH, and lacked the cylindrical morphology around blood vessels characteristic of sympathetic innervation. This approach to selective labeling of sensory nerve terminal endings will help to better identify how different sub‐populations of sensory neurons, and their peripheral nerve terminal endings, interact with bone.</p>

<p>Most spider species possess eight eyes, of which two (the principal eyes) are used for object discrimination, whereas the other three pairs (secondary eyes) detect movement. Jumping spiders are particularly renowned for their visual abilities and we studied the neural substrate for visual processing in the jumping spider <i>Marpissa muscosa </i> 
<i>. </i> We show that the principal eye pathway involves two subsequent visual neuropils and the arcuate body. Among the secondary eyes, the anterior lateral and the posterior lateral eyes are connected to two subsequent visual neuropils (AL1, PL1, and AL2/PL2) and the mushroom body (MBp). They also share an additional second‐order visual neuropil (L2), which might serve as integration center. The small posterior median eye is connected via a single visual neuropil (PM1) with the arcuate body and might thus not detect movement. Additional data on the visual pathways in the ctenid spider <i>Cupiennius salei </i>  are provided and differences to <i>M. muscosa </i>  are discussed.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Some animals have evolved task differentiation among their eyes. A particular example is spiders, where most species have eight eyes, of which two (the principal eyes) are used for object discrimination, whereas the other three pairs (secondary eyes) detect movement. In the ctenid spider <i>Cupiennius salei </i>,  these two eye types correspond to two visual pathways in the brain. Each eye is associated with its own first‐ and second‐order visual neuropil. The second‐order neuropils of the principal eyes are connected to the arcuate body, whereas the second‐order neuropils of the secondary eyes are linked to the mushroom body. We explored the principal‐ and secondary eye visual pathways of the jumping spider <i>Marpissa muscosa </i> , in which size and visual fields of the two eye types are considerably different. We found that the connectivity of the principal eye pathway is the same as in <i>C. salei </i> , while there are differences in the secondary eye pathways. In <i>M. muscosa </i> , all secondary eyes are connected to their own first‐order visual neuropils. The first‐order visual neuropils of the anterior lateral and posterior lateral eyes are connected with a second‐order visual neuropil each and an additional shared one (L2). In the posterior median eyes, the axons of their first‐order visual neuropils project directly to the arcuate body, suggesting that the posterior median eyes do not detect movement<i>. </i> The L2 might function as an upstream integration center enabling faster movement decisions.</p>

<p>Multisensory processing occurs across the neocortex, but what makes an area multisensory? Multisensory processing in ferret lateral rostral suprasylvian (LRSS) area was examined using tract tracing and multichannel neuronal recording and compared with other cortical areas. Inputs from lower level auditory and somatosensory cortices converged in the LRSS, where the majority of neurons were auditory‐somatosensory multisensory and multisensory activity was the dominant output signal. Comparison with similarly studied cortical areas indicates that areas dominated by multisensory activity are appropriately designated as multisensory.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Now that examples of multisensory neurons have been observed across the neocortex, this has led to some confusion about the features that actually designate a region as “multisensory.” While the documentation of multisensory effects within many different cortical areas is clear, often little information is available about their proportions or net functional effects. To assess the compositional and functional features that contribute to the multisensory nature of a region, the present investigation used multichannel neuronal recording and tract tracing methods to examine the ferret temporal region: the lateral rostral suprasylvian sulcal area. Here, auditory‐tactile multisensory neurons were predominant and constituted the majority of neurons across all cortical layers whose responses dominated the net spiking activity of the area. These results were then compared with a literature review of cortical multisensory data and were found to closely resemble multisensory features of other, higher‐order sensory areas. Collectively, these observations argue that multisensory processing presents itself in hierarchical and area‐specific ways, from regions that exhibit few multisensory features to those whose composition and processes are dominated by multisensory activity. It seems logical that the former exhibit some multisensory features (among many others), while the latter are legitimately designated as “multisensory.”</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Brain imaging studies in children with prenatal methamphetamine exposure (PME) suggest structural and functional alterations of striatal, frontal, parietal, and limbic regions. However, no longitudinal studies have investigated changes in structural connectivity during the first 2 years of formal schooling. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of PME on structural connectivity of brain networks in children over the critical first 2 years of formal schooling when foundational learning takes place. Networks are expected to gradually increase in global connectedness while segregating into defined systems. Graph theoretical analysis was used to investigate changes in structural connectivity at age 6 and 8 years in children with and without PME. While healthy control children showed increased connectivity in frontal and limbic hubs over time, children with PME showed increased connectivity in the superior parietal cortex and striatum in their global network. Furthermore, compared to control children, those with PME were characterized by less change in segregation of structural networks over time. These findings are consistent with previous work on regions implicated in children with PME, but they additionally demonstrate alterations in structural connectivity between regions that underlie primary cognitive, behavioral, and emotional development. Understanding patterns of network development during critical periods in at‐risk children may inform strategies for supporting this group of children in these developmental tasks important for lifelong brain health and development.</p>

<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hypothalamus contains catecholaminergic neurons marked by the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). As multiple chemical messengers coexist in each neuron, we determined if hypothalamic TH‐immunoreactive (ir) neurons express vesicular glutamate or GABA transporters. We used Cre/loxP recombination to express enhanced GFP (EGFP) in neurons expressing the vesicular glutamate (vGLUT2) or GABA transporter (vGAT), then determined whether TH‐ir neurons colocalized with native EGFP<sup>
   <i>Vglut2 </i>
</sup>‐ or EGFP<sup>
   <i>Vgat </i>
</sup>‐fluorescence, respectively. EGFP<sup>
   <i>Vglut2 </i>
</sup> neurons were not TH‐ir. However, discrete TH‐ir signals colocalized with EGFP<sup>
   <i>Vgat </i>
</sup> neurons, which we validated by <i>in situ </i> hybridization for <i>Vgat </i> mRNA. To contextualize the observed pattern of colocalization between TH‐ir and EGFP<sup>
   <i>Vgat </i>
</sup>, we first performed Nissl‐based parcellation and plane‐of‐section analysis, and then mapped the distribution of TH‐ir EGFP<sup>
   <i>Vgat </i>
</sup> neurons onto atlas templates from the <i>Allen Reference Atlas </i> (<i>ARA </i>) for the mouse brain. TH‐ir EGFP<sup>

</sup> neurons were distributed throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the hypothalamus. Within the <i>ARA </i> ontology of gray matter regions, TH‐ir neurons localized primarily to the periventricular hypothalamic zone, periventricular hypothalamic region, and lateral hypothalamic zone. There was a strong presence of EGFP<sup>
   <i>Vgat </i>
</sup> fluorescence in TH‐ir neurons across all brain regions, but the most striking colocalization was found in a circumscribed portion of the zona incerta (ZI)—a region assigned to the hypothalamus in the <i>ARA </i>—where every TH‐ir neuron expressed EGFP<sup>
   <i>Vgat </i>
</sup>. Neurochemical characterization of these ZI neurons revealed that they display immunoreactivity for dopamine but not dopamine β‐hydroxylase. Collectively, these findings indicate the existence of a novel mouse hypothalamic population that may signal through the release of GABA and/or dopamine.</p>

<p>We report that a protein belonged to the PDLIM family is associated to the retinal periactive zone in cones of the chicken retina. PDLIM1, is a cytoskeletal protein that acts as an adapter that allows the trafficking of other proteins, like kinases, to the cytoskeleton and plays a role in controlling neurite outgrowth. The data in this work demonstrated that PDLIM1 delineates the cone's terminals and intermingles between the ribbons of the synapses. The localization of PDLIM1 could be of importance not only for understanding the molecular anatomy of the terminal ending in cones, but also to knowledge the fine mechanisms of the process of neurotransmission.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>PDLIM's protein family is involved in the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. In the present study, we describe the localization of PDLIM1 in chicken photoreceptors. This study provides evidence that this protein is present at the cone pedicles, as well as in other synapses of the chicken retina. Here, we demonstrate the expression pattern of PDLIM1 through immunofluorescence staining, immunoblots, subcellular fractionation, and immunoprecipitation experiments. Also, we consider the possibility that PDLIM1 may be involved in the synaptic vesicle endocytosis and/or the presynaptic trafficking of synaptic vesicles back to the nonready releasable pool. This endocytotic/exocytotic coupling requires a tight link between exocytic vesicle fusion at defined release sites and endocytic retrieval of synaptic vesicle membranes. In turn, photoreceptor ribbon synaptic structure depends on the cytoskeleton arrangement, both at the active zone‐related with exocytosis—as well as at the endocytic zone—periactive zone. To our knowledge, the PDLIM1 protein has not been observed in the pre synapses of the retina. Thus, the present study describes the expression and subcellular localization of PDLIM1 for the first time, as well as its modulation by visual environment in the chicken retina.</p>

<p>Retrograde transsynaptic virus (a) allowed to trace (two to three synapses) projections onto the main olfactory bulb (b). Monosynaptic cholera toxin b (a) was a control to differentiate direct and indirect projections. The MOB mainly receives indirect projections from hypothalamic nuclei (c) and reward‐related regions (c1), underlining the role of olfaction in feeding (d).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A wide range of evidence indicates that olfactory perception is strongly involved in food intake. However, the polysynaptic circuitry linking the brain areas involved in feeding behavior to the olfactory regions is not well known. The aim of this article was to examine such circuits. Thus, we described, using hodological tools such as transsynaptic viruses (PRV152) transported in a retrograde manner, the long‐distance indirect projections (two to three synapses) onto the main olfactory bulb (MOB). The ß‐subunit of the cholera toxin which is a monosynaptic retrograde tracer was used as a control to be able to differentiate between direct and indirect projections. Our tracing experiments showed that the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, as a major site for regulation of food intake, sends only very indirect projections onto the MOB. Indirect projections to MOB also originate from the solitary nucleus which is involved in energy homeostasis. Other indirect projections have been evidenced in areas of the reward circuit such as VTA and accumbens nucleus. In contrast, direct projections to the MOB arise from melanin‐concentrating hormone and orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. Functional significances of these projections are discussed in relation to the role of food odors in feeding and reward‐related behavior.</p>

<p>Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a disease of the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction (NMJ) where nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors (AChRs) are targeted by autoantibodies. Search for other pathogenic antigens has detected the antibodies against muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) and low-density lipoprotein-related protein 4 (Lrp4), both causing pre- and post-synaptic impairments. Agrin is also suspected as a fourth pathogen. In a complex NMJ organization centering on MuSK: (1) the Wnt non-canonical pathway through the Wnt-Lrp4-MuSK cysteine-rich domain (CRD)-Dishevelled (Dvl, scaffold protein) signaling acts to form AChR prepatterning with axonal guidance; (2) the neural agrin-Lrp4-MuSK (Ig1/2 domains) signaling acts to form rapsyn-anchored AChR clusters at the innervated stage of muscle; (3) adaptor protein Dok-7 acts on MuSK activation for AChR clustering from “inside” and also on cytoskeleton to stabilize AChR clusters by the downstream effector Sorbs1/2; (4) the trans-synaptic retrograde signaling contributes to the presynaptic organization via: (i) Wnt-MuSK CRD-Dvl-β catenin-Slit 2 pathway; (ii) Lrp4; and (iii) laminins. The presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis conditioning ACh release is modified by autoreceptors such as M1-type muscarinic AChR and A2A adenosine receptors. The post-synaptic structure is stabilized by: (i) laminin-network including the muscle-derived agrin; (ii) the extracellular matrix proteins (including collagen Q/perlecan and biglycan which link to MuSK Ig1 domain and CRD); and (iii) the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex. The study on MuSK ectodomains (Ig1/2 domains and CRD) recognized by antibodies suggested that the MuSK antibodies were pathologically heterogeneous due to their binding to multiple functional domains. Focussing one of the matrix proteins, biglycan which functions in the manner similar to collagen Q, our antibody assay showed the negative result in MG patients. However, the synaptic stability may be impaired by antibodies against MuSK ectodomains because of the linkage of biglycan with MuSK Ig1 domain and CRD. The pathogenic diversity of MG is discussed based on NMJ signaling molecules.</p>

<p>Rett syndrome is a debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder for which no disease-modifying treatment is available. Fortunately, advances in our understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology of Rett syndrome has led to the development of promising new therapeutics for the condition. Several of these therapeutics are currently being tested in clinical trials with others likely to progress to clinical trials in the coming years. The failure of recent clinical trials for Rett syndrome and other neurodevelopmental disorders has highlighted the need for electrophysiological or other objective biological markers of treatment response to support the success of clinical trials moving forward. The purpose of this review is to describe the existing studies of electroencephalography (EEG) and evoked potentials (EPs) in Rett syndrome and discuss the open questions that must be addressed before the field can adopt these measures as surrogate endpoints in clinical trials. In addition to summarizing the human work on Rett syndrome, we also describe relevant studies with animal models and the limited research that has been carried out on Rett-related disorders, particularly methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) duplication syndrome, CDKL5 deficiency disorder, and FOXG1 disorder.</p>

<p>Objective: Tai chi (TC), a contemplative practice combining slow movements and deep breathing, has been shown to be clinically effective in alleviating depressive symptoms. Feelings of fatigue or low vitality often accompany major depressive disorder (MDD) though they are commonly overlooked and not well understood neurologically. By using resting state functional connectivity (rs-FC) using the insula as the seed, this study examines the relationship between mood and vitality symptoms in MDD and how they are impacted by TC training.</p><p>Methods: Patients (N = 16) with MDD participated in a 10-week TC intervention. Self-report scores of vitality (using the SF-36 scale) and depressed mood (using the Beck Depression Inventory) as well as rs-fMRI were collected pre- and post-intervention. A seed-to-voxel approach was used to test whether changes in insular rs-FC were related to therapeutic improvement in MDD-related symptoms resulting from TC practice.</p><p>Results: We found decreased self-reported depressed mood and increased vitality following the TC intervention. Furthermore, decreases in depressed mood were associated with increased rs-FC between the right anterior insula (AIC) and superior temporal gyrus and caudate (cluster-corrected p &lt; 0.05). Increased vitality was associated with increased rs-FC between the right posterior insula (PIC) and regions associated with sensorimotor processes (cluster-corrected p &lt; 0.05).</p><p>Conclusion: These results provide support for differential changes in insula connectivity as neural correlates of symptom improvement in MDD.</p>

<p>In schizophrenia and related disorders, a deeper mechanistic understanding of neocortical dysfunction will be essential to developing new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. To this end, combined transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS/EEG) provides a non-invasive tool to simultaneously perturb and measure neurophysiological correlates of cortical function, including oscillatory activity, cortical inhibition, connectivity, and synchronization. In this review, we summarize the findings from a variety of studies that apply TMS/EEG to understand the fundamental features of cortical dysfunction in schizophrenia. These results lend to future applications of TMS/EEG in understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.</p>

In this regard the efficacy of local binary pattern (LBP) based texture analysis (TA) of CC is performed to quantify the changes in topographical distribution of callosal fiber connected to different regions of cortex. The extent of highest texture alteration in CC is used for differential diagnosis.</p>Materials and Methods<p>Study included subjects with Parkinson’s disease (PD) (n = 20), and atypical Parkinsonian disorders – multiple system atrophy (MSA) (n = 20), Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (n = 20), and healthy controls (n = 20). For each subject, we have automated the ROI extraction within mid-sagittal CC, followed by LBP TA. Two-class support vector machine (SVM) classification for each disorder as against HC is performed using extracted LBP features like energy and entropy. Correct classification ratio (CCR) is computed as the fraction of correctly classified ROIs at each of the CC sub-regions based on well-known Witelson and Hofer schemes. Based on CCR values, the “Scatter Index (SI)” is proposed to capture how localized (closer to 0) or scattered (closer to 1) the textural changes are among the CC sub-regions, across all subjects per class. The CCR values are further utilized to classify the disease groups.</p>Results<p>Highest alteration of texture is observed in mid-body of CC. The consistency of this finding is quantified using SI for all subjects in a specific class that results more localized textural changes in PSP (15%) and MSA (25%), in comparison to PD (47%). Classification among disease groups results maximum classification accuracy of 90% in classifying PSP from PD-NC.</p>Conclusion<p>Our result demonstrates the efficacy of proposed methodology in analyzing tissue alteration in MRI of Parkinsonian disorders and thus has potential to become valuable tool in computer aided differential diagnosis.</p>

<p>Besides several endogenous elements, exogenous factors, including exposure to pesticides, have been recognized as putative factors contributing to the onset and development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease (PD). Considering the availability, success rate, and limitations associated with the current arsenals to fight PD, there is an unmet need for novel therapeutic interventions. Therefore, based on the previously reported beneficial functions of the L1 cell adhesion molecule, we hypothesized that L1 mimetic compounds may serve to neutralize neurotoxicity triggered by the pesticide paraquat (PQ). In this study, we attempt to use PQ for inducing PD-like pathology and the L1 mimetic compounds phenelzine sulfate (PS) and tacrine (TC) as potential candidates for the amelioration of PD symptoms using zebrafish as a model system. Administration of PQ together with the L1 mimetic compounds PS or TC (250 nM) improved survival of zebrafish larvae, protected them from locomotor deficits, and increased their sensorimotor reflexes. Moreover, application of PQ together with PS (500 nM) or TC (1000 nM) in adult zebrafish counteracted PQ-induced toxicity, maintaining normal locomotor functions and spatial memory in an open field and T-maze task, respectively. Both L1 mimetic compounds prevented reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine levels, reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, protected against impairment of mitochondrial viability, improved the antioxidant enzyme system, and prevented a decrease in ATP levels. Altogether, our findings highlight the beneficial functions of the agonistic L1 mimetics PS and TC by improving several vital cell functions against PQ-triggered neurotoxicity.</p>

<p>Theta-nested gamma oscillations have been reported in many areas of the brain and are believed to represent a fundamental mechanism to transfer information across spatial and temporal scales. In a series of recent experiments in vitro it has been possible to replicate with an optogenetic theta frequency stimulation several features of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) among theta and gamma rhythms observed in behaving animals. In order to reproduce the main findings of these experiments we have considered a new class of neural mass models able to reproduce exactly the macroscopic dynamics of spiking neural networks. In this framework, we have examined two set-ups able to support collective gamma oscillations: namely, the pyramidal interneuronal network gamma (PING) and the interneuronal network gamma (ING). In both set-ups we observe the emergence of theta-nested gamma oscillations by driving the system with a sinusoidal theta-forcing in proximity of a Hopf bifurcation. These mixed rhythms always display phase amplitude coupling. However, two different types of nested oscillations can be identified: one characterized by a perfect phase locking between theta and gamma rhythms, corresponding to an overall periodic behavior; another one where the locking is imperfect and the dynamics is quasi-periodic or even chaotic. From our analysis it emerges that the locked states are more frequent in the ING set-up. In agreement with the experiments, we find theta-nested gamma oscillations for forcing frequencies in the range [1:10] Hz, whose amplitudes grow proportionally to the forcing intensity and which are clearly modulated by the theta phase. Furthermore, analogously to the experiments, the gamma power and the frequency of the gamma-power peak increase with the forcing amplitude. At variance with experimental findings, the gamma-power peak does not shift to higher frequencies by increasing the theta frequency. This effect can be obtained, in our model, only by incrementing, at the same time, also the stimulation power. An effect achieved by increasing the amplitude either of the noise or of the forcing term proportionally to the theta frequency. On the basis of our analysis both the PING and the ING mechanism give rise to theta-nested gamma oscillations with almost identical features.</p>

<p>To understand functional neuronal circuits for emotion in the basal forebrain, patterns of neuronal activation were examined in mice by immunohistochemistry of immediate-early gene products (Zif268/Egr1 and c-Fos). In all mice examined, clusters of 30–50 neurons expressing Zif268 were found on both sides in the area between the extended amygdala (EA) and globus pallidus (GP), generally designated as sublenticular extended amygdala (SLEA). The clusters consisted of 79.9 ± 3.0% of GABAergic neurons in GAD65-mCherry mice. The expression of the cholinergic marker choline acetyltransferase and the GP markers parvalbumin, proenkephalin, and FoxP2 indicated that these neurons were different from known types of neurons in the EA and GP; therefore, we named them the sublenticular extended amygdalar Zif268/Egr1-expressing neuronal cluster (SLEA-zNC). Sublenticular extended amygdalar Zif268/Egr1-expressing neuronal clusters participated in stress processing because increasing numbers of cells were observed in SLEA-zNCs after exposure to restraint stress (RS), the induction of which was suppressed by diazepam treatment. Mapping SLEA-zNCs showed that their positions and arrangement varied individually; SLEA-zNCs were distributed asymmetrically and tended to be situated mainly in the middle region between the anterior commissure (AC) and posterior end of the GP. However, the total cell number in SLEA-zNCs was compatible between the right and left hemispheres after activation by RS. Therefore, SLEA-zNCs were distributed asymmetrically but were not lateralized. Because time courses of activation differed between the Zif268 and c-Fos, the sequential dual treatment of RSs enabled us to differentiate SLEA-zNCs activated by the first and second RS. The results supported that the same SLEA-zNCs responded to both the first and second RS, and this also applied for all SLEA-zNCs. Thus, we concluded that the cluster positions were invariable under RS in each mouse but were distributed differently between individual mice. We name these newly identified neuronal clusters as stress-related neuronal clusters, SLEA-zNCs, which are considered to be novel functional units of “islands of activation.” Moreover, SLEA-zNCs were situated at different positions in all mice examined, showing individual differences in their positions.</p>

<p>Animal survival relies on environmental information gathered by their sensory systems. We found that contrast information of a looming stimulus biases the type of defensive behavior that goldfish (Carassius auratus) perform. Low-contrast looms only evoke subtle alarm reactions whose probability is independent of contrast. As looming contrast increases, the probability of eliciting a fast escape maneuver, the C-start response, increases dramatically. Contrast information also modulates the decision of when to escape. Although response latency is known to depend on looming retinal size, we found that contrast acts as an additional parameter influencing this decision. When presenting progressively higher contrast stimuli, animals need shorter periods of stimulus processing to initiate the response. Our results comply with the notion that the decision to escape is a flexible process initiated with stimulus detection and followed by assessment of the perceived risk posed by the stimulus. Highly disruptive behaviors as the C-start are only observed when a multifactorial threshold that includes stimulus contrast is surpassed.</p>

<p>Emerging genetically-encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup>-indicators (GECIs) are intensiometric reporters that increase in fluorescence when bound to Ca<sup>2+</sup>; highly suited for studying calcium-signaling in many cell types, notably neurons. Today, major efforts are devoted toward optimizing red-emitting [red fluorescent protein (RFP)-based] GECIs (R-GECI), as these provide several advantages over GFP-based reporters, for instance, increased imaging depth, reduced photodamage by longer imaging wavelengths and, in principle, are better suited for use with prevalent blue-absorbing optogenetic tools (e.g., channelrhodopsin). However, excessive fluorescence from intersecting neighboring cells in very dense tissues, notably the brain, hinders the ability to collect signals from single cells and their processes. This challenge can be addressed by photoactivatable (PA) fluorescent proteins that can be rendered fluorescent on demand by user-defined targeted light. This allows activation and, thereby, collection of fluorescent signals exclusively from desired cells and their processes, while leaving all neighboring cells in the dark (i.e., non-fluorescent). Nevertheless, there are no PA R-GECIs. Here, we sought to develop PA-R-GECIs. To do so, we initially explored a recently discovered phenomenon of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent increases in fluorescence (i.e., artifacts) in an emerging R-GECI, which has led us to rationally engineer several functional PA-R-GECIs. We also take advantage of our findings to quickly engineer a novel PA-RFP, namely, PA-mRuby3.</p>

<p>Moths develop sophisticated olfactory systems to sense the airborne chemical cues from the environment. Understanding the structural basis in the neuronal center is a fundamental neuroethological step. Little is known about the emerging crop pest Athetis dissimilis with regard to its morphology or its neuronal organizations. Through antibody staining and digital 3D modeling, we re-constructed the primary olfactory center—the antennal lobe of A. dissimilis. In the antennal lobes 68.8 ± 3.1 male glomeruli and 70.8 ± 1.0 female glomeruli were identified with obvious sexual dimorphism. In particular, male adults of A. dissimilis contain a macroglomerular complex (MGC) that consists of three subunits, while the female lobe has four relatively enlarged glomeruli at the entrance of the antennal nerve. Glomeruli were later clustered with deviation and variance, and referring to reported olfactory related receptor family genes in seven different moth species, we found that glomerular counts of these insects are better related to the sum of odorant receptor and ionotropic receptor numbers, suggesting olfactory receptors and ionotropic receptors may both involved in olfaction of Noctuidae moths.</p>

<p>The nucleus prethalamicus of the yellowfin goby relays visual information from the optic tectum to as many as 13 regions of the telencephalon that is amazingly well compartmentalized in the goby.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The nucleus prethalamicus (PTh) receives fibers from the optic tectum and then projects to the dorsal telencephalon in the yellowfin goby <i>Acanthogobius flavimanus </i>. However, it remained unclear whether the PTh is a visual relay nucleus, because the optic tectum receives not only visual but also other sensory modalities. Furthermore, precise telencephalic regions receiving prethalamic input remained unknown in the goby. We therefore investigated the full set of afferent and efferent connections of the PTh by direct tracer injections into the nucleus. Injections into the PTh labeled cells in the optic tectum, ventromedial thalamic nucleus, central and medial parts of the dorsal telencephalon, and caudal lobe of the cerebellum. We found that the somata of most tecto‐prethalamic neurons are present in the stratum periventriculare. Their dendrites ascend to reach the major retinorecipient layers of the tectum. The PTh is composed of two subnuclei (medial and lateral) and topographic organization was appreciated only for tectal projections to the lateral subnucleus (PTh‐l), which also receives sparse retinal projections. In contrast, the medial subnucleus receives fibers only from the medial tectum. We found that the PTh projects to nine subregions in the dorsal telencephalon and four in the ventral telencephalon. Furthermore, cerebellar injections revealed that cerebello‐prethalamic fibers cross the midline twice to innervate the PTh‐l on both sides. The present study is the first detailed report on the full set of the connections of PTh, which suggests that the PTh relays visual information from the optic tectum to the telencephalon.</p>

<p>Blockade of peripheral opioid receptors with the peripherally restricted antagonist, methylnaltrexone (MNTX), had no effect on acute morphine antinociception or development of tolerance. The results do not support the use of MNTX for preventing opioid tolerance and also suggest that morphine tolerance is mediated by central rather than peripheral opioid receptors in the rat.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Opioids are effective analgesics in the management of severe pain. However, tolerance, leading to dose escalation and adverse effects are significant limiting factors in their use. The role of peripheral opioid receptors in analgesia has been discussed especially under inflammatory conditions. The results from pharmacological and conditional knockout studies together do not provide a clear picture of the contribution of peripheral opioid receptors on antinociceptive tolerance and this needs to be evaluated. Therefore, we studied whether the peripherally restricted opioid receptor antagonist, methylnaltrexone (MNTX), could prevent morphine tolerance without attenuating the antinociceptive effect of morphine. Male Sprague‐Dawley rats were treated for 7 days with increasing subcutaneous doses of morphine (5–30 mg/kg) and were coadministered saline, MNTX (0.5 or 2 mg/kg), or naltrexone (NTX; 2 mg/kg). Nociception was assessed with tail‐flick, hotplate, and von Frey tests. Morphine, MNTX, and NTX concentrations in the plasma, brain, and spinal cord were measured by liquid chromatography‐tandem mass spectrometry. In acute coadministration, NTX, but not MNTX, abolished the acute antinociceptive effects of morphine in all nociceptive tests. The antinociceptive tolerance after repeated morphine administration was also prevented by NTX but not by MNTX. MNTX penetrated to the spinal cord and the brain to some extent after repeated administration. The results do not support the use of MNTX for preventing opioid tolerance and also suggest that morphine tolerance is mediated by central rather than peripheral opioid receptors in the rat.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Coincident with the opioid epidemic in the United States has been a dramatic increase in the number of children born with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), a form of withdrawal resulting from opioid exposure during pregnancy. Many research efforts on NAS have focused on short‐term care, including acute symptom treatment and weaning of the infants off their drug dependency prior to authorizing their release. However, investigations into the long‐term effects of prenatal opioid exposure (POE) on brain development, from the cellular to the behavioral level, have not been as frequent. Given the importance of the perinatal period for human brain development, opioid‐induced disturbances in the formation and function of nascent synaptic networks and glia have the potential to impact brain connectivity and cognition long after the drug supply is cutoff shortly after birth. In this review, we will summarize the current state of NAS research, bringing together findings from human studies and preclinical animal models to highlight what is known about how POE can induce significant, prolonged deficits in brain structure and function. With rates of NAS continuing to rise, particularly in regions that already face substantial socioeconomic challenges, we speculate as to the most promising avenues for future research to alleviate this growing multigenerational threat.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25752?af=R">Dysregulation of the Retromer Complex System in Down Syndrome</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Most of the patients with Down syndrome (DS) develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology by age 40. Although this increased susceptibility to AD in DS is thought to be primarily due to triplication of the amyloid precursor protein located on chromosome 21, the precise molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Recent evidence has implicated defective protein sorting and trafficking secondary to deficiencies in retromer complex proteins in AD pathogenesis. Thus, the objective of the present study is to assess the retromer complex system in DS.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Human postmortem brain tissue and fibroblasts from subjects with DS and healthy controls were examined for the various retromer protein components using Western blot analysis and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‐qPCR).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Retromer recognition core proteins were significantly decreased in DS fibroblasts, and in both the hippocampi and cortices of young (age 15–40 years old) and aged (40–65 years old) subjects with DS compared with controls. Correlation analyses showed a significant inverse relationship between recognition core proteins and levels of soluble forms of Aβ 1–40 and 1–42 in both hippocampus (n = 33, Spearman = −0.59 to −0.38, <i>p </i> ≤ 0.03 for VPS35, VPS26, VPS29, and VPS26B) and cortex tissue (n = 57, Spearman = −0.46 to −0.27, <i>p </i> ≤ 0.04 for VPS35, VPS26, and VPS29) of the same patients.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We conclude that dysregulation of the retromer complex system is an early event in the development of the AD‐like pathology and cognitive decline in DS, and for this reason the system could represent a novel potential therapeutic target for DS. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>Lifestyle factors have been shown to increase the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) later in life. Specifically, an unfavorable cholesterol profile, and insulin resistance are associated with increased risk of developing AD. One way to non-pharmacologically affect the levels of plasma lipids is by exercise, which has been shown to be beneficial in cognitively healthy individuals. In this randomized controlled trial y, we therefore aimed to clarify the effect of physical exercise on the lipid profile, insulin and glucose in patients with AD. In addition, we investigated the effect of apolipoproteinE genotype on total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein–cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) in plasma from patients with AD. Plasma samples from 172 patients who underwent 16 weeks of moderate-to-high intensity exercise (n = 90) or treatment as usual (n = 82) were analyzed change from baseline for the levels of total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, glucose, and insulin. In addition, we analyzed those from the exercise group who adhered to the protocol with an attendance of 2/3 or more of the exercise session and who followed the protocol of an intensity of 70% of the maximum heart rate. We found a significant increase in plasma HDL-C levels between the “high exercise sub-group” compared to control group. After intervention HDL-C was increased by 4.3% in the high-exercise group, and decreased by 0.7% in the control group, after adjustment for statin use. In conclusion, short term physical activity may be beneficial on the cholesterol profile in patients with AD.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the visual motion area (MT) is considered as a brain region specialized for visual motion perception. However, accumulating evidence showed that MT is also related to various functions, suggesting that it is a complex functional area and different functional subregions might exist in this area. To delineate functional subregions of this area, left and right masks of MT were defined using meta-analysis in the BrainMap database, and coactivation-based parcellation was then performed on these two masks. Two dorsal subregions (Cl1 and Cl2) and one ventral subregion (Cl3) of left MT, as well as two dorsal-anterior subregions (Cl1 and Cl2), one ventral-anterior subregion (Cl3), and an additional posterior subregion (Cl4) of right MT were identified. In addition to vision motion, distinct and specific functions were identified in different subregions characterized by task-dependent functional connectivity mapping and forward/reverse inference on associated functions. These results not only were in accordance with the previous findings of a hemispheric asymmetry of MT, but also strongly confirmed the existence of subregions in this region with distinct and specific functions. Furthermore, our results extend the special role of visual motion perception on this area and might facilitate future cognitive study.</p>

<p>In the last decades, several electrophysiological markers have been investigated to better understand how humans precede a signaled event. Among others, the pre-stimulus microstates’ topography, representing the whole brain activity, has been proposed as a promising index of the anticipatory period in several cognitive tasks. However, to date, a clear relationship between the metrics of the pre-stimulus microstates [i.e., the global explained variance (GEV) and the frequency of occurrence (FOO)] and well-known electroencephalography marker of the anticipation (i.e., the alpha power reduction) has not been investigated. Here, after extracting the microstates during the expectancy of the semantic memory task, we investigate the correlations between the microstate features and the anticipatory alpha (8–12 Hz) power reduction (i.e., the event-related de-synchronization of the alpha rhythms; ERD) that is widely interpreted as a functional correlate of brain activation. We report a positive correlation between the occurrence of the dominant, but not non-dominant, microstate and both the mean amplitude of high-alpha ERD and the magnitude of the alpha ERD peak so that the stronger the decrease (percentage) in the alpha power, the higher the FOO of the dominant microstate. Moreover, we find a positive correlation between the occurrence of the dominant microstate and the latency of the alpha ERD peak, suggesting that subjects with higher FOO present the stronger alpha ERD closely to the target. These correlations are not significant between the GEV and all anticipatory alpha ERD indices. Our results suggest that only the occurrence of the dominant, but not non-dominant, microstate should be considered as a useful electrophysiological correlate of the cortical activation.</p>

<p>Previous studies suggest locomotion training could be an effective non-invasive therapy after spinal cord injury (SCI) using primarily acute thoracic injuries. However, the majority of SCI patients have chronic cervical injuries. Regaining hand function could significantly increase their quality of life. In this study, we used a clinically relevant chronic cervical contusion to study the therapeutic efficacy of rehabilitation in forelimb functional recovery. Nude rats received a moderate C5 unilateral contusive injury and were then divided into two groups with or without Modified Montoya Staircase (MMS) rehabilitation. For the rehabilitation group, rats were trained 5 days a week starting at 8 weeks post-injury (PI) for 6 weeks. All rats were assessed for skilled forelimb functions with MMS test weekly and for untrained gross forelimb locomotion with grooming and horizontal ladder (HL) tests biweekly. Our results showed that MMS rehabilitation significantly increased the number of pellets taken at 13 and 14 weeks PI and the accuracy rates at 12 to 14 weeks PI. However, there were no significant differences in the grooming scores or the percentage of HL missteps at any time point. Histological analyses revealed that MMS rehabilitation significantly increased the number of serotonergic fibers and the amount of presynaptic terminals around motor neurons in the cervical ventral horns caudal to the injury and reduced glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactive astrogliosis in spinal cords caudal to the lesion. This study shows that MMS rehabilitation can modify the injury environment, promote axonal sprouting and synaptic plasticity, and importantly, improve reaching and grasping functions in the forelimb, supporting the therapeutic potential of task-specific rehabilitation for functional recovery after chronic SCI.</p>

<p>Reduced pain tolerance may be one of the possible explanations for high prevalence of chronic pain among older people. We hypothesized that age-related alterations in pain tolerance are associated with functioning deterioration of the frontal cortex during normal aging. Twenty-one young and 41 elderly healthy participants underwent a tonic heat pain test, during which cerebral activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). Elderly participants were divided into two subgroups according to their scores on executive tests, high performers (HPs; n = 21) and low performers (LPs; n = 20). Pain measures [exposure times (ETs) and perceived pain ratings] and cerebral activity were compared among the three groups. ETs were significantly lower in elderly LPs than in young participants and elderly HPs. Electroencephalographic analyses showed that gamma-band oscillations (GBOs) were significantly increased in pain state for all subjects, especially in the frontal sites. Source analysis showed that GBO increase in elderly LPs was contributed not only by frontal but also by central, parietal, and occipital regions. These findings suggest that better preservation of frontal functions may result in better pain tolerance by elderly subjects.</p>

Enhanced resolution 3D microscopy reveals the dynamics of thin dendritic spine protrusions, termed spinules, which are uniquely regulated by local Ca2+ and the Rac1-GEF kalirin-7. The majority are small, short-lived, dynamic, and recurrent, whereas an elongated subset is activity-induced, stabilized by distal presynaptic terminals, and can form connectivity-altering secondary synapses.

<p>by Clare I. Abreu, Vilhelm L. Andersen Woltz, Jonathan Friedman, Jeff Gore</p>

The effect of environmental fluctuations is a major question in ecology. While it is widely accepted that fluctuations and other types of disturbances can increase biodiversity, there are fewer examples of other types of outcomes in a fluctuating environment. Here we explore this question with laboratory microcosms, using cocultures of two bacterial species, <i>P</i>. <i>putida</i> and <i>P</i>. <i>veronii</i>. At low dilution rates we observe competitive exclusion of <i>P</i>. <i>veronii</i>, whereas at high dilution rates we observe competitive exclusion of <i>P</i>. <i>putida</i>. When the dilution rate alternates between high and low, we do not observe coexistence between the species, but rather alternative stable states, in which only one species survives and initial species’ fractions determine the identity of the surviving species. The Lotka-Volterra model with a fluctuating mortality rate predicts that this outcome is independent of the timing of the fluctuations, and that the time-averaged mortality would also lead to alternative stable states, a prediction that we confirm experimentally. Other pairs of species can coexist in a fluctuating environment, and again consistent with the model we observe coexistence in the time-averaged dilution rate. We find a similar time-averaging result holds in a three-species community, highlighting that simple linear models can in some cases provide powerful insight into how communities will respond to environmental fluctuations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TMfn7BB66D0" width="1" />

<p>by Christopher B. Currin, Andrew J. Trevelyan, Colin J. Akerman, Joseph V. Raimondo</p>

Fast synaptic inhibition is a critical determinant of neuronal output, with subcellular targeting of synaptic inhibition able to exert different transformations of the neuronal input-output function. At the receptor level, synaptic inhibition is primarily mediated by chloride-permeable Type A GABA receptors. Consequently, dynamics in the neuronal chloride concentration can alter the functional properties of inhibitory synapses. How differences in the spatial targeting of inhibitory synapses interact with intracellular chloride dynamics to modulate the input-output function of neurons is not well understood. To address this, we developed computational models of multi-compartment neurons that incorporate experimentally parametrised mechanisms to account for neuronal chloride influx, diffusion, and extrusion. We found that synaptic input (either excitatory, inhibitory, or both) can lead to subcellular variations in chloride concentration, despite a uniform distribution of chloride extrusion mechanisms. Accounting for chloride changes resulted in substantial alterations in the neuronal input-output function. This was particularly the case for peripherally targeted dendritic inhibition where dynamic chloride compromised the ability of inhibition to offset neuronal input-output curves. Our simulations revealed that progressive changes in chloride concentration mean that the neuronal input-output function is not static but varies significantly as a function of the duration of synaptic drive. Finally, we found that the observed effects of dynamic chloride on neuronal output were mediated by changes in the dendritic reversal potential for GABA. Our findings provide a framework for understanding the computational effects of chloride dynamics on dendritically targeted synaptic inhibition.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Xy9ZofIHwmU" width="1" />

S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is one of the most important enzyme substrates. It is vital for the function of various proteins, including large group of methyltransferases (MTs). Intriguingly, some bacterial and eukaryotic MTs, while catalysing the same reaction, possess significantly different topologies, with the former being a knotted one. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of SAM conformational space and factors that affect its vastness. We investigated SAM in two forms: free in water (via NMR studies and explicit solvent simulations) and bound to proteins (based on all data available in the PDB and on all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in water). We identified structural descriptors—angles which show the major differences in SAM conformation between unknotted and knotted methyltransferases. Moreover, we report that this is caused mainly by a characteristic for knotted MTs compact binding site formed by the knot and the presence of adenine-binding loop. Additionally, we elucidate conformational restrictions imposed on SAM molecules by other protein groups in comparison to conformational space in water.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/m35Km0cNHrc" width="1" />

<p>by Francesca Young, Simon Rogers, David L. Robertson</p>

The rise in metagenomics has led to an exponential growth in virus discovery. However, the majority of these new virus sequences have no assigned host. Current machine learning approaches to predicting virus host interactions have a tendency to focus on nucleotide features, ignoring other representations of genomic information. Here we investigate the predictive potential of features generated from four different ‘levels’ of viral genome representation: nucleotide, amino acid, amino acid properties and protein domains. This more fully exploits the biological information present in the virus genomes. Over a hundred and eighty binary datasets for infecting versus non-infecting viruses at all taxonomic ranks of both eukaryote and prokaryote hosts were compiled. The viral genomes were converted into the four different levels of genome representation and twenty feature sets were generated by extracting k-mer compositions and predicted protein domains. We trained and tested Support Vector Machine, SVM, classifiers to compare the predictive capacity of each of these feature sets for each dataset. Our results show that all levels of genome representation are consistently predictive of host taxonomy and that prediction k-mer composition improves with increasing k-mer length for all k-mer based features. Using a phylogenetically aware holdout method, we demonstrate that the predictive feature sets contain signals reflecting both the evolutionary relationship between the viruses infecting related hosts, and host-mimicry. Our results demonstrate that incorporating a range of complementary features, generated purely from virus genome sequences, leads to improved accuracy for a range of virus host prediction tasks enabling computational assignment of host taxonomic information.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/A8a_FLHiaZs" width="1" />

<p>by Haleh Alimohamadi, Alyson S. Smith, Roberta B. Nowak, Velia M. Fowler, Padmini Rangamani</p>

The biconcave disk shape of the mammalian red blood cell (RBC) is unique to the RBC and is vital for its circulatory function. Due to the absence of a transcellular cytoskeleton, RBC shape is determined by the membrane skeleton, a network of actin filaments cross-linked by spectrin and attached to membrane proteins. While the physical properties of a uniformly distributed actin network interacting with the lipid bilayer membrane have been assumed to control RBC shape, recent experiments reveal that RBC biconcave shape also depends on the contractile activity of nonmuscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) motor proteins. Here, we use the classical Helfrich-Canham model for the RBC membrane to test the role of heterogeneous force distributions along the membrane and mimic the contractile activity of sparsely distributed NMIIA filaments. By incorporating this additional contribution to the Helfrich-Canham energy, we find that the RBC biconcave shape depends on the ratio of forces per unit volume in the dimple and rim regions of the RBC. Experimental measurements of NMIIA densities at the dimple and rim validate our prediction that (a) membrane forces must be non-uniform along the RBC membrane and (b) the force density must be larger in the dimple than the rim to produce the observed membrane curvatures. Furthermore, we predict that RBC membrane tension and the orientation of the applied forces play important roles in regulating this force-shape landscape. Our findings of heterogeneous force distributions on the plasma membrane for RBC shape maintenance may also have implications for shape maintenance in different cell types.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tdtlqFxkPn4" width="1" />

<p>by Arumay Pal, Yaakov Levy</p>

DNA sequences are often recognized by multi-domain proteins that may have higher affinity and specificity than single-domain proteins. However, the higher affinity to DNA might be coupled with slower recognition kinetics. In this study, we address this balance between stability and kinetics for multi-domain Cys<sub>2</sub>His<sub>2</sub>- (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-) type zinc-finger (ZF) proteins. These proteins are the most prevalent DNA-binding domain in eukaryotes and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> type zinc-finger proteins (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-ZFPs) constitute nearly one-half of all known and predicted transcription factors in human. Extensive contact with DNA via tandem ZF domains confers high stability on the sequence-specific complexes. However, this can limit target search efficiency, especially for low abundance ZFPs. Earlier, we found that asymmetrical distribution of electrostatic charge among the three ZF domains of the low abundance transcription factor Egr-1 facilitates its DNA search process. Here, on a diverse set of 273 human C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-ZFP comprised of 3–15 tandem ZF domains, we find that, in many cases, electrostatic charge and binding specificity are asymmetrically distributed among the ZF domains so that neighbouring domains have different DNA-binding properties. For proteins containing 3–6 ZF domains, we show that the low abundance proteins possess a higher degree of non-specific asymmetry and vice versa. Our findings suggest that where the electrostatics of tandem ZF domains are similar (i.e., symmetrical), the ZFPs are more abundant to optimize their DNA search efficiency. This study reveals new insights into the fundamental determinants of recognition by C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-ZFPs of their DNA binding sites in the cellular landscape. The importance of electrostatic asymmetry with respect to binding site recognition by C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-ZFPs suggests the possibility that it may also be important in other ZFP systems and reveals a new design feature for zinc finger engineering.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RUxYdMJWctY" width="1" />

Interactions between disordered proteins involve a wide range of changes in the structure and dynamics of the partners involved. These changes can be classified in terms of binding modes, which include disorder-to-order (DO) transitions, when proteins fold upon binding, as well as disorder-to-disorder (DD) transitions, when the conformational heterogeneity is maintained in the bound states. Furthermore, systematic studies of these interactions are revealing that proteins may exhibit different binding modes with different partners. Proteins that exhibit this context-dependent binding can be referred to as fuzzy proteins. Here we investigate amino acid code for fuzzy binding in terms of the Shannon entropy of the probabilities of transitions towards increasing or decreasing order (<i>p</i><sub>DO</sub> and <i>p</i><sub>DD</sub>). We implement these entropy calculations into the FuzPred (http://protdyn-fuzpred.org) algorithm to predict the range of context-dependent binding modes of proteins from their amino acid sequences. As we illustrate through a variety of examples, this method identifies those binding sites that are sensitive to the cellular context or post-translational modifications, and may serve as regulatory points of cellular pathways.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/e5M5a9eOI4g" width="1" />

Members of the Tre2-Bub2-Cdc16 (TBC) family often function to regulate membrane trafficking and to control signaling transductions pathways. As a member of the TBC family, TBC1D23 is critical for endosome-to-Golgi cargo trafficking by serving as a bridge between Golgi-bound golgin-97/245 and the WASH/FAM21 complex on endosomal vesicles. However, the exact mechanisms by which TBC1D23 regulates cargo transport are poorly understood. Here, we present the crystal structure of the N-terminus of TBC1D23 (D23<sup>N</sup>), which consists of both the TBC and rhodanese domains. We show that the rhodanese domain is unlikely to be an active sulfurtransferase or phosphatase, despite containing a putative catalytic site. Instead, it packs against the TBC domain and forms part of the platform to interact with golgin-97/245. Using the zebrafish model, we show that impacting golgin-97/245-binding, but not the putative catalytic site, impairs neuronal growth and brain development. Altogether, our studies provide structural and functional insights into an essential protein that is required for organelle-specific trafficking and brain development.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qu44YOJC4Bw" width="1" />

Anticipating an odor improves detection and perception, yet the underlying neural mechanisms of olfactory anticipation are not well understood. In this study, we used human intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) to show that anticipation resets the phase of delta oscillations in piriform cortex prior to odor arrival. Anticipatory phase reset correlates with ensuing odor-evoked theta power and improvements in perceptual accuracy. These effects were consistently present in each individual subject and were not driven by potential confounds of pre-inhale motor preparation or power changes. Together, these findings suggest that states of anticipation enhance olfactory perception through phase resetting of delta oscillations in piriform cortex.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/iuOKvySs354" width="1" />

<p>by William P. J. Smith, Andrea Vettiger, Julius Winter, Till Ryser, Laurie E. Comstock, Marek Basler, Kevin R. Foster</p>

The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a nanomachine used by many bacteria to drive a toxin-laden needle into other bacterial cells. Although the potential to influence bacterial competition is clear, the fitness impacts of wielding a T6SS are not well understood. Here we present a new agent-based model that enables detailed study of the evolutionary costs and benefits of T6SS weaponry during competition with other bacteria. Our model identifies a key problem with the T6SS. Because of its short range, T6SS activity becomes self-limiting, as dead cells accumulate in its way, forming “corpse barriers” that block further attacks. However, further exploration with the model presented a solution to this problem: if injected toxins can quickly lyse target cells in addition to killing them, the T6SS becomes a much more effective weapon. We tested this prediction with single-cell analysis of combat between T6SS-wielding <i>Acinetobacter baylyi</i> and T6SS-sensitive <i>Escherichia coli</i>. As predicted, delivery of lytic toxins is highly effective, whereas nonlytic toxins leave large patches of <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> alive. We then analyzed hundreds of bacterial species using published genomic data, which suggest that the great majority of T6SS-wielding species do indeed use lytic toxins, indicative of a general principle underlying weapon evolution. Our work suggests that, in the T6SS, bacteria have evolved a disintegration weapon whose effectiveness often rests upon the ability to break up competitors. Understanding the evolutionary function of bacterial weapons can help in the design of probiotics that can both establish well and eliminate problem species.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/5_LHdCAMXds" width="1" />

Increased life expectancy of patients diagnosed with HIV in the current era of antiretroviral therapy is unfortunately accompanied with the prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs) and risk of comorbidities such as Alzheimer-like pathology. HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein has been shown to induce the production of toxic neuronal amyloid protein and also enhance neurotoxicity. The contribution of astrocytes in Tat-mediated amyloidosis remains an enigma. We report here, in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)+ rhesus macaques and patients diagnosed with HIV, brain region–specific up-regulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Aβ (40 and 42) in astrocytes. In addition, we find increased expression of β-site cleaving enzyme (BACE1), APP, and Aβ in human primary astrocytes (HPAs) exposed to Tat. Mechanisms involved up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α), its translocation and binding to the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) BACE1‐antisense transcript (BACE1-AS), resulting, in turn, in the formation of the BACE1-AS/BACE1 RNA complex, subsequently leading to increased BACE1 protein, and activity and generation of Aβ-42. Gene silencing approaches confirmed the regulatory role of HIF-1α in BACE1-AS/BACE1 in Tat-mediated amyloidosis. This is the first report implicating the role of the HIF-1α/lncRNABACE1-AS/BACE1 axis in Tat-mediated induction of astrocytic amyloidosis, which could be targeted as adjunctive therapies for HAND-associated Alzheimer-like comorbidity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/xNuaoBeFtwk" width="1" />

One of the most influential accounts of central orbitofrontal cortex—that it mediates behavioral flexibility—has been challenged by the finding that discrimination reversal in macaques, the classic test of behavioral flexibility, is unaffected when lesions are made by excitotoxin injection rather than aspiration. This suggests that the critical brain circuit mediating behavioral flexibility in reversal tasks lies beyond the central orbitofrontal cortex. To determine its identity, a group of nine macaques were taught discrimination reversal learning tasks, and its impact on gray matter was measured. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were taken before and after learning and compared with scans from two control groups, each comprising 10 animals. One control group learned discrimination tasks that were similar but lacked any reversal component, and the other control group engaged in no learning. Gray matter changes were prominent in posterior orbitofrontal cortex/anterior insula but were also found in three other frontal cortical regions: lateral orbitofrontal cortex (orbital part of area 12 [12o]), cingulate cortex, and lateral prefrontal cortex. In a second analysis, neural activity in posterior orbitofrontal cortex/anterior insula was measured at rest, and its pattern of coupling with the other frontal cortical regions was assessed. Activity coupling increased significantly in the reversal learning group in comparison with controls. In a final set of experiments, we used similar structural imaging procedures and analyses to demonstrate that aspiration lesion of central orbitofrontal cortex, of the type known to affect discrimination learning, affected structure and activity in the same frontal cortical circuit. The results identify a distributed frontal cortical circuit associated with behavioral flexibility.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7bLSqR7cW90" width="1" />

<p>by Avner Wallach, David Deutsch, Tess Baker Oram, Ehud Ahissar</p>

Animals actively move their sensory organs in order to acquire sensory information. Some rodents, such as mice and rats, employ cyclic scanning motions of their facial whiskers to explore their proximal surrounding, a behavior known as whisking. Here, we investigated the contingency of whisking kinematics on the animal’s behavioral context that arises from both internal processes (attention and expectations) and external constraints (available sensory and motor degrees of freedom). We recorded rat whisking at high temporal resolution in 2 experimental contexts—freely moving or head-fixed—and 2 spatial sensory configurations—a single row or 3 caudal whiskers on each side of the snout. We found that rapid sensorimotor twitches, called pumps, occurring during free-air whisking carry information about the rat’s upcoming exploratory direction, as demonstrated by the ability of these pumps to predict consequent head and body locomotion. Specifically, pump behavior during both voluntary motionlessness and imposed head fixation exposed a backward redistribution of sensorimotor exploratory resources. Further, head-fixed rats employed a wide range of whisking profiles to compensate for the loss of head- and body-motor degrees of freedom. Finally, changing the number of intact vibrissae available to a rat resulted in an alteration of whisking strategy consistent with the rat actively reallocating its remaining resources. In sum, this work shows that rats adapt their active exploratory behavior in a homeostatic attempt to preserve sensorimotor coverage under changing environmental conditions and changing sensory capacities, including those imposed by various laboratory conditions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/oarD9EsnT5I" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate whether intensive blood pressure treatment is associated with less hematoma growth and better outcome in ICH patients who received intravenous nicardipine treatment within 2 hrs after onset of symptoms.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A post‐hoc exploratory analysis of the Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage 2 (ATACH‐2) trial was performed. This was a multicenter, international, open‐label randomized clinical trial in which patients with primary ICH were allocated to intensive versus standard blood pressure treatment with nicardipine within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. We have included 913 patients with complete imaging and follow‐up data in the present analysis.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among the 913 included patients, 354 (38.7%) had intravenous nicardipine treatment initiated within 2 hours. In this subgroup of patients treated within 2 hours, the frequency of ICH expansion was significantly lower in the intensive blood pressure reduction group as compared with standard treatment group (P = 0.02). Multivariable analysis showed that ultra‐early intensive blood pressure treatment was associated with a decreased risk of hematoma growth (odds ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.34–0.92; P = 0.02), higher rate of functional independence (odds ratio, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.28–3.68; P = 0.004) and good outcome (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.01–2.83; P = 0.048) at 90 days. Ultra‐early intensive blood pressure reduction was associated with a favorable shift in modified Rankin Scale score distribution at 3 months (p = 0.04).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In a subgroup of ICH patients with elevated blood pressure given intravenous nicardipine within 2 hours of symptom onset, intensive blood pressure reduction was associated with reduced hematoma growth and improved functional outcome.</p>
