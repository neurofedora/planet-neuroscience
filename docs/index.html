                <p>The subjective visual vertical (VV), the visually estimated direction of gravity, is essential for assessing vestibular function and visuospatial cognition. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying altered VV perception in stroke participants with unilateral spatial neglect (USN), specifically by examining their eye movement patterns during VV judgment tasks. Participants with USN demonstrated limited eye movement scanning along a rotating bar, often fixating on prominent ends, such as the top or bottom. This suggests a reflexive response to visually salient areas, potentially interfering with accurate VV perception. In contrast, participants without USN showed broader scanning around the center of the bar. Notably, participants with USN without frontal lobe lesions occasionally exhibited extended scanning that included the bar&rsquo;s center, which was associated with accurate VV judgments. These findings suggest that (1) a tendency to fixate on peripheral, prominent areas and (2) frontal lobe involvement in disengaging and redirecting spatial attention may influence VV perception in USN. Based on these results, targeted rehabilitation strategies that encourage individuals with USN to extend their visual scanning beyond prominent endpoints and include central areas could improve VV accuracy. This study highlights the specific eye movement behaviors contributing to VV misperception, emphasizing the importance of training that broadens scanning to improve VV perception effectively.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/1/ENEURO.0287-24.2024?rss=1">Exploring Relevant Features for EEG-Based Investigation of Sound Perception in Naturalistic Soundscapes</a></h4>

              
                <p>A comprehensive analysis of everyday sound perception can be achieved using electroencephalography (EEG) with the concurrent acquisition of information about the environment. While extensive research has been dedicated to speech perception, the complexities of auditory perception within everyday environments, specifically the types of information and the key features to extract, remain less explored. Our study aims to systematically investigate the relevance of different feature categories: discrete sound-identity markers, general cognitive state information, and acoustic representations, including discrete sound onset, the envelope, and mel-spectrogram. Using continuous data analysis, we contrast different features in terms of their predictive power for unseen data and thus their distinct contributions to explaining neural data. For this, we analyze data from a complex audio-visual motor task using a naturalistic soundscape. The results demonstrated that the feature sets that explain the most neural variability were a combination of highly detailed acoustic features with a comprehensive description of specific sound onsets. Furthermore, it showed that established features can be applied to complex soundscapes. Crucially, the outcome hinged on excluding periods devoid of sound onsets in the analysis in the case of the discrete features. Our study highlights the importance to comprehensively describe the soundscape, using acoustic and non-acoustic aspects, to fully understand the dynamics of sound perception in complex situations. This approach can serve as a foundation for future studies aiming to investigate sound perception in natural settings.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/1/ENEURO.0300-24.2024?rss=1">Alterations of White Matter Microstructure in Migraine Patients Vary in the Peri-ictal Phases</a></h4>

              
                <p>Alterations in white matter (WM) microstructure are commonly found in migraine patients. Here, we employ a longitudinal study of episodic migraine without aura using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to investigate whether such WM microstructure alterations vary through the different phases of the pain cycle. Fourteen patients with episodic migraine without aura related with menstruation were scanned through four phases of their (spontaneous) migraine cycle (interictal, preictal, ictal, and postictal). Fifteen healthy controls were studied in the corresponding phases of the menstrual cycle. Multishell dMRI data were acquired and preprocessed to obtain maps of diffusion parameters reflecting WM microstructure. After a whole-brain analysis comparing patients with controls, a region-of-interest analysis was performed to determine whether the patients&rsquo; microstructural changes varied across the migraine cycle in specific WM tracts. Compared with controls, patients showed reduced axial diffusivity (AD) in several WM tracts across the whole brain in the interictal phase and increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in commissural fibers in the ictal phase. Interestingly, AD returned to baseline levels during peri-ictal phases in specific projection and association fibers. In contrast, FA values decreased in the ictal phase away from normal values in a few commissural and projection tracts. Widespread WM fiber tracts suffer structural variations across the migraine cycle, suggesting microstructural changes potentially associated with limbic and salience functional networks and highlighting the importance of the cycle phase in imaging studies of migraine.</p>

                <p>Psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, are highly comorbid in people with epilepsy. However, the mechanisms mediating the shared pathophysiology are currently unknown. There is considerable evidence implicating the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in the network communication of anxiety and fear, a process demonstrated to involve parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons. The loss of PV interneurons has been well described in the hippocampus of chronically epileptic mice and in postmortem human tissue of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). We hypothesize that a loss of PV interneurons in the BLA may contribute to comorbid mood disorders in epilepsy. To test this hypothesis, we employed a ventral intrahippocampal kainic acid model of TLE in mice, which exhibits profound behavioral deficits associated with chronic epilepsy. We demonstrate a loss of PV interneurons and dysfunction of the remaining PV interneurons in the BLA of chronically epileptic mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate altered principal neuron function and impaired coordination of BLA network and behavioral states in chronically epileptic mice. To determine whether the loss of PV interneurons contributes to these altered network and behavioral states, we partially ablated PV interneurons in the BLA by stereotaxically injecting AAV-Flex-DTA into the BLA of PV-Cre mice. Loss of PV interneurons in the BLA is sufficient to alter behavioral states, such as increasing avoidance behaviors and impairing fear learning. These data suggest that compromised inhibition in the BLA in chronically epileptic mice may contribute to behavioral deficits, suggesting a novel mechanism contributing to comorbid anxiety and epilepsy.</p>

                <p>Epilepsy&ndash;aphasia syndrome (EAS) is a spectrum of childhood disorders that exhibit complex comorbidities that include epilepsy and the emergence of cognitive and language disorders. CNKSR2 is an X-linked gene in which mutations are linked to EAS. We previously demonstrated Cnksr2 knock-out (KO) mice model key phenotypes of EAS analogous to those present in clinical patients with mutations in the gene. Cnksr2 KO mice have increased seizures, impaired learning and memory, increased levels of anxiety, and loss of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs). The intricate interplay between these diverse phenotypes at the brain regional and cell-type level remains unknown. Here, we leverage conditional deletion of the X-linked Cnksr2 in a neuronal cell-type manner in male mice to demonstrate that anxiety and impaired USVs track with its loss from excitatory neurons. Finally, we further narrow the essential role of Cnksr2 loss in USV deficits to excitatory neurons of the ACC, a region in mice recently implicated in USV production associated with specific emotional states or social contexts, such as mating calls, distress calls, or social bonding signals. Together, our results reveal Cnksr2-based mechanisms that underlie USV impairments that suggest communication impairments can be dissociated from seizures or anxiety. Furthermore, we highlight the cortical circuitry important for initiating USVs.</p>

                Aim To determine the influencing factors of health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) perceived by North-African children/adolescents with type-1 diabetes-mellitus (T1DM) and their parents. Methods It was a cross sectional study conducted in Tunisia. A total of 116 patients ( ie ; 43 children and 73 adolescents) and their parents were included. The Arabic validated version of the Pediatric Generic Core Quality-of-Life Inventory 4.0-Scale (PedsQL4.0) was used to evaluate the HRQoL of children/adolescents as perceived by patients and parents. The dependent data were the patients’ self-report and the parents’ proxy-report of the PedsQL4.0 total scores, and the independent data were the patients and parents characteristics. Results Patients’ PedsQL4.0 total score was influenced significantly by siblings in the family > 2; lipodystrophy, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C). The combination of these factors explained 34.84% of the PedsQL4.0 total score variability. Parents’ PedsQL4.0 total score was influenced significantly by lipodystrophy, siblings; body mass index (BMI), hypoglycemia episodes, and HbA1C. The combination of these factors explained 56.92% of the PedsQL4.0 total score variability. Conclusion T1DM patients self-reported HRQoL was influenced by siblings in the family > 2; lipodystrophy, and HbA1C. The parents’ proxy-report HRQoL was influenced by lipodystrophy, siblings, BMI, hypoglycemia episodes, and HbA1C.

                Introduction Recent reports indicate the emergence of community-acquired pneumonia associated with K64- Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae). Here, we identify the capsular types and sequence type of invasive and commensal K. pneumoniae isolates from Vietnam. Methods We included 93 K. pneumoniae isolates from patients hospitalized at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Hanoi between 2007 and 2011; and 110 commensal isolates from throat swabs from healthy volunteers living in rural and urban Hanoi in 2012. We determined sequence types (STs) by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and capsule typing for seven K types by PCR. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using disk diffusion. Results The most common detected capsule types were K1 (39/203, 19.2%, mainly ST23) and K2 (31/203, 15.3%, multiple STs: ST65, ST86, ST380). We found significantly more K2 isolates among invasive in comparison to commensal isolates (22.6% vs 9%, p = 0.01) but no significant difference was observed between invasive and commensal K1 isolates (14.5% vs 24.7%, p = 0.075). K64 with varying sequence types were predominantly seen among invasive K. pneumoniae (8 vs. 3) and were isolated from sepsis and meningitis patients. Among K64 isolates, one was carbapenem-resistant with ST799. Conclusion Our study confirms that capsule type K64 K. pneumoniae is associated with community-acquired invasive infections in Vietnam. Research is needed to unravel the mechanisms of virulence of capsule type K64 in both community and hospital settings.

                Background Rehabilitation services are necessary for many people with disabilities to improve their functioning and be included in society. This study aimed to determine the factors associated with the use of rehabilitation services among people with disabilities in Chile in 2015. Methods This cross-sectional analysis of secondary data from Chile’s 2015 Second National Disability Study (ENDISC II) included people with disabilities aged ≥18 years. The dependent variable was the use of rehabilitation services in the previous year, and the exposure variables were sociodemographic and confounders. Poisson regression was used to determine associated factors, and prevalence ratios (PR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated. All results were weighted according to the ENDISC II complex sampling. Results A total of 2610 people with disabilities were included, and 19.1% used some rehabilitation services in the previous year. Educational level (PR 0.43; 95% CI 0.25–0.75), having a mental illness (PR 1.77; 95% CI 1.44–2.18), and caregiver assistance (PR 1.57; 95% CI 1.25–1.97) were factors associated with the use of rehabilitation services. Conclusions In 2015, one-fifth of people with disabilities in Chile used some rehabilitation services in the previous year. People with disabilities with lower educational levels were less likely to access these services. By contrast, people with mental illness and caregiver assistance were more likely to use rehabilitation services.

                Background Yeasts are unicellular fungi that inhabit a variety of environments including plant surfaces, water, soil, and animal hosts. However, limited research has been conducted on soil and plant associated yeasts in Africa, with most studies originating from developed regions. Methods This study explored the diversity, distribution, and phenotypic characterization of cultivable wild yeast in samples from rhizosphere soil, leaves, litter, and tree bark collected from South West Ethiopia. Yeast isolates were characterized using morphological, physiological and biochemical methods, Stress-tolerant yeast species were identified using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF). Results Based on morphological, physiological, and biochemical analyses, a total of 15 yeast genera were identified from 23 plant species. Predominant yeast species included Candida spp., Saccharomyces spp., Meyerozyma spp., Pichia spp., Geotrichum spp., and Hanseniaspora spp. Plant species with the highest yeast diversity were Ficus vasta, Ficus exasperata, Ficus sycomorus, Cordia africana, and Ritchiea albersii. Bark samples yielded more yeast isolates than rhizosphere soil, litter, and leaves. Stress-tolerant species such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida pelliculosa, Meyerozyma guilliermondii, Pichia kluyveri, and Trichosporon asahii were identified using MALDI-TOF. Correlation analysis revealed no significant relationship between yeast populations in bark and leaf samples or between rhizosphere soil and leaves, though a weak positive correlation was found between rhizosphere soil and bark or litter. Seasonal analysis showed a strong positive correlation between yeast abundance in spring and summer, but no association between autumn and spring. Conclusion Ethiopian forests are home for various yeast species including the stress-tolerant wild yeasts. This study highlights the significant yeast diversity in Ethiopian forests, with potential applications in improving industrial fermentation processes that operate under stressful conditions.

                Background This study investigates chloride concentrations in tap water samples from Gimba city administration, using the argentometric method to assess water quality. Chloride levels are a key indicator of water treatment effectiveness, particularly the adequacy of chlorination, which is critical for preventing waterborne diseases. Methods Chloride concentrations in tap water samples from various locations in Gimba city administration, were determined using the argentometric titration method. Silver nitrate (AgNO₃) was employed as the titrant to precisely quantify chloride ions. The water samples were collected from different sites in Gimba, and chloride levels were measured to evaluate the adequacy of water treatment processes. Results The chloride concentrations across all samples ranged from 52.8 mg/L to 71.9 mg/L, well below the World Health Organization’s recommended limit for drinking water. Significant variation in chloride levels was observed, with Dembesh exhibiting the highest concentration and Medera the lowest. Conclusion The low chloride concentrations suggest insufficient chlorination at the sampling sites, which may compromise the effectiveness of water disinfection and contribute to the prevalence of waterborne diseases in the region. The study underscores the need for enhanced water treatment and disinfection practices in Gimba city to ensure safe drinking water and reduce health risks.

                Backgrounds Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant health issue in Indonesia, ranking second globally in TB incidence in 2021. Diagnosing intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) is challenging due to its symptoms, which mimic other diseases, limited laboratory tests, and the need for invasive procedures like colonoscopy. This study aimed to develop a non-invasive laboratory panel for ITB using various biomarkers. Methods A cross-sectional study from November 2020 to December 2022 was carried out at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National Central General Hospital. Laboratory parameters from 143 subjects were identified by Chi-square test and multiple regression analysis. The scoring system was developed based on the identified independent diagnostic parameters scored by regression coefficient β value and standard errors, with the cut-off value determined by the ROC curve. The sensitivity and specificity of the scoring system were determined using the ROC curve. Results Among 143 subjects, 22 were diagnosed with ITB and 121 Non-ITB (prevalence of 15.38%). This study was dominated by females (65.03%), with a ratio of 1.86: 1. The median age in this study was 41 years. The scoring system to differentiate ITB and Non-ITB consisted of 6 diagnostic parameters (referred to as the HEALTH scoring system) as follows: stool HBD-2 (1 and 0 points), ESR (1 and 0 points), blood ADA activity (1 and 0 points), Lymphocyte (0 and 1 point), stool TB PCR (2 and 0 points), and NLR (1 and 0 points). Subjects with scores ≥ 4 could be diagnosed as ITB. The sensitivity and specificity of the HEALTH scoring system were 68.18% and 95.04%, respectively. Conclusion This study developed and validated a laboratory panel called the HEALTH scoring system based on clinical biomarkers of stool HBD-2 level, ESR, blood ADA activity, lymphocytes, stool TB PCR, and NLR, which could be used to differentiate ITB from other gastrointestinal diseases.

                Background This study analyzed the nexus between rural household welfare and agricultural technology adoption in Ethiopia using secondary data from the Ethiopian Socioeconomic Survey (ESS). The agricultural sector plays a pivotal role in Ethiopia’s economy, contributing significantly to income, consumption, and employment. This research aims to analyze how adopting agricultural technologies such as improved seeds, fertilizers, and irrigation affects poverty and food insecurity among rural households. The research examined poverty and food insecurity levels in Ethiopia and investigates the impact of adopting agricultural technologies on rural household welfare. Methods We used both Descriptive and econometric methods, in which descriptive analysis has been used to assess poverty and food insecurity levels, and a seemingly unrelated bivariate and multivariate probit model applied to analyze the effect of agricultural technology adoption. Result From descriptive summary, it is noted that out of a total sample of the study, 47.61% (2322 out of 4877) are adopting agricultural technologies in many forms more than 70% of female-headed households are food secured and non-poor and 68% of male-headed households are food secured and nun poor. The findings from regression model indicate that access to irrigation, improved seeds, and fertilizers significantly reduces the likelihood of poverty and food insecurity among rural households. Conclusion Based on these results, policy recommendations include promoting agricultural technologies, enhancing access to credit, investing in agricultural extension services, diversifying livelihoods, improving education, and implementing targeted poverty alleviation programs. Further research is encouraged to explore the reasons behind insignificant variables and to identify additional factors affecting rural household welfare in Ethiopia.

                Background This study was designed to investigate the mediation effects of social empowerment (SE) in the relationship between perceived social support (PSS) and life satisfaction (LS) in women self-help group members. Also, this research attempted to understand the moderating effect of decision making (DM) and external communication (EC) on the relationship between the constructs. Methods To achieve the above objective, the primary data were collected from the self-help group women members by using an existing scale. In this survey, 333 participants who are members of self-help group completed the questionnaire and considered for the study. The study is non-experimental and survey-based, with no interventions or manipulations involved. In line with ethical guidelines, we obtained informed consent directly from each respondent before their participation. Conclusion The path coefficient values, t-statistics and P-Values confirmed the positive relationship between PSS->LS; PSS->SE & SE->LS in women self-group members. PLS structural equation modelling estimated by the bootstrap method revealed that SE partially mediates the relationship between PSS & LS. With regard to the interaction effect, the slope analysis and f2 effect size confirmed the moderating effect of EC in the relationship between PSS -> LS & SE -> LS.

                Background Sustainable modular dwelling design for rural areas should focus on creating healthy and economically accessible spaces, sensitive to local needs and integrating environmental, functional, sociological and technological aspects. Flexibility is essential to reduce the initial investment and allow future transformations, optimizing the recovery and reuse of materials. These houses must be adaptable, safe and have basic services, satisfying the needs and stages of families’ development. In Ecuador, poverty and energy inefficiency worsen the quality of life in rural areas. This project in the Cebadas parish proposes modular dwelling that applies bioclimatic and sustainable criteria, using local materials to improve habitability and promote the social and economic development of the community. Method The research approach is qualitative-quantitative. Qualitative, since it is necessary to identify the qualities of the sector, bibliographic exploration of guidelines and sustainable strategies. Quantitative, to evaluate the degree of affectation through a diagnosis of the study site and to provide efficient solutions that respond to the context and social reality. Results The spaces presented in the proposal respond to the spatial need for growth and expansion of the users of the sector, through 6 basic guidelines that this type of dwelling should have: Environment, Visual, Form, Function, Bioclimatic and Materials. Conclusions The flexible modular dwelling project for rural environments addresses complex housing needs, highlighting the flexibility and adaptability of an expandable module. It includes income generation with a duplex apartment, fosters communal and cultural life with public and commercial spaces, promotes tourism and rural development with landscape design and crops. In addition, it ensures sustainability through bioclimatic strategies and responsible use of resources.

                Background This study used ChatGPT for sentiment analysis to investigate the possible links between online sentiments and COVID-19 vaccination rates. It also examines Internet posts to understand the attitudes and reasons associated with vaccine-related opinions. Methods We collected 500,558 posts over 60 weeks from the Blind platform, mainly used by working individuals, and 854 relevant posts were analyzed. After excluding duplicates and irrelevant content, attitudes toward and reasons for vaccine opinions were studied through sentiment analysis. The study further correlated these categorized attitudes with the actual vaccination data. Results The proportions of posts expressing positive, negative, and neutral attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines were 5%, 83%, and 12%, respectively. The total post count showed a positive correlation with the vaccination rate, indicating a high correlation between the number of negative posts about the vaccine and the vaccination rate. Negative attitudes were predominantly associated with societal distrust and perceived oppression. Conclusions This study demonstrates the interplay between public perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines as expressed through social media and vaccination behavior. These correlations can serve as useful clues for devising effective vaccination strategies.

                Background Machine learning (ML) algorithms have generally enhanced the speed and accuracy of image-based diagnosis, and treatment strategy planning, compared to the traditional approach of interpreting medical images by experienced radiologists. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been particularly useful in this regard. However, training CNNs come with significant time and computational cost necessitating the development of efficient solutions for deploying CNNs in low-resource environments. This study investigates the use of pre-trained CNNs as feature extractors in medical imaging analyses and highlights the key considerations to be taken into account when implementing these extractors. Methods Eight medical imaging datasets covering several diseases (e.g. breast cancer, brain tumor and malaria) were used. Five ML algorithms (k-nearest neighbours, logistic regression, naïve Bayes, random forests and light gradient boosting machine) were implemented with three pre-trained CNN models (VGG-16, EfficientNet-B0, and ResNet-50). These pre-trained models were deployed as feature extractors fed into the classifiers for image classification tasks. The performance of these classifiers was assessed using a ten-fold cross validation scheme with metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, specificity, sensitivity, AUC-ROC, Matthews’ correlation coefficient (MCC), precision, time and space complexities. Results From our experiments, we found a general improvement in ML models’ performance after feature extraction (FE). Of the three FE models tested,EfficientNet-B0 performed best in terms of predicitve performance i.e. accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, AUC-ROC, MCC, F1 score, and precision. However, VGG-16 had the best performance in terms of time and memory efficiency. Our results identify two conditions necessary for the optimal performance of the FE models; (i) balanced datasets - a set where classes or categories are represented in approximately equal proportions, (ii) big data sets - adequate number of objects for training and testing. Interestingly, the performance of the ML models did not correlate with the number of class labels i.e. the type of classification task whether binary or multi-class had no influence in the models’ performance. Of the five algorithms investigated, logistic regression benefitted the most from the adoption of the feature extractors. Conclusion Our results confirm that the use of CNNs as feature extractors offer an effective balance between high performance and computational efficiency, making them well-suited for use in low-resource environments.

                Background Contamination of Cartagena Bay, Colombia with heavy metals such as mercury (Hg) and cadmium (Cd) presents a major environmental and public health concern, particularly for human communities residing on nearby islands and coastal areas. These populations face enhanced exposure risks owing to their traditional fishing practices and continuous interactions with polluted marine environments. This study aimed to evaluate the genotoxic effects of environmental exposure to Hg and Cd in populations from the island zone of the Cartagena district, Bolívar. Methods Ninety-four individuals from the four island communities (study group) and 30 individuals from the urban area of Cartagena (control group) participated in this study. The blood samples were collected to measure total mercury (T-Hg) and Cd concentrations, and a Buccal Micronucleus Cytome (BMCyt) assay was used to evaluate exposure effects. Results Cadmiun levels in the blood of the study group were within the normal range and comparable to those of the control group (p > 0.05). However, the study group exhibited significantly higher T-Hg levels (7.34 μg/L) compared to the control group (2.01 μg/L), surpassing the accepted limit. Moreover, the study group showed a higher incidence of DNA damage and cell death biomarkers (p < 0.05). Additionally, significant correlations were observed between total blood Hg levels and the frequencies of micronuclei, karyorrhexis, and karyolysis. Conclusion These results suggest that island populations of Cartagena are exposed to high levels of Hg and exhibit genotoxic damage, indicating a problem that must be addressed.

                <p>by Jiang Mao, Constantin A Rothkopf, Alan A Stocker</p>

Sensory neurons continually adapt their response characteristics according to recent stimulus history. However, it is unclear how such a reactive process can benefit the organism. Here, we test the hypothesis that adaptation actually acts proactively in the sense that it optimally adjusts sensory encoding for future stimuli. We first quantified human subjects’ ability to discriminate visual orientation under different adaptation conditions. Using an information theoretic analysis, we found that adaptation leads to a reallocation of coding resources such that encoding accuracy peaks at the mean orientation of the adaptor while total coding capacity remains constant. We then asked whether this characteristic change in encoding accuracy is predicted by the temporal statistics of natural visual input. Analyzing the retinal input of freely behaving human subjects showed that the distribution of local visual orientations in the retinal input stream indeed peaks at the mean orientation of the preceding input history (i.e., the adaptor). We further tested our hypothesis by analyzing the internal sensory representations of a recurrent neural network trained to predict the next frame of natural scene videos (PredNet). Simulating our human adaptation experiment with PredNet, we found that the network exhibited the same change in encoding accuracy as observed in human subjects. Taken together, our results suggest that adaptation-induced changes in encoding accuracy prepare the visual system for future stimuli.

                <p>by Natalie R. Davidson, Fan Zhang, Casey S. Greene</p>

While single-cell experiments provide deep cellular resolution within a single sample, some single-cell experiments are inherently more challenging than bulk experiments due to dissociation difficulties, cost, or limited tissue availability. This creates a situation where we have deep cellular profiles of one sample or condition, and bulk profiles across multiple samples and conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose BuDDI (BUlk Deconvolution with Domain Invariance). BuDDI utilizes domain adaptation techniques to effectively integrate available corpora of case-control bulk and reference scRNA-seq observations to infer cell-type-specific perturbation effects. BuDDI achieves this by learning independent latent spaces within a single variational autoencoder (VAE) encompassing at least four sources of variability: 1) cell type proportion, 2) perturbation effect, 3) structured experimental variability, and 4) remaining variability. Since each latent space is encouraged to be independent, we simulate perturbation responses by independently composing each latent space to simulate cell-type-specific perturbation responses. We evaluated BuDDI’s performance on simulated and real data with experimental designs of increasing complexity. We first validated that BuDDI could learn domain invariant latent spaces on data with matched samples across each source of variability. Then we validated that BuDDI could accurately predict cell-type-specific perturbation response when no single-cell perturbed profiles were used during training; instead, only bulk samples had both perturbed and non-perturbed observations. Finally, we validated BuDDI on predicting sex-specific differences, an experimental design where it is not possible to have matched samples. In each experiment, BuDDI outperformed all other comparative methods and baselines. As more reference atlases are completed, BuDDI provides a path to combine these resources with bulk-profiled treatment or disease signatures to study perturbations, sex differences, or other factors at single-cell resolution.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected global health systems and daily life, exacerbating vulnerabilities, particularly in Indonesia. This study investigates the impact of anxiety and education level on mental health, with spiritual intelligence as an intervening variable among post-COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Methods Utilizing a cross-sectional design, data were collected from 390 post-COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Structured questionnaires assessed anxiety, education level, spiritual intelligence, and mental health. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the relationships among these variables. Results The findings indicate that anxiety significantly affects both spiritual intelligence and mental health, with spiritual intelligence acting as a mediating factor. Additionally, higher educational attainment is positively associated with enhanced spiritual intelligence and improved mental health outcomes. Conclusions The study underscores the importance of incorporating spiritual development practices into mental health interventions and educational programs to boost resilience and overall well-being in the post-pandemic era. While these findings are promising, the cross-sectional design limits causal inferences, and future research should consider longitudinal studies to examine these relationships over time. These practices can help mitigate the adverse effects of anxiety and educational disparities on mental health.

                Background The study analyzes the impact of public health spending on malnutrition among Peruvians, using data from the National Household Survey, the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics and the Ministry of Economy and Finance from 2010. -2020. Previous studies have revealed the existing relationship of health spending with the reduction of malnutrition. Methods A quantitative approach is considered, with an explanatory type of research using panel data methodology considering the bidimensionality of the data, which allows quantifying this effect for the Peruvian case using the National Household Survey, data from the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, as well as information from the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics and the Transparency Portal of the Ministry of Economy and Finance in the period 2010-2020. Results The results show that public expenditure on health has a negative relationship with malnutrition; the rural sector has a positive relationship with malnutrition given the limitations present for access to adequate food. Similarly, the unemployment rate shows a positive relationship with malnutrition, given that being unemployed leads to a higher cause of malnutrition in the population, and the gross domestic product has a negative relationship with malnutrition, given that greater economic growth produces an impact on reducing malnutrition, with the greatest impact being on the rural population and the gross domestic product. Conclusions In the analysis period 2010-2020 in Peru, based on the panel data analysis, the impact of public health expenditure on reducing malnutrition is observed in 10 departments, achieving a reduction in malnutrition; while in 14 departments, this indicator has not been reduced.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-99/v1?src=rss">Predicting determinants of modern contraceptive use among reproductive-age women in Ethiopia using machine learning algorithm: Evidence from the Performance Monitoring and Accountability (PMA) Survey 2019 dataset [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer rev</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Globally, around 40% of women report unintended pregnancies, with approximately 214 million women in developing countries wanting to avoid pregnancy but not using any contraception. Modern contraceptives (MCs) are effective tools for preventing unintended pregnancies, controlling rapid population growth, and reducing fertility and maternal mortality rates, particularly in developing countries. Low use of contraceptives is responsible for the high fertility and maternal mortality rates in sub-Saharan African nations like Ethiopia. Thus, this study aimed to identify the determinants of modern contraceptive use among Ethiopian women of reproductive age using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Methodology The study utilized secondary data from the 2019 Performance Monitoring and Accountability (PMA) Ethiopia survey, analyzing 8,837 samples. Preprocessing steps included data cleaning, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and splitting the data, with 80% used for training and 20% for testing the algorithms. Six supervised ML algorithms were employed and assessed using confusion matrices, with information gain applied to identify critical attributes for predicting MC use. Results Only 24% of participants used modern contraceptives {95% CI (23.1%, 24.9%). Extreme gradient boosting (XGB) demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy (81.97%, 95% CI {79.06%, 82.7%}) and area under the ROC curve (76.63%), followed by logistic regression (80.52%) and support vector machines (80.41%). Key determinants of MC use included starting family planning at age 20 or older, being single, having partner approval, being the wife of the household head, age between 36–49 years, advice from healthcare providers, concerns about side effects, and having a household size of five or more. Conclusion and Recommendations The use of modern contraceptives among Ethiopian women remains low. Extreme gradient boosting proved most effective in predicting determinants of MC use. Improved counseling during ANC/PNC visits, promoting partner discussions on family planning, and addressing concerns about family size and contraceptive use are recommended strategies to enhance MC uptake.

                Zhou et al. identify a 9-bp deletion in a putative transcriptional regulator in P. aeruginosa. This mutation is highly associated with chronic P. aeruginosa infection and leads to pyruvate accumulation by downregulating aceEF transcription and, consequently, attenuating bacterial virulence and enhancing innate immune evasion in the host.

                The specific role that prolactin plays in lactational infertility, as distinct from other suckling or metabolic cues, remains unresolved. Here, deletion of the prolactin receptor (Prlr) from forebrain neurons or arcuate kisspeptin neurons resulted in failure to maintain normal lactation-induced suppression of estrous cycles. Kisspeptin immunoreactivity and pulsatile LH secretion were increased in these mice, even in the presence of ongoing suckling stimulation and lactation. GCaMP fibre photometry of arcuate kisspeptin neurons revealed that the normal episodic activity of these neurons is rapidly suppressed in pregnancy and this was maintained throughout early lactation. Deletion of Prlr from arcuate kisspeptin neurons resulted in early reactivation of episodic activity of kisspeptin neurons prior to a premature return of reproductive cycles in early lactation. These observations show dynamic variation in arcuate kisspeptin neuronal activity associated with the hormonal changes of pregnancy and lactation, and provide direct evidence that prolactin action on arcuate kisspeptin neurons is necessary for suppressing fertility during lactation in mice.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102618">Realistic mossy fiber input patterns to unipolar brush cells evoke a continuum of temporal responses comprised of components mediated by different glutamate receptors</a></h4>

              
                Unipolar brush cells (UBCs) are excitatory interneurons in the cerebellar cortex that receive mossy fiber (MF) inputs and excite granule cells. The UBC population responds to brief burst activation of MFs with a continuum of temporal transformations, but it is not known how UBCs transform the diverse range of MF input patterns that occur in vivo. Here, we use cell-attached recordings from UBCs in acute cerebellar slices to examine responses to MF firing patterns that are based on in vivo recordings. We find that MFs evoke a continuum of responses in the UBC population, mediated by three different types of glutamate receptors that each convey a specialized component. AMPARs transmit timing information for single stimuli at up to 5 spikes/s, and for very brief bursts. A combination of mGluR2/3s (inhibitory) and mGluR1s (excitatory) mediates a continuum of delayed, and broadened responses to longer bursts, and to sustained high frequency activation. Variability in the mGluR2/3 component controls the time course of the onset of firing, and variability in the mGluR1 component controls the duration of prolonged firing. We conclude that the combination of glutamate receptor types allows each UBC to simultaneously convey different aspects of MF firing. These findings establish that UBCs are highly flexible circuit elements that provide diverse temporal transformations that are well suited to contribute to specialized processing in different regions of the cerebellar cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98409">Altering the redox status of Chlamydia trachomatis directly impacts its developmental cycle progression</a></h4>

              
                <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen with a unique developmental cycle. It differentiates between two functional and morphological forms: the elementary body (EB) and the reticulate body (RB). The signals that trigger differentiation from one form to the other are unknown. EBs and RBs have distinctive characteristics that distinguish them, including their size, infectivity, proteome, and transcriptome. Intriguingly, they also differ in their overall redox status as EBs are oxidized and RBs are reduced. We hypothesize that alterations in redox may serve as a trigger for secondary differentiation. To test this, we examined the function of the primary antioxidant enzyme alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C (AhpC), a well-known member of the peroxiredoxins family, in chlamydial growth and development. Based on our hypothesis, we predicted that altering the expression of <i>ahpC</i> would modulate chlamydial redox status and trigger earlier or delayed secondary differentiation. Therefore, we created <i>ahpC</i> overexpression and knockdown strains. During <i>ahpC</i> knockdown, ROS levels were elevated, and the bacteria were sensitive to a broad set of peroxide stresses. Interestingly, we observed increased expression of EB-associated genes and concurrent higher production of EBs at an earlier time in the developmental cycle, indicating earlier secondary differentiation occurs under elevated oxidation conditions. In contrast, overexpression of AhpC created a resistant phenotype against oxidizing agents and delayed secondary differentiation. Together, these results indicate that redox potential is a critical factor in developmental cycle progression. For the first time, our study provides a mechanism of chlamydial secondary differentiation dependent on redox status.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95273">Unbiased identification of cell identity in dense mixed neural cultures</a></h4>

              
                Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology is revolutionizing cell biology. However, the variability between individual iPSC lines and the lack of efficient technology to comprehensively characterize iPSC-derived cell types hinder its adoption in routine preclinical screening settings. To facilitate the validation of iPSC-derived cell culture composition, we have implemented an imaging assay based on cell painting and convolutional neural networks to recognize cell types in dense and mixed cultures with high fidelity. We have benchmarked our approach using pure and mixed cultures of neuroblastoma and astrocytoma cell lines and attained a classification accuracy above 96%. Through iterative data erosion, we found that inputs containing the nuclear region of interest and its close environment, allow achieving equally high classification accuracy as inputs containing the whole cell for semi-confluent cultures and preserved prediction accuracy even in very dense cultures. We then applied this regionally restricted cell profiling approach to evaluate the differentiation status of iPSC-derived neural cultures, by determining the ratio of postmitotic neurons and neural progenitors. We found that the cell-based prediction significantly outperformed an approach in which the population-level time in culture was used as a classification criterion (96% <i>vs</i> 86%, respectively). In mixed iPSC-derived neuronal cultures, microglia could be unequivocally discriminated from neurons, regardless of their reactivity state, and a tiered strategy allowed for further distinguishing activated from non-activated cell states, albeit with lower accuracy. Thus, morphological single-cell profiling provides a means to quantify cell composition in complex mixed neural cultures and holds promise for use in the quality control of iPSC-derived cell culture models.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102440">Evaluating the transcriptional regulators of arterial gene expression via a catalogue of characterized arterial enhancers</a></h4>

              
                The establishment and growth of the arterial endothelium requires the coordinated expression of numerous genes. However, regulation of this process is not yet fully understood. Here, we combined <i>in silico</i> analysis with transgenic mice and zebrafish models to characterize arterial-specific enhancers associated with eight key arterial identity genes (<i>Acvrl1</i>/<i>Alk1</i>,<i> Cxcr4, Cxcl12, Efnb2, Gja4/Cx37, Gja5/Cx40</i>,<i> Nrp1</i> and <i>Unc5b)</i>. Next, to elucidate the regulatory pathways upstream of arterial gene transcription, we investigated the transcription factors binding each arterial enhancer compared to a similar assessment of non-arterial endothelial enhancers. These results found that binding of SOXF and ETS factors was a common occurrence at both arterial and pan-endothelial enhancers, suggesting neither are sufficient to direct arterial specificity. Conversely, FOX motifs independent of ETS motifs were over-represented at arterial enhancers. Further, MEF2 and RBPJ binding was enriched but not ubiquitous at arterial enhancers, potentially linked to specific patterns of behaviour within the arterial endothelium. Lastly, there was no shared or arterial-specific signature for WNT-associated TCF/LEF, TGFβ/BMP-associated SMAD1/5 and SMAD2/3, shear stress-associated KLF4 or venous-enriched NR2F2. This cohort of well characterized and in vivo-verified enhancers can now provide a platform for future studies into the interaction of different transcriptional and signalling pathways with arterial gene expression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95485">CausalXtract, a flexible pipeline to extract causal effects from live-cell time-lapse imaging data</a></h4>

              
                Live-cell microscopy routinely provides massive amounts of time-lapse images of complex cellular systems under various physiological or therapeutic conditions. However, this wealth of data remains difficult to interpret in terms of causal effects. Here, we describe CausalXtract, a flexible computational pipeline that discovers causal and possibly time-lagged effects from morphodynamic features and cell–cell interactions in live-cell imaging data. CausalXtract methodology combines network-based and information-based frameworks, which is shown to discover causal effects overlooked by classical Granger and Schreiber causality approaches. We showcase the use of CausalXtract to uncover novel causal effects in a tumor-on-chip cellular ecosystem under therapeutically relevant conditions. In particular, we find that cancer-associated fibroblasts directly inhibit cancer cell apoptosis, independently from anticancer treatment. CausalXtract uncovers also multiple antagonistic effects at different time delays. Hence, CausalXtract provides a unique computational tool to interpret live-cell imaging data for a range of fundamental and translational research applications.

">Electrophysiological resting-state signatures link polygenic scores to general intelligence</a></h4>

              
                Intelligence is associated with important life outcomes. Behavioral, genetic, structural, and functional brain correlates of intelligence have been studied for decades, but questions remain as to how genetics are related to trait expression and what intermediary role brain properties play. This study investigated these mediations in a representative sample of 434 individuals, comprising young and older adults. Polygenic scores (PGS) for intelligence were calculated. Resting-state EEG recordings were analyzed using graph theory quantifying functional connectivity across different frequencies. We tested whether global and local graph metrics like efficiency and clustering mediated the association between PGS and intelligence. PGS significantly predicted variance in intelligence and were related to frequency-specific graph metrics in areas predominantly located in parieto-frontal regions, which in turn were associated with intelligence. These findings, which are based on the first study linking PGS to intelligence using EEG-derived graph metrics, advance our understanding of the neurogenetics of intelligence.

">Behavioral investigation of allocentric and egocentric cognitive maps in human spatial memory</a></h4>

              
                Spatial memory is a fundamental cognitive function that enables humans and other species to encode and recall the locations of items in their environments. Humans employ diverse strategies to support spatial memory, including the use of cognitive maps. Cognitive maps are mental representations of the environment that organize its content along two or more continuous dimensions. In allocentric cognitive maps, these dimensions form a Cartesian coordinate system referenced to the environment. In egocentric cognitive maps, the dimensions form a polar coordinate system centered on the subject. To better understand how humans employ allocentric and egocentric cognitive maps for spatial memory, we performed a behavioral study with a novel task designed to directly and explicitly assess both types of cognitive maps. During encoding periods, participants navigated through a virtual environment and encountered objects at different locations. During recall periods, participants aimed at remembering these locations in abstract allocentric and egocentric coordinate systems. Our results show that relationships between the objects and the environment, such as their distance to boundaries and corners, were associated with allocentric memory performance. Relationships between the objects and the participant, including their distance and orientation to the participant's starting position, were linked to egocentric memory performance. Spatial feedback during recall supported performance within allocentric and egocentric domains, but not across domains. These findings are compatible with the notion that allocentric and egocentric cognitive maps operate as (partially) independent systems for spatial memory, each specialized in processing specific types of spatial relationships.

">Astrocyte Ca2+ activity regulates node of Ranvier length in the white matter</a></h4>

              
                Nodes of Ranvier generate action potentials along myelinated axons, but it is unclear whether they can modulate neural circuit function. Computer modelling previously predicted that adjusting node length can control axonal conduction speed1, but it is unknown whether mechanisms controlling nodal structure operate in the healthy brain. Here, in brain slices and in intact white matter tracts of live mice, we found that nodes elongate and shorten, while an overall stable mean node length is maintained. Changes in node length were only detected in nodes that were flanked by compact myelin sheaths, and more motile nodes were observed as myelination progressed during development. In the developing brain, but not in adult mice, neuronal activity caused the nodes to elongate. This occurred via astrocyte Ca2+-mediated adenosine generation, targeting A2b receptors expressed in myelin sheaths which raised cyclic AMP levels in oligodendrocytes. This activated NKCC1 cotransporters present in the myelin of the paranodes and internodes, the expression of which was upregulated in the developing brain compared to adults. NKCC1 activation elevated the membrane conductance and reduced the length of internodal myelin sheaths. Thus, nodal dynamics may continuously tune information flow along myelinated axons and drive activity-dependent white matter plasticity.

                Temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-HS) is associated with a complex genetic architecture, but the translation from genetic risk factors to brain vulnerability remains unclear. Here, we examined associations between epilepsy-related polygenic risk scores for HS (PRS-HS) and brain structure in a large sample of neurotypical children, and correlated these signatures with case-control findings in in multicentric cohorts of patients with TLE-HS. Imaging-genetic analyses revealed PRS-related cortical thinning in temporo-parietal and fronto-central regions, strongly anchored to distinct functional and structural network epicentres. Compared to disease-related effects derived from epilepsy case-control cohorts, structural correlates of PRS-HS mirrored atrophy and epicentre patterns in patients with TLE-HS. By identifying a potential pathway between genetic vulnerability and disease mechanisms, our findings provide new insights into the genetic underpinnings of structural alterations in TLE-HS and highlight potential imaging-genetic biomarkers for early risk stratification and personalized interventions.

">Maternal motivation overcomes innate fear via prefrontal switching dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Parental care is altruistic. In natural environments, parents are often faced with challenging environmental conditions, such as severe weather, complex terrain and predatory threats, and therefore need to overcome the fear of adverse conditions to protect and raise the offspring. Although a few studies have reported risk-taking maternal behaviors, it is unknown how maternal motivation and environmental threats are represented and integrated in neural circuits to resolve the conflict and dynamically drive behaviors. Here we report a novel risk-taking maternal behavior paradigm in a semi-naturalistic context, in which a female mouse has to overcome fear and jump off an elevated platform to retrieve pups outside a nest on the ground. We show that while fear of heights reduces the motivation to jump, the presence of pups dramatically facilitates overcoming such fear. A medial prefrontal-periaqueductal gray (mPFC-PAG) pathway is specifically required for the effect of pups on overcoming fear of height, and this circuit integrates conflicting cues about pup and height and encodes motivation to drive risk-taking jumping behaviors. In contrast to cued, fast and predictable reaction timing in typical structured tasks, behaviors in our paradigm are highly spontaneous, characterized by stochastic transitions between low-motivation and high-motivation states. Our data reveal that such spontaneity is shaped by the switching ramping dynamics of neural activity in the motivation-encoding dimension, rather than continuous ramping dynamics. Pup and height cues modulate the switching ramping dynamics to influence, but not immediately evoke behaviors. Together, we propose that the prefrontal-brainstem pathway plays vital roles in encoding altruistic motivation to overcome innate fear, and the switching ramping dynamics might represent a general mechanism that gives rise to spontaneous behaviors in naturalistic and conflicting conditions.

                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is poised to reach epidemic levels as the world population ages. There is currently no treatment that halts this debilitating disease. Our recent finding that the memory gene Arc regulates the expression of many genes associated with the pathophysiology of AD sets the stage for a new therapeutic approach that is not structurally based on the amyloid hypothesis that has driven most research to date. Neuronal activity-dependent Arc expression is controlled by a chromatin-modification complex containing two enzymes: Tip60 and PHF8. Here, we show that small molecules targeting these proteins inhibit Arc expression. This finding sets the stage for a novel therapeutic approach to combat Alzheimer's disease. Targeting Arc opens a new frontier of "multi-target" therapy designed to simultaneously intervene in several aspects of the disease. Because of Arc's role in controlling the expression of multiple genes and pathways implicated in AD, it could serve as a therapeutic hub.

">Acute cortical stroke alters neural activity in the subthalamic nucleus, which correlates with motor disability in rats</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: We aimed to investigate the impact of acute cortical stroke (ACS) on neural activity in subthalamic nucleus (STN). We then examined the correlation between changes in STN activity and motor disability. Methods: Forty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were used. While rats were anesthetized, we inserted electrodes in STN and induced an ACS by creating photothrombotic lesion in ipsilateral motor cortex. Local field potentials were recorded before and after ACS. The motor behavior was assessed before and after ACS using single pellet reaching task. Results: Rats experienced significant motor disability after ACS. STN firing rate significantly decreased after ACS. Additionally, delta (0.5-4 Hz) and gamma (50-140 Hz) power significantly decreased after ACS. Furthermore, the decrease in delta mean power correlated with decreases in success rate (r =0.77, p =0.009) and first try success rate (r =0.69, p =0.028). The decreases in gamma mean power (r =0.68, p =0.029) and gamma peak power (r =0.74, p =0.015) correlated with the decrease in success rate. The decrease in gamma power significantly correlated with the decreased STN firing rate. However, decreased delta power exhibited no correlation with decreased gamma power. Interpretation: ACS causes abnormal STN activity, which correlated with motor disability. Post-stroke STN inhibition may partially compensate for ACS. However, it could also lead to pathological consequences. This STN abnormal activity may serve as a biomarker for motor disability severity after ACS. Furthermore, our findings may provide a possibility for developing neuromodulation strategies, allowing to mitigate post-stroke motor disability through modulating abnormal STN activity.

">Optical recordings of unitary synaptic connections reveal high and random local connectivity between CA3 pyramidal cells</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampal CA3 region is thought to play crucial roles in episodic memory functions because of the extensive recurrent connections between CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3PCs). However, different methods provided contradicting observations about the synaptic connectivity between CA3PCs. Therefore, we estimated the connectivity rate between individual CA3PCs using a new approach that is not affected by the confounds of conventional methods. Specifically, we used voltage imaging with the Voltron sensor in acute slices from rats of both sexes to test CA3PC connections by detecting spontaneous spiking and subthreshold responses in anatomically identified neurons. We detected 164 monosynaptic excitatory connections in 3078 tested CA3PC-CA3PC pairs. This 5.3% connectivity rate was much higher than that we observed with the theoretically more sensitive patch clamp method in similar experimental conditions, but it remained below the anatomically observed number of CA3PC-CA3PC contacts. We verified that the imaged excitatory connections were mediated by AMPA receptors. Our results also showed that the recurrent connections did not enrich into preferred connectivity motifs and followed a distribution that was consistent with random connectivity in general. Moreover, voltage imaging revealed CA3PCs with distinct firing properties and somatic locations corresponding to previously established heterogeneity and showed that specific connectivity rules create preferred information routes among these subpopulations. Finally, we showed that there is at least one condition, influencing patch clamp recordings but not voltage imaging, that affects the observable functional connections between CA3PCs. Altogether, our results obtained with a new voltage imaging approach argue for high local connectivity rates between CA3PCs.

">Oral prodrug of a novel glutathione surrogate reverses metabolic dysregulation and attenuates neurodegenerative process in APP/PS1 mice</a></h4>

              
                Glycation-induced oxidative stress underlies the numerous metabolic ravages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reduced glutathione levels in AD lead to increased oxidative stress, including glycation-induced pathology. Previously, we showed that the accumulation of reactive 1,2-dicarbonyls such as methylglyoxal, the major precursor of non-enzymatic glycation products, was reduced by the increased function of GSH-dependent glyoxalase-1 enzyme in the brain. In this two-pronged study, we evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of an orally bioavailable prodrug of our lead glyoxalase substrate, pro-{psi}-GSH, for the first time in a transgenic Alzheimer's disease mouse model. This prodrug delivers pharmacodynamically relevant brain concentrations of {psi}-GSH upon oral delivery. Chronic oral dosing of pro-{psi}-GSH effectively reverses the cognitive decline observed in the APP/PS1 mouse model. The prodrug successfully mirrors the robust effects of the parent drug i.e., reducing amyloid pathology, glycation stress, neuroinflammation, and the resultant neurodegeneration in these mice. We also report the first metabolomics study of such a treatment, which yields key biomarkers linked to the reversal of AD-related metabolic dysregulation. Collectively, this study establishes pro-{psi}-GSH as a viable, disease-modifying therapy for AD and paves the way for further preclinical advancement of such therapeutics. Metabolomic signatures identified could prove beneficial in the development of treatment-specific clinically translatable biomarkers.

">Comparison of TENS electrodes and textile electrodes for electrocutaneous warning</a></h4>

              
                Electrocutaneous stimulation can be employed to alert workers in potentially hazardous situations. To determine the feasibility of a novel textile electrode cuff in comparison to previously used TENS electrodes, two studies were conducted. In a study on n = 30 participants, perception, attention, muscle twitch, and intolerance thresholds as well as qualitative and spatial perceptions, were determined for eight pairs of electrodes circumferentially placed around the upper right arm for TENS and for textile electrodes. In a second study on n = 36 participants, these thresholds were also determined during vibration, and a warning signal pattern was presented during vibration. We found smaller perception thresholds for the textile electrodes in comparison to the TENS electrodes for all 8 electrode pairs and occasional differences for the attention and intolerance thresholds, which might be mainly explained by the varying electrode sizes due to the manual production process of the textile electrodes. Stimulation using textile electrodes within the cuff showed less frequent muscle twitches compared to TENS electrodes. Other qualitative and spatial perceptions appeared comparable. The perception, attention, and intolerance thresholds increased during vibration comparable to previous results with TENS electrodes. The feasibility of using the textile electrodes during vibration and for the application of a warning signal was successfully demonstrated. Occasional cases occurred where the transition impedance was too high while using the textile electrodes. Future studies will focus on electrode optimization to achieve a wearable solution with both low electrode-skin transition impedance and minimal muscle twitching.

">Cognitive enrichment preserves retrosplenial parvalbumin density and cognitive function in female 5xFAD mice</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: The rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) varies considerably from person to person. Numerous epidemiological studies point to the protective effects of cognitive, social, and physical enrichment as potential mediators of cognitive decline in AD; however, there is much debate as to the mechanism underlying these effects. The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is one of the earliest brain regions with impaired functions during AD pathogenesis, and its activity is affected by cognitive, social, and physical stimulation. METHODS: In the current study, we use the 5xFAD mouse mode of AD to examine the impact of enriched housing conditions on cognitive function in AD and the viability of a particularly vulnerable cell population within the RSC - parvalbumin interneurons (PV-INs). RESULTS: Enriched housing conditions improved cognitive performance in 5xFAD mice. These changes in cognitive performance coincided with restored functional connectivity of the RSC and preserved PV-IN density within this region. Along with preserved PV-IN density, there was an increase in the density of perineuronal nets (PNNs) across the RSC of 5xFAD mice housed in enriched conditions. Direct manipulation of PNNs revealed that these extracellular matrix structures protect PV-INs from amyloid toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results provide support for the PNN-mediated maintenance of PV-INs in the RSC as a potential mechanism mediating the protective effects of enrichment against cognitive decline in AD.

">Prior use-dependent plasticity triggers different individual corticomotor responses during persistent musculoskeletal pain</a></h4>

              
                Movement repetition is crucial for pain interventions. It facilitates the rehabilitation of motor patterns, the acquisition of motor skills and the genesis of adaptive use-dependent plasticity. However, the influence of prior motor experience and pre-existing use-dependent plasticity on pain severity and progression remains poorly investigated. This study investigated the effects of pre-existing use-dependent plasticity during the development of prolonged experimental musculoskeletal pain. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, corticospinal excitability was assessed by measuring the rest-motor thresholds (RMTs), motor-evoked potential (MEP), representational area of the motor map, volume, and center of gravity of the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle in musicians (n=19), a well-known ecological model of use-dependent plasticity, and in non-musicians (n=20). All participants attended three sessions (Day1, Day3, Day8). Prolonged pain for several days was induced by intramuscular injection of nerve growth factor (NGF) into the right FDI muscle at the end of Day1. Compared to Day1, prolonged pain uniquely led to reduced motor map volume in non-musicians on Day3 (p=0.004), who also showed higher NGF-related pain intensity compared to musicians. The motor maps of musicians, which were already smaller in pain-free conditions (Day1) compared to non-musicians (p=0.021), remained non-significantly different across days. Notably, corticomotor responses (map volume, MEP amplitude, and RMTs) at Day1 were correlated to weekly and accumulated musical training. These findings demonstrate that pre-existing use-dependent plasticity associated with motor training may counteract the effects of prolonged pain in the motor system. Moreover, it confirms that prior motor experience acts as a source of individual variability to pain.

">Childhood Maltreatment and Brain Aging During Adulthood</a></h4>

              
                Importance: Childhood maltreatment (CM) is associated with the early onset of psychiatric and medical disorders and accelerated biological aging. Objective: To identify types of maltreatment and developmental sensitive periods that are associated with accelerated adult brain aging. Design: Participants were mothers of infants recruited from the community into a study assessing the effects of CM on maternal behavior, infant attachment, and maternal and infant neurobiology. Data were collected from July 2015 to November 2019 and were analyzed from July 2023 to October 2024. Setting: Academic medical centers. Participants: High-quality MRI scans were obtained on 92 of 150 mothers enrolled in the study. The main exclusion criteria for neuroimaging were histories of head trauma with loss of consciousness or concussion, psychotropic use before age 18, pregnancy, and customary MRI exclusions (e.g., metal implant). The primary reasons for non-completion of the neuroimaging study were unwillingness to be scanned, inability to attend the MRI study visit due to work and/or childcare, metal implants, or pregnancy. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): The Maltreatment and Abuse Chronology of Exposure scale was used to retrospectively assess the annual severity of exposure to ten types of CM from birth to age 18 years. Brain age was calculated from T1-weighted 3T MRI Scans using a previously published machine learning algorithm. Sensitive periods were identified using random forest regression with conditional inference trees. Results: Forty-nine (53.3%) of the 92 mothers (mean [SD] age, 32.4 [4.3] years) reported experiencing one or more types of CM. Total CM severity was associated with accelerated brain aging (beta=0.05, 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.09, p<.005). The most robust type/time risk factors for accelerated brain aging were parental physical abuse between ages 4 to 6 years, witnessing sibling violence between ages 4 to 15 years, parental verbal abuse between ages 10 to 12 years, and parental emotional neglect between ages 16 to 18 years. Conclusions and Relevance: Several types of CM between ages 4-18 years were associated with accelerated brain aging. Understanding how these specific types and ages of exposure contribute to accelerated brain aging may provide important insights into preventing key clinical consequences of CM.

">Axon Trafficking Counteracts Aberrant Protein Aggregation in Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Directed axon trafficking of mRNA via ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) is essential for the proper function and survival of neurons. However, the mechanisms governing RNP transport in axons remain poorly understood. Here, we identify Annexin A7 (ANXA7) as a critical adaptor facilitating the retrograde transport of T-cell intracellular antigen 1 (TIA1)-containing RNPs by linking them to the cytoplasmic dynein. Persistent axonal Ca2+ elevation disrupts ANXA7's linker role, causing the detachment of TIA1 granules from dynein, consequently impairing transport and triggering pathological TIA1 aggregation within axons. Similarly, ANXA7 knockdown decouples TIA1 granules from dynein, severely obstructing trafficking and causing pathological aggregation of TIA1 in axons, which culminates in axonopathy and neurodegeneration both in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, ANXA7 overexpression enhances trafficking and counteracts aberrant aggregation of TIA1-containing RNPs in axons. Our findings elucidate a novel mechanism underlying RNP axonal transport, highlighting its significance in the biology and pathology of central neurons.

">Fusobacteria nucleatum determines the expression of amphetamine-induced behavioral responses through an epigenetic phenomenon.</a></h4>

              
                Amphetamines (AMPHs) are psychostimulants commonly used for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. They are also misused (AMPH use disorder; AUD), with devastating outcomes. Recent studies have implicated dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of AUD. However, the mechanistic roles of microbes in AUD are unknown. Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) is a bacterium that increases in abundance in both rats and humans upon AMPH exposure. Fn releases short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bacterial byproducts thought to play a fundamental role in the gut-brain axis as well as the pathogenesis of AUD. We demonstrate that in gnotobiotic Drosophila melanogaster, colonization with Fn or dietary supplementation of the SCFA butyrate, a potent inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs), enhances the psychomotor and rewarding properties of AMPH as well as its ability to promote male sexual motivation. Furthermore, solely HDAC1 RNAi targeted inhibition recapitulates these enhancements, pointing to a specific process underlying this Fn phenomenon. Of note is that the expression of these AMPH behaviors is determined by the increase in extracellular dopamine (DA) levels that result from AMPH-induced reversal of DA transporter (DAT) function, termed non-vesicular DA release (NVDR). The magnitude of AMPH-induced NVDR is dictated, at least in part, by DAT expression levels. Consistent with our behavioral data, we show that Fn, butyrate, and HDAC1 inhibition enhance NVDR by elevating DAT expression. Thus, the participation of Fn in AUD stems from its ability to release butyrate and inhibit HDAC1. These data offer a microbial target and probiotic interventions for AUD treatment.

">Gaze dynamics prior to navigation support hierarchical planning</a></h4>

              
                The task of planning future actions in the context of an uncertain world results in massive state spaces that preclude exhaustive search and other strategies explored in the domains of both human decision-making and computational agents. One plausible solution to this dimensionality explosion is to decompose the task into subgoals that match the information geometry of the task at hand. However, how individuals identify a productive hierarchy, and perceive and select subgoals suitable to planning, is not well understood. To investigate this topic, we designed a virtual-reality based behavioral experiment which collected eye movements during a pre-navigation planning phase. By capturing gaze dynamics correlated with the simulative processes used in planning, we were able to identify the spatiotemporal evolution of visual search under uncertainty. Our results highlight gaze dynamics indicative of a search process that exhibits hierarchical structure. These include a decreasing trend seen in gaze distance from origin and a broad to narrow shift (with reducing saccade distances and longer fixation durations) as plans are established. In line with prior work, critical tiles to which landscape connectivity is most sensitive were the strongest predictors of visual attention. We also find that deeper planning was correlated with success only on the most complex maps (e.g. those with a larger number of information-nodes, higher branching factor, and more forks, according to an info-graphical map analysis). This study highlights the role of embodied visual search during planning, and the skill-dependence of the specific subgoals and hierarchical decomposition used which unlocked successful performance.

We developed a congenic C57BL/6J line with defined regions of non-C57BL/6J genomic DNA, increased postnatal viability and reduced incidence of HC. Both perinatal lethality and HC were eliminated in F2 mice following outcross of the congenic line to CBA/J or BALBc/J backgrounds. To assess the impacts of microglial deficiency in postnatal neurodevelopment we analyzed deep total RNA-seq data from multiple brain regions of wild-type and mutant mice. Aside from the loss of microglial-specific transcripts, we found no significant alterations in relative abundance of any cell-type or region-specific transcriptomic signature. Transcripts associated with endosome/lysosome function, which are enriched in microglia, were not affected, suggesting compensatory expression by other cell types. On the C57BL/6J x CBA/J F2 background, congenital absence of microglia did not affect motor activity, behavior or myelination up to 7 months of age but was associated with astrocytosis and calcification in the thalamus. In the congenic C57BL/6J Csf1r mutant mouse line, intraperitoneal transfer of wild-type bone marrow cells (BMT) at weaning led to complete repopulation of the brain with microglia-like cells without giving rise to monocytic intermediates. Our results suggest novel strategies for treatment of microglial deficiency.

">Reciprocal roles of crowding and serial dependence on visual perception</a></h4>

              
                Visual perception arises from the interplay between current and prior sensory inputs. Two perceptual phenomena-serial dependence and visual crowding-result from the mandatory integration of retinal information across time and space, respectively. This study investigated, for the first time, their functional relationship for orientation and brightness discrimination tasks. Participants performed orientation and brightness discrimination tasks (blocked) on peripheral targets surrounded by distractors of varying color, orientation, and proximity. Both serial dependence (the influence of prior stimuli on current judgments) and visual crowding (impaired peripheral recognition caused by nearby distractors) were observed. Similar double dissociations in task and stimulus specificity emerged for both phenomena, suggesting functional links mediated by distinct processing mechanisms for brightness and orientation judgments. Additionally, the two effects interacted: crowding reduced serial dependence on subsequent trials, indicating that spatial information is prioritized over temporal information when spatial redundancy is high. Conversely, serial dependence increased crowding for orientation judgments, while for brightness judgments, serial dependence operated additively without affecting crowding. These interactions were spatially specific, occurring only when targets appeared in the same location across consecutive trials. Notably, a positive correlation between crowding and serial dependence was found exclusively for orientation judgments and only when targets appeared at the same location across trials. The reciprocal interaction and positive correlation between serial dependence and crowding observed for orientation judgments indicate that that these processes are intrinsically linked, possibly via a common neural mechanism. In contrast, for brightness judgments, the unilateral effect of crowding on serial dependence-along with the absence of correlation-indicates distinct neural mechanisms. Here, brightness crowding likely precedes serial dependence, reflecting a prioritization of spatial redundancy minimization over temporal stabilization. These findings suggest that the brain strategically integrates spatial and temporal information through distinct yet overlapping mechanisms, balancing spatial precision with temporal stability based on task demands and stimulus characteristics.

">Loss of excitatory inputs and decreased tonic and evoked activity of locus coeruleus neurons in aged P301S mice</a></h4>

              
                Tau pathology in the locus coeruleus (LC) is associated with several neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimers disease and frontotemporal dementia. Phosphorylated tau accumulates in the LC and results in inflammation, synaptic loss, and eventually cell death in other brain regions as the disease progresses. Loss of LC neurons and noradrenergic innervation is thought to contribute to the symptoms of cognitive decline later in disease. While loss and degeneration of LC neurons has been well studied, less is known about changes in LC physiology at advanced stages of tau pathology that precedes neurodegeneration. In this study, we investigated the ex vivo electrophysiological properties of LC neurons in male and female mice from the P301S mouse model of tauopathy at 9 months of age, a time-point when significant tau accumulation, cell death, and cognitive impairments are observed. We found a reduction in excitatory inputs and changes in excitatory post-synaptic current kinetics in male and female P301S. There was also a decrease in spontaneous discharge of LC neurons and an increase in AP threshold in P301S mice of both sexes. Finally, we observed a decrease in excitability and increase in rheobase current in P301S mice. Despite the decrease in LC activity in slice, we did not identify differences in total tissue norepinephrine (NE) or NE metabolites in prefrontal cortex or hippocampus. Together these findings demonstrate reductions in the activity and excitability of LC neurons at late stages of tau accumulation. However, compensatory mechanisms may maintain normal NE levels in LC projection regions in vivo.

">Apolipoprotein E ε4 exacerbates microglia-mediated complement-dependent synapse loss caused by neuronal Tpk deficiency</a></h4>

              
                Thiamine pyrophosphokinse-1 (TPK) is a key enzyme that converts thiamine to functional thiamine diphosphate (TDP). TPK insufficiency and hence TDP reduction in neurons induced by amyloid-{beta} deposition and diabetes, an independent risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD), recapitulate multi-pathophysiological features in the brain of mice, similar to those in human AD. Apolipoprotein E {varepsilon}4 allele (APOE4) is the most well-known genetic risk factor for AD. Clinical trials by boosting TDP using benfotiamine, a derivative of thiamine that significantly elevates TDP level in human encrythrocytes, have shown the inferior clinical efficacies in APOE4 carriers compared to non-APOE4 carriers. Clarifying the relationship between APOE4 and TPK expression and multi-pathophysiological characteristics of AD induced by Tpk deficiency in neurons is imperative. Here, we find that humanized APOE4 didn't directly affect Tpk expression of mice, but markedly aggravates behavior abnormalities of Tpk-cKO mice. Pathologically, the Tpk-cKO mice with humanized APOE4 knock-in (AE-cKO mice) exhibit more synapse loss than the mice with only humanized APOE4 knock-in and the Tpk-cKO mice. Transcriptomics and pathologic analysis identified that APOE4 promoted the overactivation of microglia and the transition of microglia to a disease-associated and phagocytosis state via a complement-mediated pathway. Further, the C3aR antagonist significantly repressed microglia phagocytosis and synaptic elimination of the AE-cKO mice. Our results demonstrate that APOE4 exacerbates behavior dysfunction of Tpk-cKO mice through microglia-mediated complement-dependent synaptic elimination. These findings provide important insights into the role of APOE4 in the pathogenesis of AD.

">Classifying Mild Cognitive Impairment from Normal Cognition: fMRI Complexity Matches Tau PET Performance</a></h4>

              
                Background: Tau protein accumulation is closely linked to synaptic and neuronal loss in Alzheimers disease (AD), resulting in progressive cognitive decline. Although tau-PET imaging is a direct biomarker of tau pathology, it is costly, carries radiation risks, and is not widely accessible. Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) complexity-an entropy-based measure of BOLD signal variation-has been proposed as a non-invasive surrogate biomarker of early neuronal dysfunction associated with tau pathology. Objectives: To determine whether fMRI-based brain complexity (sample entropy and multiscale entropy) can match or exceed tau-PET in classifying cognitively normal (CN) versus cognitively impaired (MCI/AD) individuals. And to investigate and compare the most influential network regions-of-interest (ROIs) for classification between fMRI complexity and tau-PET, thereby identifying key neuroanatomical correlates of AD-related changes. Design: A cross-sectional study employing 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) classification with five-fold cross-validation and leave-one-network-out analysis. Setting: Data from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Participants: One hundred forty-seven older adults (age 72.5 (SD: 7.5) years), including 95 CN, 45 MCI, and 7 AD. Measurements: We created whole-brain complexity maps from rs-fMRI and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) maps from tau-PET. Each modality was separately fed into CNN classifiers. Region-based analyses (leave-one-network-out) were performed to identify critical ROIs for classification. Results: fMRI complexity showed classification accuracy comparable to tau-PET yet surpassed it in F1-score (0.64 vs. 0.61) and area under the curve (AUC; 0.73 vs. 0.67). Salience and dorsal attention networks contributed most to fMRI-based classification, and a dorsal attention network contributed most to tau-PET-based classification. Conclusions: fMRI complexity performs similarly to tau-PET in detecting cognitive impairment related to AD and identifies partially distinct critical ROIs, suggesting an alternative, radiation-free imaging biomarker for earlier detection and broader clinical application.

">An amygdala-cortical circuit for encoding generalized fear memories.</a></h4>

              
                Generalized learning is a fundamental process observed across species, contexts, and sensory modalities that enables animals to use past experiences to adapt to changing conditions. Evidence suggests that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) extracts general features of an experience that can be used across multiple situations. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a region of the PFC, is implicated in generalized fear responses to novel contexts. However, the ACCs role in encoding contextual information is poorly understood, especially under increased threat intensity that promotes generalization. Here, we show that synaptic plasticity within the ACC and signaling from amygdala inputs during fear learning are necessary for generalized fear responses to novel encountered contexts. The ACC did not encode specific fear to the training context, suggesting this region extracts general features of a threatening experience rather than specific contextual information. Together with our previous work, our results demonstrate that generalized learning about threatening contexts is encoded, in part, within an ascending amygdala-cortical circuit, whereas descending ACC projections to the amygdala drive generalized fear responses during exposure to novel contexts. Our results further demonstrate that schematic learning can occur in the PFC after single-trial learning, a process typically attributed to learning over many repeated learning episodes.

">Stimulus-driven cerebrospinal fluid dynamics is impaired in glaucoma patients</a></h4>

              
                Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics, driven by sensory stimulation-induced neuronal activity, is crucial for maintaining homeostasis and clearing metabolic waste. However, it remains unclear whether such CSF flow is impaired in age-related neurodegenerative diseases of the visual system. This study addresses this gap by examining CSF flow during visual stimulation in glaucoma patients and healthy older adults using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The findings reveal that in glaucoma, CSF inflow becomes decoupled from visually evoked blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) response. Furthermore, stimulus-locked CSF patterns, characterized by decreases following stimulus onset and increases after offset, diminish as glaucoma severity worsens. Mediation analysis suggests that this flattened CSF pattern is driven by a flatter BOLD slope, resulting in a shallower CSF trough and a reduced rebound. These findings unveil a novel pathophysiological mechanism underlying disrupted stimulation-driven CSF dynamics in glaucoma and highlight potential in vivo biomarkers for monitoring CSF in the glaucomatous brain.

">EEG Responses to Exercise Intensity in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                1. Abstract 1.1. Background Exercise is increasingly recognized as a beneficial intervention for Parkinson's disease (PD), yet the optimal type and intensity of exercise remain unclear. This study investigated the relationship between exercise intensity and neural responses in PD patients, using electroencephalography (EEG) to explore potential neural markers for optimal exercise intensity. 1.2. Method EEG data were collected from 14 PD patients (5 females) and 8 healthy controls (HC) performing stationary pedaling exercises at 60 RPM with resistance adjusted to target heart rates of 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, and 70% of maximum heart rate. Subjects pedaled for 3 minutes at each intensity level in a counterbalanced order. Canonical Time-series Characteristics (Catch-22) features and Multi-set Canonical Correlation Analysis (MCCA) were utilized to identify common profiles of EEG features at increasing exercise intensity across subjects. 1.3. Results We identified a statistically significant MCCA component demonstrating a monotonic relationship with pedaling intensity. The dominant feature in this component was Periodicity Wang (PW), reflecting the autocorrelation of neural dynamics. Analysis revealed a consistent trend across features: six features increased with intensity, indicating heightened rhythmic engagement and sustained neural activation, while three features decreased, suggesting reduced variability and enhanced predictability in neural responses. Notably, PD patients exhibited more rigid, consistent response patterns compared to healthy controls (HC), who showed greater flexibility and variability in their neural adaptation across intensities. 1.4. Conclusion This study highlights the feasibility of using EEG-derived features to track exercise intensity in PD patients, identifying specific neural markers correlating with varying intensity levels. PD subjects demonstrate less inter-subject variability in motor responses to increasing intensity. Our results suggest that EEG biomarkers can be used to assess differing brain involvement with the same exercise of increasing intensity, potentially useful for guiding targeted therapeutic strategies and maximizing the neurological benefits of exercise in PD.

">Detection of alpha synuclein seeding activity in tear fluid in patients with Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Detection of alpha-synuclein seeding activity in tear fluid (TF) might provide a promising non-invasive biomarker for Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis. In this study, we applied the alpha-synuclein seeding amplification assay (aSynSAA) to detect misfolded alpha-synuclein (aSyn) aggregation in TF from PD patients. The discovery cohort included 11 PD patients and 13 controls, and the validation cohort consisted of 9 PD patients and 11 controls without synucleinopathies. The aSynSAA yielded positive results in over 55% of PD patients. These findings were confirmed in a second cohort, including patients with prion diseases as a negative control for synuclein pathology. Our results demonstrate for the first time the ability of aSynSAA to distinguish between PD and control groups in TF, with PD showing the highest seeding activity compared to prion disease and control groups. Further comparisons between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and TF samples from the same individuals revealed consistent seeding results across both biofluids. These findings highlight the potential of tear fluid as a novel, accessible medium for detecting Lewy body-specific misfolded synuclein aggregation in PD, which could aid in early diagnosis and disease progression monitoring.

">Impaired glymphatic clearance independently contributes to poor outcomes in Parkinsons disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: Impaired glymphatic clearance may contribute to pathological accumulations in Parkinsons (PD), but how it interacts with other processes causing dementia and poor outcomes remains unclear. Objectives: Clarify how glymphatic clearance impacts cognition in PD and its interaction with established imaging markers. Methods: We used diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) as an indirect marker of glymphatic clearance in 98 PD patients (31 PD-poor outcomes: dementia, mild cognitive impairment, frailty or death within 3-year follow-up; 67 PD-good outcomes) and 28 controls. We assessed DTI-ALPS relationship to cognition, white matter (fibre cross-section), cortical thickness, iron accumulation (quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM)), and plasma markers (phosphorylated tau-181 (p-tau181 and neurofilament light (NFL)) cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Results: DTI-ALPS was lower in PD-poor outcomes compared to PD-good outcomes and controls (p=0.005) with further longitudinal reductions only in PD-poor outcomes (group*time interaction: beta=-0.013, p=0.021). Lower DTI-ALPS was associated with lower fibre cross-section in PD, at baseline and longitudinally but with different spatial distribution from white matter changes relating to PD cognition. There was no correlation between baseline DTI-ALPS and plasma ptau-181 (p=0.642), NFL (p=0.448) or baseline cortical thickness. Lower DTI-ALPS was associated with accelerated cortical thinning within left precentral gyrus and changes in brain iron distribution. Conclusions: PD patients who develop poor outcomes show impaired glymphatic clearance at baseline that worsened longitudinally. DTI-ALPS correlated with white matter integrity and brain iron accumulation. However, both showed different spatial distribution than that seen in PD dementia; suggesting impaired glymphatic clearance contributes to cognitive decline in a distinct manner.

	<p>Background: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is characterized by early postural instability and gait dysfunction, with frequent falls. Rehabilitation is an important therapeutic approach for motor dysfunction in patients with PSP. However, no conclusions have yet been drawn regarding the beneficial effects of rehabilitation in PSP, including the optimal duration of rehabilitation and differences in treatment effects among PSP subtypes. Herein, we investigated the effects of short-term rehabilitation and separately analyzed the effects on patients with PSP-Richardson&amp;amp;rsquo;s syndrome (RS) and PSP-progressive gait freezing (PGF). Methods: The participants underwent several therapeutic exercise programs individualized for each participant, performed over 2 weeks. Analysis was performed on 25 patients with PSP-RS and eight with PSP-PGF. Results: Short-term rehabilitation improved the Berg Balance Scale score in both the PSP-RS and PSP-PGF groups, step length on the symptom-dominant side in PSP-RS, the coefficient of variation of step length on the symptom-dominant side, and the stance phase of the Symmetry Index in PSP-PGF. Conclusions: Overall, this 2-week short-term rehabilitation intervention was shown to have beneficial effects on balance in patients with PSP-RS and PSP-PGF.</p>

	<p>Background/Aim: Currently, there are limited evidence-based protocols for improving upper extremity (UE) motor function after stroke. The Keys protocol, a distributed form of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), delivers CIMT components in fewer hours per day over an extended period, fitting outpatient rehabilitation schedules and third-party payor models. This pilot study aimed to assess the effectiveness of the Keys protocol in enhancing UE capacity and performance poststroke. Methods: Ten adults with chronic stroke (&amp;amp;gt;6 months) participated in an 8-week intervention. The protocol included 22 supervised training sessions (1.5 h each): 4 days/week for 4 weeks, 2 days/week for weeks 5&amp;amp;ndash;6, and 1 day/week for weeks 7&amp;amp;ndash;8. Participants wore a restraint mitt on the less-affected UE during waking hours and used an adapted transfer package. Outcome measures included the Motor Activity Log (MAL), Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Stroke Impact Scale (SIS), and Zung Depression Scale, assessed pre-treatment, mid-treatment (4 weeks), and posttreatment. Results: Significant improvements were observed in SIS Strength, ADLs/IADLs, Mobility, and Hand Function domains, exceeding MCID thresholds. Memory and Communication domains improved significantly at the 3-month follow-up. WMFT performance times improved, with fewer incomplete tasks. MAL scores for Amount of Use and Quality of Movement increased across all time points. Depressive symptoms significantly decreased posttreatment. Conclusions: The Keys protocol effectively improves UE use, motor function, mood, and quality of life, with the greatest gains observed mid-intervention. These findings support its feasibility and potential for outpatient stroke rehabilitation (ClinicalTrials.gov Registration: NCT05311384).</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Loneliness is a heterogeneous phenomenon, generally defined as an emotional experience based on the perceived distance between an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s actual social relationships and those he or she would like to have. Adolescence is particularly vulnerable to loneliness because of the many changes in values, feelings, and emotions that characterize it. Among the aspects that may influence this feeling of discomfort, the literature identifies maladaptive personality and a dysfunctional response to traumatic events. Our study aims to identify the possible role that maladaptive personality traits and post-traumatic stress symptomatology in the form of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Disturbance in Self-Organization (DSO) may play in the perception of loneliness in adolescents: Methods: We identified a mediation model constructed through structural equation modeling (SEM) to test PTSD and DSO post-traumatic stress symptomatology as independent variables and maladaptive personality as a mediator in the relationship between these and perceptions of loneliness in a population of adolescents of both sexes, Italian high school students; Results: Our study identifies the significant role of PTSD and DSO symptomatology in influencing the state of loneliness, both directly and indirectly through maladaptive personality traits, which appear to exert a substantial influence on the perception of loneliness, potentially functioning as mediators in the relationship between the latter and PTSD/DSO symptomatology. Presumably, a maladaptive personality may complicate recovery from adverse and traumatic experiences by preventing the implementation of functional coping strategies and promoting dysfunctional responses. Conclusions: Our findings underscore the importance of researchers and clinicians adequately considering different personality traits and the early identification of post-traumatic stress symptomatology. A focus on adolescents&amp;amp;rsquo; communication and interpersonal skills and their ability to respond effectively to stressful and traumatic events may prove useful in identifying more effective strategies for preventing and managing loneliness and related distress in adolescents.</p>

	<p>Objectives: This study analyzed the effects of parachute jump stress on the executive functions and attention of cadets. Executive functions, which includes processes such as attentional control and cognitive flexibility, are crucial for soldiers, especially in situations requiring rapid decision-making. Parachute jumping, as an intense stressor, mobilizes cognitive resources, which can lead to short-term improvements in executive functions. Methods: A total of 64 cadets divided into control (N = 32) and experimental (N = 32) groups participated in the study. The experimental group performed a parachute jump and then took the Color Trails Test, assessed both before and after the jump. Results: The results showed significant improvements in executive functions, in particular, sustained and alternating attention, sequential information processing, and monitoring one&amp;amp;rsquo;s own behavior, suggesting a positive effect of stress on selected executive functions. Conclusions: The results indicate that intense, short-term stress can positively affect executive functions, although this effect may depend on the type of task and the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; experience of exposure to intense stressful stimuli. The study makes an important contribution to the design of future military training, considering the importance of mobilizing cognitive resources in response to short-term stress.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Charcot first described ALS in 1869, but the specific mechanisms that mediate the disease pathology are still not clear. Intense research efforts have provided insight into unique neuroanatomical regions, specific neuronal populations and genetic associations for ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases; however, the experimental results also suggest a convergence of these events to common toxic pathways. We propose that common toxic pathways can be therapeutically targeted, and this intervention will be effective in slowing progression and improving patient quality of life. Here, we focus on understanding the role of IL6 trans-signaling in ALS disease processes. Methods: We leveraged unique mouse models of IL6 trans-signaling that we developed that recapitulate the production of active sIL6R in a genotypic and quantitative fashion observed in humans. Given that the SOD1 transgenic mouse is one of the most highly studied and characterized models of ALS, we bred SOD1G93A mice with IL6R trans-signaling mice to determine how enhanced trans-signaling influenced symptom onset and pathological processes, including neuromuscular junction (NMJ) denervation, glial activation and motoneuron (MN) survival. Results: The results indicate that in animals with enhanced trans-signaling, symptom onset and pathological processes were accelerated, suggesting a role in disease modification. Administration of an IL6R functional blocking antibody failed to alter accelerated symptom onset and disease progression. Conclusions: Future work to investigate the site-specific influence of enhanced IL6 trans-signaling and the tissue-specific bioavailability of potential therapeutics will be necessary to identify targets for precise therapeutic interventions that may limit disease progression in the 60% of ALS patients who inherit the common IL6R Asp358Ala variant.</p>

	<p>The assessment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia has advanced since the 2006 NIMH-MATRICS Consensus Statement, leading to the development of second-generation rating scales like the Brief Negative Symptom Scale and the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms. These scales address the limitations of first-generation tools, such as the inclusion of aspects that are not negative symptoms and the lack of assessment of the subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s internal experience. However, psychometric validation of these scales is still in progress, and they are not yet recommended by regulatory agencies, thus limiting their use in clinical trials and settings. Complementing these traditional methods, remote digital phenotyping offers a novel approach by leveraging smartphones and wearable technology to capture real-time, high-resolution clinical data. Despite the potential to overcome traditional assessment barriers, challenges remain in aligning these digital measures with clinical ratings and ensuring data security. Equally important is patient acceptance, as the success of remote digital phenotyping relies on the willingness of patients to use these technologies. This review provides a critical overview of both second-generation scales and remote digital phenotyping for assessing negative symptoms, highlighting future research needs.</p>

	<p>Background: Perinatal brain injury is a leading cause of developmental disabilities, including cerebral palsy. However, further work is needed to understand early brain development in the presence of brain injury. In this case report, we examine the longitudinal neuromotor development of a term infant following a significant loss of right-hemispheric brain tissue due to a unilateral ischemic stroke. Our analysis focuses on the integrity and development of the corticospinal tract (CST) from the lesioned hemisphere. This case provides a unique opportunity to evaluate CST development after loss of the majority of the motor cortex. Methods: Evaluations were conducted when the infant was 4 (Visit-1), 18 (Visit 2), and 25 (Visit 3) months old. Assessments included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to characterize the lesion and quantify CST structural integrity, single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) to evaluate CST functional circuitry, and neuromotor assessments. Results: At Visit 1, bilateral CSTs were identified through diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) despite an estimated loss of 92.7% (7.3% retained) of age-typical motor cortex from the right hemisphere. Both hemispheres exhibited bilateral motor-evoked potential in response to stimulation with spTMS, which remained when reassessed at Visits 2 and 3. Longitudinal MRI showed distinct developmental trajectories of CST integrity in each hemisphere, with the lesioned hemisphere exhibiting initial increases in integrity between Visits 1 and 2 followed by a decrease in integrity between Visits 2 and 3. The non-lesioned hemisphere showed increased integrity from Visit 1 to Visit 2, which remained stable at Visit 3. Motor assessments at all visits indicated a high risk of cerebral palsy. Conclusions: This report highlights the utility of MRI and spTMS in studying neuromotor development. The findings reveal preserved functional bilateral CST circuitry despite majority loss of the right-hemispheric motor cortex as well as distinct developmental trajectories in CST integrity between hemispheres. These results underscore the potential for neural plasticity after perinatal brain injury. Clinical Trials Registration: NCT05013736.</p>

	<p>The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has been developed and edited by the World Health Organisation and represents the global standard for recording health information and causes of death. The ICD-11 is the eleventh revision and came into effect on 1 January 2022. Perceptual disturbances refer to abnormalities in the way sensory information is interpreted by the brain, leading to distortions in the perception of reality. These can manifest as distorted perceptions or as phantom perceptions and can occur in all sensory modalities as visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory tactile, vestibular, proprioceptory or interoceptory disturbances. There are similar brain mechanisms involved in the generation of these analogous perceptual disturbances and disorders, and they are treated with similar approaches. Perceptual disturbances are highly prevalent, with large variations across the different sensory modalities. They can be associated with significant suffering and cause a high socioeconomic burden. Perceptual disturbances can be symptoms of another disease or disease entities on their own. In the context of pain, this is reflected by the distinction between secondary pain (pain as a symptom of another underlying condition) and primary pain (a disease in its own right, rather than being a symptom of another underlying condition) in the ICD-11. Such a clear distinction is not found in an entirely consistent way across the various sensory modalities. By using the example of auditory phantom perceptions, we propose a framework for the classification of sensory disorders in alignment with the classification of pain in the ICD-11. The descriptions of the sensory disturbances should include (1) a causal aspect (primary versus secondary), (2) a temporal aspect (acute vs. chronic and persistent vs. intermittent), (3) a cognitive, emotional and autonomic interpretation aspect (=suffering) and (4) a social aspect (=disability). If the latter two aspects are present, we propose that the sensory disturbance is called a sensory disorder.</p>

                <p>Short-term motor adaptation to novel movement dynamics has been shown to involve at least two concurrent learning processes: a slow process that responds weakly to error but retains information well and a fast process that responds strongly to error but has poor retention. This modeling framework can explain several properties of motion-dependent motor adaptation (e.g., 24&nbsp;h retention). An important assumption of this computational framework is that learning is only based on the experienced movement error, and the effect of noise (either internally generated or externally applied) is not considered. We examined the respective error sensitivity by quantifying adaptation in three subject groups distinguished by the noise added to the motion-dependent perturbation. We assessed the feedforward adaptive changes in motor output and examined the adaptation rate, retention, and decay of learning. Applying a two-state modeling framework showed that the applied noise during training mainly affected the fast learning process, with the slow process largely unaffected; participants in the higher noise groups demonstrated a reduced force profile following training, but the decay rate across groups was similar, suggesting that the slow process was unimpaired across conditions. Collectively, our results provide evidence that noise significantly decreases motor adaptation, but this reduction may be due to its influence over specific learning mechanisms. Importantly, this may have implications for how the motor system compensates for random fluctuations, especially when affected by brain disorders that result in movement tremor (e.g., essential tremor).</p>

                <p>Epilepsy, a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures, significantly impacts patient quality of life. Current classification methods focus primarily on clinical observations and electroencephalography (EEG) analysis, often overlooking the underlying dynamics driving seizures. This study uses surface EEG data to identify seizure transitions using a dynamical systems&ndash;based framework&mdash;the taxonomy of seizure dynamotypes&mdash;previously examined only in invasive data. We applied principal component and independent component (IC) analysis to surface EEG recordings from 1,177 seizures in 158 patients with focal epilepsy, decomposing the signals into ICs. The ICs were visually labeled for clear seizure transitions and bifurcation morphologies (BifMs), which were then examined using Bayesian multilevel modeling in the context of clinical factors. Our analysis reveals that certain onset bifurcations (saddle node on invariant circle and supercritical Hopf) are more prevalent during wakefulness compared with their reduced rate during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, particularly NREM3. We discuss the possible implications of our results in the context of modeling approaches and suggest additional avenues to continue this exploration. Furthermore, we demonstrate the feasibility of automating this classification process using machine learning, achieving high performance in identifying seizure-related ICs and classifying interspike interval changes. Our findings suggest that the noise in surface EEG may obscure certain BifMs, and we suggest technical improvements that could enhance detection accuracy. Expanding the dataset and incorporating long-term biological rhythms, such as circadian and multiday cycles, may provide a more comprehensive understanding of seizure dynamics and improve clinical decision-making.</p>

                Background Studies assessing sub-maximal aerobic capacity in non-cirrhotic chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate sub-maximal aerobic capacity in CHB patients compared to apparently healthy participants (control-group). Methods A 6-min walk test was performed. The 6-min walk distance (6MWD) was recorded, along with heart-rate, oxygen hemoglobin saturation (SpO2), blood pressure, and dyspnea ( ie ; visual analogue scale) at rest (Rest) and at the end (End) of the test. Additionally, 6-min walk work (6MWW), “6MWD × body mass index (BMI), “6MWD × SpO2End”, and “estimated cardiorespiratory and muscular chain age” were calculated. Signs of physical intolerance were determined including abnormal 6MWD ( ie ; 6MWD < lower limit of normal), chronotropic insufficiency ( ie ; heart-rateEnd < 60% of maximal predicted heart-rate), high dyspnea ( ie ; dyspneaEnd > 5), and desaturation ( ie ; drop in SpO2 > 5 points). Results Compared to the control-group (n=28), the CHB-group (n=26) exhibited significantly lower 6MWD by 61 meters (13%), lower 6MWW by 5266 m.kg, lower “6MWD × BMI” by 1498 m.kg/m2, lower “6MWD × SpO2End” by 5650%, and lower heart-rateEnd by 26 bpm (12% predicted). The CHB-group included higher percentages of participants with chronotropic insufficiency (23.08% vs. 3.57% in the CG) and abnormal 6MWD (34.61% vs. 3.57% in the CG). CHB accelerated the aging of the “cardiorespiratory and muscular chain” by 11 years. Conclusion Non-cirrhotic CHB may contribute to reduced submaximal aerobic capacity and acceleration of “cardiorespiratory and muscular chain” aging. A regular physical activity program could be a valuable intervention to mitigate these effects.

                Background This study explores the influence of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices on consumer purchasing decisions in the fashion industry. It examines how corporate image and word-of-mouth (WOM) mediate the relationship between ESG practices and consumer trust, impacting purchase intent. Methods A structured questionnaire was distributed online to 393 participants aware of ESG practices, targeting Generation Z consumers. The survey assessed demographics, ESG awareness, brand image, WOM, and purchasing decisions using a Likert scale across five constructs: ESG Practices, Corporate Image, WOM, Trust, and Purchase Intention. Data were analyzed with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) in IBM AMOS, following a two-step process: Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) for validation and path analysis for hypothesis testing. Results The findings indicate that ESG practices significantly enhance corporate image and positive WOM, which, in turn, foster consumer trust. Corporate image has a substantial impact on consumer trust (p < .001), while WOM also contributes to trust (p < .001). Trust was found to be a strong predictor of purchase intention, demonstrating the mediating role of corporate image and WOM between ESG practices and purchasing behavior. Conclusions ESG practices are critical in shaping consumer perceptions and fostering loyalty in the fashion sector. By building a trustworthy corporate image and encouraging positive WOM, fashion brands can effectively influence consumer purchasing decisions. This study highlights the competitive advantage of implementing ESG practices, particularly in appealing to Generation Z consumers who value sustainability and ethical business practices.

<p>Anxiety, but not depression scores, were significantly related to neural stress responses in a striato-limbic cluster. Moreover, relative to women, men showed stronger associations between anxiety scores and activity in striatal and temporal clusters. Baseline neural stress responses could not predict the anxiety trajectory during a particular stress phase.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Anxiety and depression disorders show high prevalence rates, and stress is a significant risk factor for both. However, studies investigating the interplay between anxiety, depression, and stress regulation in the brain are scarce. The present manuscript included 124 law students from the LawSTRESS project. Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and psychosocial stress was induced with the imaging stress paradigm Scan<i>STRESS</i>. Anxiety, but not depression scores, were significantly related to neural stress responses in a striato-limbic cluster. Moreover, relative to women, men showed stronger associations between anxiety scores and activation in striatal and temporal clusters. A bifactor model of the HADS suggested a general factor characterized by tension, nervousness, and cheerlessness, which was associated with activation changes in a similar but more circumscribed cluster than anxiety. In the LawSTRESS project, the HADS was assessed at five sampling points (1 year, 3 months, 1 week prior exam, 1 week, and 1 month thereafter), and thus an exploratory trajectory analysis could be performed. It confirmed the relationship between anxiety scores and striatal stress responses at baseline but revealed no predictive value of the neural measure across the sampling points. Our results suggest that—in healthy young participants—neural acute psychosocial stress responses in striato-limbic structures are associated with anxiety, supporting the assumption that these regions are related to individual differences in vulnerability to stress-related disorders. A correlation with depression scores could not be found, and possible explanations are discussed.</p>

The rapid advance of large-scale atlas-level single cell RNA sequences and single-cell chromatin accessibility data provide extraordinary avenues to broad and deep insight into complex biological mechanism. Leveraging the datasets and transfering labels from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq will empower the exploration of single-cell omics data. However, the current label transfer methods have limited performance, largely due to the lower capable of preserving fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic or extrinsic heterogeneity between datasets. Here, we present a robust deep transfer model based graph convolutional network, scTGCN, which achieves versatile performance in preserving biological variation, while achieving integration hundreds of thousands cells in minutes with low memory consumption. We show that scTGCN is powerful to the integration of mouse atlas data and multimodal data generated from APSA-seq and CITE-seq. Thus, scTGCN shows high label transfer accuracy and effectively knowledge transfer across different modalities.

                <p>by Lua Koenig, Biyu J. He</p>

Perceptual awareness results from an intricate interaction between external sensory input and the brain’s spontaneous activity. Pre-stimulus ongoing activity influencing conscious perception includes both brain oscillations in the alpha (7 to 14 Hz) and beta (14 to 30 Hz) frequency ranges and aperiodic activity in the slow cortical potential (SCP, <5 Hz) range. However, whether brain oscillations and SCPs independently influence conscious perception or do so through shared mechanisms remains unknown. Here, we addressed this question in 2 independent magnetoencephalography (MEG) data sets involving near-threshold visual perception tasks in humans using low-level (Gabor patches) and high-level (objects, faces, houses, animals) stimuli, respectively. We found that oscillatory power and large-scale SCP activity influence conscious perception through independent mechanisms that do not have shared variance. In addition, through mediation analysis, we show that pre-stimulus oscillatory power and SCP activity have different relations to pupil size—an index of arousal—in their influences on conscious perception. Together, these findings suggest that oscillatory power and SCPs independently contribute to perceptual awareness, with distinct relations to pupil-linked arousal.

                Background Chronic diseases are a significant health concern in Australia. Understanding community preferences for health screening services is vital for enhancing service delivery. We conducted a study to determine community preferences for health screening services for chronic diseases in Australia using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). This paper aims to present the development of the final DCE design using priors estimated from a survey. Methods A DCE was conducted in Australia. An online survey was administered to a general Australian population over 18. The final attribute list of five attributes with three levels each was designed. A D-efficient design with 30 pair-wise choice tasks was developed using a fractional factorial design. A pre-test was conducted to assess comprehension and understanding of the online DCE survey. The pilot survey aimed to compute priors (i.e. coefficients) associated with attributes. A multinomial logit model was used to analyse the pilot DCE data. Results The survey included 30 choice tasks in three blocks, with 119 participants responding. The best DCE design was selected based on D-error, with a lower D-error indicating the most efficient design. The pilot survey results indicated a strong preference for highly accurate screening tests, with coefficients for 85% and 95% accuracy being positive. Coefficients estimated from the pilot survey were used as priors to design the DCE choice tasks for the main survey. The final DCE design showed a notable improvement in the attribute level overlap compared to the design used for the pilot survey. Conclusions A rigorous approach was taken to develop a DCE survey that could effectively determine the preferences of the community for health screening services. The resulting DCE design consisted of 30 choice tasks presented in pairs and was deemed efficient enough to gather comprehensive information in the final survey.

                Background This study investigates the impact of the 2008 constitutional change on Ecuadorians´ life satisfaction (developing country), based on the Sumak-Kawsay or “The good way of living” philosophy, with a particular focus on caring of people and mingas (community participation). Methods Through a repeated cross-sectional analysis of national survey data, this study compares the periods before (2007) and after (2014) the implementation of the 2008 constitution to examine how caring behaviors and mingas (community work) influence life satisfaction, using an ordinal logistic regression model to assess the role of this reform in shaping these effects. Results The findings reveal significant improvements in life satisfaction following the 2008’ reform, especially in the Eastern region, where community activities are prevalent, and poverty is most concentrated. These activities, including mingas, showed a positive association with an increase in life satisfaction, underscoring the role of public policies in improving public well-being. Conclusion This approach offers innovative empirical evidence on how social public policies that promote prosocial behaviors, such as solidarity and community participation, can create an environment encouraging to greater life satisfaction, particularly in less developed regions. It also underscores how social investment aimed at improving wealth distribution can positively influence collaborative behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27168?af=R">Diagnosing Epilepsy with Normal Interictal EEG Using Dynamic Network Models</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Whereas a scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) is important for diagnosing epilepsy, a single routine EEG is limited in its diagnostic value. Only a small percentage of routine EEGs show interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and overall misdiagnosis rates of epilepsy are 20% to 30%. We aim to demonstrate how network properties in EEG recordings can be used to improve the speed and accuracy differentiating epilepsy from mimics, such as functional seizures – even in the absence of IEDs.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this multicenter study, we analyzed routine scalp EEGs from 218 patients with suspected epilepsy and normal initial EEGs. The patients’ diagnoses were later confirmed based on an epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) admission. About 46% ultimately being diagnosed with epilepsy and 54% with non-epileptic conditions. A logistic regression model was trained using spectral and network-derived EEG features to differentiate between epilepsy and non-epilepsy. Of the 218 patients, 90% were used for training and 10% were held out for testing. Within the training set, 10-fold cross validation was performed. The resulting tool was named “EpiScalp.”</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>EpiScalp achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.940, an accuracy of 0.904, a sensitivity of 0.835, and a specificity of 0.963 in classifying patients as having epilepsy or not.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>EpiScalp provides an accurate diagnostic aid from a single initial EEG recording, even in more challenging epilepsy cases with normal initial EEGs. This may represent a paradigm shift in epilepsy diagnosis by deriving an objective measure of epilepsy likelihood from previously uninformative EEGs. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Somatostatin-expressing (SST) neurons are a major class of electrophysiologically and morphologically distinct inhibitory cells in the mammalian neocortex. Transcriptomic data suggest that this class can be divided into multiple subtypes that are correlated with morpho-electric properties. At the same time, availability of transgenic tools to identify and record from SST neurons in awake, behaving mice has stimulated insights about their response properties and computational function. Neocortical SST neurons are regulated by sleep and arousal, attention, and novelty detection, and show marked response plasticity during learning. Recent studies suggest that subtype-specific analysis of SST neurons may be critical for understanding their complex roles in cortical function. In this review, we discuss and synthesize recent advances in understanding the diversity, circuit integration, and functional properties of this important group of GABAergic neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101943">Outer hair cells stir cochlear fluids</a></h4>

              
                We hypothesized that active outer hair cells drive cochlear fluid circulation. The hypothesis was tested by delivering the neurotoxin, kainic acid, to the intact round window of young gerbil cochleae while monitoring auditory responses in the cochlear nucleus. Sounds presented at a modest level significantly expedited kainic acid delivery. When outer-hair-cell motility was suppressed by salicylate, the facilitation effect was compromised. A low-frequency tone was more effective than broadband noise, especially for drug delivery to apical locations. Computational model simulations provided the physical basis for our observation, which incorporated solute diffusion, fluid advection, fluid–structure interaction, and outer-hair-cell motility. Active outer hair cells deformed the organ of Corti like a peristaltic tube to generate apically streaming flows along the tunnel of Corti and basally streaming flows along the scala tympani. Our measurements and simulations coherently suggest that active outer hair cells in the tail region of cochlear traveling waves drive cochlear fluid circulation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101701">Exploration of the metabolomic mechanisms of postmenopausal hypertension induced by low estrogen state</a></h4>

              
                Estrogen significantly impacts women’s health, and postmenopausal hypertension is a common issue characterized by blood pressure fluctuations. Current control strategies for this condition are limited in efficacy, necessitating further research into the underlying mechanisms. Although metabolomics has been applied to study various diseases, its use in understanding postmenopausal hypertension is scarce. Therefore, an ovariectomized rat model was used to simulate postmenopausal conditions. Estrogen levels, blood pressure, and aortic tissue metabolomics were analyzed. Animal models were divided into Sham, OVX, and OVX +E groups. Serum estrogen levels, blood pressure measurements, and aortic tissue metabolomics analyses were performed using radioimmunoassay, UHPLC-Q-TOF, and bioinformatics techniques. Based on the above research content, we successfully established a correlation between low estrogen levels and postmenopausal hypertension in rats. Notable differences in blood pressure parameters and aortic tissue metabolites were observed across the experimental groups. Specifically, metabolites that were differentially expressed, particularly L-alpha-aminobutyric acid (L-AABA), showed potential as a biomarker for postmenopausal hypertension, potentially exerting a protective function through macrophage activation and vascular remodeling. Enrichment analysis revealed alterations in sugar metabolism pathways, such as the Warburg effect and glycolysis, indicating their involvement in postmenopausal hypertension. Overall, this current research provides insights into the metabolic changes associated with postmenopausal hypertension, highlighting the role of L-AABA and sugar metabolism reprogramming in aortic tissue. The findings suggest a potential link between low estrogen levels, macrophage function, and vascular remodeling in the pathogenesis of postmenopausal hypertension. Further investigations are needed to validate these findings and explore their clinical implications for postmenopausal women.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100922">Early and delayed STAT1-dependent responses drive local trained immunity of macrophages in the spleen</a></h4>

              
                Trained immunity (TI) is the process wherein innate immune cells gain functional memory upon exposure to specific ligands or pathogens, leading to augmented inflammatory responses and pathogen clearance upon secondary exposure. While the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and reprogramming of bone marrow (BM) progenitors are well-established mechanisms underpinning durable TI protection, remodeling of the cellular architecture within the tissue during TI remains underexplored. Here, we study the effects of peritoneal Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) administration to find TI-mediated protection in the spleen against a subsequent heterologous infection by the Gram-negative pathogen <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium (<i>S</i>.Tm). Utilizing single cell RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry, we discerned STAT1-regulated genes in TI-associated resident and recruited splenic myeloid populations. The temporal dynamics of TI were further elucidated, revealing both early and delayed myeloid subsets with time-dependent, cell-type-specific STAT1 signatures. Using lineage tracing, we find that tissue-resident red pulp macrophages (RPM), initially depleted by BCG exposure, are restored from both tissue-trained, self-renewing macrophages and from bone marrow-derived progenitors, fostering long lasting local defense. Early inhibition of STAT1 activation, using specific JAK-STAT inhibitors, reduces both RPM loss and recruitment of trained monocytes. Our study suggests a temporal window soon after BCG vaccination, in which STAT1-dependent activation of long-lived resident cells in the tissue mediates localized protection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100545">Discovery of a heparan sulfate binding domain in monkeypox virus H3 as an anti-poxviral drug target combining AI and MD simulations</a></h4>

              
                Viral adhesion to host cells is a critical step in infection for many viruses, including monkeypox virus (MPXV). In MPXV, the H3 protein mediates viral adhesion through its interaction with heparan sulfate (HS), yet the structural details of this interaction have remained elusive. Using AI-based structural prediction tools and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identified a novel, positively charged α-helical domain in H3 that is essential for HS binding. This conserved domain, found across <i>orthopoxviruses</i>, was experimentally validated and shown to be critical for viral adhesion, making it an ideal target for antiviral drug development. Targeting this domain, we designed a protein inhibitor, which disrupted the H3-HS interaction, inhibited viral infection in vitro and viral replication in vivo, offering a promising antiviral candidate. Our findings reveal a novel therapeutic target of MPXV, demonstrating the potential of combination of AI-driven methods and MD simulations to accelerate antiviral drug discovery.

                The role of cerebellum in controlling eye movements is well established, but its contribution to more complex forms of visual behavior has remained elusive. To study cerebellar activity during visual attention we recorded extracellular activity of dentate nucleus (DN) neurons in two non-human primates (NHPs). NHPs were trained to read the direction indicated by a peripheral visual stimulus while maintaining fixation at the center, and report the direction of the cue by performing a saccadic eye movement into the same direction following a delay. We found that single-unit DN neurons modulated spiking activity over the entire time course of the task, and that their activity often bridged temporally separated intra-trial events, yet in a heterogeneous manner. To better understand the heterogeneous relationship between task structure, behavioral performance, and neural dynamics, we constructed a behavioral, an encoding, and a decoding model. Both NHPs showed different behavioral strategies, which influenced the performance. Activity of the DN neurons reflected the unique strategies, with the direction of the visual stimulus frequently being encoded long before an upcoming saccade. Moreover, the latency of the ramping activity of DN neurons following presentation of the visual stimulus was shorter in the better performing NHP. Labeling with the retrograde tracer Cholera Toxin B in the recording location in the DN indicated that these neurons predominantly receive inputs from Purkinje cells in the D1 and D2 zones of the lateral cerebellum as well as neurons of the principal olive and medial pons, all regions known to connect with neurons in the prefrontal cortex contributing to planning of saccades. Together, our results highlight that DN neurons can dynamically modulate their activity during a visual attention task, comprising not only sensorimotor but also cognitive attentional components.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100060">Crispant analysis in zebrafish as a tool for rapid functional screening of disease-causing genes for bone fragility</a></h4>

              
                Heritable fragile bone disorders (FBDs), ranging from multifactorial to rare monogenic conditions, are characterized by an elevated fracture risk. Validating causative genes and understanding their mechanisms remain challenging. We assessed a semi-high throughput zebrafish screening platform for rapid <i>in vivo</i> functional testing of candidate FBD genes. Six genes linked to severe recessive osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and four associated with bone mineral density (BMD) from genome-wide association studies were analyzed using CRISPR/Cas9-based crispant screening in F0 mosaic founder zebrafish. Next-generation sequencing confirmed high indel efficiency (mean 88%), mimicking stable knock-out models. Skeletal phenotyping at 7, 14, and 90 days post-fertilization (dpf) using microscopy, Alizarin Red S staining, and microCT was performed. Larval crispants showed variable osteoblast and mineralization phenotypes, while adult crispants displayed consistent skeletal defects, including malformed neural and haemal arches, vertebral fractures and fusions, and altered bone volume and density. In addition, <i>aldh7a1</i> and <i>mbtps2</i> crispants experienced increased mortality due to severe skeletal deformities. RT-qPCR revealed differential expression of osteogenic markers <i>bglap</i> and <i>col1a1a</i>, highlighting their biomarker potential. Our results establish zebrafish crispant screening as a robust tool for FBD gene validation, combining skeletal and molecular analyses across developmental stages to uncover novel insights into gene functions in bone biology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97865">Target-agnostic identification of human antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum sexual forms reveals cross-stage recognition of glutamate-rich repeats</a></h4>

              
                Circulating sexual stages of <i>Plasmodium falciparum (Pf</i>) can be transmitted from humans to mosquitoes, thereby furthering the spread of malaria in the population. It is well established that antibodies can efficiently block parasite transmission. In search for naturally acquired antibodies targets on sexual stages, we established an efficient method for target-agnostic single B cell activation followed by high-throughput selection of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) reactive to sexual stages of <i>Pf</i> in the form of gametes and gametocyte extracts. We isolated mAbs reactive against a range of <i>Pf</i> proteins including well-established targets Pfs48/45 and Pfs230. One mAb, B1E11K, was cross-reactive to various proteins containing glutamate-rich repetitive elements expressed at different stages of the parasite life cycle. A crystal structure of two B1E11K Fab domains in complex with its main antigen, RESA, expressed on asexual blood stages, showed binding of B1E11K to a repeating epitope motif in a head-to-head conformation engaging in affinity-matured homotypic interactions. Thus, this mode of recognition of <i>Pf</i> proteins, previously described only for Pf circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP), extends to other repeats expressed across various stages. The findings augment our understanding of immune-pathogen interactions to repeating elements of the <i>Plasmodium</i> parasite proteome and underscore the potential of the novel mAb identification method used to provide new insights into the natural humoral immune response against <i>Pf</i>.

">Microglia regulate nucleus accumbens synaptic development and circuit function underlying threat avoidance behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Microglia are the resident immune cells of the CNS and modulate synaptic connectivity and function in the developing brain1-3. While microglia have well-established roles in synapse pruning4,5, only a few studies have identified roles for microglia in synapse formation6-8. These studies focused on the cortex and primary sensory circuits during restricted developmental time periods, leaving substantial gaps in our understanding of the early developmental functions of microglia. Here we investigated how the absence of microglia impacts synaptic development in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a region critical for emotional regulation and motivated behaviors and where dysfunction is implicated in psychiatric disorders that arise early in life9-11. Using a genetically modified mouse that lacks microglia (Csf1r{Delta}FIRE/{Delta}FIRE)12, we found blunted excitatory synapse formation in the NAc. This effect was most prominent during the second and third postnatal weeks, when we previously found microglia to be overproduced13, and was accompanied by an increase in presynaptic release probability and alterations in postsynaptic kinetics. Tissue-level NAc proteomics confirmed that microglial absence impacted numerous proteins involved in synapse structure, trans-synaptic signaling, and pre-synaptic function. However, microglial absence did not perturb levels of astrocyte-derived cues and adhesive proteins that promote synaptogenesis, suggesting that reduced synapse number may be caused by absence of a microglial-derived synaptogenic cue. Although observed electrophysiological synaptic changes were largely normalized by adulthood, we identified lasting effects of microglial absence on threat avoidance behavior, and these behavioral effects were directly associated with alterations of NAc neuronal activity. Together, these results indicate a critical role for microglia in regulating the synaptic landscape of the developing NAc and in establishing functional circuits underlying adult behavioral repertoires.

">The medial prefrontal cortex encodes procedural rules as sequential neuronal activity dynamics</a></h4>

              
                The prefrontal cortex plays a crucial role in procedural rule learning; however, the specific neuronal mechanism through which it represents rules is unknown. We hypothesized that sequential neuronal activities in the prefrontal cortex encode these rules. To investigate this, we recorded neuronal activities in the medial prefrontal cortex of mice during rule learning using Ca2+ imaging. We utilized a method based on convolutional negative matrix factorization, iSeq, to automatically detect temporal neuronal sequences in the recorded data. As rule learning advanced, these neuronal sequences began to encode critical information for rule execution. In mice that had mastered the rule, the dynamics of neuronal sequences could predict success and failure of reward acquisition. Furthermore, the composition of cell populations within the neuronal sequences was rearranged throughout the learning process. These findings suggest that as animals learn a rule, the medial prefrontal cortex continually updates its neuronal sequences to assign significance to behavioral actions crucial for reward acquisition.

">Category-biased patches encircle core domain-general regions in the human lateral prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The fine-grained functional organization of the human lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) remains poorly understood. Previous fMRI studies delineated focal domain-general, or multiple-demand (MD), PFC areas that co-activate during diverse cognitively demanding tasks. While there is some evidence for category-selective (face and scene) patches, in human and non-human primate PFC, these have not been systematically assessed. Recent precision fMRI studies have also revealed sensory-biased PFC patches adjacent to MD regions. To investigate if this topographic arrangement extends to other domains, we analysed two independent fMRI datasets (n=449 and n=37) utilizing the high-resolution multimodal MRI approaches of the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Both datasets included cognitive control tasks and stimuli spanning different categories: faces, places, tools and body parts. Contrasting each stimulus category against the remaining ones revealed focal interdigitated patches of activity located adjacent to core MD regions. The results were robust, replicating across different executive tasks, experimental designs (block and event-related) and at the single subject level. Our results paint a refined view of the fine-grained functional organization of the PFC, revealing a recurring motif of interdigitated domain-specific and domain-general circuits. This organization offers new constraints for models of cognitive control, cortical specialization and development.

">Technical and biological sources of noise confound multiplexed enhancer AAV screening</a></h4>

              
                Cis-acting regulatory enhancer elements are valuable tools for gaining cell type-specific genetic access. Leveraging large chromatin accessibility atlases, putative enhancer sequences can be identified and deployed in adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery platforms. However, a significant bottleneck in enhancer AAV discovery is charting their detailed expression patterns in vivo, a process that currently requires gold-standard one-by-one testing. Here we present a barcoded multiplex strategy for screening enhancer AAVs at cell type resolution using single cell RNA sequencing and taxonomy mapping. We executed a proof-of-concept study using a small pool of validated enhancer AAVs expressing in a variety of neuronal and non-neuronal cell types across the mouse brain. Unexpectedly, we encountered substantial technical and biological noise including chimeric packaging products, necessitating development of novel techniques to accurately deconvolve enhancer expression patterns. These results underscore the need for improved methods to mitigate noise and highlight the complexity of enhancer AAV biology in vivo.

	<p>Background: The integration of digital health technologies has transformed mental healthcare, particularly for young adults with First-Episode Psychosis (FEP). Digital interventions, such as telepsychiatry and mobile applications, address barriers like social stigma, restricted access to services, and the urgency of timely care. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted using PubMed and APA PsycINFO. Included studies focused on randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and open studies of digital interventions for FEP rehabilitation. Exclusion criteria included meta-analyses, reviews, and irrelevant studies. Results: Smartphone applications like Horyzons-Canada facilitated peer support and symptom management, while tools such as My Journey 3 emphasized the need for better user engagement. Digital innovations, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and telepsychiatry, demonstrated improvements in recovery and treatment adherence. Discussion: Digital interventions significantly enhance the accessibility and quality of FEP care, supporting functional recovery and patient engagement. Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies, user engagement strategies, and advanced analytics to develop personalized, scalable solutions.</p>

	<p>Advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques are transforming the study of movement disorders by providing valuable insights into disease mechanisms. This narrative review presents a comprehensive overview of their applications in this field, offering an updated perspective on their potential for early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and therapeutic evaluation. Emerging MRI modalities such as neuromelanin-sensitive imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, magnetization transfer imaging, and relaxometry provide sensitive biomarkers that can detect early microstructural degeneration, iron deposition, and connectivity disruptions in key regions like the substantia nigra. These techniques enable earlier and more accurate differentiation of movement disorders, including Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, corticobasal degeneration, Lewy body and frontotemporal dementia, Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, and dystonia. Furthermore, MRI provides objective metrics for tracking disease progression and assessing therapeutic efficacy, making it an indispensable tool in clinical trials. Despite these advances, the absence of standardized protocols limits their integration into routine clinical practice. Addressing this gap and incorporating these techniques more systematically could bring the field closer to leveraging advanced MRI for personalized treatment strategies, ultimately improving outcomes for individuals with movement disorders.</p>

	<p>The global prevalence of sedentary lifestyles and the associated health risks, such as cardiovascular, metabolic and mental issues, is an epidemic worldwide problem, particularly in the university population. Background/Objectives: University students are particularly vulnerable because of academic pressure and lifestyle changes. Despite the well-known benefits of physical activity in reducing mental stress and improving physical and mental well-being, the literature lacks effective interventions and standardized protocols for this population. This study aims to investigate the state of the art in literature regarding the correlation between the use of physical activity as a means of prevention and intervention and the effects on university students&amp;amp;rsquo; stress and mental well-being. Methods: A scoping review was conducted using the PRISMA protocol for scoping reviews, targeting university population with specific terms. Results: The review analyzed 61 articles and identified a consistent positive correlation between physical activity and stress reduction. Interventions included yoga, tai chi, aerobic exercise and moderate- or high-intensity exercise. A lack of standardized protocols were also evident. Conclusions: Physical activity is an effective means for managing stress and improving mental well-being among university students. An integrated approach combining different forms of exercise and strategies to regulate emotions could provide very effective effects on the mental well-being of students. Universities should propose physical activity programs in several forms to enable students to choose the most appropriate one and keep them active.</p>

	<p>Introduction: The cerebellum is a common lesion site in persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Physiologic and anatomic studies have identified a topographic organization of the cerebellum including functionally distinct motor and cognitive areas. In this study, a recent parcellation algorithm was applied to a sample of PwMS and healthy controls to examine the relationships among specific cerebellar regions, fall status, and common clinical measures of motor and cognitive functions. Methods: Thirty-one PwMS and twenty-nine age- and sex-matched controls underwent an MRI scan and motor and cognitive testing. The parcellation algorithm was applied to all images and divided the cerebellum into 28 regions. Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U tests were used to compare cerebellar volumes among PwMS and controls, and MS fallers and MS non-fallers. Relationships between cerebellar volumes and motor and cognitive function were evaluated using Spearman correlations. Results: PwMS performed significantly worse on functional measures compared to controls. We found significant differences in volumetric measures between PwMS and controls in the corpus medullare, lobules I&amp;amp;ndash;III, and lobule V. Volumetric differences seen between the PwMS and controls were primarily driven by the MS fallers. Finally, functional performance on motor and cognitive tasks was associated with cerebellar volumes. Conclusions: Using the parcellation tool, our results showed that the volumes of motor and cognitive lobules impact both motor and cognitive performance, and that functional performance and cerebellar volumes distinguishes the MS fallers from non-fallers. Future studies should explore the potential of cerebellar imaging to predict falls in PwMS.</p>

	<p>Background: The molecular biology of Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (HD) has grown substantially, with pathological considerations extending to genetic modifiers, epigenetic changes, transcriptomics, the proteome, and the metabolome. The metabolome and proteome are especially intriguing in that they most directly reflect the functional state of the cellular environment, which may involve some combination of pathology as well as compensation. Methods: We assessed CSF proteomics from eight participants by their functional severity (TFC range 3&amp;amp;ndash;13), with 47 proteins having a minimum r-value of 0.7 and nominal p-values &amp;amp;lt; 0.05. Results: Our exploratory data reveal correlations between progression and several processes including inflammation, ECM homeostasis and NAD+ metabolism. Conclusions: Consistently identified targets that correlate with phenotype or progression may have value, if validated, as enrichment tools in clinical trials and potentially as markers of therapeutic response.</p>

	<p>Backgrounds: Virtual reality (VR) has become a transformative technology with applications in gaming, education, healthcare, and psychotherapy. The subjective experiences in VR vary based on the virtual environment&amp;amp;rsquo;s characteristics, and electroencephalography (EEG) is instrumental in assessing these differences. By analyzing EEG signals, researchers can explore the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive and emotional responses to VR stimuli. However, distinguishing EEG signals recorded by two-dimensional (2D) versus three-dimensional (3D) VR environments remains underexplored. Current research primarily utilizes power spectral density (PSD) features to differentiate between 2D and 3D VR conditions, but the potential of other feature parameters for enhanced discrimination is unclear. Additionally, the use of machine learning techniques to classify EEG signals from 2D and 3D VR using alternative features has not been thoroughly investigated, highlighting the need for further research to identify robust EEG features and effective classification methods. Methods: This study recorded EEG signals from participants exposed to 2D and 3D VR video stimuli to investigate the neural differences between these conditions. Key features extracted from the EEG data included PSD and common spatial patterns (CSPs), which capture frequency-domain and spatial-domain information, respectively. To evaluate classification performance, several classical machine learning algorithms were employed: ssupport vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), naive Bayes, decision Tree, AdaBoost, and a voting classifier. The study systematically compared the classification performance of PSD and CSP features across these algorithms, providing a comprehensive analysis of their effectiveness in distinguishing EEG signals in response to 2D and 3D VR stimuli. Results: The study demonstrated that machine learning algorithms can effectively classify EEG signals recorded during watching 2D and 3D VR videos. CSP features outperformed PSD in classification accuracy, indicating their superior ability to capture EEG signals differences between the VR conditions. Among the machine learning algorithms, the Random Forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy at 95.02%, followed by KNN with 93.16% and SVM with 91.39%. The combination of CSP features with RF, KNN, and SVM consistently showed superior performance compared to other feature-algorithm combinations, underscoring the effectiveness of CSP and these algorithms in distinguishing EEG responses to different VR experiences. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that EEG signals recorded during watching 2D and 3D VR videos can be effectively classified using machine learning algorithms with extracted feature parameters. The findings highlight the superiority of CSP features over PSD in distinguishing EEG signals under different VR conditions, emphasizing CSP&amp;amp;rsquo;s value in VR-induced EEG analysis. These results expand the application of feature-based machine learning methods in EEG studies and provide a foundation for future research into the brain cortical activity of VR experiences, supporting the broader use of machine learning in EEG-based analyses.</p>

                <p>Fragile X autosomal homolog 1 (FXR1), a member of the fragile X messenger riboprotein 1 family, has been linked to psychiatric disorders including autism and schizophrenia. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons play critical roles in cortical processing and have been implicated in FXR1-linked mental illnesses. Targeted deletion of FXR1 from PV interneurons in mice has been shown to alter cortical excitability and elicit schizophrenia-like behavior. This indicates that FXR1 regulates behaviorally relevant electrophysiological functions in PV interneurons. We therefore expressed a genetically encoded hybrid voltage sensor in PV interneurons and used voltage imaging in slices of mouse somatosensory cortex to assess the impact of targeted FXR1 deletion. These experiments showed that PV interneurons lacking FXR1 had excitatory synaptic potentials with larger amplitudes and shorter latencies compared with wild type. Synaptic potential rise-times, decay-times, and half-widths were also impacted to degrees that varied between cortical layer and synaptic input. Thus, FXR1 modulates the responsiveness of PV interneurons to excitatory synaptic inputs. This will enable FXR1 to control cortical processing in subtle ways, with the potential to influence behavior and contribute to psychiatric dysfunction.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/1/ENEURO.0466-24.2024?rss=1">Microglia Morphology in the Developing Primate Amygdala and Effects of Early Life Stress</a></h4>

              
                <p>A unique pool of immature glutamatergic neurons in the primate amygdala, known as the paralaminar nucleus (PL), are maturing between infancy and adolescence. The PL is a potential substrate for the steep growth curve of amygdala volume during this developmental period. A microglial component is also embedded among the PL neurons and likely supports local neuronal maturation and emerging synaptogenesis. Microglia may alter neuronal growth following environmental perturbations such as stress. Using multiple measures in rhesus macaques, we found that microglia in the infant primate PL had relatively large somas and a small arbor size. In contrast, microglia in the adolescent PL had a smaller soma and a larger dendritic arbor. We then examined microglial morphology in the PL after a novel maternal separation protocol, to examine the effects of early life stress. After maternal separation, the microglia had increased soma size, arbor size, and complexity. Surprisingly, strong effects were seen not only in the infant PL, but also in the adolescent PL from subjects who had experienced the separation many years earlier. We conclude that under normal maternal-rearing conditions, PL microglia morphology tracks PL neuronal growth, progressing to a more "mature" phenotype by adolescence. Maternal separation has long-lasting effects on microglia, altering their normal developmental trajectory, and resulting in a "hyper-ramified" phenotype that persists for years. We speculate that these changes have consequences for neuronal development in young primates.</p>

                <p>The human medial parietal cortex (MPC) is recruited during multiple cognitive processes. Previously, we demonstrated regions specific to recall of people or places and proposed that the functional organization of MPC mirrors the category selectivity defining the medial&ndash;lateral axis of the ventral&ndash;temporal cortex (VTC). However, prior work considered recall of people and places only, and VTC also shows object selectivity sandwiched between face- and scene-selective regions. Here, we tested a strong prediction of our proposal: like VTC, MPC should show a region specifically recruited during object recall, and its relative cortical position should mirror the one of VTC. While responses during people and place recall showed a striking replication of prior findings, we did not observe any evidence for object-recall effects within MPC, which differentiates it from the spatial organization in VTC. Importantly, beyond MPC, robust recall effects were observed for people, places, and objects on the lateral surface of the brain. Place-recall effects were present in the angular gyrus, frontal eye fields, and peripheral portions of the early visual cortex, whereas people recall selectively drove response in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus. Object-recall effects were largely restricted to a region posterior to the left somatosensory cortex, in the vicinity of the supramarginal gyrus. Taken together, these data demonstrate that while there are distributed regions active during recall of people, places, and objects, the functional organization of MPC does not mirror the medial&ndash;lateral axis of VTC but reflects only the most salient features of that axis&mdash;namely, representations of people and places.</p>

                Background Gliomas, particularly glioblastomas, have grim prognoses, necessitating early diagnostic and prognostic indicators. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), influential in cancer research, show potential as glioma biomarkers. This systematic review aimed to examine the efficacy of miRNAs in the diagnosis and prognosis of high-grade glioma. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for studies published from 2013 to 2023. The eligibility criteria included high-grade glioma, histopathological confirmation, miRNA samples from cerebrospinal fluid or plasma, and relevant outcome data. Studies were excluded if they were experimental or reviews and not in English. Results Of the 1120 initial results, 8 studies involving 660 subjects met the inclusion criteria. Several studies have assessed miRNA expression and its association with diagnosis and prognosis of high-grade gliomas. Overexpression of miR-221, miR-222, miR-210, miR-21, miR-125b, and miR-223 and under-expression of miR-15b and miR-124-3p showed significant potential in differentiating high-grade glioma patients from controls. Additionally, miRNAs are associated with distinct tumorigenic pathways. Conclusion Elevated or depressed expression levels of specific circulating miRNAs hold significant promise as noninvasive biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of high-grade glioma. These miRNAs offer valuable insights into disease progression and patient outcome. Further validation through extensive clinical trials and in-depth mechanistic studies is essential to realize their full clinical utility.

                Abstract* Currently, machine learning applications in marketing allow to optimize strategies, personalize experiences and improve decision making. However, there are still several research gaps, so the objective is to examine the research trends in the use of machine learning in marketing. A bibliometric analysis is proposed to assess the current scientific activity, following the parameters established by PRISMA-2020. Machine learning applications in marketing have experienced steady growth and increased attention in the academic community. Key references, such as Miklosik and Evans, and prominent journals, such as IEEE Access and Journal of Business Research, have been identified. A thematic evolution towards big data and digital marketing is observed, and thematic clusters such as “digital marketing”, “interpretation”, “prediction”, and “healthcare" stand out. These findings demonstrate the continued importance and research potential of this evolving field.

                Background This article introduces the fuzzy LiuB-subalgebra (LBS) of LiuB-algebra (LBA), a concept previously undefined in the context of BCL-algebras (other than BCL+-algebras). Additionally, we explore the use of a new notion of Pythagorean fuzzy sets within LiuB-subalgebras of LiuB-algebra.

Results The paper introduces a new concept—the Pythagorean fuzzy LiuB-subalgebra of LiuB-algebra—and provides theorems and properties associated with this structure. These findings demonstrate how these fuzzy subalgebras can be defined and explored within the broader framework of LiuB-algebra. Conclusions This work contributes to the theory of LiuB-algebras by presenting the Pythagorean fuzzy LiuB-subalgebra, along with its key properties and characteristics. The study provides new insights into the relationships between fuzzy sets and LiuB-algebras, opening up further avenues for research in this area.

                Background Conventional fish feed based on fish meal, meat, and soy cake presents procurement difficulties and high costs, affecting the profitability and sustainability of the aquaculture industry. Objective To evaluate the effect of hydrolyzed red worm (HRW- Eisenia foétida) in red tilapia (Oreochromis sp.) diet on production parameters. Methods The study was conducted at the aquaculture farm of the Politécnico Colombiano Jaime Isaza Cadavid (PCJIC) at 780 m.a.s.l.,with an average temperature of 28 °C. Ninety red tilapia fingerlings, averaging 7,5±0,5 g, were distributed in nine aquariums containing 75 liters of water. Fish underwentweight and size measurements at the beginning and end of the trial. They were fed experimental diets to apparent satiation three times daily. Water quality parameters and productive rates of growth and nutrient utilization were measured. The experimental design included three treatments with three replicates each: T1 (control diet, 0% hydrolysate inclusion), T2 (10% hydrolysate inclusion), and T3 (20% hydrolysate inclusion). ANOVA (p<0,05) was applied to growth and nutrient utilization variables, with mean comparisons using α<0,05 in SPSS version 25. Results Significant differences (p<0,04) were found between the control diet T1 (0% inclusion) and T2 (10% inclusion) in favor of weight gain (31,87 g). There were no statistical differences in size increase (p<0,217). As HRWinclusion increased, feed consumption decreased, likely due to higher hydrolyzed protein availability. Feed conversion rates showed significant differences (p<0,001) between T2 and T3 compared to T1, indicating better assimilation of the hydrolyzed protein. T2 and T3 also showed better protein and energy efficiency (p<0,001), demonstrating the hydrolyzed protein’s nutritional quality and assimilation. Diet cost decreased with higher hydrolyzed inclusion (p<0,034). Conclusion Inclusion 10% and 20% hydrolyzed red worms significantly improved production parameters and reduced costs, making it a viable alternative for feeding red tilapia for small and medium-scale producers.

                Background Owing to its combination of speed, tactics, and accuracy, table tennis is becoming a sport exercise that is suitable for older adults. Casual play is fun and relaxing, and more serious table tennis might further develop skills through focused practice. Methods A randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to determine how the practice of competition compared to leisure playing affects the Quality of life (QoL) of people aged 40-70. Selecting subjects at random, one group of subjects undertook a structured competitive regimen, whereas the other group was given time to play recreationally without any structured competition. QoL was measured before and after the intervention using the WHOQOL-BREF, which measures physical, psychological, social, and environmental domains. Data were analyzed using paired and independent t-test. Results The group that received structured competition reported a marked improvement in their QoL indicators, especially in physical health (p < 0.001), psychological health (p < 0.001), and social relationships (p = 0.001), when compared to the control group, which showed few improvements. No significant differences were observed in the environmental domains in either group. Conclusions Regular competitive table tennis practice improves physical condition, emotions, and social relationships, which leads to a higher QoL in older adults. Thus, these results emphasize the utility of competitive sports in the maintenance of active and healthy aging.

                Background Structuring data analysis projects, that is, defining the layout of files and folders needed to analyze data using existing tools and novel code, largely follows personal preferences. Open Science calls for more accessible, transparent and understandable research. We believe that Open Science principles can be applied to the way data analysis projects are structured. Methods We examine the structure of several data analysis project templates by analyzing project template repositories present in GitHub. Through visualization of the resulting consensus structure, we draw observations regarding how the ecosystem of project structures is shaped, and what salient characteristics it has. Results Project templates show little overlap, but many distinct practices can be highlighted. We take them into account with the wider Open Science philosophy to draw a few fundamental Design Principles to guide researchers when designing a project space. We present Kerblam!, a project management tool that can work with such a project structure to expedite data handling, execute workflow managers, and share the resulting workflow and analysis outputs with others. Conclusions We hope that, by following these principles and using Kerblam!, the landscape of data analysis projects can become more transparent, understandable, and ultimately useful to the wider community.

                The common, or spectacled, caiman Caiman crocodilus is an abundant, widely distributed Neotropical crocodilian exhibiting notable morphological and molecular diversification. As the type species for the Caimaninae subfamily - the sister taxa for the subfamily to which members of the genus Alligator belong - C. crocodilus occupies a key position in our understanding of crocodilian and archosaur genetics and evolution. The species also accounts by far for the largest share of crocodilian hides on the global market, with the C. crocodilus hide trade alone valued at about US$86.5 million per year. Thus, the genome sequence of C. crocodilus can potentially be of considerable use for both basic and applied research. We obtained 239,911,946 paired-end reads comprising approximately 72 G bases using Illumina TM sequencing of tissue sampled from a single Caiman crocodilus individual. These reads were de-novo assembled and progressively aligned against the genomes of increasingly related crocodilians; liftoff was used to annotate the draft C. crocodilus genome assembly based on an Alligator mississipiensis (a confamilial species) annotation. The draft C. crocodilus genome assembly and sequences reads have been deposited with the National Center for Biotechnology Information with accession numbers JAGPOW000000000.1 for the assembly, and SRR22317059 for the sequence read archives under Bioproject PRJNA716363.

                Background We present q2-boots, a QIIME 2 plugin that facilitates bootstrapped and rarefaction-based microbiome diversity analysis. This plugin provides eight new actions that allow users to apply any of thirty different alpha diversity metrics and twenty-two beta diversity metrics to bootstrapped or rarefied feature tables, using a single QIIME 2 Pipeline command, or more granular QIIME 2 Action commands. Results Given a feature table, an even sampling depth, and the number of iterations to perform (n), the command qiime boots core-metrics will resample the feature table n times and compute alpha and beta diversity metrics on each resampled table. The results will be integrated in summary data artifacts that are identical in structure and type to results that would be generated by applying diversity metrics to a single table. This enables all the same downstream analytic tools to be applied to these tables and ensures that all collected data is considered when computing microbiome diversity metrics. Conclusions A challenge of this work was deciding how to integrate distance matrices that were computed on n resampled feature tables, as a simple average of pairwise distances (median or mean) does not account for the structure of distance matrices. q2-boots provides three options, and we show here that the results of these approaches are highly correlated. q2-boots is free and open source. Source code can be found at https://github.com/caporaso-lab/q2-boots; installation instructions and a tutorial can be found in the project’s documentation at https://q2-boots.readthedocs.io.

                The emergence of antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens poses a significant threat to aquaculture and public health. This study presents the characterization of a novel bacteriophage, designated as Ursula, specifically targeting Citrobacter, a prominent pathogen affecting fish populations. We isolated Ursula from aquatic environments during a search for novel phages active against fish pathogens, and conducted a comprehensive analysis of its morphological, genomic, and lytic properties. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that Ursula has a myovirus morphology, being a rather large T4-like phage. Genomic sequencing identified a double-stranded linear DNA genome of approximately 183 kb, containing unique genes associated with lytic activity and host recognition. This phage is related to other T4-like Citrobacter phages, being a new species.

                <p>by Ankita Chavan, Lena Skrutl, Federico Uliana, Melanie Pfister, Franziska Brändle, Laszlo Tirian, Delora Baptista, Dominik Handler, David Burke, Anna Sintsova, Pedro Beltrao, Julius Brennecke, Madhav Jagannathan</p>

Noncoding satellite DNA repeats are abundant at the pericentromeric heterochromatin of eukaryotic chromosomes. During interphase, sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins cluster these repeats from multiple chromosomes into nuclear foci known as chromocenters. Despite the pivotal role of chromocenters in cellular processes like genome encapsulation and gene repression, the associated proteins remain incompletely characterized. Here, we use 2 satellite DNA-binding proteins, D1 and Prod, as baits to characterize the chromocenter-associated proteome in <i>Drosophila</i> embryos, ovaries, and testes through quantitative mass spectrometry. We identify D1- and Prod-associated proteins, including known heterochromatin proteins as well as proteins previously unlinked to satellite DNA or chromocenters, thereby laying the foundation for a comprehensive understanding of cellular functions enabled by satellite DNA repeats and their associated proteins. Interestingly, we find that multiple components of the transposon-silencing piRNA pathway are associated with D1 and Prod in embryos. Using genetics, transcriptomics, and small RNA profiling, we show that flies lacking D1 during embryogenesis exhibit transposon expression and gonadal atrophy as adults. We further demonstrate that this gonadal atrophy can be rescued by mutating the checkpoint kinase, <i>Chk2</i>, which mediates germ cell arrest in response to transposon mobilization. Thus, we reveal that a satellite DNA-binding protein functions during embryogenesis to silence transposons, in a manner that is heritable across later stages of development.

                Background The identification of an individual after mass calamities poses challenges to experts when bones are fragmented. Dense bones, such as the maxilla, surpass this challenge and remain intact with sinuses even after incineration, thereby making the sinuses an ideal and reliable forensic science tool. No-ninvasive imaging techniques, such as Computed Tomography (CT), can be used to evaluate such cases and help detect fractures and further locate foreign bodies. This study aimed to estimate the dimensions and volumes of the frontal (FS), maxillary (MS), and sphenoidal air sinuses (SS) on CT scans and investigate age- and sex-related differences. Methods CT scans of the paranasal sinuses were acquired from 158 patients ranging in age from 19 to 73 years, and written consent was obtained from all participants. This study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee (ethical clearance number IEC 064/2010). All parameters were statistically analyzed using SPSS 20 version and the significance level was set at p<0.05. Results The bilateral anteroposterior length and height of the FS were significantly larger in men than females (p<0.05). The overall dimensions of the MS and SS were substantially greater in males than females (P <0.05). Likewise, the overall volumes of the fFS, MS, and SS were significantly greater in males than females (p<0.05). However, no significant age-related correlation was observed in the dimensions and volumes of the sinuses. Conclusion The results of this study showed that imaging could be a reliable instrument for personal identification in forensic anthropology. Countries that do not allow autopsies may implement this method to clarify the cause of death.

                Background Anxiety and obesity can have negative impacts on the health of children. Understanding the relationship between obesity and mental disorders in children and adolescents will help develop effective prevention and intervention strategies. This research investigates the impact of anxiety-related emotional disorders and self-esteem on obesity among Chinese children aged 6-12 in Anhui Province. Methods Utilizing a non-experimental, cross-sectional study design, data were from 136 participants collected through standardized instrument measures from Chinese children: the “Chinese screening for overweight and obesity among school-age children and adolescents” in the “Health Industry Standards of the People’s Republic of China” as the standard for identifying obesity, the Screen for Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) for assessing anxiety disorder, and the Children’s Self-Esteem Scale (CSES) for evaluating self-esteem. Statistical analysis, including descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation analysis, and multiple regression analyses was performed using SPSS version 26 to determine the predictive relationships between the variables. Results The analysis revealed that anxiety-related emotional disorders and self-esteem contribute significantly to the prediction of obesity among Chinese children, accounting for a 13.7% variance. The study highlights the critical roles of anxiety-related emotional disorders and self-esteem in determining children’s obesity. It suggests that underscores the necessity for comprehensive interventions that address both physical and mental health aspects to combat childhood obesity effectively. The study concludes that addressing anxiety and self-esteem is essential for developing effective strategies to reduce obesity rates among Chinese children, meeting the research objectives, and contributing to the development of holistic health programs for children’s well-being.

                Background In-stent restenosis (ISR) remains a major drawback in coronary stenting. The association between the CYP2C19 loss of function (LOF) gene and the prevalence of ISR after coronary stenting remains controversial. Previous studies have produced conflicting results and have been limited by their small population sizes. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the association between the presence of the CYP2C19 LOF gene and the prevalence of ISR. Methods A systematic online database search was performed until April 2021. The primary outcome was ISR and assessed using OR with 95% CI. Quality of the study was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. I2 was applied to examine heterogeneities among the studies. Results A total of 284 patients (four non-randomized controlled trial studies) were included in this study. Two hundred and six patients had wild-type genotypes, while 78 patients had the LOF genotype. Among the 78 patients with the LOF gene, 38 patients had an ISR. Meanwhile, of the 206 patients with a wild-type gene, 69 patients had an ISR. LOF gene was associated with a higher risk of ISR (OR 95% CI = 2.71 [1.42–5.16], P = 0.003). However, study-specific variability should be considered when applying these findings clinically. Conclusions Patients with LOF genes, regardless of the allele variation, treated with clopidogrel, had a higher likelihood of ISR after coronary stenting.
