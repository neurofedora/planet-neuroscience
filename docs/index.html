              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03541">Do Mice Grok? Glimpses of Hidden Progress During Overtraining in Sensory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.03541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Does learning of task-relevant representations stop when behavior stops changing? Motivated by recent theoretical advances in machine learning and the intuitive observation that human experts continue to learn from practice even after mastery, we hypothesize that task-specific representation learning can continue, even when behavior plateaus. In a novel reanalysis of recently published neural data, we find evidence for such learning in posterior piriform cortex of mice following continued training on a task, long after behavior saturates at near-ceiling performance ("overtraining"). This learning is marked by an increase in decoding accuracy from piriform neural populations and improved performance on held-out generalization tests. We demonstrate that class representations in cortex continue to separate during overtraining, so that examples that were incorrectly classified at the beginning of overtraining can abruptly be correctly classified later on, despite no changes in behavior during that time. We hypothesize this hidden yet rich learning takes the form of approximate margin maximization; we validate this and other predictions in the neural data, as well as build and interpret a simple synthetic model that recapitulates these phenomena. We conclude by showing how this model of late-time feature learning implies an explanation for the empirical puzzle of overtraining reversal in animal learning, where task-specific representations are more robust to particular task changes because the learned features can be reused.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03630">RTify: Aligning Deep Neural Networks with Human Behavioral Decisions</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.03630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current neural network models of primate vision focus on replicating overall levels of behavioral accuracy, often neglecting perceptual decisions' rich, dynamic nature. Here, we introduce a novel computational framework to model the dynamics of human behavioral choices by learning to align the temporal dynamics of a recurrent neural network (RNN) to human reaction times (RTs). We describe an approximation that allows us to constrain the number of time steps an RNN takes to solve a task with human RTs. The approach is extensively evaluated against various psychophysics experiments. We also show that the approximation can be used to optimize an "ideal-observer" RNN model to achieve an optimal tradeoff between speed and accuracy without human data. The resulting model is found to account well for human RT data. Finally, we use the approximation to train a deep learning implementation of the popular Wong-Wang decision-making model. The model is integrated with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model of visual processing and evaluated using both artificial and natural image stimuli. Overall, we present a novel framework that helps align current vision models with human behavior, bringing us closer to an integrated model of human vision.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03840">Flexible task abstractions emerge in linear networks with fast and bounded units</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.03840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Animals survive in dynamic environments changing at arbitrary timescales, but such data distribution shifts are a challenge to neural networks. To adapt to change, neural systems may change a large number of parameters, which is a slow process involving forgetting past information. In contrast, animals leverage distribution changes to segment their stream of experience into tasks and associate them with internal task abstracts. Animals can then respond flexibly by selecting the appropriate task abstraction. However, how such flexible task abstractions may arise in neural systems remains unknown. Here, we analyze a linear gated network where the weights and gates are jointly optimized via gradient descent, but with neuron-like constraints on the gates including a faster timescale, nonnegativity, and bounded activity. We observe that the weights self-organize into modules specialized for tasks or sub-tasks encountered, while the gates layer forms unique representations that switch the appropriate weight modules (task abstractions). We analytically reduce the learning dynamics to an effective eigenspace, revealing a virtuous cycle: fast adapting gates drive weight specialization by protecting previous knowledge, while weight specialization in turn increases the update rate of the gating layer. Task switching in the gating layer accelerates as a function of curriculum block size and task training, mirroring key findings in cognitive neuroscience. We show that the discovered task abstractions support generalization through both task and subtask composition, and we extend our findings to a non-linear network switching between two tasks. Overall, our work offers a theory of cognitive flexibility in animals as arising from joint gradient descent on synaptic and neural gating in a neural network architecture.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00982">The Dynamics of Triple Interactions in Resting fMRI: Insights into Psychotic Disorders</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.00982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The human brain dynamically integrated and configured information to adapt to the environment. To capture these changes over time, dynamic second-order functional connectivity was typically used to capture transient brain patterns. However, dynamic second-order functional connectivity typically ignored interactions beyond pairwise relationships. To address this limitation, we utilized dynamic triple interactions to investigate multiscale network interactions in the brain. In this study, we evaluated a resting-state fMRI dataset that included individuals with psychotic disorders (PD). We first estimated dynamic triple interactions using resting-state fMRI. After clustering, we estimated cohort-specific and cohort-common states for controls (CN), schizophrenia (SZ), and schizoaffective disorder (SAD). From the cohort-specific states, we observed significant triple interactions, particularly among visual, subcortical, and somatomotor networks, as well as temporal and higher cognitive networks in SZ. In SAD, key interactions involved temporal networks in the initial state and somatomotor networks in subsequent states. From the cohort-common states, we observed that high-cognitive networks were primarily involved in SZ and SAD compared to CN. Furthermore, the most significant differences between SZ and SAD also existed in high-cognitive networks. In summary, we studied PD using dynamic triple interaction, the first time such an approach has been used to study PD. Our findings highlighted the significant potential of dynamic high-order functional connectivity, paving the way for new avenues in the study of the healthy and disordered human brain.

                arXiv:2411.00992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To understand collective network behavior in the complex human brain, pairwise correlation networks alone are insufficient for capturing the high-order interactions that extend beyond pairwise interactions and play a crucial role in brain network dynamics. These interactions often reveal intricate relationships among multiple brain networks, significantly influencing cognitive processes. In this study, we explored the correlation of correlation networks and topological network analysis with resting-state fMRI to gain deeper insights into these higher-order interactions and their impact on the topology of brain networks, ultimately enhancing our understanding of brain function. We observed that the correlation of correlation networks highlighted network connections while preserving the topological structure of correlation networks. Our findings suggested that the correlation of correlation networks surpassed traditional correlation networks, showcasing considerable potential for applications in various areas of network science. Moreover, after applying topological network analysis to the correlation of correlation networks, we observed that some high-order interaction hubs predominantly occurred in primary and high-level cognitive areas, such as the visual and fronto-parietal regions. These high-order hubs played a crucial role in information integration within the human brain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03324">A Surrogate Model for Quay Crane Scheduling Problem</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.03324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ports, a variety of tasks are carried out, and scheduling these tasks is crucial due to its significant impact on productivity, making the generation of precise plans essential. This study proposes a method to solve the Quay Crane Scheduling Problem (QCSP), a representative task scheduling problem in ports known to be NP-Hard, more quickly and accurately. First, the study suggests a method to create more accurate work plans for Quay Cranes (QCs) by learning from actual port data to accurately predict the working speed of QCs. Next, a Surrogate Model is proposed by combining a Machine Learning (ML) model with a Genetic Algorithm (GA), which is widely used to solve complex optimization problems, enabling faster and more precise exploration of solutions. Unlike methods that use fixed-dimensional chromosome encoding, the proposed methodology can provide solutions for encodings of various dimensions. To validate the performance of the newly proposed methodology, comparative experiments were conducted, demonstrating faster search speeds and improved fitness scores. The method proposed in this study can be applied not only to QCSP but also to various NP-Hard problems, and it opens up possibilities for the further development of advanced search algorithms by combining heuristic algorithms with ML models.

                arXiv:2411.03588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic flow forecasting is a crucial task in intelligent transport systems. Deep learning offers an effective solution, capturing complex patterns in time-series traffic flow data to enable the accurate prediction. However, deep learning models are prone to overfitting the intricate details of flow data, leading to poor generalisation. Recent studies suggest that decomposition-based deep ensemble learning methods may address this issue by breaking down a time series into multiple simpler signals, upon which deep learning models are built and ensembled to generate the final prediction. However, few studies have compared the performance of decomposition-based ensemble methods with non-decomposition-based ones which directly utilise raw time-series data. This work compares several decomposition-based and non-decomposition-based deep ensemble learning methods. Experimental results on three traffic datasets demonstrate the superiority of decomposition-based ensemble methods, while also revealing their sensitivity to aggregation strategies and forecasting horizons.

                arXiv:2411.03604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A computational problem in biological reward-based learning is how credit assignment is performed in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Much research suggests that NAc dopamine encodes temporal-difference (TD) errors for learning value predictions. However, dopamine is synchronously distributed in regionally homogeneous concentrations, which does not support explicit credit assignment (like used by backpropagation). It is unclear whether distributed errors alone are sufficient for synapses to make coordinated updates to learn complex, nonlinear reward-based learning tasks. We design a new deep Q-learning algorithm, Artificial Dopamine, to computationally demonstrate that synchronously distributed, per-layer TD errors may be sufficient to learn surprisingly complex RL tasks. We empirically evaluate our algorithm on MinAtar, the DeepMind Control Suite, and classic control tasks, and show it often achieves comparable performance to deep RL algorithms that use backpropagation.

                arXiv:2411.03726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce PropNEAT, a fast backpropagation implementation of NEAT that uses a bidirectional mapping of the genome graph to a layer-based architecture that preserves the NEAT genomes whilst enabling efficient GPU backpropagation. We test PropNEAT on 58 binary classification datasets from the Penn Machine Learning Benchmarks database, comparing the performance against logistic regression, dense neural networks and random forests, as well as a densely retrained variant of the final PropNEAT model. PropNEAT had the second best overall performance, behind Random Forest, though the difference between the models was not statistically significant apart from between Random Forest in comparison with logistic regression and the PropNEAT retrain models. PropNEAT was substantially faster than a naive backpropagation method, and both were substantially faster and had better performance than the original NEAT implementation. We demonstrate that the per-epoch training time for PropNEAT scales linearly with network depth, and is efficient on GPU implementations for backpropagation. This implementation could be extended to support reinforcement learning or convolutional networks, and is able to find sparser and smaller networks with potential for applications in low-power contexts.

Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities of text-to-audio music generation models in producing long-form music with prompts that change over time, focusing on soundtrack generation for Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TRPGs). We introduce Babel Bardo, a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform speech transcriptions into music descriptions for controlling a text-to-music model. Four versions of Babel Bardo were compared in two TRPG campaigns: a baseline using direct speech transcriptions, and three LLM-based versions with varying approaches to music description generation. Evaluations considered audio quality, story alignment, and transition smoothness. Results indicate that detailed music descriptions improve audio quality while maintaining consistency across consecutive descriptions enhances story alignment and transition smoothness.

Abstract: We present a novel software feature for the BrainScaleS-2 accelerated neuromorphic platform that facilitates the partitioned emulation of large-scale spiking neural networks. This approach is well suited for deep spiking neural networks and allows for sequential model emulation on undersized neuromorphic resources if the largest recurrent subnetwork and the required neuron fan-in fit on the substrate. The ability to emulate and train networks larger than the substrate provides a pathway for accurate performance evaluation in planned or scaled systems, ultimately advancing the development and understanding of large-scale models and neuromorphic computing architectures. We demonstrate the training of two deep spiking neural network models -- using the MNIST and EuroSAT datasets -- that exceed the physical size constraints of a single-chip BrainScaleS-2 system.

                arXiv:2410.24081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization problems are characterized by an interactive hierarchical structure, where the upper level seeks to optimize its strategy while simultaneously considering the response of the lower level. Evolutionary algorithms are commonly used to solve complex bilevel problems in practical scenarios, but they face significant resource consumption challenges due to the nested structure imposed by the implicit lower-level optimality condition. This challenge becomes even more pronounced as problem dimensions increase. Although recent methods have enhanced bilevel convergence through task-level knowledge sharing, further efficiency improvements are still hindered by redundant lower-level iterations that consume excessive resources while generating unpromising solutions. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes an efficient dynamic resource allocation framework for evolutionary bilevel optimization, named DRC-BLEA. Compared to existing approaches, DRC-BLEA introduces a novel competitive quasi-parallel paradigm, in which multiple lower-level optimization tasks, derived from different upper-level individuals, compete for resources. A continuously updated selection probability is used to prioritize execution opportunities to promising tasks. Additionally, a cooperation mechanism is integrated within the competitive framework to further enhance efficiency and prevent premature convergence. Experimental results compared with chosen state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, DRC-BLEA achieves competitive accuracy across diverse problem sets and real-world scenarios, while significantly reducing the number of function evaluations and overall running time.

                arXiv:2404.07724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Guidance is a crucial technique for extracting the best performance out of image-generating diffusion models. Traditionally, a constant guidance weight has been applied throughout the sampling chain of an image. We show that guidance is clearly harmful toward the beginning of the chain (high noise levels), largely unnecessary toward the end (low noise levels), and only beneficial in the middle. We thus restrict it to a specific range of noise levels, improving both the inference speed and result quality. This limited guidance interval improves the record FID in ImageNet-512 significantly, from 1.81 to 1.40. We show that it is quantitatively and qualitatively beneficial across different sampler parameters, network architectures, and datasets, including the large-scale setting of Stable Diffusion XL. We thus suggest exposing the guidance interval as a hyperparameter in all diffusion models that use guidance.

                arXiv:2406.16619v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) analysis has been widely applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to reveal time-varying dynamic changes of brain states. The sliding window method is by far the most popular DFC analysis method due to its simplicity. However, the sliding window method comes with some assumptions, namely the typically approach uses a single window which captures dynamics only within a specific frequency range. In this study, we propose a generalized approach to dynamics via a multi-dimensional random convolution (RandCon) DFC method that is able to effectively capture time-varying DFC at arbitrary time scales by extracting different local features from fMRI time series using a number of multi-dimensional random convolution kernels without the need for learning kernel weights. Compared to a standard sliding window method, multiplication of temporal derivatives (MTD) and phase synchrony methods, RandCon with the smallest kernel size (3 time points) showed notable improvements in performance on simulated data, particularly in terms of DFC temporal and spatial estimation in very short window/kernel size under different noise levels. Results from real fMRI data indicated that RandCon was more sensitive to gender differences than competing methods. Furthermore, we show that the sliding window method can be considered a special case of the proposed multi-dimensional convolution framework. The proposed method is simple and efficient significantly broadens the scope of dynamic functional connectivity research and offer theoretical and practical potential.

                <p>Each olfactory cortical hemisphere receives ipsilateral odor information directly from the olfactory bulb and contralateral information indirectly from the other cortical hemisphere. Since neural projections to the olfactory cortex (OC) are disordered and nontopographic, spatial information cannot be used to align projections from the two sides like in the visual cortex. Therefore, how bilateral information is integrated in individual cortical neurons is unknown. We have found, in mice, that the odor responses of individual neurons to selective stimulation of each of the two nostrils are significantly correlated, such that odor identity decoding optimized with information arriving from one nostril transfers very well to the other side. Nevertheless, these aligned responses are asymmetric enough to allow decoding of stimulus laterality. Computational analysis shows that such matched odor tuning is incompatible with purely random connections but is explained readily by Hebbian plasticity structuring bilateral connectivity. Our data reveal that despite the distributed and fragmented sensory representation in the OC, odor information across the two hemispheres is highly coordinated.</p>

                <p>Age-related brain changes affect sleep and are reflected in properties of sleep slow-waves, however, the precise mechanisms behind these changes are still not completely understood. Here, we adapt a previously established whole-brain model relating structural connectivity changes to resting state dynamics, and extend it to a slow-wave sleep brain state. In particular, starting from a representative connectome at the beginning of the aging trajectory, we have gradually reduced the inter-hemispheric connections, and simulated sleep-like slow-wave activity. We show that the main empirically observed trends, namely a decrease in duration and increase in variability of the slow waves are captured by the model. Furthermore, comparing the simulated EEG activity to the source signals, we suggest that the empirically observed decrease in amplitude of the slow waves is caused by the decrease in synchrony between brain regions.</p>

                <p>The neural network, including the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC), functions as an oculomotor neural integrator involved in the control of vertical gaze holding. Impairment of the vestibulocerebellum (VC), including the flocculus (FL), has been shown to affect vertical gaze holding, indicating that the INC cooperates with the VC in controlling this function. However, a network between the INC and VC has not been identified. In this study, we aimed to obtain anatomical evidence of a neural pathway from the INC to the VC (the INC-VC pathway) in rats. Injection of dextran-conjugated Alexa Fluor 488 or adeno-associated virus 2-retro (AAV2retro) expressing GFP into the FL or another VC region (uvula/nodulus) did not reveal any retrogradely labeled neurons in the INC, suggesting that INC neurons do not project directly to the VC. Rabies virus-based transsynaptic tracing experiments revealed that the INC-VC pathway is mediated via synaptic connections with the prepositus hypoglossi nucleus (PHN) and medial vestibular nucleus (MVN). The INC neurons in the INC-VC pathway were mainly localized bilaterally within the rostral region of the INC. Transsynaptic tracing experiments involving the INC-FL pathway revealed that INC neurons connected to the FL via the bilateral PHN and MVN. These results indicate that the INC-VC pathway is not a direct pathway but is mediated via the PHN and MVN. These findings can provide clues for understanding the network mechanisms responsible for vertical gaze holding.</p>

                <p>Experience- and activity-dependent transcription is a candidate mechanism to mediate development and refinement of specific cortical circuits. Here, we demonstrate that the activity-dependent transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) is required in both presynaptic layer (L) 4 and postsynaptic L2/3 mouse (male and female) somatosensory (S1) cortical neurons for development of this specific synaptic connection. While postsynaptic deletion of <I>Mef2c</I> weakens L4 synaptic inputs, it has no effect on inputs from local L2/3, contralateral S1, or the ipsilateral frontal/motor cortex. Similarly, homozygous or heterozygous deletion of <I>Mef2c</I> in presynaptic L4 neurons weakens L4 to L2/3 excitatory synaptic inputs by decreasing presynaptic release probability. Postsynaptic MEF2C is specifically required during an early postnatal, experience-dependent, period for L4 to L2/3 synapse function, and expression of transcriptionally active MEF2C (MEF2C-VP16) rescues weak L4 to L2/3 synaptic strength in sensory-deprived mice. Together, these results suggest that experience- and/or activity-dependent transcriptional activation of MEF2C promotes development of L4 to L2/3 synapses. Additionally, MEF2C regulates the expression of many pre- and postsynaptic genes in postnatal cortical neurons. Interestingly, MEF2C was necessary for activity-dependent expression of many presynaptic genes, including those that function in transsynaptic adhesion and neurotransmitter release. This work provides mechanistic insight into the experience-dependent development of specific cortical circuits.</p>

                <p>Impaired inhibitory synapse development is suggested to drive neuronal hyperactivity in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and epilepsy. We propose a novel mechanism by which astrocytes control the development of parvalbumin (PV)-specific inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus, implicating ephrin-B/EphB signaling. Here, we utilize genetic approaches to assess functional and structural connectivity between PV and pyramidal cells (PCs) through whole-cell patch&ndash;clamp electrophysiology, optogenetics, immunohistochemical analysis, and behaviors in male and female mice. While inhibitory synapse development is adversely affected by PV-specific expression of EphB2, a strong candidate ASD risk gene, astrocytic ephrin-B1 facilitates PV-&gt;PC connectivity through a mechanism involving EphB signaling in PV boutons. In contrast, the loss of astrocytic ephrin-B1 reduces PV-&gt;PC connectivity and inhibition, resulting in increased seizure susceptibility and an ASD-like phenotype. Our findings underscore the crucial role of astrocytes in regulating inhibitory circuit development and discover a new role of EphB2 receptors in PV-specific inhibitory synapse development.</p>

                <p>The precise regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals plays a crucial role in the physiological functions of neurons. Here, we investigated the rapid effect of glucocorticoids on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in cultured hippocampal neurons from both female and male rats. In cultured hippocampal neurons, glucocorticoids inhibited the spontaneous somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes generated by Kv2.1-organized Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains. Furthermore, glucocorticoids rapidly reduced the cell surface expressions of Kv2.1 and Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1.2 channels in hippocampal neurons. In HEK293 cells transfected with Kv2.1 alone, glucocorticoids significantly reduced the surface expression of Kv2.1 with little effect on K<sup>+</sup> currents. In HEK293 cells transfected with Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1.2 alone, glucocorticoids inhibited Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1.2 currents but had no effect on the cell surface expression of Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1.2. Notably, in the presence of wild-type Kv2.1, glucocorticoids caused a decrease in the surface expression of Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1.2 channels in HEK293 cells. However, this effect was not observed in the presence of nonclustering Kv2.1S586A mutant channels. Live-cell imaging showed that glucocorticoids rapidly decreased Kv2.1 clusters on the plasma membrane. Correspondingly, Western blot results indicated a significant increase in the cytoplasmic level of Kv2.1, suggesting the endocytosis of Kv2.1 clusters. Glucocorticoids rapidly decreased the intracellular cAMP concentration and the phosphorylation level of PKA in hippocampal neurons. The PKA inhibitor H89 mimicked the effect of glucocorticoids on Kv2.1, while the PKA agonist forskolin abrogated the effect. In conclusion, glucocorticoids rapidly suppress Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1.2-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in hippocampal neurons by promoting the endocytosis of Kv2.1 channel clusters through reducing PKA activity.</p>

                <p>Different people listening to the same story may converge upon a largely shared interpretation while still developing idiosyncratic experiences atop that shared foundation. What linguistic properties support this individualized experience of natural language? Here, we investigate how the "concrete&ndash;abstract" axis&mdash;the extent to which a word is grounded in sensory experience&mdash;relates to within- and across-subject variability in the neural representations of language. Leveraging a dataset of human participants of both sexes who each listened to four auditory stories while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate that neural representations of "concreteness" are both reliable across stories and relatively unique to individuals, while neural representations of "abstractness" are variable both within individuals and across the population. Using natural language processing tools, we show that concrete words exhibit similar neural representations despite spanning larger distances within a high-dimensional semantic space, which potentially reflects an underlying representational signature of sensory experience&mdash;namely, imageability&mdash;shared by concrete words but absent from abstract words. Our findings situate the concrete&ndash;abstract axis as a core dimension that supports both shared and individualized representations of natural language.</p>

                <p>Estimating the direction of functional connectivity (FC) can help further elucidate complex brain function. However, the estimation of directed FC at the voxel level in fMRI data, and evaluating its performance, has yet to be done. We therefore developed a novel directed seed-based connectivity analysis (SCA) method based on normalized pairwise Granger causality that provides greater detail and accuracy over ROI-based methods. We evaluated its performance against 145 cortical retrograde tracer injections in male and female marmosets that were used as ground truth cellular connectivity on a voxel-by-voxel basis. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated for each injection, and we achieved area under the ROC curve of 0.95 for undirected and 0.942 for directed SCA in the case of high cell count threshold. This indicates that SCA can reliably estimate the strong cellular connections between voxels in fMRI data. We then used our directed SCA method to analyze the human default mode network (DMN) and found that dlPFC (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and temporal lobe were separated from other DMN regions, forming part of the language-network that works together with the core DMN regions. We also found that the cerebellum (Crus I-II) was strongly targeted by the posterior parietal cortices and dlPFC, but reciprocal connections were not observed. Thus, the cerebellum may not be a part of, but instead a target of, the DMN and language-network. Summarily, our novel directed SCA method, visualized with a new functional flat mapping technique, opens a new paradigm for whole-brain functional analysis.</p>

                <p>Hyperbilirubinemia (HB) is a key risk factor for hearing loss in neonates, particularly premature infants. Here, we report that bilirubin (BIL)-dependent cell death in the auditory brainstem of neonatal mice of both sexes is significantly attenuated by ZD7288, a blocker for hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel-mediated current (<I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB>), or by genetic deletion of HCN1. GABAergic inhibitory interneurons predominantly express HCN1, on which BIL selectively acts to increase their intrinsic excitability and mortality by enhancing HCN1 activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent membrane targeting. Chronic BIL elevation in neonatal mice in vivo increases the fraction of spontaneously active interneurons and their firing frequency, <I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB>, and death, compromising audition at the young adult stage in HCN1<sup>+/+</sup>, but not in HCN1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> genotype. We conclude that HB preferentially targets HCN1 to injure inhibitory interneurons, fueling a feedforward loop in which lessening inhibition cascades hyperexcitability, Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload, neuronal death, and auditory impairments. These findings rationalize HCN1 as a potential target for managing HB encephalopathy.</p>

                <p>Systemic study of pathogenic pathways and interrelationships underlying genes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) facilitates the identification of new targets for effective treatments. Recently available large-scale multiomics datasets provide opportunities to use computational approaches for such studies. Here, we devised a novel <unl>di</unl>sease <unl>g</unl>ene <unl>id</unl>entification (digID) computational framework that consists of a semi-supervised deep learning classifier to predict AD-associated genes and a protein&ndash;protein interaction (PPI) network-based analysis to prioritize the importance of these predicted genes in AD. digID predicted 1,529 AD-associated genes and revealed potentially new AD molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets including GNAI1 and GNB1, two G-protein subunits that regulate cell signaling, and KNG1, an upstream modulator of CDC42 small G-protein signaling and mediator of inflammation and candidate coregulator of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Analysis of mRNA expression validated their dysregulation in AD brains but further revealed the significant spatial patterns in different brain regions as well as among different subregions of the frontal cortex and hippocampi. Super-resolution STochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) further demonstrated their subcellular colocalization and molecular interactions with APP in a transgenic mouse model of both sexes with AD-like mutations. These studies support the predictions made by digID while highlighting the importance of concurrent biological validation of computationally identified gene clusters as potential new AD therapeutic targets.</p>

                <p>Words offer a unique opportunity to separate the processing mechanisms of object subcomponents from those of the whole object, because the phonological or semantic information provided by the word subcomponents (i.e., sublexical information) can conflict with that provided by the whole word (i.e., lexical information). Previous studies have revealed some of the specific brain regions and temporal information involved in sublexical information processing. However, a comprehensive spatiotemporal neural network for sublexical processing remains to be fully elucidated due to the low temporal or spatial resolutions of previous neuroimaging studies. In this study, we recorded stereoelectroencephalography signals with high spatial and temporal resolutions from a large sample of 39 epilepsy patients (both sexes) during a Chinese character oral reading task. We explored the activated brain regions and their connectivity related to three sublexical effects: phonological regularity (whether the whole character's pronunciation aligns with its phonetic radical), phonological consistency (whether characters with the same phonetic radical share the same pronunciation), and semantic transparency (whether the whole character's meaning aligns with its semantic radical). The results revealed that sublexical effects existed in the inferior frontal gyrus, precentral and postcentral gyri, temporal lobe, and middle occipital gyrus. Additionally, connectivity from the middle occipital gyrus to the postcentral gyrus and from postcentral gyrus to the fusiform gyrus was associated with the sublexical effects. These findings provide valuable insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of sublexical processing and object recognition in the brain.</p>

                <p>Plasticity in the subcortical motor basal ganglia&ndash;thalamo&ndash;cerebellar network plays a key role in the acquisition and control of long-term memory for new procedural skills, from the formation of population trajectories controlling trained motor skills in the striatum to the adaptation of sensorimotor maps in the cerebellum. However, recent findings demonstrate the involvement of a wider cortical and subcortical brain network in the consolidation and control of well-trained actions, including a brain region traditionally associated with declarative memory&mdash;the hippocampus. Here, we probe which role these subcortical areas play in skilled motor sequence control, from sequence feature selection during planning to their integration during sequence execution. An fMRI dataset (<I>N</I> = 24; 14 females) collected after participants learnt to produce four finger press sequences entirely from memory with high movement and timing accuracy over several days was examined for both changes in BOLD activity and their informational content in subcortical regions of interest. Although there was a widespread activity increase in effector-related striatal, thalamic, and cerebellar regions, in particular during sequence execution, the associated activity did not contain information on the motor sequence identity. In contrast, hippocampal activity increased during planning and predicted the order of the upcoming sequence of movements. Our findings suggest that the hippocampus preorders movements for skilled action sequences, thus contributing to the higher-order control of skilled movements that require flexible retrieval. These findings challenge the traditional taxonomy of episodic and procedural memory and carry implications for the rehabilitation of individuals with neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

                <p>Key event-related potentials (ERPs) of perceptual decision-making such as centroparietal positivity (CPP) elucidate how evidence is accumulated toward a given choice. Furthermore, this accumulation can be impacted by visual target selection signals such as the N2 contralateral (N2c). How these underlying neural mechanisms of perceptual decision-making are influenced by the spatial congruence of distractors relative to target stimuli remains unclear. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) in humans of both sexes to investigate the effect of distractor spatial congruency (same vs different hemifield relative to targets) on perceptual decision-making. We confirmed that responses for perceptual decisions were slower for spatially incongruent versus congruent distractors of high salience. Similarly, markers of target selection (N2c peak amplitude) and evidence accumulation (CPP slope) were found to be lower when distractors were spatially incongruent versus congruent. To evaluate the effects of congruency further, we applied drift diffusion modeling to participant responses, which showed that larger amplitudes of both ERPs were correlated with shorter nondecision times when considering the effect of congruency. The modeling also suggested that congruency's effect on behavior occurred prior to and during evidence accumulation when considering the effects of the N2c peak and CPP slope. These findings point to spatially incongruent distractors, relative to congruent distractors, influencing decisions as early as the initial sensory processing phase and then continuing to exert an effect as evidence is accumulated throughout the decision-making process. Overall, our findings highlight how key electrophysiological signals of perceptual decision-making are influenced by the spatial congruence of target and distractor.</p>

                Background Aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD) or Leriche syndrome, is a form of peripheral arterial disease involving the infrarenal aorta and iliac arteries. The presentation of AIOD ranges from asymptomatic cases to limb-threatening emergencies. Advances and innovations in endovascular devices have replaced traditional surgical interventions for the management of AIOD. Here we report a case of a 52-year-old man presenting with AIOD managed by endovascular approach using kissing stent technique. Case presentation A 52-year-old man, with history of chronic coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, long-standing hypertension, and a significant history of smoking, was admitted to our hospital with symptoms of long-standing bilateral claudication which recently progressed to rest pain. A history of AIOD was previously established. AIOD (TASC II Type D) diagnosis was made by lower extremity duplex ultrasound and CT angiography. The patient underwent urgent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with kissing stent technique. The patient was discharged 4 days after the procedure without any significant complaints, received best medical therapy. Conclusion Endovascular interventions present excellent alternatives to surgical techniques in the treatment of complex AIOD. Herein we presented an endovascular treatment of AIOD utilizing the kissing stent technique which showed satisfactory outcomes.

                Background The population is increasingly demanding a better quality of life in their territories, which requires better urban planning. This study aims to find out the effectiveness of urban planning implemented by local governments on citizen satisfaction. Method A systematic literature review was conducted exploring the evolution of the state-of-the-art databases in Scopus, WOS and Dimensions, involving a relevant selection of empirical studies on the effectiveness of urban planning on citizen satisfaction, using quality criteria and the application of the PRISMA diagram. Results The findings in the various empirical contributions find converging in three main blocks the contributions related to: (i) Urban planning as a catalyst for the impact of citizen satisfaction, given that using the planning tool will lead to the development of local policies based on the Neoliberalism approach for smart urban development; (ii) Theoretical contributions for urban planning that contextualises a modernist planning based on a multidimensional aspect to address quality of life for modern well-being and (iii) Smart planning for citizen satisfaction for the design and implementation of public governance reforms aimed at optimising urban planning management at the local level for smart urban city development. Conclusion There is strong theoretical and empirical support that is closely linked to sustainable development, happiness, public space, urban growth, urban areas, satisfied customers and urban residents. Future research should examine the relative weight of urban planning dimensions and effectiveness in the sustainable development of territories and citizen satisfaction.

                Background The objective of this systematic review was to analyze the effects of physical activity (PA) intervention as an adjuvant strategy to pharmacological treatment in people with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and non-remitted depression (NRD). Methods A search strategy was realized from five databases: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database and Oxford’s Evidence Levels were used to classify the quality appraisal. Results Of the 10777 records, 11 randomized controlled studies attained the inclusion criteria. The more significant outcome for this analysis was the improvement of depression by PA or exercise in TRD and NRD. According to the FITT (Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type) principle, there was some variability in the PA intervention, and except for one article, they all were classified as excellent in terms of quality description. Conclusions This review highlights the potential of PA intervention as an adjuvant program to improve different traits of TRD and NRD. The remission of depression seems to be higher after PA intervention, showing improvements in quality of life, sleep quality, executive function, and vitality.

                Complexities in obturation and difficulties in disinfection are the major problems that make endodontic treatment very time-consuming. A new perspective is needed to reduce the working time as well as to answer these two problems. Until now, none of the established obturation techniques for root canal filling can guarantee a perfect seal. Solid substances cannot be manipulated easily to fill the tiny branches of the root canal system hermetically. At the same time, anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, especially Enterococcus faecalis, are very dominant in endodontic infections discussion. As shown in many studies, it is extremely difficult to perfectly disinfect Enterococcus faecalis even by using some irrigating solutions with strong antibacterial properties. Under anaerobic conditions, the invasion efficiency of facultative anaerobes is increased. In case irrigation and disinfection cannot totally eliminate anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, a new strategy is also needed to deal with the bacteria that still survive in the root canal. Oxygen can fill the root canal system with ease, eliminate anaerobes, and prevent facultative anaerobes from being pathogenic. Therefore, using oxygen as obturation biomaterial after proper cleaning and shaping procedures is expected to solve the two major endodontic problems. The aim of this article was to discuss a new possible concept of dental restoration system that uses an oxygen-permeable membrane to decrease the time required in endodontic treatment. The membrane is placed at the orifice of a duct created to connect the entire root canal system with free air outside the restoration. The function of the membrane is more or less similar to the mask used during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it enables the oxygen to circulate while preventing any fluid, debris, and microorganisms from passing. We hypothesize that the oxygen circulating in the root canal system will also act as an antimicrobial agent that is constantly renewed.

                Background Endovascular repair for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) has been the gold standard since it was established in 1991. Various graft configurations have been developed to overcome the limitations of endovascular aortic repair (EVAR), including contralateral gate cannulation (CGC). We propose a new device and technique intended to simplify endovascular AAA repair, along with reports of its application in six patients. Intervention The Taofan and Kang (T&K) bidirectional endovascular aortic repair (B-EVAR (B-EVAR) device uses a main-body stent graft, two-limb extensions, and bare metal stent. The procedure involved accessing the right and left femoral arteries, followed by standard aortography evaluation using a pigtail catheter through the contralateral femoral access. The main body stent graft is deployed through ipsilateral femoral access using a balloon catheter, while the contralateral gate is cannulated with a hydrophilic coated wire. Both balloons were inflated simultaneously to ensure that the wires were in different lumens. Contralateral and ipsilateral extensions were deployed using a limb extension stent graft. Standard aortography evaluation was repeated. Result T&K B-EVAR pilot procedures proved successful in various cases, from simple to complex anatomy, and even with varied graft stent deployment strategies. None of the patients had complications or prolonged length of stay (LOS). Follow-up CT did not reveal any high-pressure endoleaks. Conclusion T&K B-EVAR has been proven to simplify endovascular AAA repair in six patients with excellent results. It is also reproducible, potentially universally applicable, and can offer operators ease of use, faster procedure times, reduced fluoroscopy times, and reduced contrast usage.

                Background Excess nitrogen (N) loading to coastal ecosystems impairs estuarine water quality. Land management decisions made within estuarine watersheds have a direct impact on downstream N delivery. Natural features within watersheds can act as landscape sinks for N, such as wetlands, streams and ponds that transform dissolved N into gaseous N, effectively removing it from the aquatic system. Identifying and evaluating these landscape sinks and their spatial relationship to N sources can help managers understand the effects of alternative decisions on downstream resources. Methods The N-Sink approach uses widely available GIS data to identify landscape sinks within HUC-12 (or larger) catchments, estimate their N removal potential and map the effect of those sinks on N movement through the catchment. Static maps are produced to visualize N removal efficiency, transport and delivery, the latter in the form of an index. The R package nsink was developed to facilitate data acquisition, processing and visualization. Results nsink creates static maps for a specific HUC-12, or users can visit the University of Connecticut website to explore previously mapped areas. Users can investigate specific flowpaths interactively by clicking on any location within the catchment. A flowpath is generated with a table describing N removal along each segment. We describe the motivation behind developing nsink, discuss implementation in R, and present two use case examples. nsink is available from https://github.com/USEPA/nsink. Conclusions N-Sink is a decision support tool created for local decision-makers and NGOs to facilitate better understanding of the relationship between land use and downstream N delivery. Local decision-makers that have prioritized N mitigation in their long-term planning can use nsink to better understand the potential impact of proposed development projects, zoning variances, and land acquisition or restoration. nsink also allows resource economists to investigate the tradeoffs among different, often costly, N reduction strategies.

                Background Globally, neonatal deaths are significantly attributed to hypothermia. This is mostly because of its co-morbidity with asphyxia, premature birth and severe neonatal infections. Worldwide, neonatal hypothermia case fatality rates (CFRs) range from 8.5% to 52%. This study aimed to assess how well a video-based training intervention on mothers’ knowledge and practices in preventing neonatal hypothermia worked. Methods The knowledge and practices of two groups of primi-para mothers—one control group and one intervention group—were compared in order to achieve this. A total of 124 primipara mothers took part in the research. Using a video based tool, the intervention group was educated about preventing hypothermia in newborns. Both control and intervention group mothers were interviewed to compare the knowledge and practices. Results Sixty-one of the sixty-two mothers in the control group were unsure of which body area to cover in order to preserve the baby’s body heat. Following the intervention, 61 out of 62 mothers in the group recognised which body part to cover to protect the baby’s body heat. In the post-intervention group, 98.4% of moms wore a cap over their baby’s head, compared to just 35.5% in the control group. Conclusion The results of this study demonstrate the significant improvement in mothers’ knowledge and actions about the prevention of neonatal hypothermia resulting from the use of a video-based training tool.

                <p>by John H. Tay, Arthur Kocher, Sebastian Duchene</p>

Our understanding of the evolution of many microbes has been revolutionised by the molecular clock, a statistical tool to infer evolutionary rates and timescales from analyses of biomolecular sequences. In all molecular clock models, evolutionary rates and times are jointly unidentifiable and ‘calibration’ information must therefore be used. For many organisms, sequences sampled at different time points can be employed for such calibration. Before attempting to do so, it is recommended to verify that the data carry sufficient information for molecular dating, a practice referred to as evaluation of temporal signal. Recently, a fully Bayesian approach, BETS (Bayesian Evaluation of Temporal Signal), was proposed to overcome known limitations of other commonly used techniques such as root-to-tip regression or date randomisation tests. BETS requires the specification of a full Bayesian phylogenetic model, posing several considerations for untangling the impact of model choice on the detection of temporal signal. Here, we aimed to (i) explore the effect of molecular clock model and tree prior specification on the results of BETS and (ii) provide guidelines for improving our confidence in molecular clock estimates. Using microbial molecular sequence data sets and simulation experiments, we assess the impact of the tree prior and its hyperparameters on the accuracy of temporal signal detection. In particular, highly informative priors that are inconsistent with the data can result in the incorrect detection of temporal signal. In consequence, we recommend: (i) using prior predictive simulations to determine whether the prior generates a reasonable expectation of parameters of interest, such as the evolutionary rate and age of the root node, (ii) conducting prior sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the posterior to the choice of prior, and (iii) selecting a molecular clock model that reasonably describes the evolutionary process.

Prolyl-4-hydroxylase subunit alpha3 (P4HA3) is a triple helical procollagen synthesis protein. The role of P4HA3 in cancer development is not well known and lacks comprehensive analyses among human cancers. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between P4HA3 expression and anti-tumor immunity and its prognostic value in pan-cancer. P4HA3 expression was analyzed from TIMER2.0, GTEx, GEPIA2.0 and TCGA databases. Genetic and DNA methylation alterations, survival analysis and proteins co-expression analysis of P4HA3 in cBio Cancer Genomics Portal, TCGA, GSCA and TIMER2.0. The correlation between P4HA3 expression and immune infiltration was analyzed by TIDE, XCELL, MCPCOUNTER, and EPIC. We performed EdU and transwell experiments to evaluate the influence of P4HA3 on the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of different tumors. Patients derived xenograft (PDX) and subcutaneous transplantation models were utilized to explore the correlation between P4HA3 and immunotherapy response in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Among 33 types of cancers, P4HA3 had generally different expression between different tumors, further analysis showed that the expression of P4HA3 was correlated with the cells infiltration of the tumor microenvironment (TME). The expression of P4HA3 was positively with the cell proliferation markers and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. Moreover, P4HA3 deficiency inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of tumor cells, and promoted anti-tumor immunotherapy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor. This pan-cancer analysis of P4HA3 provides a comprehensive understanding of its oncogenic and prognosis role in different cancers, P4HA3 abnormal expression could be a useful biomarker for predicting the effectiveness of immunotherapy in cancer patients.

                <p>by Jonathan Eden, Ekaterina Ivanova, Etienne Burdet</p>

Physically connected humans have been shown to exploit the exchange of haptic forces and tactile information to improve their performance in joint action tasks. As human interactions are increasingly mediated through robots and networks it is important to understand the impact that network features such as lag and noise may have on human behaviour. In this paper, we investigated interaction with a human-like robot controller that provides similar haptic communication behaviour as human-human interaction and examined the influence and compensation mechanisms for delay and noise on haptic communication. The results of our experiments show that participants can perceive a difference between noise and delay, and make use of compensation mechanisms to preserve performance in both cases. However, while noise is compensated for by increasing co-contraction, delay compensation could not be explained by this strategy. Instead, computational modelling suggested that a distinct mechanism is used to compensate for the delay and yield an efficient haptic communication.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23646?af=R">Supramammillary Theta Oscillations in Water Maze Learning</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The supramammillary nucleus (SuM) in the hypothalamus, in conjunction with the hippocampus (HPC), has been implicated through theta oscillations in various brain functions ranging from locomotion to learning and memory. While the indispensable role of the SuM in HPC theta generation in anesthetized animals is well-characterized, the SuM is not always necessary for HPC theta in awake animals. This raises questions on the precise behavioral relevance of SuM theta activity and its interaction with HPC theta activity. We used simultaneously recorded SuM and HPC local field potentials (LFPs) in a one-day water maze (WM) learning paradigm in rats (<i>n</i> = 8), to show that theta activities recorded from the SuM itself were not positively correlated with locomotor (swimming) speed nor acceleration, but the individual relationship between acceleration and SuM theta frequency is correlated with WM learning rates. In contrast, we found that SuM-HPC theta phase coherence is strongly correlated with swimming speed and acceleration, but these do not relate to WM learning. SuM-HPC-directed coherence analysis demonstrated no swimming kinetics nor learning rate associations, but revealed that periods of high SuM-HPC theta phase coherence are driven by the SuM at relatively low (~6.2 Hz) frequencies. Additionally, we demonstrate that the SuM and the HPC also engage in non-random, non-coherent phase coupling modes where either structure preferentially displays a ± 2 Hz difference with the other. Our data indicate SuM theta LFPs do not appear to be related to either speed coding or spatial learning in swimming rats and display non-random out-of-phase theta frequency coupling with the HPC.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95213">Distinct catecholaminergic pathways projecting to hippocampal CA1 transmit contrasting signals during navigation in familiar and novel environments</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulatory inputs to the hippocampus play pivotal roles in modulating synaptic plasticity, shaping neuronal activity, and influencing learning and memory. Recently, it has been shown that the main sources of catecholamines to the hippocampus, ventral tegmental area (VTA) and locus coeruleus (LC), may have overlapping release of neurotransmitters and effects on the hippocampus. Therefore, to dissect the impacts of both VTA and LC circuits on hippocampal function, a thorough examination of how these pathways might differentially operate during behavior and learning is necessary. We therefore utilized two-photon microscopy to functionally image the activity of VTA and LC axons within the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus in head-fixed male mice navigating linear paths within virtual reality (VR) environments. We found that within familiar environments some VTA axons and the vast majority of LC axons showed a correlation with the animals’ running speed. However, as mice approached previously learned rewarded locations, a large majority of VTA axons exhibited a gradual ramping-up of activity, peaking at the reward location. In contrast, LC axons displayed a pre-movement signal predictive of the animal’s transition from immobility to movement. Interestingly, a marked divergence emerged following a switch from the familiar to novel VR environments. Many LC axons showed large increases in activity that remained elevated for over a minute, while the previously observed VTA axon ramping-to-reward dynamics disappeared during the same period. In conclusion, these findings highlight distinct roles of VTA and LC catecholaminergic inputs in the dorsal CA1 hippocampal region. These inputs encode unique information, with reward information in VTA inputs and novelty and kinematic information in LC inputs, likely contributing to differential modulation of hippocampal activity during behavior and learning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89582">Inhibition of the Notch signal transducer CSL by Pkc53E-mediated phosphorylation to fend off parasitic immune challenge in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Notch signalling activity regulates hematopoiesis in <i>Drosophila</i> and vertebrates alike. Parasitoid wasp infestation of <i>Drosophila</i> larvae, however, requires a timely downregulation of Notch activity to allow the formation of encapsulation-active blood cells. Here, we show that the <i>Drosophila</i> CSL transcription factor Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)] is phosphorylated at Serine 269 in response to parasitoid wasp infestation. As this phosphorylation interferes with the DNA binding of Su(H), it reversibly precludes its activity. Accordingly, phospho-deficient <i>Su(H)<sup>S269A</sup></i> mutants are immune-compromised. A screen for kinases involved in Su(H) phosphorylation identified Pkc53E, required for normal hematopoiesis as well as for parasitoid immune response. Genetic and molecular interactions support the specificity of the Su(H)-Pkc53E relationship. Moreover, phorbol ester treatment inhibits Su(H) activity in vivo and in human cell culture. We conclude that Pkc53E targets Su(H) during parasitic wasp infestation, thereby remodelling the blood cell population required for wasp egg encapsulation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92074">Single-cell multiomics analysis of chronic myeloid leukemia links cellular heterogeneity to therapy response</a></h4>

              
                The advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a paradigm in molecularly targeted cancer therapy. Nonetheless, TKI-insensitive leukemia stem cells (LSCs) persist in most patients even after years of treatment and are imperative for disease progression as well as recurrence during treatment-free remission (TFR). Here, we have generated high-resolution single-cell multiomics maps from CML patients at diagnosis, retrospectively stratified by BCR::ABL1<sup>IS</sup> (%) following 12 months of TKI therapy. Simultaneous measurement of global gene expression profiles together with &gt;40 surface markers from the same cells revealed that each patient harbored a unique composition of stem and progenitor cells at diagnosis. The patients with treatment failure after 12 months of therapy had a markedly higher abundance of molecularly defined primitive cells at diagnosis compared to the optimal responders. The multiomic feature landscape enabled visualization of the primitive fraction as a mixture of molecularly distinct BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSCs and BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup>hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in variable ratio across patients, and guided their prospective isolation by a combination of CD26 and CD35 cell surface markers. We for the first time show that BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSCs and BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> HSCs can be distinctly separated as CD26<sup>+</sup>CD35<sup>-</sup> and CD26<sup>-</sup>CD35<sup>+</sup>, respectively. In addition, we found the ratio of LSC/HSC to be higher in patients with prospective treatment failure compared to optimal responders, at diagnosis as well as following 3 months of TKI therapy. Collectively, this data builds a framework for understanding therapy response and adapting treatment by devising strategies to extinguish or suppress TKI-insensitive LSCs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89755">Functional implications of the exon 9 splice insert in GluK1 kainate receptors</a></h4>

              
                Kainate receptors are key modulators of synaptic transmission and plasticity in the central nervous system. Different kainate receptor isoforms with distinct spatiotemporal expressions have been identified in the brain. The GluK1-1 splice variant receptors, which are abundant in the adult brain, have an extra fifteen amino acids inserted in the amino-terminal domain (ATD) of the receptor resulting from alternative splicing of exon 9. However, the functional implications of this post-transcriptional modification are not yet clear. We employed a multi-pronged approach using cryogenic electron microscopy, electrophysiology, and other biophysical and biochemical tools to understand the structural and functional impact of this splice insert in the extracellular domain of GluK1 receptors. Our study reveals that the splice insert alters the key gating properties of GluK1 receptors and their modulation by the cognate auxiliary Neuropilin and tolloid-like (Neto) proteins 1 and 2. Mutational analysis identified the role of crucial splice residues that influence receptor properties and their modulation. Furthermore, the cryoEM structure of the variant shows that the presence of exon 9 in GluK1 does not affect the receptor architecture or domain arrangement in the desensitized state. Our study thus provides the first detailed structural and functional characterization of GluK1-1a receptors, highlighting the role of the splice insert in modulating receptor properties and their modulation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96755">DNAH3 deficiency causes flagellar inner dynein arm loss and male infertility in humans and mice</a></h4>

              
                Axonemal protein complexes, including the outer and inner dynein arms (ODA/IDA), are highly ordered structures of the sperm flagella that drive sperm motility. Deficiencies in several axonemal proteins have been associated with male infertility, which is characterized by asthenozoospermia or asthenoteratozoospermia. Dynein axonemal heavy chain 3 (DNAH3) resides in the IDA and is highly expressed in the testis. However, the relationship between DNAH3 and male infertility is still unclear. Herein, we identified biallelic variants of <i>DNAH3</i> in four unrelated Han Chinese infertile men with asthenoteratozoospermia through whole-exome sequencing (WES). These variants contributed to deficient DNAH3 expression in the patients’ sperm flagella. Importantly, the patients represented the anomalous sperm flagellar morphology, and the flagellar ultrastructure was severely disrupted. Intriguingly, <i>Dnah3</i> knockout (KO) male mice were also infertile, especially showing the severe reduction in sperm movement with the abnormal IDA and mitochondrion structure. Mechanically, nonfunctional DNAH3 expression resulted in decreased expression of IDA-associated proteins in the spermatozoa flagella of patients and KO mice, including DNAH1, DNAH6, and DNALI1, the deletion of which has been involved in disruption of sperm motility. Moreover, the infertility of patients with <i>DNAH3</i> variants and <i>Dnah3</i> KO mice could be rescued by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment. Our findings indicated that <i>DNAH3</i> is a novel pathogenic gene for asthenoteratozoospermia and may further contribute to the diagnosis, genetic counseling, and prognosis of male infertility.

">Optimization of microRNA Target Sequence Arrangement in AAV Vectors Dramatically Enhances Specificity and Efficiency of Transgene Expression in Cortical Microglia</a></h4>

              
                Microglia play a critical role in diseases such as Alzheimer's and stroke, making them a significant target for therapeutic intervention. However, due to their immune functions in detecting and combating viral invasion, efficient gene delivery to microglia remains challenging. We achieved specific and efficient gene delivery to microglia using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector designed for this purpose. This microglia-targeting AAV vector includes the mouse microglia/macrophage-specific ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (mIba1) promoter, green fluorescent protein (GFP), microRNA target sequences (miR.Ts), woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE), and polyadenylation (polyA) signal, positioned between inverted terminal repeats. When miR.Ts were placed downstream of WPRE (between WPRE and polyA), gene expression occurred not only in microglia but also in a substantial number of neurons. However, when miR.Ts were positioned upstream of WPRE (between GFP and WPRE) or on both sides of WPRE, neuronal expression was significantly suppressed, resulting in selective GFP expression in microglia. Notably, positioning miR.Ts on both sides of WPRE achieved over 90% specificity and more than 60% efficiency in transgene expression in microglia three weeks after viral administration. This vector also enabled GCaMP expression in microglia, facilitating real-time monitoring of calcium dynamics and microglial process activity in the cortex. Additionally, intravenous administration of this vector with the blood-brain barrier-penetrant AAV-9P31 capsid variant resulted in extensive GFP expression selectively in microglia throughout the brain. These findings establish this AAV vector system as a robust tool for long-term, specific, and efficient gene expression in microglia.

">Simultaneously induced slow and fast gamma waves travel independently in primate primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Travelling waves have been reported for multiple neuronal oscillations across the cortex. Within the primary visual cortex (V1), large visual stimuli (gratings) can induce two gamma oscillations, slow (20-35 Hz) and fast (40-60 Hz), potentially due to two different interneuronal classes. However, wave like behaviour of these rhythms and their relationship is unknown. We showed large gratings to monkeys that simultaneously induced slow and fast gamma while recording from V1 using microelectrode arrays. Both slow and fast gamma were organized as travelling waves that were not locked to stimulus onset. Direction of wave propagation was significantly different but showed no correlation, even in concurrent waves. Slow gamma waves lasted for longer durations than fast gamma. Wave direction varied with stimulus orientation and spatial frequency. Thus, slow and fast gamma oscillations in V1 show unique spatial and temporal wave dynamics signifying that these gamma rhythms are generated by distinct neural circuits.

">Bidirectional control of neurovascular coupling by cortical somatostatin interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Neurovascular coupling, which links neuronal activity to cerebral blood flow, is altered early in several neurological disorders and underlies functional brain imaging. This complex process involves multiple cellular players, with inhibitory interneurons in particular receiving increasing attention, yet the mechanisms underlying how they control of cerebral blood flow remain elusive. This study elucidates the mechanisms by which somatostatin interneurons bidirectionally control neurovascular coupling. Using patch-clamp recordings in cortical slices from mouse expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in somatostatin interneurons, we observed that these neurons are supralinearly activated by low-frequency (< 5 Hz) photostimulation and are efficiently and reliably activated at frequencies up to 20 Hz. Ex vivo vascular imaging showed that low-frequency (2 Hz) photostimulation triggered vasodilation whereas high-frequency (20 Hz) photostimulation induced vasoconstriction, both dependent on action potential firing. Histochemical analysis revealed that subpopulations of cortical somatostatin interneurons expressed NOS-1, the neuronal synthesizing enzyme of the vasodilator nitric oxide, and/or the vasoconstrictor neuropeptide Y at much greater extents. Consistently, pharmacological investigations have shown that vasodilation induced by low-frequency optogenetic stimulation involves nitric oxide release and activation of its vascular receptor soluble guanylate cyclase. In contrast, the vasoconstriction induced at high-frequency photostimulation involves neuropeptide Y release and activation of the Y1 vascular receptor. These findings provide valuable insights into neurovascular coupling and help to understand the cellular mechanism underlying the functional brain imaging signals used to map brain function in both health and disease.

">Relationships between measures of neurovascular integrity and fluid transport in aging: a multi-modal neuroimaging study</a></h4>

              
                Fluid transport in the neurovascular unit (NVU) is essential for maintaining brain health through nutrient delivery and waste clearance. NVU integrity and fluid regulation can be assessed through MRI measures, including water exchange rate through the NVU (BBB kw), enlarged perivascular spaces (ePVS), cerebral blood flow (CBF), free water (FW), and white matter hyperintensities (WMH). This study investigated relationships between these MRI measures using Bayesian mixed models, and their variation with chronological age or biological brain age (brainageR) using linear regression in 132 non-clinical older adults (mean age=67 years; 68% female). BBB kw positively associated with CBF (^=0.08, 95% credible interval (CI)=[0.02,0.15]). FW positively associated with both ePVS (^=0.44, CI=[0.30,0.63]) and WMH (^=0.13, CI=[0.04,0.21]). BBB kw, CBF and ePVS decreased with age, while FW and WMH increased (all p<.05). There were no associations with brain age (all p>.05). Relationships between FW, ePVS and WMH likely reflect interconnectivity of fluid regulation within different compartments, while the relationship between BBB kw and CBF indicates a link between NVU fluid flow and vessel function. While individual metrics of NVU integrity are associated with age, their inter-relationships appear stable, providing a baseline for future research in fluid transport and vascular health in neurodegenerative disease.

                We present the implementation and efficacy of an open-source closed-loop neurofeedback (CLNF) and closed-loop movement feedback (CLMF) system. In CLNF, we measure mm-scale cortical mesoscale activity with GCaMP6s and provide graded auditory feedback (within ~50 ms) based on changes in dorsal-cortical activation within regions of interest (ROI) and with a specified rule. Single or dual ROIs (ROI1, ROI2) on the dorsal cortical map were selected as targets. Both motor and sensory regions supported closed-loop training in male and female mice. Mice modulated activity in rule-specific target cortical ROIs to get increasing rewards over days (RM ANOVA p=2.83e-5) and adapted to changes in ROI rules (RM ANOVA p=8.3e-10, Table 4 for different rule changes). In CLMF, feedback was based on tracking a specified body movement, and rewards were generated when the behavior reached a threshold. For movement training, the group that received graded auditory feedback performed significantly better (RM-ANOVA p=9.6e-7) than a control group (RM-ANOVA p=0.49) within four training days. Additionally, mice can learn a change in task rule from left forelimb to right forelimb within a day, after a brief performance drop on day 5. Offline analysis of neural data and behavioral tracking revealed changes in the overall distribution of dF/F0 values in CLNF and body-part speed values in CLMF experiments. Increased CLMF performance was accompanied by a decrease in task latency and cortical dF/F0 amplitude during the task, indicating lower cortical activation as the task gets more familiar.

">Neural markers of abstinence in alcohol dependence: Insights from Reward Learning</a></h4>

              
                Maladaptive reward learning and decision-making circuity are key factors in the onset and progression of alcohol use disorder and have therefore emerged as key targets for neuropsychological and pharmacological interventions. Probabilistic reversal learning studies have consistently reported impaired learning in recently detoxified alcohol dependent (AD) participants. However, the neural and behavioural changes associated with reward learning which occur throughout abstinence remain unexplored. Here, we show that AD participants, with mean abstinence of 20 months, exhibit intact behavioural performance within an electroencephalography (EEG) probabilistic reversal learning task. Reinforcement learning modelling reveals reward and punishment related learning rates and exploration rates are comparable between AD and healthy control (HC) participants, suggesting recovery of even the nuanced aspects of learning in longer term abstinence. However, EEG analysis indicates that AD, compared to HC participants, show globally elevated event-related potential (ERP) feedback related negativity (FRN) following reward valuation. Furthermore, Feedback-P3 valence prediction error signal is negatively associated with abstinence duration indicating a potential state marker of AD recovery. We then employ unsupervised machine learning (canonical polyadic tensor decomposition) to identify spatiotemporal EEG patterns of reward valuation in a purely data-driven manner. Classification analysis shows these tensor components can predict group membership with 80.4% accuracy. By probing group differences in tensor components, we discover early hyperfunctioning in centro-frontal regions linked to alcohol dependence and associated with early abstinence. The clinically meaningful EEG biomarkers presented here could guide the development of more targeted treatments and support big data approaches to objective patient monitoring.

                Neuro- and retinal degenerative diseases rob millions of aging individuals of their independence. Researching these diseases in human tissue has been hindered by the immediate loss of electric activity in neurons after the circulation ceases. Recent studies indicate that limited neuronal activity can be revived postmortem, even in the retina. We capitalized on this discovery by successfully restoring and maintaining in vivo-like light responses in eyes recovered up to four hours and stored for up to 48 hours postmortem. This breakthrough significantly increases the availability of functionally viable human retinas for research. Our AI-based postmortem retinal imaging platform identifies retinal structures and allows us to compare light responses in the healthy central and peripheral retina with ex vivo electroretinography. We use this platform to measure the dark adaptation of human macular cones from controls and donors with age-related macular degeneration for the first time in the absence of the retinal pigment epithelium. We developed increased throughput technology and a model to simulate disease-associated acute ischemia-reperfusion. In this model, we demonstrate the protective or toxic effects of several drugs targeting oxidative stress or glutamate excitotoxicity.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Orthosomnia has become a concern in the field of sleep medicine. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to estimate the prevalence of orthosomnia in the general population. Methods: We collected data from 523 participants via the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Anxiety and Preoccupation about Sleep Questionnaire, and Athens Insomnia Scale. Additionally, we gathered information about participants&amp;amp;rsquo; use of commercial sleep-tracking wearable devices. Results: We developed a four-criteria algorithm to identify cases of orthosomnia: ownership of a wearable sleep-tracking device, AIS score &amp;amp;ge; 6, GAD-7 score &amp;amp;le; 14, and APSQ score &amp;amp;ge; 40 or APSQ score &amp;amp;ge; 35 or APSQ score &amp;amp;ge; 30, for conservative, moderate, and lenient prevalence estimates, respectively. One hundred seventy-six (35.8%) (95% CI 34.6&amp;amp;ndash;40.1%) participants regularly used sleep-tracking devices. The prevalence rates of algorithm-identified orthosomnia in the study sample were: 16 participants (3.0%, 95% CI 1.6&amp;amp;ndash;4.5%), 45 participants (8.6%, 95% CI 6.2&amp;amp;ndash;11.0%), 73 participants (14.0%, 95% CI 10.9&amp;amp;ndash;16.9%) for the for conservative, moderate, and lenient prevalence estimates, respectively. Individuals with orthosomnia were not significantly different in terms of age and sex. The cases consistently had higher AIS scores than non-cases across all APSQ cutoffs, indicating more severe insomnia symptoms, with significant differences observed at each cutoff point. Conclusions: This study offers initial insights into the prevalence of orthosomnia within our sample at a specific time. The findings reveal notable rates of orthosomnia among individuals using sleep-tracking devices; however, we must acknowledge the limitations inherent in a cross-sectional design.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1325/v1?src=rss">Water quality evaluation by WQI and ICOs for the rivers of Joya de los Sachas and Francisco de Orellana [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                A monitoring program enabled the evaluation of water quality and the simulation of the pollution dynamics of the rivers in the Joya de los Sachas and Francisco de Orellana cantons in Ecuador. For this assessment one used the WQI (water quality index) and the pollution indices ICOMO (organics contamination), ICOSUS (suspended solids), ICOMI (mineralization), ICOTRO (trophy system), and ICOpH (pH Index). The mathematical model operates with several input parameters, including dissolved oxygen, fecal coliforms, the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), turbidity, total solids, total phosphorus, pH, total nitrogen, suspended solids, alkalinity, conductivity, temperature, and the concentrations of nitrates, nitrites, and phosphates. WQI values were obtained from ICO pollution indices. The pollution of the Sacha area is significant, WQI = 0.292, which represents an advanced degree of pollution, since increased BOD values correspond to a high load of organic pollutants. They can originate from household, agricultural, industrial, and soil erosion waste. Likewise, the Sacha River has an ICOSUS = 0.16, which renders water treatment difficult, without impacting human health. Calculated WQI values reveal that the water quality of the Sacha, Basura and Coca rivers is low, being highly contaminated. In contrast, the Huamayacu, Jivino Rojo, Jivino Negro, and Jivino Blanco rivers are commonly polluted.

                This study shows that ethnomedicine and ethnobotany have gained great relevance for their role in preserving ancestral knowledge about the use of medicinal plants. Despite the benefits, such as cultural preservation and biodiversity, new challenges arise, such as the lack of standardization and scientific validation, which limits their integration into modern medicine. Therefore, this systematic review aims to assess the documentation, evaluation, and conservation of medicinal plants and their therapeutic applications across different cultures, using the systematic literature review (SLR) methodology. The searches were conducted in electronic databases, such as Scopus, EBSCO, and Web of Science, following PRISMA protocol guidelines and focusing on studies published between 2007 and 2024. Research gaps were identified, and questions were developed to better understand ethnomedicinal practices, their validation, and conservation. A total of seventy studies were selected, documenting a wide diversity of medicinal plants, with a significant focus on the conservation of traditional knowledge. However, critical gaps were identified in the scientific validation and integration of this knowledge into conservation policies. The results of the thematic analysis highlight the need for standardized protocols and a multidisciplinary approach to validate and preserve ethnomedicinal knowledge, ensuring its relevance in modern medicine and its transmission to future generations.

                Purpose To report the impact of front surface eccentricity (FSE) of scleral lenses (SCLs) on the visual performance of eyes exhibiting refractive surgery-induced higher-order aberrations (HOAs) Method A female teenager presented to the clinic with blurring of vision and dependency on spectacles even after undergoing Small Incision Lenticule Extraction (SMILE) in both eyes (BE). Her presenting uncorrected high contrast distance visual acuity (HCDVA) was 20/60 in the right eye (RE) and 20/40 in the left eye (LE). On examination, the cornea showed a ring-shaped area of ablation with faint scarring and a well-apposed lenticule-extraction site. Subjective refraction improved the HCDVA to 20/20p in RE and 20/25 in LE but the patient was not happy with the quality of vision. Ocular aberrometry revealed an increase in total HOAs as the underlying cause of unsatisfactory vision. Result A contact lens trial was recommended for BE to enhance visual quality. Rigid corneal lenses (RCLs) were tried, but the patient was intolerant to them. Large diameter SCLs of different FSEs (0, 0.6, and 0.8) were tried to reduce these aberrations. SCL with FSE 0 yielded the most favourable visual outcome, which was confirmed subjectively on ocular aberrometry. Conclusion With this case report, we hypothesize that the eccentricity of SCL can be selected according to the asphericity (at 6 mm) of the posterior corneal surface. This case also re-emphasizes the impact of SCL with varying FSEs on reducing HOAs and enhancing visual quality in eyes where conventional RCLs yield suboptimal results.

                Background of the study Child marriage is linked with multiple maternal and child health issues. However, there is insufficient information regarding the factors influencing child marriage among rural women. Objective To identify the determinants of child marriage among rural women of reproductive age women in the West Guji Zone, Southern Ethiopia, 2024. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April 1 to May 5, 2024. A multistage sampling procedure was used to select 711 participants. The SPSS version 25 was used for data analysis. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to determine the determinants of child marriage. Adjusted odd ratio with a 95% confidence interval was used to assess the strength of the associations, and statistical significance was declared at p < 0.05. Results The prevalence of child marriage was 49.6% (95% CI: 0.472-0.524). Being Muslim (AOR=2.104, 95% CI =1.176-3.764), nonformal fathers’ education (AOR=2.633, 95% CI=1.135-6.109), primary level of fathers’ education (AOR=3.326, 95% CI=1.421-7.787); not exposed to media (AOR=1.56, 95% CI=1.033-2.356); living with a relative (AOR=1.592, 95% CI=1.012-2.504); not knowing the legal age of marriage (AOR=2.528, 95% CI=1.593-4.010); marital decision making by girls (AOR=.666, 95% CI=.463-.959), and poor parental wealth status (AOR=4.464, 95% CI=2.795-7.129) were associated with child marriage. Conclusion Almost one in every two women married before 18 in the study area. The determinant factors include religion, fathers’ level of education, exposure to media, living arrangements; awareness of the legal marital age, marriage decision making, and parents’ wealth status. Thus, intervention efforts should focus on these factors to increase the marital age and improve women’s prospects.

                Background The Environmental Nutrition Program (ENP) as an environmental intervention offers voluntary involvement with students, but persists in exposure. This study aimed to investigate the effect of ENP on students’ dietary intake and nutritional knowledge. Methods A quasi-experimental study was conducted with a control school. ENP comprises four activities: the use of uniform food serving tools, nutrition fact displays, food and nutrition information displays, and body weighing awareness. The ENP emphasized voluntary involvement with students but persisted in exposure for over 8-weeks. Multiple passes of 24-hour food recall and validated questionnaires were used in the assessments by a nutritionist. Multiple linear regressions were performed to analyze the effectiveness of ENP. Results A total of 113 female high school students, with a median age of 16 years, were recruited. At baseline, all students had a lower dietary intake than the national recommendation. Except for the stipend, no differences in the characteristics were found among the students. The students’ carbohydrate intake and nutritional knowledge significantly increased after the ENP in the intervention school (p < 0.001). Total energy, protein, and fat intake also improved after ENP. Conclusion ENP activities effectively increased students’ daily carbohydrate intake and nutritional knowledge. Thus, ENP may be appropriate for enhancing nutrition literacy among female students. Future studies with a longer time frame are encouraged to yield sustained, favorable dietary practices.

                Background Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) has improved diagnosis and treatment planning in paediatric dentistry, but no bibliometric studies have examined the research landscape. This study provides an overview of CBCT in paediatric dentistry. Methods A bibliometric review was conducted using articles from the Web of Science database up to February 2024. Conference papers and editorials were excluded. Data extracted included citation counts, publication dates, journals, impact factors, study designs, topics, geographical and institutional affiliations, authors, and keywords. Collaborative networks were visualised using VOSviewer, and Spearman’s correlation assessed the relationship between citation counts and other variables. Results The review analysed 517 articles, with the most cited receiving 557 citations. Publication dates ranged from 2005 to 2024, with a peak in 2023. Observational studies were the most common, particularly on maxillary expansion. The American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics was the most cited journal, and the USA was a major contributor. Jacobs R authored the most articles (n=19), and the University of Alberta led in institutional output. Spearman’s correlation showed a weak positive correlation between citation count and journal impact factor (rho=0.272, p<0.001) and a strong negative correlation with publication year (rho=-0.762, p<0.001). Conclusions This bibliometric review provides an overview of the use of CBCT in paediatric dentistry, particularly in maxillary expansion. The findings suggest that more specific imaging protocols may improve safety and clinical outcomes, and that further investigation of long-term outcomes may provide valuable insights.

                The health sector in Bangladesh is thriving, and the Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) program has been in place to investigate the causes of maternal and perinatal death. This study aimed to investigate the availability of information systems for measuring the status of an MPDSR program and the planning process and actions developed based on real-time information. This study delved into innovative information systems that can be used to monitor and measure the impact of health programs. The study included both the primary and secondary data. A total of six key informant interviews were conducted to explore the enablers and strengths of information systems. Secondary data were collected from government websites and MPDSR action plans. This study highlights the potential and challenges of governmental health information systems in notifying maternal and neonatal deaths. While the current notification rates are not up to national standards, it is encouraging to see health managers develop action plans and address this issue. The MPDSR information system is a valuable tool to help health managers measure changes in maternal and perinatal mortality rates and design locally targeted interventions. However, several obstacles must be addressed, such as insufficient data, lack of monitoring, and irregularities in MPDSR review meetings. By finding ways to overcome these challenges, we can unlock the full potential of MPDSR and improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes. The success of an MPDSR program relies on how the information is utilized to take action and measure the outcome. Advanced information systems, such as health dashboards, scorecards, and administrative data, can play a vital role in measuring the progress and impact of a program. The primary challenge lies in capturing all deaths, including their causes, and having the capacity to analyze the data effectively to develop action plans for health managers.

                Background The association between anemia and severity of infection as well as mortality rates among patients infected with COVID-19 has scarcely been studied. This is the first study from the UAE aimed to assess the influence of anemia on COVID-19 severity, ICU admission, and mortality rate. Methods A retrospective chart review of hospitalized COVID-19 patients was conducted in a large COVID-19 referral hospital in UAE. The study included adult patients with confirmed COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory data, severity of the disease, ICU admissions, and mortality rates were analyzed and correlated to the presence of anemia among the patients. Results A total of 3092 patients were included. 362 patients (11.7%) were anemic and most of the cases were between asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 (77.4%, n=2393). Among patients with anemia, 30.1% (n=109) had moderate to severe COVID-19. Statistically, anemia was associated significantly with a higher risk for severe COVID-19 outcome compared to nonanemic patients (AOR:1.59, 95% CI:1.24-2.04, p<0.001). Intensive care unit (ICU) admission was almost 3 times higher among anemic patients compared to nonanemic (AOR:2.83,95% CI:1.89-4.25, p<0.001). In addition, the overall mortality rate of 2.8% (n=87) was 2.5-fold higher in anemic than nonanemic patients (OR:2.56, CI: 1.49-4.06, p<0.001). Moreover, older age (≥48-year-old) and male gender were independent predictors for severe illness (Age: OR=1.26, CI:1.07-1.51, p=0.006; Gender: OR:1.43,CI:1.15-1.78, p<0.001)) and ICU admission (Age: OR:2.08, CI:1.47-2.94, p<0.001; Gender: OR: 1.83, CI:1.12-3.00, p=0.008) whereas only age ≥48 years old contributed to higher mortality rate (OR:1.60, CI:1.04-2.46, p=0.034). Conclusion Anemia was a major risk factor for severe COVID-19, ICU admission and mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Thus, healthcare providers should be aware of monitoring the hematological parameters among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and anemia to reduce the risk of disease complications and mortality. This association should also be considered in other infectious diseases.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Effective clinical laboratories are the need of the hour, they play a significant role in healthcare, providing tests for diagnosis, treatment monitoring. Having skilled and adequate staffing is crucial for clinical laboratories to operate efficiently, manage their workload effectively, and deliver test results in a timely manner. Despite being critical for healthcare delivery, ensuring adequate staffing levels in clinical laboratories remains a complex challenge for healthcare providers worldwide due to resource constraints and workforce shortages. Methods This study evaluates the effectiveness of clinical laboratory staff utilization by considering workload, work pressure, and staffing requirements. We utilized the Workload Indicators of Staffing Need (WISN) method to assess the staffing in the clinical laboratory of a tertiary care hospital. Annual hospital statistics were collected for two years from June 2021 to May 2023 to calculate the average number of days (234) worked annually, percentage of workload, distribution of activity time measurement units, and the ratio of needed, surplus, and existing staff. The findings aim to provide valuable insights for optimizing staffing levels and ensuring an efficient laboratory environment. Result The analysis found a significant workforce gap in the laboratory between the current staff numbers and the calculated staffing needs. The WISN ratios ranged from 0.2 to 0.7, indicating the existing 33 staff members face a high workload burden. The calculated ideal staffing level was 46.33 personnel. These results demonstrate staff shortage and excess workload pressure on the current laboratory employees. Conclusion The results highlight the importance of optimizing staffing levels in clinical laboratories to ensure quality service delivery. The WISN methodology can be a useful tool in healthcare facilities for making evidence -based decisions for staff allocation, maximizing the utilization of employee skill sets, and establishing standard staffing benchmarks tailored to the needs of clinical laboratories.

                Background One of the most common strabismus types in children is intermittent exotropia, which masks the deviation of one eye outward, mostly in children aged 2-4 years. It may affect visual development and often coexists with refractive mistakes. Unlike esotropia, which usually links to hyperopia, intermittent exotropia might have a different relationship with refractive errors and thus lead to myopia. Methods In this cross-sectional study from August 2021 to December 2023, 179 patients diagnosed with intermittent exotropia were recruited via an outpatient clinic of Najah Al-Quraishi, Baghdad, Iraq. The refractive errors were compared by autorefractometry and retinoscopy after cycloplegic dilation. Data analysis was constructed under the use of IBM SPSS V.26 for the determination of emmetropia, myopia, and hyperopia prevalence. Results The most expected refractive error among the 179 patients was emmetropia, which occurred in 68 patients (38%). Low hyperopia and low myopia were also common, with 64 and 40, respectively. A limited number of patients had moderate/high myopia and moderate/high hyperopia; in detail, the prevalence was following: 5% of patients had moderate myopia, while 0.5% of patients suffered from high myopia; symmetrically, 5% were moderate to high hyperopia. From the data collected, a trend emerged for a low refractive error and symmetric refractive error in both eyes. Conclusion Contrasted to prior conventional wisdom about refractive error in strabismus, it established the greater incidence of emmetropia in patients with intermittent exotropia. The findings call for specific management strategies to be applied in this population.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The limited existing evidence on sex differences in the clinical characteristics of patients with spontaneous, non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) comes from small, single-center studies. Here, we performed an individual patient data meta-analysis of 3 randomized clinical trials and 1 multi-ethnic observational study of ICH to investigate the impact of sex on ICH severity and outcome.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Inclusion criteria in our study were a neuroimaging-confirmed ICH. We evaluated whether sex was associated with ICH severity (hematoma volume and expansion) and poor functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale &gt;3) 3 or 6 months after the ICH.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 4,812 ICH patients were evaluated (mean age 62, 40% female). Males with ICH were younger, more likely to be smokers and have diabetes, and less likely to be on anticoagulants (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). In multivariable analyses, male sex was associated with non-lobar location (odds ratio [OR]: 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.39–1.92]; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), larger hemorrhages (beta: 0.16 [0.08–0.23]; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and a higher risk of hematoma expansion (OR: 1.43 [1.20–1.71]; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Despite the larger hemorrhage volume and higher risk of expansion, male sex was associated with a 24% lower risk of poor outcomes (OR: 0.76 [0.64–0.90]; <i>p</i> = 0.002).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Compared to females, males with ICH have larger bleeds and higher risk of hematoma expansion. Despite the larger bleeds and higher risk of hematoma expansion, males with ICH have lower risk of poor outcomes. Our results suggest that the biology and clinical trajectory are different in females and males with ICH, supporting sex-specific research in this condition. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

Protein domain annotation is typically done by predictive models such as HMMs trained on sequence motifs. However, sequence-based annotation methods are prone to error, particularly in calling domain boundaries and motifs within them. These methods are limited by a lack of structural information accessible to the model. With the advent of deep learning-based protein structure prediction, existing sequenced-based domain annotation methods can be improved by taking into account the geometry of protein structures. We develop dimensionality reduction methods to annotate repeat units of the Leucine Rich Repeat solenoid domain. The methods are able to correct mistakes made by existing machine learning-based annotation tools and enable the automated detection of hairpin loops and structural anomalies in the solenoid. The methods are applied to 127 predicted structures of LRR-containing intracellular innate immune proteins in the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and validated against a benchmark dataset of 172 manually-annotated LRR domains.

We conducted an international cross-sectional survey of biomedical researchers’ perspectives on the reproducibility of research. This study builds on a widely cited 2016 survey on reproducibility and provides a biomedical-specific and contemporary perspective on reproducibility. To sample the community, we randomly selected 400 journals indexed in MEDLINE, from which we extracted the author names and emails from all articles published between October 1, 2020 and October 1, 2021. We invited participants to complete an anonymous online survey which collected basic demographic information, perceptions about a reproducibility crisis, perceived causes of irreproducibility of research results, experience conducting reproducibility studies, and knowledge of funding and training for research on reproducibility. A total of 1,924 participants accessed our survey, of which 1,630 provided useable responses (response rate 7% of 23,234). Key findings include that 72% of participants agreed there was a reproducibility crisis in biomedicine, with 27% of participants indicating the crisis was “significant.” The leading perceived cause of irreproducibility was a “pressure to publish” with 62% of participants indicating it “always” or “very often” contributes. About half of the participants (54%) had run a replication of their own previously published study while slightly more (57%) had run a replication of another researcher’s study. Just 16% of participants indicated their institution had established procedures to enhance the reproducibility of biomedical research and 67% felt their institution valued new research over replication studies. Participants also reported few opportunities to obtain funding to attempt to reproduce a study and 83% perceived it would be harder to do so than to get funding to do a novel study. Our results may be used to guide training and interventions to improve research reproducibility and to monitor rates of reproducibility over time. The findings are also relevant to policy makers and academic leadership looking to create incentives and research cultures that support reproducibility and value research quality.

The CA1 region of the hippocampus is one of the most studied regions of the rodent brain, thought to play an important role in cognitive functions such as memory and spatial navigation. Despite a wealth of experimental data on its structure and function, it has been challenging to integrate information obtained from diverse experimental approaches. To address this challenge, we present a community-based, full-scale in silico model of the rat CA1 that integrates a broad range of experimental data, from synapse to network, including the reconstruction of its principal afferents, the Schaffer collaterals, and a model of the effects that acetylcholine has on the system. We tested and validated each model component and the final network model, and made input data, assumptions, and strategies explicit and transparent. The unique flexibility of the model allows scientists to potentially address a range of scientific questions. In this article, we describe the methods used to set up simulations to reproduce in vitro and in vivo experiments. Among several applications in the article, we focus on theta rhythm, a prominent hippocampal oscillation associated with various behavioral correlates and use our computer model to reproduce experimental findings. Finally, we make data, code, and model available through the hippocampushub.eu portal, which also provides an extensive set of analyses of the model and a user-friendly interface to facilitate adoption and usage. This community-based model represents a valuable tool for integrating diverse experimental data and provides a foundation for further research into the complex workings of the hippocampal CA1 region.

                <p>by Katelyn Del Toro, Rosalyn Sayaman, Kate Thi, Yamhilette Licon-Munoz, William Curtis Hines</p>

A fundamental question in biology, central to our understanding of cancer and other pathologies, is determining how different cell types coordinate to form and maintain tissues. Recognizing the distinct features and capabilities of the cells that compose these tissues is critical. Unfortunately, the complexity of tissues often hinders our ability to distinguish between neighboring cell types and, in turn, scrutinize their transcriptomes and generate reliable and tractable cell models for studying their inherently different biologies. We have recently introduced a novel method that permits the identification and purification of the 12 cell types that compose the human breast—nearly all of which could be reliably propagated in the laboratory. Here, we explore the nature of these cell types. We sequence mRNAs from each purified population and investigate transcriptional patterns that reveal their distinguishing features. We describe the differentially expressed genes and enriched biological pathways that capture the essence of each cell type, and we highlight transcripts that display intriguing expression patterns. These data, analytic tools, and transcriptional analyses form a rich resource whose exploration provides remarkable insights into the inner workings of the cell types composing the breast, thus furthering our understanding of the rules governing normal cell and tissue function.

                Background Human activity recognition (HAR) is increasingly important in enhancing healthcare systems by enabling accurate monitoring of individuals' movements through sensor data. This paper is motivated by the need to improve the accuracy of HAR, particularly for applications in e-health systems, where reliable activity detection can lead to better health outcomes. The study explores six prominent machine learning techniques—decision tree, random forest, linear regression, Naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, and neural networks—to determine which methods can most effectively predict activities like walking, sitting, standing, laying, walking upstairs, and walking downstairs. Methods We employed these six machine learning algorithms to analyze a comprehensive dataset derived from various sensors. Each model was rigorously trained and evaluated to compare its effectiveness in recognizing human activities. The experiments aimed to identify strengths and weaknesses in each approach, with particular emphasis on advanced techniques such as random forest, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and gated recurrent networks (GRNs). Results The experimental evaluation revealed that the random forest classifier, CNN, GRN, and neural networks delivered promising results, achieving high accuracy levels. Notably, the neural network model excelled, attaining an impressive accuracy of 98%. In contrast, the Naïve Bayes model did not meet the performance expectations set by the other algorithms. Conclusions This research effectively classifies activities such as sitting, standing, laying, walking, walking downstairs, and walking upstairs, underscoring the potential of machine learning in HAR. The findings highlight the superior performance of neural networks in enhancing activity recognition, which could lead to advanced applications in e-health systems and improve overall healthcare monitoring strategies.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Motor circuits in the vertebrate hindbrain need to become functional early in development. What are the fundamental mechanisms that establish early synaptic inputs to motor neurons? Previous evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that motor neuron dendrite positioning serves a causal role in early spinal motor circuit development, with initial connectivity determined by the overlap between premotor axons and motor neuron dendrites (perhaps without the need for molecular recognition). Does motor neuron dendrite topography serve a similar role in the hindbrain? In the current study, we provide the first quantitative analysis of the dendrites of facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs) in larval zebrafish. We previously demonstrated that FBMNs exhibit functional topography along the dorsoventral axis, with the most ventral cell bodies most likely to exhibit early rhythmic activity—suggesting that FBMNs with ventral cell bodies are most likely to receive inputs from premotor neurons carrying rhythmic respiratory signals. We hypothesized that this functional topography can be explained by differences in dendrite positioning, giving ventral FBMNs preferential access to premotor axons carrying rhythmic signals. If this hypothesis is true, we predicted that FBMN cell body position would be correlated with dendrite position along the dorsoventral axis. To test this prediction, we used single-cell labeling to trace the dendritic arbors of FBMNs in larval zebrafish at 5-days post-fertilization (dpf). FBMN dendrites varied in complexity, and this variation could not be attributed to differences in the relative age of neurons. Most dendrites grew caudally, laterally, and ventrally from the cell body—though FBMN dendrites could extend their dendrites dorsally. Across our sample, FBMN cell body position correlated with dendrite position along the dorsoventral axis, consistent with our hypothesis that differences in dendrite positioning serve as the substrate for differences in activity patterns across neurons. Future studies will build on this foundational data, testing additional predictions of the central hypothesis—to further investigate the mechanisms of early motor circuit development.</p>

                The authors show that activation of prelimbic (PL) cortex inputs leads to depolarization block in a subset of anterior paraventricular thalamic (aPVT) neurons. Inhibitory inputs from the anteroventral thalamic reticular nucleus (avTRN) restore aPVT firing rates and shift the top-down effects of PL inputs on aPVT activity and motivated behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98489">The recurrent temporal restricted Boltzmann machine captures neural assembly dynamics in whole-brain activity</a></h4>

              
                Animal behaviour alternates between stochastic exploration and goal-directed actions, which are generated by the underlying neural dynamics. Previously, we demonstrated that the compositional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (cRBM) can decompose whole-brain activity of larval zebrafish data at the neural level into a small number (∼100-200) of assemblies that can account for the stochasticity of the neural activity (van der Plas et al., eLife, 2023). Here, we advance this representation by extending to a combined stochastic-dynamical representation to account for both aspects using the recurrent temporal RBM (RTRBM) and transfer-learning based on the cRBM estimate. We demonstrate that the functional advantage of the RTRBM is captured in the temporal weights on the hidden units, representing neural assemblies, for both simulated and experimental data. Our results show that the temporal expansion outperforms the stochastic-only cRBM in terms of generalization error and achieves a more accurate representation of the moments in time. Lastly, we demonstrate that we can identify the original time-scale of assembly dynamics by estimating multiple RTRBMs at different temporal resolutions. Together, we propose that RTRBMs are a valuable tool for capturing the combined stochastic and time-predictive dynamics of large-scale data sets.

                Computation in neural circuits relies on the judicious use of nonlinear circuit components. In many cases, multiple nonlinear components work collectively to control circuit outputs. Separating the contributions of these different components is difficult, and this limits our understanding of the mechanistic basis of many important computations. Here, we introduce a tool that permits the design of light stimuli that predictably alter rod and cone phototransduction currents – including stimuli that compensate for nonlinear properties such as light adaptation. This tool, based on well-established models for the rod and cone phototransduction cascade, permits the separation of nonlinearities in phototransduction from those in downstream circuits. This will allow, for example, direct tests of how adaptation in rod and cone phototransduction affects downstream visual signals and perception.

In this study, by gene deletion and complementation, we found SntB is essential for mycelia growth, conidial production, sclerotia formation, aflatoxin synthesis, and host colonization. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that SntB played key roles in oxidative stress response of <i>A. flavus</i>, influencing related gene activity, especially <i>catC</i> encoding catalase. SntB regulated the expression activity of <i>catC</i> with or without oxidative stress, and was related to the expression level of the secretory lipase (G4B84_008359). The deletion of <i>catC</i> showed that CatC participated in the regulation of fungal morphogenesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and aflatoxin production, and that CatC significantly regulated fungal sensitive reaction and AFB1 yield under oxidative stress. Our study revealed the potential machinery that SntB regulated fungal morphogenesis, mycotoxin anabolism, and fungal virulence through the axle of from H3K36me3 modification to fungal virulence and mycotoxin biosynthesis. The results of this study shed light into the SntB-mediated transcript regulation pathways of fungal mycotoxin anabolism and virulence, which provided potential strategy to control the contamination of <i>A. flavus</i> and its aflatoxins.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92860">Natural forgetting reversibly modulates engram expression</a></h4>

              
                Memories are stored as ensembles of engram neurons and their successful recall involves the reactivation of these cellular networks. However, significant gaps remain in connecting these cell ensembles with the process of forgetting. Here, we utilized a mouse model of object memory and investigated the conditions in which a memory could be preserved, retrieved, or forgotten. Direct modulation of engram activity via optogenetic stimulation or inhibition either facilitated or prevented the recall of an object memory. In addition, through behavioral and pharmacological interventions, we successfully prevented or accelerated forgetting of an object memory. Finally, we showed that these results can be explained by a computational model in which engrams that are subjectively less relevant for adaptive behavior are more likely to be forgotten. Together, these findings suggest that forgetting may be an adaptive form of engram plasticity which allows engrams to switch from an accessible state to an inaccessible state.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95314">Molecular basis of neurodegeneration in a mouse model of Polr3-related disease</a></h4>

              
                Pathogenic variants in subunits of RNA polymerase (Pol) III cause a spectrum of <i>Polr3</i>-related neurodegenerative diseases including 4H leukodystrophy. Disease onset occurs from infancy to early adulthood and is associated with a variable range and severity of neurological and non-neurological features. The molecular basis of <i>Polr3</i>-related disease pathogenesis is unknown. We developed a postnatal whole-body mouse model expressing pathogenic <i>Polr3a</i> mutations to examine the molecular mechanisms by which reduced Pol III transcription results primarily in central nervous system phenotypes. <i>Polr3a</i> mutant mice exhibit behavioral deficits, cerebral pathology and exocrine pancreatic atrophy. Transcriptome and immunohistochemistry analyses of cerebra during disease progression show a reduction in most Pol III transcripts, induction of innate immune and integrated stress responses and cell-type-specific gene expression changes reflecting neuron and oligodendrocyte loss and microglial activation. Earlier in the disease when integrated stress and innate immune responses are minimally induced, mature tRNA sequencing revealed a global reduction in tRNA levels and an altered tRNA profile but no changes in other Pol III transcripts. Thus, changes in the size and/or composition of the tRNA pool have a causal role in disease initiation. Our findings reveal different tissue- and brain region-specific sensitivities to a defect in Pol III transcription.

">Contactin-1 is a critical neuronal cell surface receptor for perineuronal net structure</a></h4>

              
                Perineuronal nets (PNNs), are neuron-specific substructures within the neural extracellular matrix (ECM). These reticular structures form on a very small subset of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and yet have a profound impact in regulating neuronal development and physiology. PNNs are well-established as key regulators of plasticity in the CNS. Their appearance coincides with the developmental transition of the brain more to less plastic state. And, importantly, numerous studies have demonstrated that indeed PNNs play a primary role in regulating this transition. There is, however, a growing literature implicating PNNs in numerous roles in neural physiology beyond their role in regulating developmental plasticity. Accordingly, numerous studies have shown PNNs are altered in a variety of neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, linking them to these conditions. Despite the growing interest in PNNs, the mechanisms by which they modulate neural functions are poorly understood. We believe the limited mechanistic understanding of PNNs is derived from the fact that there are limited models, tools or techniques that specifically target PNNs in a cell-autonomous manner and without also disrupting the surrounding neural ECM. These limitations are primarily due to our incomplete understanding of PNN composition and structure. In particular, there is little understanding of the neuronal cell surface receptors that nucleate these structures on subset of neurons on which they form in the CNS. Therefore, the main focus our work is to identify the neuronal cell surface proteins critical for PNN formation and structure. In our previous studies we demonstrated PNN components are immobilized on the neuronal surface by two distinct mechanisms, one dependent on the hyaluronan backbone of PNNs and the other mediated by a complex formed by receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase zeta (RPTP{zeta}) and tenascin-R (Tnr). Here we first demonstrate that the Tnr-RPTP{zeta} complex in PNNs is bound to the cell surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked receptor protein. Using a biochemical and structural approach we demonstrate the GPI-linked protein critical for binding the Tnr-RPTP{zeta} complex in PNNs is contactin-1 (Cntn1). We further show the binding of this complex in PNNs by Cntn1 is critical for PNN structure. We believe identification of CNTN1 as a key cell-surface protein for PNN structure is a very significant step forward in our understanding of PNN formation and structure and will offer new strategies and targets to manipulate PNNs and better understand their function.

                Here we investigated the role of the ventral pallidum (VP) to nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh) pathway in mediating sucrose consumption and motivation for food in female rats. Using chemogenetic techniques, excitatory and inhibitory designer receptors were expressed in VP neurons projecting to the AcbSh. Behavioral assays assessed both lever pressing under a progressive ratio schedule and free sucrose consumption following activation or inhibition of this pathway. Results showed that inhibition of VP-AcbSh projections increased sucrose intake, while excitation reduced it, without affecting motivation to work for food. These findings indicate a specific influence of the VP-AcbSh pathway on sucrose consumption independent of food-seeking motivation. The study highlights the importance of differentiating VP efferents in understanding distinct roles in feeding behaviors and suggests that the VP-AcbSh pathway modulates consumption based on food type and potentially other variables.

">Sufficiency of ITD for (biased) human auditory azimuthal perception</a></h4>

              
                Experiments on human auditory perception have shown that interaural time difference (ITD) is sufficient to generate spatial percepts, even though stimuli containing only the ITD cue are perceived as being emitted from inside the head instead of from external locations at specific azimuths. These experiments are thus interpreted as "lateralization" instead of "localization" tasks. In fact, lateralized spatial perception has been quantified using tasks in which participants have to report their estimates by selecting a putative location inside the head, or matching the perceived position to sounds with a given interaural level difference. Therefore, these estimates are made with respect to internal frames of reference, but it is unclear whether these percepts have any significance for the more ecological problem of locating an external sound source. In order to investigate the link between internalized spatial percepts and sound localization, we designed a new task in which subjects are instructed to report externalized azimuthal location for sounds containing only ITD cues. Despite the mismatch between an internalized percept having to be reported as emanating from an external location, subjects were able to estimate azimuths consistently. Furthermore, normalized estimates were indistinguishable from those obtained using traditional lateralization tasks. Our results revealed a direct relationship between perceived azimuths and ITD, which deviates from that obtained from acoustical analysis of binaural recordings, revealing estimation biases. Intriguingly, these results indicate that externalized percepts are not required for the generation of azimuthal percepts.

">In vivo cell-type and brain region classification via multimodal contrastive learning</a></h4>

              
                Current electrophysiological approaches can track the activity of many neurons, yet it is usually unknown which cell-types or brain areas are being recorded without further molecular or histological analysis. Developing accurate and scalable algorithms for identifying the cell-type and brain region of recorded neurons is thus crucial for improving our understanding of neural computation. In this work, we develop a multimodal contrastive learning approach for neural data that can be fine-tuned for different downstream tasks, including inference of cell-type and brain location. We utilize this approach to jointly embed the activity autocorrelations and extracellular waveforms of individual neurons. We demonstrate that our embedding approach, Neuronal Embeddings via MultimOdal contrastive learning (NEMO), paired with supervised fine-tuning, achieves state-of-the-art cell-type classification for an opto-tagged visual cortex dataset and brain region classification for the public International Brain Laboratory brain-wide map dataset. Our method represents a promising step towards accurate cell-type and brain region classification from electrophysiological recordings.

">Unraveling eye movement-related eardrum oscillations (EMREOs): how saccade direction and middle ear properties shape amplitude and time course</a></h4>

              
                Eye movement-related eardrum oscillations (EMREOs) reflect movements of the tympanic membrane that are known to scale with the magnitude and direction of saccades. While EMREOs have been consistently described in humans and non-human primates, many questions regarding this phenomenon remain open. Based on bilateral in-ear recordings in human participants we here probe a number of their properties that improve our understanding of the EMREOs' origin and functional significance. We show that the time courses are comparable between the left and right ears, and between paradigms guiding saccades by visual and auditory targets. However, the precise time course and amplitude differ significantly between ipsi- and contralateral saccades beyond the previously known phase-inversion described for saccades in opposing directions. Finally, we show that the EMREO amplitude is negatively related to the compliance of the tympanic membrane. These results altogether raise potential challenges for the interpretation of EMREOs in the light of a coordinate-alignment between vision and hearing. Furthermore, they support the notion that EMREOs largely reflect motor-related top-down signals that are relayed to the middle ear muscles in a differential principle similar as governing the execution of ipsi- and contralateral saccades.

">Presaccadic attentional shifts are not modulated by saccade amplitude</a></h4>

              
                Humans constantly explore the visual environment through saccades, bringing relevant visual stimuli to the center of the gaze. Before the eyes begin to move, visual attention is directed to the intended saccade target. As a consequence of this presaccadic shift of attention (PSA), visual perception is enhanced at the future gaze position. PSA has been investigated in a variety of saccade amplitudes, from microsaccades to locations that exceed the oculomotor range. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that PSA effects on visual perception are not equally distributed around the visual field. However, it remains unknown whether the magnitude of presaccadic perceptual enhancement varies with the amplitude of the saccades. Here, we measured contrast sensitivity thresholds during saccade planning in a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) discrimination task in human observers. Filtered pink noise (1/f) patches, presented at four eccentricities scaled in size according to the cortical magnification factor were used as visual targets. This method was adopted to mitigate well-known eccentricity effects on perception, thereby enabling us to explore the effects associated to saccade amplitudes. First, our results show that saccade preparation enhanced contrast sensitivity in all tested locations. Importantly, we found that this presaccadic perceptual enhancement was not modulated by the amplitude of the saccades. These findings suggest that presaccadic attention operates consistently across different saccade amplitudes, enhancing visual processing at intended gaze positions regardless of saccade size.

">Efficient laminar-distributed interactions and orientation selectivity in the mouse V1 cortical column</a></h4>

              
                The emergence of orientation selectivity in the visual cortex is a well-known phenomenon in neuroscience, but the details of such emergence and the role of different cortical layers and cell types, particularly in rodents which lack a topographical organization of orientation-selectivity (OS) properties, are less clear. To tackle this question, we use an existing biologically detailed model of the mouse V1 cortical column, which is constrained by existing connectivity data across cortical layers and between pyramidal, PV, SST and VIP cell types. Using this model as a basis, we implemented activity-dependent structural plasticity induced by stimulation with orientated drifting gratings, leading to a good match of tuning properties of pyramidal cells with experimentally observed OS laminar distribution, their evoked firing rate and tuning width. We then employed a mean-field model to uncover the role of co-tuned subnetworks in laminar signal propagation and explain the effects of intra- and inter- laminar coupling distributions. Our plasticity-induced modified model and mean-field model were able to explain both the excitatory enhancement through co-tuned subnetworks and inter-laminar disynaptic inhibition. Overall, our work highlights the importance of the clustering of neural selectivity features for effective excitatory transmission in cortical circuits.

">Inhibition of β-catenin signaling by Amyloid-β in endothelial cells impairs vascular barrier integrity</a></h4>

              
                Dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is emerging as a critical mediator of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) progression and precedes the formation of large Amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) plaques in AD patients. Maintenance of the blood brain barrier integrity by brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) is essential for brain homeostasis and is in part maintained by WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling. We hypothesized that A{beta} induces blood-brain barrier dysfunction by inhibiting WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling in brain endothelial cells, leading to reduced expression of BBB-related genes and barrier function. In brain endothelial cells, we found that A{beta} directly decreased {beta}-catenin transcriptional activity, but also inhibited activation of {beta}-catenin by the WNT3A peptide. Additionally, A{beta} reduced barrier integrity of ECs, which was in part restored by exposure to exogenous WNT3A. We observed A{beta}-induced inhibition within 3 hours of exposure. A{beta}-induced inhibition of {beta}-catenin signaling was consistent across both immortalized brain ECs and ECs differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells(iPSCs). We next investigated human iPSCs with and without the N141I mutation in presenilin-2 (PSEN2), known to increase A{beta} buildup and familial AD risk. We found the AD ECs showed smaller cell size and expressed lower VE-cadherin at the protein level. RNA sequencing revealed that the presence of PSEN2 N141I did not significantly impact gene expression of genes coding for proteins canonically involved in barrier integrity but did show differences in the expression of transposable elements. These results indicate that BBB dysfunction early in AD may be the result of A{beta} in the brain impairing WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling which maintains the barrier integrity of brain endothelial cells.

">A spatial single-cell atlas of the claustro-insular region uncovers key regulators of neuronal identity and excitability</a></h4>

              
                The claustro-insular region is an evolutionarily conserved and extensively interconnected brain area, critical for functions such as attention, cognitive flexibility, interoception, and affective processing. Despite its importance, its cellular composition and organization remain poorly characterized, hindering a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying its diverse functions. By combining single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, we created a high-resolution atlas of this region in mice, uncovering distinct neuronal subtypes and unexpected complexity. Leveraging this atlas, we investigated the role of NR4A2, a neuropsychiatric risk factor expressed in several claustro-insular neuronal subtypes. In an Nr4a2 haploinsufficiency model, we found that only claustrum neurons exhibited shifts in molecular identity. This identity shift, which involved the activation of a transcription factor cascade, was associated with alterations in neuronal firing activity. Our findings provide new insights into the cellular architecture of the claustro-insular region and highlights Nr4a2 as a master regulator of its component's identities.

">A cross-species analysis of neuroanatomical covariance sex difference in humans and mice</a></h4>

              
                Structural covariance in brain anatomy is thought to reflect inter-regional sharing of developmental influences - although this hypothesis has proved hard to causally test. Here, we use neuroimaging in humans and mice to study sex-differences in anatomical covariance - asking if regions that have developed shared sex differences in volume across species also show shared sex difference in volume covariance. The study design illuminates both the biology of sex-differences and theoretical models for anatomical covariance -- benefitting from tests of inter-species convergence. We find that volumetric structural covariance is stronger in adult females compared to adult males for both wild-type mice and healthy human subjects: 98% of all comparisons with statistically significant covariance sex differences in mice are female-biased, while 76% of all such comparisons are female-biased in humans (q < 0.05). In both species, a region's covariance and volumetric sex-biases have weak inverse relationships to each other: volumetrically male-biased regions contain more female-biased covariation, while volumetrically female-biased regions have more male-biased covariation (mice: r = -0.185, p = 0.002; humans: r = -0.189, p = 0.001). Our results identify a conserved tendency for females to show stronger neuroanatomical covariance than males, evident across species, which suggests that stronger structural covariance in females could be an evolutionarily conserved feature that is partially related to volumetric alterations through sex.

">DNA replication fork speed Acts as an Engine in Cortical Neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                DNA fork speed, the rate of replication fork progression, has emerged as a cellular plasticity regulator, however, for its role in neurogenesis has never been explored before. Here, we show that fork speed was increased as neural progenitors-radial glial cells (RGCs) transition from symmetric to asymmetric divisions. After selectively deleting mini-chromosome maintenance complex (MCMs)-binding protein (MCMBP), fork speed was increased in RGCs, resulted in widespread apoptosis, DNA damage and micronuclei at later stage of neurogenesis, which triggered p53 activation and led to microcephaly. Further, co-deletion of Trp53 with Mcmbp largely rescued brain phenotype, however, fork speed became faster, unexpectedly resulting in massive RGCs detachment from their resident place. Mechanistically, MCM3 can interact with p53 mediating centrosome biogenesis to anchor RGCs during DNA replication. Finally, behavior analysis indicated that fast fork speed led to an anxiety-like behavior in mice. Altogether, our results illuminate an unrecognized role about DNA fork speed in corticogenesis.

">Selective Enhancement of the Interneuron Network and Gamma-Band Power via GluN2C/GluN2D NMDA Receptor Potentiation</a></h4>

              
                N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) comprise a family of ligand-gated ionotropic glutamate receptors that mediate a slow, calcium-permeable component to excitatory neurotransmission. The GluN2D subunit is enriched in GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in cortical tissue. Diminished levels of GABAergic inhibition contribute to multiple neuropsychiatric conditions, suggesting that enhancing inhibition may have therapeutic utility, thus making GluN2D modulation an attractive drug target. Here, we describe the actions of a GluN2C/GluN2D-selective positive allosteric modulator (PAM), (+)-EU1180-453, which has improved drug-like properties such as increased aqueous solubility compared to the first-in-class GluN2C/GluN2D-selective prototypical PAM (+)-CIQ. (+)-EU1180-453 doubles the NMDAR response at lower concentrations (< 10 uM) compared to (+)-CIQ, and produces a greater degree of maximal potentiation at 30 uM. Using in vitro electrophysiological recordings, we show that (+)-EU1180-453 potentiates triheteromeric NMDARs containing at least one GluN2C or GluN2D subunit, and is active at both exon5-lacking and exon5-containing GluN1 splice variants. (+)-EU1180-453 increases glutamate efficacy for GluN2C/GluN2D-containing NMDARs by both prolonging the deactivation time and potentiating the peak response amplitude. We show that (+)-EU1180-453 selectively increases synaptic NMDAR-mediated charge transfer onto P11-15 CA1 stratum radiatum hippocampal interneurons, but is without effect on CA1 pyramidal cells. This increased charge transfer enhances inhibitory output from GABAergic interneurons onto CA1 pyramidal cells in a GluN2D-dependent manner. (+)-EU1180-453 also shifts excitatory-to-inhibitory coupling towards increased inhibition and produces enhanced gamma band power from carbachol-induced field potential oscillations in hippocampal slices. Thus, (+)-EU1180-453 can enhance overall circuit inhibition, which could prove therapeutically useful for the treatment of anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and other neuropsychiatric disorders.

">Mitochondrial dysfunction Impairs the Nuclear Pore Complex in Parkinson's Disease Pathogenesis</a></h4>

              
                The mislocalization of transcription factors and irregularities in the nuclear envelope of dopaminergic neurons affected by Parkinson's disease (PD) implicates the nuclear pore in disease pathogenesis. While mitochondrial dysfunction is an integral component of PD pathophysiology, the involvement of channel-forming nucleoporins (Nups) in mitochondrial dysfunction-related neurodegeneration has not been investigated. Here we have identified pathological changes in the levels and distribution of a set of Nups, which are key structural and functional components of the nuclear pore complex, in dopaminergic neuronal models of PD. We observed that mitochondrial dysfunction reduces the expression of these Nups and disrupts the localization of Ran GTPase in both in vitro and in vivo dopaminergic neuron models. Furthermore, the nuclear pore central channel component, Nup62, mislocalizes and accumulates in the cytoplasm of these neurons under mitochondrial stress conditions. Mitochondrial stress also interferes with classical nuclear export of proteins in dopaminergic neural cells. Notably, we observed Nup pathology and Ran gradient loss in nigral dopaminergic neurons of PD patient brains, which highlights the clinical relevance of nuclear pore dysfunction as a disease mechanism. These findings provide direct evidence of the critical role of Nup-related abnormalities in mitochondrial dysfunction-induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, ultimately connecting nuclear pore complex and nucleocytoplasmic transport dysregulation to cell death in the development of PD.

">Oral Boldine Administration Attenuates Glia Activation and Prevents Neuropathic Pain in a Murine Spared Nerve Injury Model</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain is present in about 20% of the population and is a major burden to the health care system. About 30-40% of these patients report neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is defined as pain caused by injury or disease of the somatosensory nervous system. Current available treatments for neuropathic pain have limited efficacy and substantial side effects. To address the need for more effective and safer treatments for neuropathic pain, this study aimed to test whether boldine, a naturally occurring alkaloid, could attenuate neuropathic pain in a murine model of spared nerve injury (SNI). We found that oral administration of boldine at 50 mg/kg body weight/day resulted in significant reduction of SNI-induced mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity. Boldine also corrected SNI-induced weight bearing deficits, which are an indication of spontaneous pain. Boldine significantly inhibited SNI-induced peripheral inflammation as indicated by reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in the serum. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that boldine reduced the number of reactive astrocytes and inhibited microglia activation in the dorsal horn of lumbar spinal cord. Boldine also reduced the mRNA level of pro-inflammatory markers including IL-1{beta} and TNF- in the lumbar spinal cord after SNI. Quantitative PCR showed that boldine inhibited the lipopolysaccharide-induced overexpression of inflammatory markers in primary mouse astrocytes and in BV-2 microglial cells. Our findings suggest that boldine may be a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of neuropathic pain, possibly through inhibition of glia activation and neuroinflammation.

                Three-dimensional (3D) microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are gaining popularity as brain-machine interfaces and platforms for studying electrophysiological activity. Interactions with neural tissue depend on the electrochemical, mechanical, and spatial features of the recording platform. While planar or protruding two-dimensional MEAs are limited in their ability to capture neural activity across layers, existing 3D platforms still require advancements in manufacturing scalability, spatial resolution, and tissue integration. In this work, we present a customizable, scalable, and straightforward approach to fabricate flexible 3D kirigami MEAs containing both surface and penetrating electrodes, designed to interact with the 3D space of neural tissue. These novel probes feature up to 512 electrodes distributed across 128 shanks in a single flexible device, with shank heights reaching up to 1 mm. We successfully deployed our 3D kirigami MEAs in several neural applications, both in vitro and in vivo, and identified spatially dependent electrophysiological activity patterns. Flexible 3D kirigami MEAs are therefore a powerful tool for large-scale electrical sampling of complex neural tissues while improving tissue integration and offering enhanced capabilities for analyzing neural disorders and disease models where high spatial resolution is required.

">Molecular impact of nicotine and smoking exposure on the developing and adult mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP) is associated with significant cognitive and behavioral effects on offspring. While neurodevelopmental outcomes have been studied for prenatal exposure to nicotine, the main psychoactive component of cigarette smoke, its contribution to MSDP effects has never been explored. Comparing the effects of these substances on molecular signaling in the prenatal and adult brain may provide insights into nicotinic and broader tobacco consequences that are developmental-stage specific or age-independent. Pregnant mice were administered nicotine or exposed to chronic cigarette smoke, and RNA-sequencing was performed on frontal cortices of postnatal day 0 pups born to these mice, as well as on frontal cortices and blood of the adult dams. We identified 1,010 and 4,165 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in nicotine and smoking-exposed pup brains, respectively (FDR<0.05, Ns = 19 nicotine-exposed vs 23 vehicle-exposed; 46 smoking-exposed vs 49 controls). Prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) alone was related to dopaminergic synapses and long-term synaptic depression, whereas MSDP was associated with the SNARE complex and vesicle transport. Both substances affected SMN-Sm protein complexes and postsynaptic endosomes. Analyses at the transcript, exon, and exon-exon junction levels supported gene level results and revealed additional smoking-affected processes. No DEGs at FDR<0.05 were found in adult mouse brain for any substance (12 nicotine-administered vs 11 vehicle-administered; 12 smoking-exposed vs 12 controls), nor in adult blood (12 smoking-exposed vs 12 controls), and only 3% and 6.41% of the DEGs in smoking-exposed pup brain replicated in smoking-exposed blood and human prenatal brain, respectively. Together, these results demonstrate variable but overlapping molecular effects of PNE and MSDP on the developing brain, and attenuated effects of both smoking and nicotine on adult versus fetal brain.

">Effects of HA1 (a Probucol Analogue) and ApoC3 siRNA on Lipoprotein-Amyloid Metabolism, Neurovascular Integrity and Cognitive Function in db/db Mice</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Background and aims Chronically elevated levels of circulating lipoprotein-amyloid-beta (Abeta) are implicated in the disruption of the blood-brain barrier and the initiation of a neurodegenerative cascade leading to Alzheimers disease (AD). Type 2 diabetes is associated with BBB dysfunction, dyslipidaemia, and an increased risk of AD. However, alterations in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL)-Abeta homeostasis and its downstream effects on the BBB in a diabetes context remain explored. This study aimed to 1) investigate, in a preclinical model of diabetes, the hypothesis that diabetes-induced impairments in TRL-Abeta metabolism might compromise BBB integrity and exacerbate cognitive function and behavioural changes, and 2) assess the efficacy of interventions that improve TRL catabolism, including probucol, HA1, and ApoC3 siRNA, to prevent disease progression by lowering circulating TRL-Abeta levels. Methods Five-week-old db/db mice underwent a 9- or 23-weeks dietary interventions with probucol, a probucol prodrug HA1, or a standard diet with four-weekly injections of ApoC3 siRNA. Db/+ mice served as negative controls for each treatment duration. Blood levels of Abeta and ApoB were measured using ELISA. Immunofluorescence imaging was used to quantify enterocytic levels of Abeta and ApoB, and assess changes in neurovascular integrity (IgG, PDGFRbeta, ZO1, occludin), neuroinflammation (GFAP, Iba1), and cerebral oxidative stress (8OHdG). Results Our results indicate that diabetes increased the abundance of plasma amyloid, specifically Abeta42, which correlated with enterocytic abundance, suggesting exaggerated postprandial excretion. Disrupted plasma amyloid homeostasis was associated with BBB breakdown, including diminished barrier function, and the loss of pericytes and astrocytes. Provision of the probucol analogue, HA1, normalised plasma and enterocytic amyloidemia concomitant with the preservation of the neurovascular junction. Treatment with ApoC3 siRNA attenuated plasma Abeta42 and modestly reduced neurovascular inflammation. Conclusion The findings further support the hypothesis that aberrant peripheral metabolism of lipoprotein-Abeta is associated with microvascular corruption and the development of anxiety-like behaviour. HA1 is more effective than probucol or ApoC3 siRNA in positively modulating lipoprotein-amyloid homeostasis in db/db mice and maintaining central capillary integrity.

">Microglia modulate cerebral blood flow and neurovascular coupling through ectonucleotidase CD39</a></h4>

              
                Microglia and the border-associated macrophages (BAMs) contribute to the modulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF), but the mechanisms have remained ill-defined. Here, we show that microglia regulate the CBF baseline and upsurges after whisker stimulation or intracisternal magna injection of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Genetic or pharmacological depletion of microglia reduces the activity-dependent hyperemia but not the cerebrovascular responses to adenosine stimulation. Notably, microglia repopulation corrects these CBF reactivity deficits. The microglial-dependent regulation of CBF requires the ATP-sensing P2ry12 receptor and the ectonucleotidase CD39 that initiates the breakdown of extracellular ATP. Pharmacological inhibition or microglia-specific deletion of CD39 simulates the CBF anomalies detected in microglia-deficient mice and reduces the rise of extracellular adenosine after whisker stimulation. Together, these results suggest that the microglial CD39-initiated conversion of extracellular ATP to adenosine is an important step in neurovascular coupling and the regulation of cerebrovascular reactivity.

">Neural coding of choice and outcome are modulated by uncertainty in orbitofrontal but not secondary motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and secondary motor cortex (M2) are both implicated in flexible reward learning but the conditions that differentially recruit these regions are not fully understood. We imaged calcium activity from single neurons in OFC or M2 during de novo learning of uncertain reward probability schedules. After controlling for experience, predictions of choice were decoded from M2 neurons with similar accuracy under all certainty conditions, but were more accurately decoded from OFC neurons under greater uncertainty. In M2, the proportion of outcome selective neurons decreased with uncertainty whereas this proportion remained stable in OFC, due to an increased recruitment of reward-selective neurons across levels of uncertainty. Decoding accuracy of both choice and outcome were positively correlated with indices of flexible strategy use in OFC, but not M2. Our results indicate that OFC neurons preferentially encode choices and outcomes under conditions of uncertainty that foster greater reliance on adaptive strategies.

">A neural network model that generates salt concentration memory-dependent chemotaxis in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                A neuroanatomical minimal network model was revisited to elucidate the mechanism of salt concentration memory-dependent chemotaxis observed in Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans memorizes the salt concentration during cultivation, manifesting a pronounced taste preference for this concentration. The right-side head sensory neuron, designated ASER, exhibits a response to a decrease in salt concentration. The basal level of glutamate transmission from ASER has been demonstrated to transiently increase and decrease when the current environmental salt concentrations are lower and higher, respectively, than that during previous cultivation. Given the sensitivity of excitatory/inhibitory glutamate receptors expressed on the postsynaptic AIY interneurons, it can be anticipated that the ASER-AIY synaptic transmission will undergo a reversal due to alterations in the basal glutamate release. The neural network model, derived with the hypothesis, reproduced the salt concentration memory-dependent preference behavior and revealed the modular neural circuit function downstream of ASE that is responsible for salt klinotaxis.

">Low dose of a non-urea selective GIRK channel activator improves hippocampal-dependent synaptic plasticity and memory disrupted by amyloid-β oligomers</a></h4>

              
                Increased neural activity characterizes early Alzheimers disease (AD), serving as a prognostic indicator for disease progression and cognitive decline. Mechanisms that drive this hyperactivity and their behavioral effects remain mostly unrevealed, although normalizing altered excitability levels has been shown to reverse cognitive impairment in early AD, both in animals and humans. Soluble amyloid-{beta} oligomers (oA{beta}) primary accumulate in limbic regions like hippocampus and induce neuronal hyperexcitability and subsequent cognitive deficits by impairing ion channel s function. Indeed, G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels -that control neuronal excitability- are greatly affected and their selective pharmacological activation has already been shown very effective to counteract oA{beta}-induced hyperexcitability and hippocampal dysfunction. However, GIRK gain-of-function in healthy animals disrupts learning, memory and underlying synaptic plasticity, greatly limiting its therapeutic potential in preclinical asymptomatic early AD patients. Therefore, GIRK-based pharmacological treatment needs further investigation to overcome these limitations. Here we tested two doses of a novel, more potent, and neuronal selective GIRK activator, VU0810464, in healthy and early oAB-generated AD male and female mice. Both doses normalized hippocampal synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation, LTP) and associated spatial object location memory (OLM) without sex dimorphism in AD animals. However, in healthy mice, low VU0810464 dose did not significantly alter LTP and OLM, whereas the high dose disrupted both. Our results suggest that the precise tuning of neural excitability with low dosing of VU0810464 might be a promising strategy to safely treat and prevent hippocampal overexcitation and upstreaming memory deficits in early preclinical asymptomatic phases of AD.

">EEG connectome-based predictive modeling of nonverbal intelligence level in healthy subjects</a></h4>

              
                Intelligence is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in successful behavioral and emotional regulation. Neuroimaging techniques coupled with machine learning algorithms have proven to be valuable tools for uncovering the neural foundations of individual cognitive abilities. Nevertheless, current electroencephalograph (EEG) studies primarily focus on classification tasks to predict the intelligence category of subjects (e.g., high, medium, or low intelligence), rather than providing quantitative intelligence level forecasts. Furthermore, the outcomes obtained are significantly impacted by the specific data processing pipeline chosen, which could potentially compromise result generalizability. In this study, we implemented a connectome-based predictive modeling approach on high-density resting state EEG data from healthy participants to predict their nonverbal intelligence level. This method was applied to three independently collected datasets (N = 255) with different functional connectivity methods, parcellation atlases, threshold p-values and curve fitting orders used to ensure the reliability of the findings. We found that the prediction accuracy expressed in terms of R2 varied significantly depending on the processing pipeline configuration, ranging from negative R2 values up to 0.27. The most consistent results across datasets were found in the alpha frequency band. Furthermore, we employed a computational lesioning approach to identify the valuable edges that made the most significant contribution to predicting intelligence. This analysis highlighted the crucial role of frontal and parietal regions in complex cognitive computations. Overall, these findings support and expand upon previous research, underscoring the close relationship between alpha rhythm characteristics and cognitive functions and emphasizing the critical consideration of method selection in result evaluation.

	<p>Background: Previous studies have demonstrated that mind wandering during incubation phases enhances post-incubation creative performance. Recent empirical evidence, however, has highlighted a specific form of mind wandering closely related to creativity, termed freely moving mind wandering (FMMW). In this study, we examined the behavioral and neural associations between FMMW and creativity. Methods: We initially validated a questionnaire measuring FMMW by comparing its results with those from the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART). Data were collected from 1316 participants who completed resting-state fMRI scans, the FMMW questionnaire, and creative tasks. Correlation analysis and Bayes factors indicated that FMMW was associated with creative thinking (AUT). To elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying the relationship between FMMW and creativity, Hidden Markov Models (HMM) were employed to analyze the temporal dynamics of the resting-state fMRI data. Results: Our findings indicated that brain dynamics associated with FMMW involve integration within multiple networks and between networks (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.11, pFDR &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The links between brain dynamics associated with FMMW and creativity were mediated by FMMW (c&amp;amp;rsquo; = 0.01, [&amp;amp;minus;0.0181, &amp;amp;minus;0.0029]). Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the relationship between FMMW and creativity, offering insights into the neural mechanisms underpinning this relationship.</p>

                <p>Adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) serotypes vary in how effectively they express genes across different cell types and brain regions. Here we report a systematic comparison of the AAV serotypes 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, and the directed evolution derived AAVrg, in the inferior colliculus (IC) and cerebellum. The AAVs were identical apart from their different serotypes, each having a synapsin promotor and expressing GFP (AAV-hSyn-GFP). Identical titers and volumes were injected into the IC and cerebellum of adult male and female mice, and brains were sectioned and imaged 2&nbsp;weeks later. Transduction efficacy, anterograde labeling of axonal projections, and retrograde labeling of somata were characterized and compared across serotypes. Cell-type tropism was assessed by analyzing the morphology of the GFP-labeled neurons in the cerebellar cortex. In both the cerebellum and IC, AAV1 expressed GFP in more cells, labeled a larger volume, and produced significantly brighter labeling than all other serotypes, indicating superior transgene expression. AAV1 labeled more Purkinje cells, unipolar brush cells, and molecular layer interneurons than the other serotypes, while AAV2 labeled a greater number of granule cells. These results provide guidelines for the use of AAVs as gene delivery tools in these regions.</p>

                Background Physical activity plays a crucial role in the health and well-being of older adults, positively influencing various aspects of their quality of life. This study aims to explore the relationship between physical activity and body segments, as well as the risk indices of non-communicable chronic diseases in healthy elderly individuals. Methods The analyzed variables include weekly physical activity, the Postural Correction Index (PCI), measured using the system developed by Portland State University (PSU), and predictors of non-communicable chronic diseases assessed through body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio. Results The results reveal a moderate positive relationship between physical activity and the PCI (r=0.45; p≤0.05), with significant correlations in specific components of the PCI, such as thoracic depression (r=0.51; p<0.01), anteroposterior shoulder alignment (r=0.51; p<0.01), and upper back (r=0.53; p<0.001). Conclusions It is concluded that physical activity has a significant positive impact on the posture of older adults, particularly in the trunk, contributing 40% to the improvement of PCI components. The PCI values obtained, exceeding 84.67 in men and 82.67 in women according to the PSU evaluation, underscore the effectiveness of physical activity in postural correction and the prevention of issues associated with chronic diseases.

                The health crisis caused by COVID-19 impacted the dynamics of the work of health professionals, specifically in nursing professionals who were aware of the essential need for care and a safe environment to reduce in-hospital risks and mortality indicators. The study aimed to analyze the scientific evidence on the lessons learned during the health crisis in the work of the nursing professional, and the analysis of scientific articles published between 2020 and 2023 in the Scopus databases, obtaining a total of 30 articles. The findings show that there is a need to adopt health contingency policies to respond to health crises, as well as to establish and apply coping strategies in health professionals to avoid the impact on their mental health. Additionally, it is important to recognize their role in society. In conclusion, contingency policies and coping strategies must be developed to ensure the safety and well-being of nursing professionals and prevent the impact on their mental health during health crises like the one caused by COVID-19. Furthermore, it is important to recognize and value the fundamental role of nursing professionals in disease prevention and care in society and continue to work on developing policies and support strategies for health professionals to ensure their safety and well-being during health crises.

                Background Glioblastoma is a highly infiltrative, currently incurable brain cancer. To date, translation of novel therapies for glioblastoma from the laboratory into clinical trials has relied heavily on in vitro cell culture and murine (subcutaneous and orthotopic) xenograft models using cells derived from the main bulk of patient tumours. However, it is the residual cells left-behind after surgery that are responsible for disease progression and death in the clinic. A lack of substantial improvements in patient survival for decades suggests commonly used murine xenograft models, a key step before clinical trials, do not reflect the biology of residual disease in patients. Methods To address this, we have developed the ‘Sheffield Protocol’ to generate ex vivo models that reflect both resected, and post-surgical residual disease from the same patient. The protocol leverages parallel derivation of inherently treatment-resistant glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) from ‘core’ and distant ‘edge’ regions through careful macrodissection of a large en bloc specimen, such as from a partial lobectomy for tumour, followed by tissue dissociation and propagation in serum-free media. Opportunistic en bloc specimen use can liberate the most distant infiltrative cells feasibly accessible from living patients. Results We provide an example illustrating that resected and residual disease models represent spatially divergent tumour subpopulations harbouring distinct transcriptomic and cancer stem cell marker expression profiles. We also introduce the ‘Sheffield Living Biobank’ of glioma models (SLB) that incorporates over 150 GSC lines from 60+ patients, including 44+ resected and residual models, which are available for academic use via MTA. Conclusions These models provide a novel tool to reduce animal xenograft usage by improving candidate drug triage in early preclinical studies and directly replacing animal studies for some therapies that are post-Phase 1+ clinical trial for other cancers/conditions to, ultimately, deliver more effective treatments for post-surgical residual disease in glioblastoma.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-6/v2?src=rss">An international, cross-sectional survey of preprint attitudes among biomedical researchers [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Preprints are scientific manuscripts that are made available on open-access servers but are not yet peer-reviewed. Although preprints are becoming more prevalent, uptake is not optimal. Understanding researchers’ opinions and attitudes toward preprints is valuable to optimize their use. Understanding knowledge gaps and researchers’ attitudes toward preprinting can assist stakeholders, such as journals, funding agencies, and universities, to use preprints more effectively. Here, we aimed to collect perceptions and behaviours regarding preprints across an international sample of biomedical researchers. Methods Corresponding authors of articles published in biomedical research journals were identified from a random sample of journals from the MEDLINE database. Their names and email addresses were extracted to invite them to our anonymous, cross-sectional survey, which asked participants questions about their knowledge, attitudes, and opinions regarding preprinting. Results The survey was completed by 730 respondents providing a response rate of 3.20% and demonstrated a wide range of attitudes and opinions about preprints with authors from various disciplines and career stages worldwide. Most respondents were familiar with the concept of preprints but most had not previously posted one. The lead author of the project and journal policy had the greatest impact on decisions to post a preprint, whereas employers/research institutes had the least impact. Supporting open science practices was the highest ranked incentive, while increasing authors’ visibility was the highest ranked motivation for publishing preprints. Conclusions Although many biomedical researchers recognize the benefits of preprints, there is still hesitation among others to engage in this practice. This may be due to the general lack of peer review of preprints and little enthusiasm from external organizations such as journals, funding agencies, and universities. Future work is needed to determine optimal ways to improve researchers’ attitudes through modifications to current preprint systems and policies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-837/v2?src=rss">Analysis of the dynamics of transition from non-colonization to colonization and Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in hemodialysis patients using Markov models. [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Hemodialysis patients are frequently colonized by Staphylococcus aureus, leading to severe infections with high mortality rates. However, little is known about transition from non-colonization to colonization or bacteremia over time. The aim was to analyze the behavior of S. aureus colonization, identifying the probability of transition from non-colonized to colonized state or bacteremia, and the influence of specific covariates. Methods The study was conducted in a dialysis unit associated with a tertiary care hospital in Medellín between October 2017 and October 2019. An initial measurement was taken to evaluate S. aureus colonization, and follow-up measurements were performed 2 and 6 months later. Bacteremia evolution was monitored for 12 months. A two-state recurrent continuous-time Markov model was constructed to model transition dynamics from non-colonization to S. aureus colonization in hemodialysis patients. Subsequently, the model was applied to a third state of bacteremia. Results Of 178 patients on hemodialysis, 30.3% were colonized by S. aureus. Transition intensity from non-colonization to colonization was three times higher (0.21; CI: 0.14-0.29) than from colonization to non-colonization (0.07; CI: 0.05-0.11). The colonization risk increased in patients with previous infections (HR: 2.28; CI: 0.78-6.68), hospitalization (HR: 1.29; CI: 0.56-2.99) and antibiotics consumption (HR: 1.17; CI: 0.53-2.58). Mean non-colonized state duration was 10.9 months, while in the colonized state was 5.2 months. In the 3-state model, it was found that patients colonized were more likely to develop S. aureus infection (13.9%). Conclusion A more likely transition from non-colonization to colonization was found, which increases with factors such as previous infection. In addition, the development of bacteremia was more likely in colonized than in non-colonized patients. These results underline the importance of surveillance and proper management of S. aureus colonization to prevent serious complications, such as bacteremia, and improve prognosis in this vulnerable population.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-237/v2?src=rss">Explicating collegiality and change management in neoliberalism during the dynamics of higher education institutions: : A Systematic Literature Review using PRISMA Checklist [version 2; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background This paper discusses the lack of references that comprehensively describe the changes in universities owing to the ideology of neoliberalism. This research also discusses how a university maintains its function and identity when the great wave of neoliberalism massively erodes collegiality as the original philosophy of the university through a case study of the neoliberalism ideology on higher education. This study also provides a comprehensive framework for higher education management and governance changes. Methods We selected all retrieved sources based on the keywords and analyzed all the documents we obtained. This study obtained data from Scopus retrieved on October 27, 2023, using the following keywords: (TITLE-ABS-KEY ("collegiality") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ("change management") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ("neolibelism")) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY ("higher education"). This study utilized bibliometric analysis to ensure a structured review of the literature on collegiality, change management, and neoliberalism in higher education. Results The findings show that organizational management, leadership, education, technology, curriculum, innovation, organizational change, decision-making, and human beings are significant trajectories of neoliberalism in higher education. Conclusions This study offers other constructs for accelerating leadership success in higher education. This relates to how change leadership can navigate changes resulting from neoliberal ideology.

                <p>by Zahra Razaghi-Moghadam, Fayaz Soleymani Babadi, Zoran Nikoloski</p>

The increasing availability of enzyme turnover number measurements from experiments and of turnover number predictions from deep learning models prompts the use of these enzyme parameters in precise metabolic engineering. Yet, there is no computational approach that allows the prediction of metabolic engineering strategies that rely on the modification of turnover numbers. It is also unclear if modifications of turnover numbers without alterations in the host’s transcriptional regulatory machinery suffice to increase the production of chemicals of interest. Here, we present a constraint-based modeling approach, termed Overcoming Kinetic rate Obstacles (OKO), that uses enzyme-constrained metabolic models to predict <i>in silico</i> strategies to increase the production of a given chemical, while ensuring specified cell growth. We demonstrate that the application of OKO to enzyme-constrained metabolic models of <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> results in strategies that can at least double the production of over 40 compounds with little penalty to growth. Interestingly, we show that the overproduction of compounds of interest does not entail only an increase in the values of turnover numbers. Lastly, we demonstrate that a refinement of OKO, allowing also for manipulation of enzyme abundance, facilitates the usage of the available compendia and deep learning models of turnover numbers in the design of precise metabolic engineering strategies. Our results expand the usage of genome-scale metabolic models toward the identification of targets for protein engineering, allowing their direct usage in the generation of innovative metabolic engineering designs for various biotechnological applications.

                <p>by Alireza Rezvani-Sharif, Hadi Lioe, Steven K. Dower, Matthias Pelzing, Con Panousis, Dalton J. E. Harvie, Ineke L. Muir</p>
Background <p>The kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) is a complex biochemical pathway that plays a crucial role in regulating several physiological processes, including inflammation, coagulation, and blood pressure. Dysregulation of the KKS has been associated with several pathological conditions such as hereditary angioedema (HAE), hypertension, and stroke. Developing an accurate quantitative model of the KKS may provide a better understanding of its role in health and disease and facilitate the rapid and targeted development of effective therapies for KKS-related disorders.</p> Objectives <p>Here, we present a novel, detailed mechanistic model of the plasma KKS, elucidating the processes of Factor XII (FXII) activation, the kallikrein feedback loop, cleavage of high molecular weight kininogen leading to bradykinin (BK) production, and the impact of inhibitors.</p> Methods <p>The model incorporates both surface and solution-phase reactions of all proteins in the KKS, describing how binding site concentration affects the rate of surface reactions. The model was calibrated and validated using a variety of published and in-house experimental datasets, which encompass a range of dextran sulphate (DXS) concentrations to initiate contact activation and various KKS inhibitors to block bradykinin production.</p> Results <p>Our mathematical model showed that a trace amount of activated FXII is required for subsequent FXII activation. The model also reveals a bell-shaped curve relationship between the activation of the KKS and the number of DXS surface binding sites. Simulations of BK generation in healthy and HAE plasma demonstrated the impact of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1inh) deficiency via increased peak BK levels and accelerated formation in HAE plasma. The efficacy of KKS inhibitors, such as CSL312, ecallantide, and C1inh, was also evaluated, with CSL312 showing the most potent inhibition of BK generation.</p> Conclusions <p>The present model represents a valuable framework for studying the intricate interactions within the plasma KKS and provides a better understanding of the mechanism of action of various KKS-targeted therapies.</p>

                <p>by David Kappel, Christian Tetzlaff</p>

Synapses in the brain are highly noisy, which leads to a large trial-by-trial variability. Given how costly synapses are in terms of energy consumption these high levels of noise are surprising. Here we propose that synapses use noise to represent uncertainties about the somatic activity of the postsynaptic neuron. To show this, we developed a mathematical framework, in which the synapse as a whole interacts with the soma of the postsynaptic neuron in a similar way to an agent that is situated and behaves in an uncertain, dynamic environment. This framework suggests that synapses use an implicit internal model of the somatic membrane dynamics that is being updated by a synaptic learning rule, which resembles experimentally well-established LTP/LTD mechanisms. In addition, this approach entails that a synapse utilizes its inherently noisy synaptic release to also encode its uncertainty about the state of the somatic potential. Although each synapse strives for predicting the somatic dynamics of its postsynaptic neuron, we show that the emergent dynamics of many synapses in a neuronal network resolve different learning problems such as pattern classification or closed-loop control in a dynamic environment. Hereby, synapses coordinate themselves to represent and utilize uncertainties on the network level in behaviorally ambiguous situations.

                <p>by Robert A. Barber, Jingyi Yang, Chenyue Yang, Oonagh Barker, Tim Janicke, Joseph A. Tobias</p>

Sexual selection, one of the central pillars of evolutionary theory, has powerful effects on organismal morphology, behaviour, and population dynamics. However, current knowledge about geographical variation in this evolutionary mechanism and its underlying drivers remains highly incomplete, in part because standardised data on the strength of sexual selection is sparse even for well-studied organisms. Here, we use information on mating systems—including the incidence of polygamy and extra-pair paternity—to estimate the intensity of sexual selection in 10,671 (>99.9%) bird species distributed worldwide. We show that avian sexual selection varies latitudinally, peaking at higher latitudes, although the gradient is reversed in the world’s most sexually selected birds—specialist frugivores—which are strongly associated with tropical forests. Phylogenetic models further reveal that the strength of sexual selection is explained by temperature seasonality coupled with a suite of climate-associated factors, including migration, diet, and territoriality. Overall, these analyses suggest that climatic conditions leading to short, intense breeding seasons, or highly abundant and patchy food resources, increase the potential for polygamy in birds, driving latitudinal gradients in sexual selection. Our findings help to resolve longstanding debates about spatial variation in evolutionary mechanisms linked to reproductive biology and also provide a comprehensive species-level data set for further studies of selection and phenotypic evolution in the context of global climatic change.

                <p>by Safia A. Essien, Ivanshi Ahuja, George T. Eisenhoffer</p>

Apoptotic cells can signal to neighboring cells to stimulate proliferation and compensate for cell loss to maintain tissue homeostasis. While apoptotic cell-derived extracellular vesicles (AEVs) can transmit instructional cues to mediate communication with neighboring cells, the molecular mechanisms that induce cell division are not well understood. Here, we show that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (Mif)-containing AEVs regulate compensatory proliferation via ERK signaling in epithelial stem cells of larval zebrafish. Time-lapse imaging showed efferocytosis of AEVs from dying epithelial stem cells by healthy neighboring stem cells. Proteomic and ultrastructure analysis of purified AEVs identified Mif localization on the AEV surface. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic mutation of Mif, or its cognate receptor CD74, decreased levels of phosphorylated ERK and compensatory proliferation in the neighboring epithelial stem cells. Disruption of Mif activity also caused decreased numbers of macrophages patrolling near AEVs, while depletion of the macrophage lineage resulted in a reduced proliferative response by the epithelial stem cells. We propose that AEVs carrying Mif directly stimulate epithelial stem cell repopulation and guide macrophages to cell non-autonomously induce localized proliferation to sustain overall cell numbers during tissue maintenance.

                Background Interrupted time-series (ITS) studies are commonly used to examine the effects of interventions targeted at populations. Suppression of ITS studies or results within these studies, known as reporting bias, has the potential to bias the evidence-base on a particular topic, with potential consequences for healthcare decision-making. Therefore, we aim to determine whether there is evidence of reporting bias among ITS studies. Methods We will conduct a search for published protocols of ITS studies and reports of their results in PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase up to December 31, 2022. We contact the authors of the ITS studies to seek information about their study, including submission status, data for unpublished results, and reasons for non-publication or non-reporting of certain outcomes. We will examine if there is evidence of publication bias by examining whether time-to-publication is influenced by the statistical significance of the study’s results for the primary research question using Cox proportional hazards regression. We will examine whether there is evidence of discrepancies in outcomes by comparing those specified in the protocols with those in the reports of results, and we will examine whether the statistical significance of an outcome’s result is associated with how completely that result is reported using multivariable logistic regression. Finally, we will examine discrepancies between protocols and reports of results in the methods by examining the data collection processes, model characteristics, and statistical analysis methods. Discrepancies will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Discussion These findings will inform systematic reviewers and policymakers about the extent of reporting biases and may inform the development of mechanisms to reduce such biases.

<p>We demonstrate the intricate network interactions that govern respiratory rhythm generation and airway motor activity, emphasizing the critical role of the postinspiratory complex (PiCo) in this complex circuitry.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The control of the respiratory rhythm and airway motor activity is essential for life. Accumulating evidence indicates that the postinspiratory complex (PiCo) is crucial for generating behaviors that occur during the postinspiratory phase, including expiratory laryngeal activity and swallowing. Located in the ventromedial medulla, PiCo is defined by neurons co-expressing two neurotransmitter markers (ChAT and Vglut2/Slc17a6). Here, we mapped the input–output connections of these neurons using viral tracers and intersectional viral-genetic tools. PiCo neurons were specifically targeted by focal injection of a doubly conditional Cre- and FlpO-dependent AAV8 viral marker (AAV8-Con/Fon-TVA-mCherry) into the left PiCo of adult Chat<sup>Cre/wt</sup>: Vglut2<sup>FlpO/wt</sup> mice, for anterograde axonal tracing. These experiments revealed projections to various brain regions, including the Cu, nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), Amb, X, XII, Sp5, RMg, intermediate reticular nucleus (IRt), lateral reticular nucleus (LRt), pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC), contralateral PiCo, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTg), pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg), periaqueductal gray matter (PAG), Kölliker–Fuse (KF), PB, and external cortex of the inferior colliculus (ECIC). A rabies virus (RV) retrograde transsynaptic approach was taken with EnvA-pseudotyped G-deleted (RV-SAD-G-GFP) to similarly target PiCo neurons in Chat<sup>Cre/wt</sup>: Vglut2<sup>FlpO/wt</sup> mice, following prior injections of helper AAVs (a mixture of AAV-Ef1a-Con/Fon oG and viral vector AAV8-Con/Fon-TVA-mCherry). This combined approach revealed prominent synaptic inputs to PiCo neurons from NTS, IRt, and A1/C1. Although PiCo neurons project axons to the contralateral PiCo area, this approach did not detect direct contralateral connections. We suggest that PiCo serves as a critical integration site, projecting and receiving neuronal connections implicated in breathing, arousal, swallowing, and autonomic regulation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23647?af=R">Dissecting the Hippocampal Regulation of Approach‐Avoidance Conflict: Integrative Perspectives From Optogenetics, Stress Response, and Epigenetics</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Psychiatric disorders are multifactorial conditions without clear biomarkers, influenced by genetic, environmental, and developmental factors. Understanding these disorders requires identifying specific endophenotypes that help break down their complexity. Here, we undertake an in-depth analysis of one such endophenotype, namely imbalanced approach-avoidance conflict (AAC), reviewing its significant dependency on the hippocampus. Imbalanced AAC is a transdiagnostic endophenotype, being a feature of many psychiatric conditions in humans. However, it is predominantly examined in preclinical research through paradigms that subject rodents to conflict-laden scenarios. This review offers an original perspective by discussing the AAC through three distinct lights: optogenetic modulation of the AAC, which updates our understanding of the hippocampal contribution to behavioral inhibition; the impact of environmental stress, which exacerbates conflict and strengthens the stress-psychopathology axis; and inherent epigenetic aspects, which uncover crucial molecular underpinnings of environmental (mal) adaptation. By integrating these perspectives, in this review we aim to underline a cross-species causal nexus between heightened hippocampal activity and avoidance behavior. In addition, we suggest a rationale to explore epigenetic pharmacology as a potential strategy to tackle AAC-related psychopathology. This review assumes greater significance when viewed through the lens of advancing AAC-centric diagnostics in human subjects. Unlike traditional questionnaires, which struggle to accurately measure individual differences in AAC-related dimensions, new approaches using virtual reality and computer games show promise in better focusing the magnitude of AAC contribution to psychopathology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1315/v1?src=rss">A new management strategy in reopening laminectomies for cases with spinal canal stenosis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background While a laminectomy is often mandated for spinal canal stenosis, foraminal stenosis may account for pain and functional limitations instead of central canal issues. Targeted treatment directed at this specific region may enhance patient outcomes. Methods Retrospective observational study of a total of 30 patients with previous decompression laminectomies for lumbar spinal canal stenosis were operated upon for foraminotomies from November 2012 to November 2018. The surgeries were clinically done, and EMG-confirmed nerve root compressions were treated with exact decompression techniques according to the anatomy and pathology in each case. Additionally, a systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines was conducted, utilizing Scopus and PubMed databases to identify studies on reoperation rates after decompression with or without fusion in lumbar spinal stenosis. Results The results were fearsome post-operatively, trying significant improvement in pain, functional status, and walking distance. Pain reduction was achieved in 80% of patients by an increase in the Carnovsky rating scale with evidence of improved pain reduction and walking endurance; this points to minimal resulting complications of one complete case of foot drop and three infective cases managed conservatively. It was shown in the systematic review that fusion surgeries lowered the rates of reoperations at the index level but increased those for adjacent segment reoperations, while decompression alone had higher index-level reoperation rates due to recurrent stenosis. Conclusion Most of the emphasis on foraminal stenosis, rather than traditional laminectomies, significantly reduces postoperative pain and improves functional outcomes. This strategy brings a promising alternative to the management of recurrent symptoms in patients with lumbar spinal canal stenosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96957">TMEM16 and OSCA/TMEM63 proteins share a conserved potential to permeate ions and phospholipids</a></h4>

              
                The calcium-activated TMEM16 proteins and the mechanosensitive/osmolarity-activated OSCA/TMEM63 proteins belong to the Transmembrane Channel/Scramblase (TCS) superfamily. Within the superfamily, OSCA/TMEM63 proteins, as well as TMEM16A and TMEM16B, are thought to function solely as ion channels. However, most TMEM16 members, including TMEM16F, maintain an additional function as scramblases, rapidly exchanging phospholipids between leaflets of the membrane. Although recent studies have advanced our understanding of TCS structure–function relationships, the molecular determinants of TCS ion and lipid permeation remain unclear. Here, we show that single mutations along the transmembrane helix (TM) 4/6 interface allow non-scrambling TCS members to permeate phospholipids. In particular, this study highlights the key role of TM 4 in controlling TCS ion and lipid permeation and offers novel insights into the evolution of the TCS superfamily, suggesting that, like TMEM16s, the OSCA/TMEM63 family maintains a conserved potential to permeate ions and phospholipids.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90930">Difficulty in artificial word learning impacts targeted memory reactivation and its underlying neural signatures</a></h4>

              
                Sleep associated memory consolidation and reactivation play an important role in language acquisition and learning of new words. However, it is unclear to what extent properties of word learning difficulty impact sleep associated memory reactivation. To address this gap, we investigated in 22 young healthy adults the effectiveness of auditory targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during non-rapid eye movement sleep of artificial words with easy and difficult to learn phonotactical properties. Here, we found that TMR of the easy words improved their overnight memory performance, whereas TMR of the difficult words had no effect. By comparing EEG activities after TMR presentations, we found an increase in slow wave density independent of word difficulty, whereas the spindle-band power nested during the slow wave up-states – as an assumed underlying activity of memory reactivation – was significantly higher in the easy/effective compared to the difficult/ineffective condition. Our findings indicate that word learning difficulty by phonotactics impacts the effectiveness of TMR and further emphasize the critical role of prior encoding depth in sleep associated memory reactivation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97883">Coupling of saccade plans to endogenous attention during urgent choices</a></h4>

              
                The neural mechanisms that willfully direct attention to specific locations in space are closely related to those for generating targeting eye movements (saccades). However, the degree to which the voluntary deployment of attention to a location necessarily activates a corresponding saccade plan remains unclear. One problem is that attention and saccades are both automatically driven by salient sensory events; another is that the underlying processes unfold within tens of milliseconds only. Here, we use an urgent task design to resolve the evolution of a visuomotor choice on a moment-by-moment basis while independently controlling the endogenous (goal-driven) and exogenous (salience-driven) contributions to performance. Human participants saw a peripheral cue and, depending on its color, either looked at it (prosaccade) or looked at a diametrically opposite, uninformative non-cue (antisaccade). By varying the luminance of the stimuli, the exogenous contributions could be cleanly dissociated from the endogenous process guiding the choice over time. According to the measured time courses, generating a correct antisaccade requires about 30 ms more processing time than generating a correct prosaccade based on the same perceptual signal. The results indicate that saccade plans elaborated during fixation are biased toward the location where attention is endogenously deployed, but the coupling is weak and can be willfully overridden very rapidly.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95846">Perturbations in eIF3 subunit stoichiometry alter expression of ribosomal proteins and key components of the MAPK signaling pathways</a></h4>

              
                Protein synthesis plays a major role in homeostasis and when dysregulated leads to various pathologies including cancer. To this end, imbalanced expression of eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) is not only a consequence but also a driver of neoplastic growth. eIF3 is the largest, multi-subunit translation initiation complex with a modular assembly, where aberrant expression of one subunit generates only partially functional subcomplexes. To comprehensively study the effects of eIF3 remodeling, we contrasted the impact of eIF3d, eIF3e or eIF3h depletion on the translatome of HeLa cells using Ribo-seq. Depletion of eIF3d or eIF3e, but not eIF3h reduced the levels of multiple components of the MAPK signaling pathways. Surprisingly, however, depletion of all three eIF3 subunits increased MAPK/ERK pathway activity. Depletion of eIF3e and partially eIF3d also increased translation of TOP mRNAs that encode mainly ribosomal proteins and other components of the translational machinery. Moreover, alterations in eIF3 subunit stoichiometry were often associated with changes in translation of mRNAs containing short uORFs, as in the case of the proto-oncogene MDM2 and the transcription factor ATF4. Collectively, perturbations in eIF3 subunit stoichiometry exert specific effect on the translatome comprising signaling and stress-related transcripts with complex 5’ UTRs that are implicated in homeostatic adaptation to stress and cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92737">Cell-autonomous targeting of arabinogalactan by host immune factors inhibits mycobacterial growth</a></h4>

              
                Deeper understanding of the crosstalk between host cells and <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) provides crucial guidelines for the rational design of novel intervention strategies against tuberculosis (TB). Mycobacteria possess a unique complex cell wall with arabinogalactan (AG) as a critical component. AG has been identified as a virulence factor of Mtb which is recognized by host galectin-9. Here, we demonstrate that galectin-9 directly inhibited mycobacterial growth through AG-binding property of carbohydrate-recognition domain 2. Furthermore, IgG antibodies with AG specificity were detected in the serum of TB patients. Based on the interaction between galectin-9 and AG, we developed a monoclonal antibody (mAb) screening assay and identified AG-specific mAbs which profoundly inhibit Mtb growth. Mechanistically, proteomic profiling and morphological characterizations revealed that AG-specific mAbs regulate AG biosynthesis, thereby inducing cell wall swelling. Thus, direct AG-binding by galectin-9 or antibodies contributes to protection against TB. Our findings pave the way for the rational design of novel immunotherapeutic strategies for TB control.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96155">Age-related decline in blood-brain barrier function is more pronounced in males than females in parietal and temporal regions</a></h4>

              
                The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a pivotal role in protecting the central nervous system (CNS), and shielding it from potential harmful entities. A natural decline of BBB function with aging has been reported in both animal and human studies, which may contribute to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders. Limited data also suggest that being female may be associated with protective effects on BBB function. Here, we investigated age and sex-dependent trajectories of perfusion and BBB water exchange rate (kw) across the lifespan in 186 cognitively normal participants spanning the ages of 8–92 years old, using a non-invasive diffusion-prepared pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (DP-pCASL) MRI technique. We found that the pattern of BBB kw decline with aging varies across brain regions. Moreover, results from our DP-pCASL technique revealed a remarkable decline in BBB kw beginning in the early 60 s, which was more pronounced in males. In addition, we observed sex differences in parietal and temporal regions. Our findings provide in vivo results demonstrating sex differences in the decline of BBB function with aging, which may serve as a foundation for future investigations into perfusion and BBB function in neurodegenerative and other brain disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93673">Reassessing the substrate specificities of the major Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan hydrolases lysostaphin and LytM</a></h4>

              
                Orchestrated action of peptidoglycan (PG) synthetases and hydrolases is vital for bacterial growth and viability. Although the function of several PG synthetases and hydrolases is well understood, the function, regulation, and mechanism of action of PG hydrolases characterised as lysostaphin-like endopeptidases have remained elusive. Many of these M23 family members can hydrolyse glycyl-glycine peptide bonds and show lytic activity against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> whose PG contains a pentaglycine bridge, but their exact substrate specificity and hydrolysed bonds are still vaguely determined. In this work, we have employed NMR spectroscopy to study both the substrate specificity and the bond cleavage of the bactericide lysostaphin and the <i>S. aureus</i> PG hydrolase LytM. Yet, we provide substrate-level evidence for the functional role of these enzymes. Indeed, our results show that the substrate specificities of these structurally highly homologous enzymes are similar, but unlike observed earlier both LytM and lysostaphin prefer the <span class="small-caps">D</span>-Ala-Gly cross-linked part of mature peptidoglycan. However, we show that while lysostaphin is genuinely a glycyl-glycine hydrolase, LytM can also act as a D-alanyl-glycine endopeptidase.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98458">Cryo-electron tomographic investigation of native hippocampal glutamatergic synapses</a></h4>

              
                Chemical synapses are the major sites of communication between neurons in the nervous system and mediate either excitatory or inhibitory signaling. At excitatory synapses, glutamate is the primary neurotransmitter and upon release from presynaptic vesicles, is detected by postsynaptic glutamate receptors, which include ionotropic AMPA and NMDA receptors. Here, we have developed methods to identify glutamatergic synapses in brain tissue slices, label AMPA receptors with small gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and prepare lamella for cryo-electron tomography studies. The targeted imaging of glutamatergic synapses in the lamella is facilitated by fluorescent pre- and postsynaptic signatures, and the subsequent tomograms allow for the identification of key features of chemical synapses, including synaptic vesicles, the synaptic cleft, and AuNP-labeled AMPA receptors. These methods pave the way for imaging brain regions at high resolution, using unstained, unfixed samples preserved under near-native conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98524">Nuclear translocation of SIRT4 mediates deacetylation of U2AF2 to modulate renal fibrosis through alternative splicing-mediated upregulation of CCN2</a></h4>

              
                TGF-β stimulates CCN2 expression which in turn amplifies TGF-β signaling. This process promotes extracellular matrix production and accelerates the pathological progression of fibrotic diseases. Alternative splicing plays an important role in multiple disease development, while U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 2 (U2AF2) is an essential factor in the early steps of pre-mRNA splicing. However, the molecular mechanism underlying abnormal <i>CCN2</i> expression upon TGF-β stimulation remains unclear. This study elucidates that SIRT4 acts as a master regulator for CCN2 expression in response to TGF-β by modulating U2AF2-mediated alternative splicing. Analyses of renal biopsy specimens from patients with CKD and mouse fibrotic kidney tissues revealed marked nuclear accumulation of SIRT4. The tubulointerstitial fibrosis was alleviated by global deletion or tubular epithelial cell (TEC)-specific knockout of <i>Sirt4</i>, and aggravated by adeno-associated virus-mediated SIRT4 overexpression in TECs. Furthermore, SIRT4 was found to translocate from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm through the BAX/BAK pore under TGF-β stimulation. In the cytoplasm, TGF-β activated the ERK pathway and induced the phosphorylation of SIRT4 at Ser36, which further promoted its interaction with importin α1 and subsequent nuclear translocation. In the nucleus, SIRT4 was found to deacetylate U2AF2 at K413, facilitating the splicing of CCN2 pre-mRNA to promote CCN2 protein expression. Importantly, exosomes containing anti-SIRT4 antibodies were found to effectively mitigate the UUO-induced kidney fibrosis in mice. Collectively, these findings indicated that SIRT4 plays a role in kidney fibrosis by regulating CCN2 expression via the pre-mRNA splicing.

	<p>Background: Accounting for dementia risk factors is essential in identifying people who would benefit most from intervention programs. The CAIDE dementia risk score is commonly applied, but its link to brain function remains unclear. This study aims to determine whether the variation in this score is associated with neurophysiological changes and cognitive measures in normative individuals. Methods: The sample comprised 38 participants aged between 54 and 79 (M = 67.05; SD = 6.02). Data were collected using paper-and-pencil tests and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in the resting state, channels FP1 and FP2. The EEG signals were analyzed using Power Spectral Density (PSD)-based features. Results: The CAIDE score is positively correlated with the relative power activation of the &amp;amp;theta; band and negatively correlated with the MMSE cognitive test score, and MMSE variations align with those found in distributions of EEG-extracted PSD-based features. Conclusions: The findings suggest that CAIDE scores can identify individuals without noticeable cognitive changes who already exhibit brain activity similar to that seen in people with dementia. They also contribute to the convergent validity between CAIDE and the risk of cognitive decline. This underscores the importance of early monitoring of these factors to reduce the incidence of dementia.</p>

	<p>Background: Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) represents one of the most common and debilitating effects in patients surviving after cancer treatments. Neurocognitive deficits are important causes of disability and burden in cancer survivors. The true magnitude of CRCI is difficult to define due to significant heterogeneity of literature data. At present, there is no agreement on the gold standard for detection and grading of CRCI in clinical trials, and there is a lack of clear knowledge of its pathophysiology. Objectives: In this review, we aim to discuss some perspectives for future research to pursue in order to cover the gaps in knowledge in the CRCI field. Methods: We focused our literature research on the following relevant issues: neuroradiological correlates of CRCI; objective neuropsychological evaluation and subjective complaint assessment and their correlation with objective measures; timing of assessment; and possible treatments. Results: The correct methodology for evaluating cognitive deficits induced by anti-tumor treatments still requires a definition based on quality scientific evidence, and literature data are currently scarce. Conclusions: This review highlights the need for further research to understand the causes and consequences of cancer-related cognitive impairment using standardized and sensitive measures of cognitive functions and the long-term effects of chemotherapy on cognitive functions and to develop effective interventions.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We prospectively studied asymptomatic <i>C9orf72</i> mutation carriers, identifying those developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We enrolled 56 asymptomatic family members (AFM) with a <i>C9orf72</i> mutation (AFM C9+), 132 non-carriers (AFM C9−), and 359 population-based controls. Using 3 T magnetic resonance imaging, we measured cortical thickness, gyrification, and subcortical volumes longitudinally. Linear mixed-effects models on non-converting AFM C9+ scans (n = 107) created a reference for these measurements, establishing individual atrophy patterns. Atrophy patterns from presymptomatic phenoconverters (n = 10 scans) served as a template for group comparisons and similarity assessments. Similarity with phenoconverters was quantified using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for cortical and Kullback–Leibler similarity (KLS) for subcortical measures. Using longitudinal similarity assessments, we predicted when participants would reach the average similarity level of phenoconverters at their first post-onset scan.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Five AFM C9+ converted to ALS or ALS-FTD. Up to 6 years before symptoms, these phenoconverters exhibited significant atrophy in frontal, temporal, parietal, and cingulate cortex, along with smaller thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala compared to other AFM C9+. Some non-converted AFM C9+ had high DSC and KLS, approaching values of phenoconverters, whereas others, along with AFM C9− and controls, had lower values. At age 80, we predicted 27.9% (95% confidence interval, 13.2–40.1%) of AFM C9+ and no AFM C9− would reach the same DSC as phenoconverters.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Distinctive atrophy patterns are visible years before symptom onset on presymptomatic scans of phenoconverters. Combining baseline and follow-up similarity measures may serve as a promising imaging biomarker for identifying those at risk of ALS or ALS-FTD. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Extensive research has been focused in the past century on structural, physiological, and molecular attributes of the hippocampus. This interest was created by the unique involvement of the hippocampus in cognitive and affective functions of the brain. Functional analysis revealed that the hippocampus has divergent properties along its axial dimension to the extent that the dorsal sector (dorsal hippocampus, DH) has different connections with the rest of the brain than those of the ventral sector (VH). Still, longitudinal pathways connect the DH with the VH and dampen the functional differences between the sectors. To be able to identify the intrinsic functional difference between the DH and VH, we produced dissociated monolayer cultures from prenatal DH and VH and examined their properties at 10–20 days after plating by imaging the spontaneous activity of the network using Fluo-2 AM, a calcium indicator. Surprisingly, while DH and VH sectors produced dissociated cultures with similar morphological attributes, VH cultures were more active spontaneously than DH cultures. Furthermore, when stimulated to produce action potentials, VH neurons triggered network bursts in postsynaptic neurons more often than DH cultures. Finally, in both DH and VH cultures, electrical stimulation of single cells produced network bursts in response to a burst of action potentials rather than to single spikes. These experiments indicate that even in dissociated cultures, neurons of the VH are more excitable and sensitive to electrical stimulation than DH; hence, they are more likely to generate network bursts and epileptic seizures, as suggested for in vivo brains.</p>

Jamison et al. show that IL-2 mutein-stimulated TR cells are highly activated and inhibit dendritic cell function via CTLA-4 and IL-10, leading to induction of anergic phenotype T cells in an autoimmune disease model.

                Plants frequently evade extreme environmental stress by initiating early flowering. Chen et al. show that VRF1 functions as a molecular switch that regulates the transition from drought tolerance to early flowering by modulating the proportion of different isoforms through alternative splicing.

                Background The response of heart rate to changes in exercise intensity is comprised of several dynamic modes with differing magnitudes and temporal characteristics. Investigations of empirical identification of dynamic models of heart rate showed that second-order models gave substantially and significantly better model fidelity compared to the first order case. In the present work, we aimed to reanalyse data from previous studies to more closely consider the effect of including a zero and a pure delay in the model. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of 22 treadmill (TM) and 54 cycle ergometer (CE) data sets from a total of 38 healthy participants. A linear, time-invariant plant model structure with up to two poles, a zero and a dead time is considered. Empirical estimation of the free parameters was performed using least-squares optimisation. The primary outcome measure is model fit, which is a normalised root-mean-square model error. Results A model comprising parallel connection of two first-order transfer functions, one with a dead time and one without, was found to give the highest fit (56.7 % for TM, 54.3 % for CE), whereby the non-delayed component appeared to merely capture initial transients in the data and the part with dead time likely represented the true dynamic response of heart rate to the excitation. In comparison, a simple first-order model without dead time gave substantially lower fit than the parallel model (50.2 % for TM, 47.9 % for CE). Conclusions This preliminary analysis points to a linear first-order system with dead time as being an appropriate model for heart rate response to exercise using treadmill and cycle ergometer modalities. In order to avoid biased estimates, it is vitally important that, prior to parameter estimation and validation, careful attention is paid to data preprocessing in order to eliminate transients and trends.

                Background We analysed the prevalence of depression under among pregnant women both in the immigrant and native populations in a Health Region of Spain, and evaluated the maternal factors associated with it. Methods We performed a retrospective observational cohort study in pregnant women in the Health Region of Lleida between 2012 and 2018. We analysed the following variables: age, body mass index (BMI), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, country of origin, and antidepressant drug prescribed. We performed a multivariate analysis and obtained the linear regression coefficients and their 95% confidence interval (CI). Results In a sample of 17177 pregnant women, 2.5% had a diagnosis of depression. The patients with depression had an average age of 32 years (SD 5.56) compared to the rest of the women who had an average age of 30 (SD 5.85) years of age. Obesity was present in 17.7% of patients with depression compared to 14.3% in the rest. A high percentage of women from Western Europe presented depression (2.9%); followed by women from Latin America (2.6%) and Eastern Europe (2.3%). The values for Africa, (0.8%) and Asia and the Middle East (0.5%) were significantly lower. We did not observe any relationship between depression and hypothyroidism, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Conclusions In our study, we found a prevalence of depression similar to the one found in other publications. As main risk factors, we identified age, weight, and geographical origin.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1312/v1?src=rss">The emergence of green finance a conceptual framework for environmental sustainability: innovation viewpoint [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background of the study This study intends to contribute to the continuing discussion about green economic growth by objectively investigating the consequences of clean energy generation, cutting-edge green practices, and ethical business on global sustainability. This study also examines how green finance laws effectively handle the financial limitations that companies face when pursuing green innovation. Green finance enables the development and implementation of sustainable business models, investments, trade, economic, environmental, and social projects through the effective utilization of financial resources. Methods This article offers a complete evaluation of the current state and advancements in green finance research using a mixed-methods approach, which includes bibliometric and qualitative analysis. We analysed a big dataset of research papers after entering the keywords into the Scopus database. Results This study found that green bank products include green securities, investments, climate financing, carbon finance, insurance, credit, and infrastructure bonds. Sustainability, sustainable development, investments, environmental economics, sustainable finance, green bonds, and the green economy dominate as a most prevalent theme. China has the strongest bibliometric linkages to other nations, followed by the US and UK. This study also examines whether green finance policies address firm financial restrictions while pursuing green innovation. VOS-viewer generates co-authorship-based keyword occurrence links and network maps. Conclusion Green finance strives to increase funding flows to sustainable development goals while mitigating environmental and social hazards. “Going green,” pricing, forecasting, modelling, picking the most efficient tool, and influencing investor behaviour toward environmentally friendly operations are all challenges. Environmental policies, interest rates, religion, risks, social inclusion, and banking laws all have an impact on bank green financing initiatives. The study’s main contribution is an overview of green finance breakthroughs for sustainability, which may help scholars and practitioners understand the trend and future research directions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1311/v1?src=rss">Global trends in research of Work-related musculoskeletal disorders among surgeons: Bibliometric analysis and visualization from 1991 to 2024 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Surgeons are highly exposed to Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). Assessing the prevalence of these disorders, both overall and by body area, has become a focus of interest, and numerous articles have been published on the subject. Methods Journal articles and reviews focused on WMSDs published until today and referenced in PubMed/Medline, ScienceDirect, Science.gov, Mendeley and Google Scholar were analysed. VOSviewer version 1.6.20 and Microsoft Excel were used to perform a bibliometric and visualization analyses. Overall distribution of publications by year, sources with country and related indicators, research areas, authors with their affiliations, references and keywords were studied. Results Of the total 2338 items identified, 184 articles (174 articles and 10 reviews) published between 1991 and 2024 were included. Results showed an increase in the number of publications over the years, with a significant increase from 2016 onwards (R2 = 0.8693). The United States is the leader in the field, with 89 publications (37.6%) and 2,631 citations. Hallbeck MS (USA) is the most prolific author (11 publications and 601 citations). World Neurosurgery and Work were the journals with the highest number of publications (n=7). Applied ergonomics has the highest number of citations. Medicine is the research area most present. Epstein’s work has the most citations worldwide, while Park et al’s work is the most cited of the 184 studies considered. “Ergonomics”, “musculoskeletal disorders”, “surgeons”, and “work-related musculoskeletal disorders” are the keywords most used by authors. Their use increased significantly since 2016, with an average year of publication around 2020. Conclusions The study of WMSDs in surgeons is a young research topic that is evolving significantly. North America, Europe and Asia have been the main contributors, with the USA in the lead. Subjective prevalence analysis based on questionnaires and ergonomic assessment using quantitative tools are the two main lines of research.
