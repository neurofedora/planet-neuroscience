	<p>The cerebellopontine angle (CPA) is a highly complex anatomical compartment consisting of numerous nervous and vascular structures that present mutual and intricate spatial relationships. CPA surgery represents, therefore, a constant challenge for neurosurgeons. Over the years, neurosurgeons have developed and refined several solutions with the aim of maximizing the surgical treatment effects while minimizing the invasiveness and risks for the patient. In this paper, we present our integrated approach to CPA surgery, describing its advantages in treating pathologies in this anatomical district. Our approach incorporates the use of technology, such as neuronavigation, along with advanced and multimodal intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) techniques, with the final goal of making this surgery safe and effective.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Variation in TAF1 Expression in Female Carrier-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells and Human Brain Ontogeny Has Implications for Adult Neostriatum Vulnerability in X-Linked Dystonia Parkinsonism</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) is an inherited, X-linked, adult-onset movement disorder characterized by degeneration in the neostriatum. No therapeutics alter disease progression. The mechanisms underlying regional differences in degeneration and adult onset are unknown. Developing therapeutics requires a deeper understanding of how XDP-relevant features vary in health and disease. XDP is possibly due, in part, to a partial loss of <I>TAF1</I> function. A disease-specific SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposon insertion occurs within intron 32 of <I>TAF1</I>, a subunit of TFIID involved in transcription initiation. While all XDP males are usually clinically affected, females are heterozygous carriers generally not manifesting the full syndrome. As a resource for disease modeling, we characterized eight iPSC lines from three XDP female carrier individuals for X chromosome inactivation (XCI) status and identified clonal lines that express either the wild-type X or XDP haplotype. Furthermore, we characterized XDP-relevant transcript expression in neurotypical humans, and found that SVA-F expression decreases after 30 years of age in the brain and that <I>TAF1</I> is decreased in most female samples. Uniquely in the caudate nucleus, <I>TAF1</I> expression is not sexually dimorphic and decreased after adolescence. These findings indicate that regional-specific, age-specific, and sex-specific mechanisms regulate <I>TAF1</I>, highlighting the importance of disease-relevant models and postmortem tissue. We propose that the decreased <I>TAF1</I> expression in the adult caudate may synergize with the XDP-specific partial loss of <I>TAF1</I> function in patients, thereby passing a minimum threshold of <I>TAF1</I> function, and triggering degeneration in the neostriatum.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Uncovering the Locus of Object-Context-Based Modulations in Depth Processing Using Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Neural responses of dorsal visual area V7 and lateral occipital complex (LOC) have been shown to correlate with changes in behavioral metrics of depth sensitivity observed as a function of object context, although it is unclear as to whether the behavioral manifestation results from an alteration of early depth-specific responses in V7 or arises as a result of alterations of object-level representations at LOC that subsequently feed back to affect disparity readouts in dorsal cortex. Here, we used online transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to examine the roles of these two areas in giving rise to context&ndash;disparity interactions. Stimuli were disparity-defined geometric objects rendered as random-dot stereograms, presented in geometrically plausible and implausible variations. Observers&rsquo; sensitivity to depth (depth discrimination) or object identity (plausibility discrimination) was indexed while receiving repetitive TMS at one of the two sites of interest (V7, LOC) along with a control site (Cz). TMS over LOC produced results no different from TMS over baseline Cz (and prior no-TMS behavioral work). That is, depth sensitivity was higher for implausible versus plausible objects. Strikingly, TMS over V7 abolished differences in depth sensitivity for implausible versus plausible objects. V7 serves as a key locus in bringing stereosensitivity changes because of object context, perhaps by reweighing stereoscopic data en route to informing object&ndash;motoric interactions.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">What is the nature of motor adaptation to dynamic perturbations?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Etienne Moullet, Agnès Roby-Brami, Emmanuel Guigon</p>

When human participants repeatedly encounter a velocity-dependent force field that distorts their movement trajectories, they adapt their motor behavior to recover straight trajectories. Computational models suggest that adaptation to a force field occurs at the action selection level through changes in the mapping between goals and actions. The quantitative prediction from these models indicates that early perturbed trajectories before adaptation and late unperturbed trajectories after adaptation should have opposite curvature, i.e. one being a mirror image of the other. We tested these predictions in a human adaptation experiment and we found that the expected mirror organization was either absent or much weaker than predicted by the models. These results are incompatible with adaptation occurring at the action selection level but compatible with adaptation occurring at the goal selection level, as if adaptation corresponds to aiming toward spatially remapped targets.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Reconstructing the course of the COVID-19 epidemic over 2020 for US states and counties: Results of a Bayesian evidence synthesis model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Melanie H. Chitwood, Marcus Russi, Kenneth Gunasekera, Joshua Havumaki, Fayette Klaassen, Virginia E. Pitzer, Joshua A. Salomon, Nicole A. Swartwood, Joshua L. Warren, Daniel M. Weinberger, Ted Cohen, Nicolas A. Menzies</p>

Reported COVID-19 cases and deaths provide a delayed and incomplete picture of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United States (US). Accurate estimates of both the timing and magnitude of infections are needed to characterize viral transmission dynamics and better understand COVID-19 disease burden. We estimated time trends in SARS-CoV-2 transmission and other COVID-19 outcomes for every county in the US, from the first reported COVID-19 case in January 13, 2020 through January 1, 2021. To do so we employed a Bayesian modeling approach that explicitly accounts for reporting delays and variation in case ascertainment, and generates daily estimates of incident SARS-CoV-2 infections on the basis of reported COVID-19 cases and deaths. The model is freely available as the <i>covidestim</i> R package. Nationally, we estimated there had been 49 million symptomatic COVID-19 cases and 404,214 COVID-19 deaths by the end of 2020, and that 28% of the US population had been infected. There was county-level variability in the timing and magnitude of incidence, with local epidemiological trends differing substantially from state or regional averages, leading to large differences in the estimated proportion of the population infected by the end of 2020. Our estimates of true COVID-19 related deaths are consistent with independent estimates of excess mortality, and our estimated trends in cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection are consistent with trends in seroprevalence estimates from available antibody testing studies. Reconstructing the underlying incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections across US counties allows for a more granular understanding of disease trends and the potential impact of epidemiological drivers.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">WhichTF is functionally important in your open chromatin data?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yosuke Tanigawa, Ethan S. Dyer, Gill Bejerano</p>

We present WhichTF, a computational method to identify functionally important transcription factors (TFs) from chromatin accessibility measurements. To rank TFs, WhichTF applies an ontology-guided functional approach to compute novel enrichment by integrating accessibility measurements, high-confidence pre-computed conservation-aware TF binding sites, and putative gene-regulatory models. Comparison with prior sheer abundance-based methods reveals the unique ability of WhichTF to identify context-specific TFs with functional relevance, including NF-κB family members in lymphocytes and GATA factors in cardiac cells. To distinguish the transcriptional regulatory landscape in closely related samples, we apply differential analysis and demonstrate its utility in lymphocyte, mesoderm developmental, and disease cells. We find suggestive, under-characterized TFs, such as RUNX3 in mesoderm development and GLI1 in systemic lupus erythematosus. We also find TFs known for stress response, suggesting routine experimental caveats that warrant careful consideration. WhichTF yields biological insight into known and novel molecular mechanisms of TF-mediated transcriptional regulation in diverse contexts, including human and mouse cell types, cell fate trajectories, and disease-associated cells.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Analysis of differences and commonalities in wildlife hunting across the Africa-Europe South-North gradient</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mona Estrella Bachmann, Lars Kulik, Tsegaye Gatiso, Martin Reinhardt Nielsen, Dagmar Haase, Marco Heurich, Ana Buchadas, Lukas Bösch, Dustin Eirdosh, Andreas Freytag, Jonas Geldmann, Arash Ghoddousi, Thurston Cleveland Hicks, Isabel Ordaz-Németh, Siyu Qin, Tenekwetche Sop, Suzanne van Beeck Calkoen, Karsten Wesche, Hjalmar S. Kühl</p>

Hunting and its impacts on wildlife are typically studied regionally, with a particular focus on the Global South. Hunting can, however, also undermine rewilding efforts or threaten wildlife in the Global North. Little is known about how hunting manifests under varying socioeconomic and ecological contexts across the Global South and North. Herein, we examined differences and commonalities in hunting characteristics across an exemplary Global South-North gradient approximated by the Human Development Index (HDI) using face-to-face interviews with 114 protected area (PA) managers in 25 African and European countries. Generally, we observed that hunting ranges from the illegal, economically motivated, and unsustainable hunting of herbivores in the South to the legal, socially and ecologically motivated hunting of ungulates within parks and the illegal hunting of mainly predators outside parks in the North. Commonalities across this Africa-Europe South-North gradient included increased conflict-related killings in human-dominated landscapes and decreased illegal hunting with beneficial community conditions, such as mutual trust resulting from community involvement in PA management. Nevertheless, local conditions cannot outweigh the strong effect of the HDI on unsustainable hunting. Our findings highlight regional challenges that require collaborative, integrative efforts in wildlife conservation across actors, while identified commonalities may outline universal mechanisms for achieving this goal.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Variations in sexual network connectivity may explain dramatic variations in sexually transmitted infection prevalence between populations and over time: a selected four-country analysis [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has been noted to vary dramatically between population groups and over time. Here, the hypothesis that changes in network connectivity underpin these changes is explored. Methods: The incidence/prevalence estimates of HIV, herpes simplex virus-2, syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhoea, as well as two markers of sexual network connectivity (partner concurrency and multiple partnering) by ethnic group and sexual orientation in Kenya, South Africa, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (USA) were extracted from published studies. Pearson’s correlation was used to test the association between the markers of network connectivity and the incidence/prevalence of these five STIs. A literature review was performed to evaluate the possible causes of the increases and decreases in syphilis incidence over the past 60 years. Results: In each country, the five STIs were found to cluster in particular ethnic groups and sexual orientations and to be positively associated with the two markers of network connectivity. Syphilis incidence in the UK and USA was found to increase dramatically in the 1960s/1970s, decline in the 1980s and again increase in the late 1990s. These changes took place predominantly in men who have sex with men, and were preceded by corresponding changes in network connectivity. The large decline in antenatal syphilis prevalence in Kenya and South Africa in the 1990s were likewise preceded by declines in network connectivity. Conclusions: Although other explanatory variables are not controlled for, the present analysis is compatible with the hypothesis that differential network connectivity is a parsimonious explanation for variations in STI incidence over time and between populations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Records of antibodies in breast milk in postpartum women who have been vaccinated or exposed to COVID-19: A systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Breast milk is a critical element in developing a baby's immunity through immune transfer. Antibodies are an essential unit of immunity against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This paper explores antibodies in breast milk in postpartum women who have been vaccinated or exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Duration of antibody appearance was studied to determine the adequate time in transferring antibodies by breastfeeding. Methods: Three databases, PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect, were used as sources of articles. Inclusion criteria applied in selecting articles were prospective observational study or experimental design study in English, evaluating antibodies in breast milk, and conducted between 2019–2021. Article quality and risk of bias were assessed with Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). The data found were synthesized in a narrative manner. Results: This systematic review included 20 articles. A total of 306 postpartum women who were infected with COVID-19, 20 postpartum women who had viral symptoms and 495 postpartum women who had been vaccinated were studied. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were found in the breast milk of infected and vaccinated postpartum women. SARS CoV-2 infection is associated with the presence of IgA dominant, whereas vaccination is related to the presence of IgG dominant. Antibodies persisted from day 10 of onset to 10 months in infected postpartum women and started from three days to six weeks in vaccinated postpartum women. Meta-analysis could not be carried out due to the variety of articles. Conclusions: Antibodies found in breast milk in infected and vaccinated postpartum women have different dominant types. Further research needs to be done regarding the mechanism of antibody transfer in breast milk, longer research duration and studies that directly examine the comparison of antibodies in breast milk in vaccinated and infected postpartum women.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Attitudes toward and knowledge of collaboration of dental and medical practice among medical students in Southern India: a cross-sectional questionnaire survey [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background:    Enhancing oral health care services provided through inter-professional collaboration between medical and dental practitioner is important, and even essential. The purpose of this study is to assess the attitude toward and knowledge of medical-dental collaborative practice among medical students attending colleges in Southern India. Methods:       A cross sectional questionnaire survey was conducted among medical students and interns of medical colleges in coastal South India with prior information and permission. The questionnaire consisted of 11 questions to assess attitude toward and knowledge of medical-dental collaborative practice. The demographic backgrounds of participants were also recorded. Chi square test was employed for data analysis. The responses obtained were correlated with age, gender and year of study of participants using Pearson’s correlation test Results:        A total 250 questionnaires were distributed and 234 responses were appropriately completed. Most of the students agreed that oral health was an integral part of systemic health, however participants disagreed on attending compulsory rotation in dentistry at a statistically significant level (p<0.05), moreover participants did not agree with physicians having an active role in motivating their patients for regular dental check-up. 82% of the medical students believe that dental check-up should be included in health packages under health insurance. A statistically significant (p<0.05) difference was observed among 3 rd year & 4 th year students and interns and also it was found that female students provided more positive responses towards medical-dental collaboration. Conclusions:        Even though medical students showed fairly positive attitudes and knowledge towards dentistry, the analysis within the study groups showed that knowledge and attitudes regarding the collaborative practice worsened over the academic years among the medical students. In order to destigmatize and foster interprofessional collaboration which would contribute to higher resource efficiency and the standard of care, continuing education in both the disciplines would be highly beneficial.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Elevated shock index and modified shock index are associated with mortality and major adverse cardiac events in patients with acute myocardial infarction: A systematic review and meta-analysis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) have been studied extensively to predict unfavourable outcomes in patients suffering from an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Shock index (SI) and modified shock index (MSI) are two new emerging parameters that incorporate BP and HR into their calculations, thereby improving the predictive value of each HR and BP alone in AMI patients. Thus, our aim was to determine the prognostic utility of SI and MSI in AMI patients. Methods We searched PubMed, ProQuest, EBSCO Host, and Europe PMC from conception to May 2022. Studies were eligible if they evaluated the relationship of SI and MSI with all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiac events. Results A total of 16 studies involving 80,195 participants met the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. Our study revealed significantly higher all-cause mortality risk for patients with high SI and MSI compared to patients with low indices, regardless of the periods of outcomes, study population, or diverse cut-off values. Moreover, both increased SI and MSI also predicted higher major adverse cardiac event rates. Conclusions According to our findings, both SI and MSI in the emergency department can predict all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiac events in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Given this growing body of evidence, as well as the fact that SI and MSI are very simple objective indices derived from two readily available vital signs, they should be used in daily clinical practice to risk stratify patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction.

                How lncRNA-Lsd1 interplay affects cell differentiation remains unclear in vivo. Shao et al. identify three long hairpin RNAs as Lsd1-interacting non-coding RNAs (LINRs). LINRs function to support fly egg production. At the cellular level, LINR-2 modulates Lsd1 function to regulate cell-specific differentiation of GSCs and follicle progenitors during fly oogenesis.

Here, McKernan et al. identify an ABL-YB-1 signaling axis that regulates translation of ERBB2 and other metastatic targets and reveal that inhibition of this pathway decreases colonization and improves overall survival in mouse models of brain metastasis.

                Wennagel et al. show that depletion of huntingtin, the protein mutated in Huntington’s disease, uncouples spine size from activity so that there are larger spines despite reduced excitatory synaptic function. This uncoupling is due to LIMK-mediated cofilin inactivation, which reduces both actin turnover and AMPA receptor (AMPAR) recruitment to synapses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Non-canonical function of an Hif-1α splice variant contributes to the sustained flight of locusts</a></h4>

              
                The hypoxia inducible factor (Hif) pathway is functionally conserved across metazoans in modulating cellular adaptations to hypoxia. However, the functions of this pathway under aerobic physiological conditions are rarely investigated. Here, we show that Hif-1α2, a locust Hif-1α isoform, does not induce canonical hypoxic responses but functions as a specific regulator of locust flight, which is a completely aerobic physiological process. Two Hif-1α splice variants were identified in locusts, a ubiquitously expressed Hif-1α1 and a muscle-predominantly expressed Hif-1α2. Hif-1α1 that induces typical hypoxic responses upon hypoxia exposure remains inactive during flight. By contrast, the expression of Hif-1α2, which lacks C-terminal transactivation domain, is less sensitive to oxygen tension but induced extensively by flying. Hif-1α2 regulates physiological processes involved in glucose metabolism and antioxidation during flight and sustains flight endurance by maintaining redox homeostasis through upregulating the production of a reactive oxygen species (ROS) quencher, DJ-1. Overall, this study reveals a novel Hif-mediated mechanism underlying prolonged aerobic physiological activity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nuclear fascin regulates cancer cell survival</a></h4>

              
                Fascin is an important regulator of F-actin bundling leading to enhanced filopodia assembly. Fascin is also overexpressed in most solid tumours where it supports invasion through control of F-actin structures at the periphery and nuclear envelope. Recently, fascin has been identified in the nucleus of a broad range of cell types but the contributions of nuclear fascin to cancer cell behaviour remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that fascin bundles F-actin within the nucleus to support chromatin organisation and efficient DDR. Fascin associates directly with phosphorylated Histone H3 leading to regulated levels of nuclear fascin to support these phenotypes. Forcing nuclear fascin accumulation through the expression of nuclear-targeted fascin-specific nanobodies or inhibition of Histone H3 kinases results in enhanced and sustained nuclear F-actin bundling leading to reduced invasion, viability, and nuclear fascin-specific/driven apoptosis. These findings represent an additional important route through which fascin can support tumourigenesis and provide insight into potential pathways for targeted fascin-dependent cancer cell killing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">p75NTR prevents the onset of cerebellar granule cell migration via RhoA activation</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal migration is one of the fundamental processes during brain development. Several neurodevelopmental disorders can be traced back to dysregulated migration. Although substantial efforts have been placed in identifying molecular signals that stimulate migration, little is known about potential mechanisms that restrict migration. These restrictive mechanisms are essential for proper development since it helps coordinate the timing for each neuronal population to arrive and establish proper connections. Moreover, preventing migration away from a proliferative niche is necessary in maintaining a pool of proliferating cells until the proper number of neuronal progenitors is attained. Here, using mice and rats, we identify an anti-migratory role for the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) in cerebellar development. Our results show that granule cell precursors (GCPs) robustly express p75NTR in the external granule layer (EGL) when they are proliferating during postnatal development, however, they do not express p75NTR when they migrate either from the rhombic lip during embryonic development or from the EGL during postnatal development. We show that p75NTR prevented GCP migration by maintaining elevated levels of active RhoA. The expression of p75NTR was sufficient to prevent the migration of the granule cells even in the presence of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), a well-established chemotactic signal for this cell population. Our findings suggest that the expression of p75NTR might be a critical signal that stops and maintains the GCPs in the proliferative niche of the EGL, by promoting the clonal expansion of cerebellar granule neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fast, high-throughput production of improved rabies viral vectors for specific, efficient and versatile transsynaptic retrograde labeling</a></h4>

              
                To understand the function of neuronal circuits it is crucial to disentangle the connectivity patterns within the network. However, most tools currently used to explore connectivity have low throughput, low selectivity, or limited accessibility. Here, we report the development of an improved packaging system for the production of the highly neurotropic RVdG­­<sub>envA</sub>-CVS-N2c rabies viral vectors, yielding titers orders of magnitude higher with no background contamination, at a fraction of the production time, while preserving the efficiency of transsynaptic labeling. Along with the production pipeline, we developed suites of 'starter' AAV and bicistronic RVdG­­-CVS-N2c vectors, enabling retrograde labeling from a wide range of neuronal populations, tailored for diverse experimental requirements. We demonstrate the power and flexibility of the new system by uncovering hidden local and distal inhibitory connections in the mouse hippocampal formation and by imaging the functional properties of a cortical microcircuit across weeks. Our novel production pipeline provides a convenient approach to generate new rabies vectors, while our toolkit flexibly and efficiently expands the current capacity to label, manipulate and image the neuronal activity of interconnected neuronal circuits <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dynamic molecular evolution of a supergene with suppressed recombination in white-throated sparrows</a></h4>

              
                In white-throated sparrows, two alternative morphs differing in plumage and behavior segregate with a large chromosomal rearrangement. As with sex chromosomes such as the mammalian Y, the rearranged version of chromosome two (ZAL2<sup>m</sup>) is in a near-constant state of heterozygosity, offering opportunities to investigate both degenerative and selective processes during the early evolutionary stages of ‘supergenes.’ Here, we generated, synthesized, and analyzed extensive genome-scale data to better understand the forces shaping the evolution of the ZAL2 and ZAL2<sup>m</sup> chromosomes in this species. We found that features of ZAL2<sup>m</sup> are consistent with substantially reduced recombination and low levels of degeneration. We also found evidence that selective sweeps took place both on ZAL2<sup>m</sup> and its standard counterpart, ZAL2, after the rearrangement event. Signatures of positive selection were associated with allelic bias in gene expression, suggesting that antagonistic selection has operated on gene regulation. Finally, we discovered a region exhibiting long-range haplotypes inside the rearrangement on ZAL2<sup>m</sup>. These haplotypes appear to have been maintained by balancing selection, retaining genetic diversity within the supergene. Together, our analyses illuminate mechanisms contributing to the evolution of a young chromosomal polymorphism, revealing complex selective processes acting concurrently with genetic degeneration to drive the evolution of supergenes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A moonlighting function of a chitin polysaccharide monooxygenase, CWR-1, in Neurospora crassa allorecognition</a></h4>

              
                Organisms require the ability to differentiate themselves from organisms of different or even the same species. Allorecognition processes in filamentous fungi are essential to ensure identity of an interconnected syncytial colony to protect it from exploitation and disease. <i>Neurospora crassa</i> has three cell fusion checkpoints controlling formation of an interconnected mycelial network. The locus that controls the second checkpoint, which allows for cell wall dissolution and subsequent fusion between cells/hyphae, <i>cwr</i> (cell wall remodeling), encodes two linked genes, <i>cwr-1</i> and <i>cwr-2</i>. Previously, it was shown that <i>cwr-1</i> and <i>cwr-2</i> show severe linkage disequilibrium with six different haplogroups present in <i>N. crassa</i> populations. Isolates from an identical <i>cwr</i> haplogroup show robust fusion, while somatic cell fusion between isolates of different haplogroups is significantly blocked in cell wall dissolution. The <i>cwr-1</i> gene encodes a putative polysaccharide monooxygenase (PMO). Herein we confirm that CWR-1 is a C1-oxidizing chitin PMO. We show that the catalytic (PMO) domain of CWR-1 was sufficient for checkpoint function and cell fusion blockage; however, through analysis of active-site, histidine-brace mutants, the catalytic activity of CWR-1 was ruled out as a major factor for allorecognition. Swapping a portion of the PMO domain (V86 to T130) did not switch <i>cwr</i> haplogroup specificity, but rather cells containing this chimera exhibited a novel haplogroup specificity. Allorecognition to mediate cell fusion blockage is likely occurring through a protein-protein interaction between CWR-1 with CWR-2. These data highlight a moonlighting role in allorecognition of the CWR-1 PMO domain.

                Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has revolutionized cognitive neuroscience, but methodological barriers limit the generalizability of findings from the lab to the real world. Here, we present Neuroscout, an end-to-end platform for analysis of naturalistic fMRI data designed to facilitate the adoption of robust and generalizable research practices. Neuroscout leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models to automatically annotate stimuli from dozens of fMRI studies using naturalistic stimuli-such as movies and narratives-allowing researchers to easily test neuroscientific hypotheses across multiple ecologically-valid datasets. In addition, Neuroscout builds on a robust ecosystem of open tools and standards to provide an easy-to-use analysis builder and a fully automated execution engine that reduce the burden of reproducible research. Through a series of meta-analytic case studies, we validate the automatic feature extraction approach and demonstrate its potential to support more robust fMRI research. Owing to its ease of use and a high degree of automation, Neuroscout makes it possible to overcome modeling challenges commonly arising in naturalistic analysis and to easily scale analyses within and across datasets, democratizing generalizable fMRI research.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Integrating genomic and epidemiologic data to accelerate progress toward schistosomiasis elimination</a></h4>

              
                The global community has adopted ambitious goals to eliminate schistosomiasis as a public health problem, and new tools are needed to achieve them. Mass drug administration programs, for example, have reduced the burden of schistosomiasis, but the identification of hotspots of persistent and reemergent transmission threaten progress toward elimination and underscore the need to couple treatment with interventions that reduce transmission. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies make whole-genome sequencing a valuable and increasingly feasible option for population-based studies of complex parasites such as schistosomes. Here, we focus on leveraging genomic data to tailor interventions to distinct social and ecological circumstances. We consider two priority questions that can be addressed by integrating epidemiological, ecological, and genomic information: (1) how often do non-human host species contribute to human schistosome infection? and (2) what is the importance of locally acquired versus imported infections in driving transmission at different stages of elimination? These questions address processes that can undermine control programs, especially those that rely heavily on treatment with praziquantel. Until recently, these questions were difficult to answer with sufficient precision to inform public health decision-making. We review the literature related to these questions and discuss how whole-genome approaches can identify the geographic and taxonomic sources of infection, and how such information can inform context-specific efforts that advance schistosomiasis control efforts and minimize the risk of reemergence.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">IL-37 expression reduces acute and chronic neuroinflammation and rescues cognitive impairment in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model</a></h4>

              
                The anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-37 (IL-37) belongs to the IL-1 family but is not expressed in mice. We used a human IL‑37 (hIL-37tg) expressing mouse, which has been subjected to various models of local and systemic inflammation as well as immunological challenges. Previous studies reveal an immunomodulatory role of IL-37, which can be characterized as an important suppressor of innate immunity. Here, we examined the functions of IL-37 in the central nervous system and explored the effects of IL-37 on neuronal architecture and function, microglial phenotype, cytokine production and behavior after inflammatory challenge by intraperitoneal LPS-injection. In wild-type mice, decreased spine density, activated microglial phenotype and impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) were observed after LPS injection, whereas hIL-37tg mice showed no impairment. In addition, we crossed the hIL-37tg mouse with an animal model of Alzheimer's disease (APP/PS1) to investigate the anti-inflammatory properties of IL-37 under chronic neuroinflammatory conditions. Our results show that expression of IL-37 is able to limit inflammation in the brain after acute inflammatory events and prevent loss of cognitive abilities in a mouse model of AD.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A Notch-dependent transcriptional mechanism controls expression of temporal patterning factors in Drosophila medulla</a></h4>

              
                Temporal patterning is an important mechanism for generating a great diversity of neuron subtypes from a seemingly homogenous progenitor pool in both vertebrates and invertebrates. <i>Drosophila</i> neuroblasts are temporally patterned by sequentially expressed Temporal Transcription Factors (TTFs). These TTFs are proposed to form a transcriptional cascade based on mutant phenotypes, although direct transcriptional regulation between TTFs has not been verified in most cases. Furthermore, it is not known how the temporal transitions are coupled with the generation of the appropriate number of neurons at each stage. We use neuroblasts of the <i>Drosophila</i> optic lobe medulla to address these questions and show that the expression of TTFs Sloppy-paired 1/2 (Slp1/2) is directly regulated at the transcriptional level by two other TTFs and the cell-cycle dependent Notch signaling through two <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements. We also show that supplying constitutively active Notch can rescue the delayed transition into the Slp stage in cell cycle arrested neuroblasts. Our findings reveal a novel Notch-pathway dependent mechanism through which the cell cycle progression regulates the timing of a temporal transition within a TTF transcriptional cascade.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Contribution of behavioural variability to representational drift</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal responses to similar stimuli change dynamically over time, raising the question of how internal representations can provide a stable substrate for neural coding. Recent work has suggested a large degree of drift in neural representations even in sensory cortices, which are believed to store stable representations of the external world. While the drift of these representations is mostly characterized in relation to external stimuli, the behavioural state of the animal (for instance, the level of arousal) is also known to strongly modulate the neural activity. We therefore asked how the variability of such modulatory mechanisms can contribute to representational changes. We analysed large-scale recording of neural activity from the Allen Brain Observatory, which was used before to document representational drift in the mouse visual cortex. We found that, within these datasets, behavioural variability significantly contributes to representational changes. This effect was broadcasted across various cortical areas in the mouse, including the primary visual cortex, higher order visual areas, and even regions not primarily linked to vision like hippocampus. Our computational modelling suggests that these results are consistent with independent modulation of neural activity by behaviour over slower time scales. Importantly, our analysis suggests that reliable but variable modulation of neural representations by behaviour can be misinterpreted as representational drift, if neuronal representations are only characterized in the stimulus space and marginalised over behavioural parameters.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Robust cone-mediated signaling persists late into rod photoreceptor degeneration</a></h4>

              
                Rod photoreceptor degeneration causes deterioration in the morphology and physiology of cone photoreceptors along with changes in retinal circuits. These changes could diminish visual signaling at cone-mediated light levels, thereby limiting the efficacy of treatments such as gene therapy for rescuing normal, cone-mediated vision.  However, the impact of progressive rod death on cone-mediated signaling remains unclear. To investigate the fidelity of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) signaling throughout disease progression, we used a mouse model of rod degeneration (<i>Cngb1<sup>neo/neo</sup></i>). Despite clear deterioration of cone morphology with rod death, cone-mediated signaling among RGCs remained surprisingly robust: spatiotemporal receptive fields changed little and the mutual information between stimuli and spiking responses was relatively constant. This relative stability held until nearly all rods had died and cones had completely lost well-formed outer segments. Interestingly, RGC information rates were higher and more stable for natural movies than checkerboard noise as degeneration progressed. The main change in RGC responses with photoreceptor degeneration was a decrease in response gain. These results suggest that gene therapies for rod degenerative diseases are likely to prolong cone-mediated vision even if there are changes to cone morphology and density.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hypoxia-inducible factor underlies von Hippel-Lindau disease stigmata</a></h4>

              
                von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare hereditary cancer syndrome that causes a predisposition to renal clear-cell carcinoma, hemangioblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and autosomal-recessive familial polycythemia. pVHL is the substrate conferring subunit of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that binds to the three hypoxia-inducible factor alpha subunits (HIF1-3α) for polyubiquitylation under conditions of normoxia, targeting them for immediate degradation by the proteasome. Certain mutations in pVHL have been determined to be causative of VHL disease through the disruption of HIFα degradation. However, it remains a focus of investigation and debate whether the disruption of HIFα degradation alone is sufficient to explain the complex genotype-phenotype relationship of VHL disease or whether the other lesser or yet characterized substrates and functions of pVHL impact the development of the VHL disease stigmata; the elucidation of which would have a significant ramification to the direction of research efforts and future management and care of VHL patients and for those manifesting sporadic counterparts of VHL disease. Here, we examine the current literature including the other emergent pseudohypoxic diseases and propose that the VHL disease-phenotypic spectrum could be explained solely by the varied disruption of HIFα signaling upon the loss or mutation in pVHL.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transition to siblinghood causes a substantial and long-lasting increase in urinary cortisol levels in wild bonobos</a></h4>

              
                In animals with slow ontogeny and long-term maternal investment, immatures are likely to experience the birth of a younger sibling before reaching maturity. In these species, the birth of a sibling marks a major event in an offspring's early life, as the older siblings experience a decrease in maternal support. The transition to siblinghood (TTS) is often considered to be stressful for the older offspring, but physiological evidence is lacking. To explore the TTS in wild bonobos, we investigated physiological changes in urinary cortisol (stress response), neopterin (cell-mediated immunity), and total triiodothyronine (T3, metabolic rate), as well as changes in behaviors that reflect the mother-offspring relationship. Following a sibling's birth, urinary cortisol levels of the older offspring increased fivefold, independent of their age, and remained elevated for seven months. The cortisol level increase was associated with declining neopterin levels, however T3 levels and behavioral measures did not change. Our results indicate that the TTS is accompanied by elevated cortisol levels and that this change does not coincide with nutritional weaning and attainment of physical independence. Our results suggest that bonobos and humans experience TTS in similar ways and that this developmental event may have emerged in the last common ancestor.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The scaffolding protein Flot2 promotes cytoneme-based transport of Wnt3 in gastric cancer</a></h4>

              
                The Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway regulates multiple cellular processes during development and many diseases, including cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Despite their hydrophobic nature, Wnt proteins exert their function over long distances to induce paracrine signalling. Recent studies have identified several factors involved in Wnt secretion, however, our understanding of how Wnt ligands are transported between cells to interact with their cognate receptors is still debated. Here, we demonstrate that gastric cancer cells utilise cytonemes to transport Wnt3 intercellularly to promote proliferation and cell survival. Furthermore, we identify the membrane-bound scaffolding protein Flotillin-2 (Flot2), frequently overexpressed in gastric cancer, as a modulator of these cytonemes. Together with the Wnt co-receptor and cytoneme initiator Ror2, Flot2 determines the number and length of Wnt3 cytonemes in gastric cancer. Finally, we show that Flotillins are also necessary for Wnt8a cytonemes during zebrafish embryogenesis, suggesting a conserved mechanism for Flotillin-mediated Wnt transport on cytonemes in development and disease.

	<p>Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with poor academic performance also among university students. This relationship may be made more complex by comorbid conditions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the mediating role of anxiety and depressive symptoms in the relationship between ADHD and academic performance. Data were drawn from the CAMPUS study (registration number: 0058642/21), an ongoing survey on university students&amp;amp;rsquo; mental health. Using a logit model, mediation analyses were carried out to test whether the relationship between ADHD symptoms (assessed by ASRS-5) and academic performance might be mediated by depressive (assessed by PHQ-9) and anxiety (assessed by GAD-7) symptoms. Our results showed that worse academic performance is associated with ADHD symptoms (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). However, about 24% of the overall association between ADHD symptoms and academic performance was mediated by depressive symptoms (indirect effect: 0.065, 95%CI 0.022; 0.100), whereas the contribution of anxiety symptoms to the model was not significant. Along with the association between ADHD symptoms and poor academic performance, our findings highlight the key mediating role of depressive symptoms, which may be targeted with tailored support, ultimately improving both the academic performance and the well-being of university students with ADHD.</p>

	<p>Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a growth factor that regulates T-cell autocrine secretion and has long been considered to be closely related to immune response. With the advance in neuroinflammation theory and immunology research on schizophrenia, it is interesting and meaningful to discuss the possible role of IL-2 in schizophrenia. Here, we reviewed a series of studies published from the 1990s and found that IL-2 was closely associated with schizophrenia. For example, IL-2 is responsible for mediating toxic reactions, which are the causes of schizophrenia symptoms in patients, and such symptoms resolve after discontinuation of the drug. In addition, we focused on the changes of IL-2 in the onset, progression and treatment of schizophrenia and the possible mechanisms by which IL-2 affects schizophrenia. Our review suggests that IL-2 is associated with schizophrenia and plays a role in its pathogenesis, and progression IL-2 and sIL-2R could serve as potential biomarkers of schizophrenia.</p>

	<p>The cerebellum is particularly enriched in antigens and represents a vulnerable target to immune attacks. Immune-mediated cerebellar ataxias (IMCAs) have diverse etiologies, such as gluten ataxia (GA), post-infectious cerebellitis (PIC), Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD), opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome (OMS), and anti-GAD ataxia. Apart from these well-established entities, cerebellar ataxia (CA) occurs also in association with autoimmunity against ion channels and related proteins, synaptic adhesion/organizing proteins, transmitter receptors, glial cells, as well as the brainstem antigens. Most of these conditions manifest diverse neurological clinical features, with CAs being one of the main clinical phenotypes. The term primary autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (PACA) refers to ataxic conditions suspected to be autoimmune even in the absence of specific well-characterized pathogenic antibody markers. We review advances in the field of IMCAs and propose a clinical approach for the understanding and diagnosis of IMCAs, focusing on rare etiologies which are likely underdiagnosed. The frontiers of PACA are discussed. The identification of rare immune ataxias is of importance since they are potentially treatable and may lead to a severe clinical syndrome in absence of early therapy.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors for enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) in young adults from a neurology clinic-based cohort (&amp;amp;le;45 years old) via unenhanced brain MRI. (2) Methods: A total of 931 young adults from a neurology clinic-based cohort who underwent unenhanced brain MRI between 1 January 2021 and 30 June 2021 were retrospectively included in this study. The EPVS were rated in the centrum semiovale (CSO-EPVS), basal ganglia (BG-EPVS), and midbrain (MB-EPVS) using a visual rating scale. The degrees of the CSO-EPVS, BG-EPVS, and MB-EPVS were all divided by a cutoff value of 1. Demographic factors, vascular risk factors, and symptoms were analyzed using the chi-square test and logistic regression to determine the risk factors of EPVS. (3) Results: The overall prevalence of EPVS was 99.8% (929/931). The CSO-EPVS, BG-EPVS, and MB-EPVS were predominantly scored as 1 (52.1%, 79.1%, and 58.3%, respectively). Logistic regression analysis identified age and hypertension as factors affecting the degrees of CSO-EPVS and BG-EPVS (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Hypertension (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and diabetes (p = 0.014) were revealed to be factors affecting the degree of BG-EPVS. Furthermore, patients with headache (OR = 1.807; p = 0.001) and dizziness (OR = 1.574; p = 0.025) were associated with MB-EPVS. (4) Conclusions: EPVS were frequently found in young adults and could be related to the symptoms. Age, hypertension, and diabetes were the risk factors for the severity of EPVS in the corresponding brain regions.</p>

	<p>Procrastination is defined as putting off an intended course of action voluntarily despite the harmful consequences. Previous studies have suggested that procrastination is associated with punishment sensitivity in that high punishment sensitivity results in increased negative utility for task performance. We hypothesized the effects of punishment sensitivity on procrastination would be mediated by a network connecting the caudate nucleus and prefrontal cortex, both of which have been previously associated with self-control and emotional control during procrastination. We employed voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) to examine the neural substrates of punishment sensitivity and its relationship with procrastination (N = 268). The behavioral results indicated a strong positive correlation between measures of punishment sensitivity and procrastination. The VBM analysis revealed that the gray matter (GM) volume of the right caudate was significantly positively correlated with punishment sensitivity. The primary rsFC analysis revealed connectivity between this caudate location and the bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG) was significantly negatively correlated with punishment sensitivity. A mediation model indicated punishment sensitivity completely mediated the relation between functional connectivity within a caudate&amp;amp;ndash;bilateral MFG network and procrastination. Our results support the theory that those with higher punishment sensitivity have weaker effective emotional self-control supported by the caudate&amp;amp;ndash;MFG network, resulting in greater procrastination.</p>

	<p>There has been an increase in the use of mechanical ventilation (MV) in motor neurone disease (MND) to alleviate symptoms related to hypoventilation. Little is known about its use at the end of life, and the withdrawal of MV is a challenging topic. A scoping review was conducted to map the existing evidence of ventilation use at the end of life in MND. The Joanna Briggs Institute methodological framework was used, and a total of 31 documents were included in the data extraction. Boarder themes around place, planning, cause and comments on death were identified. Our findings show that the focus of the literature has been on the process of the withdrawal of ventilation, creating the subthemes of timing and reason for withdrawal, along with ethical, emotional, and practical issues, medications used and the time until death. There is a foundation of evidence to guide the process and discuss the ethical and emotional issues of withdrawing ventilation. However, there remains limited evidence from patient and family member perspectives. Importantly, there is almost no evidence exploring dying with ventilation in place, the active or passive decisions around this process, how the interface might impact the dying process, or what families think about this.</p>

	<p>Emotion analysis has emerged as one of the most prominent study areas in the field of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) due to the critical role that the human brain plays in the creation of human emotions. In this study, a Multi-objective Immunogenetic Community Division Algorithm Based on Memetic Framework (MFMICD) was suggested to study different emotions from the perspective of brain networks. To improve convergence and accuracy, MFMICD incorporates the unique immunity operator based on the traditional genetic algorithm and combines it with the taboo search algorithm. Based on this approach, we examined how the structure of people&amp;amp;rsquo;s brain networks alters in response to different emotions using the electroencephalographic emotion database. The findings revealed that, in positive emotional states, more brain regions are engaged in emotion dominance, the information exchange between local modules is more frequent, and various emotions cause more varied patterns of brain area interactions than in negative brain states. A brief analysis of the connections between different emotions and brain regions shows that MFMICD is reliable in dividing emotional brain functional networks into communities.</p>

	<p>Introduction: It is clear that mental fatigue can have many negative impacts on individuals, such as impairing cognitive function or affecting performance. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of sound interventions in combating mental fatigue. Method: The subjects were assessed on various scales, a psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) task, and a 3 min resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG), followed by a 20 min mental fatigue&amp;amp;ndash;inducing task (Time Load Dual Back ,TloadDback), during which subjects in different condition groups listened to either 15 Hz binaural beats, 40 Hz binaural beats, relaxing music, or a 240 Hz pure tone. After the mental fatigue&amp;amp;ndash;inducing task, subjects were again assessed on various scales, a PVT task, and a 3 min resting-state EEG. Results: After the fatigue-inducing task, there was no significant difference between the four groups on the scales or the PVT task performance. In TloadDback, the accuracy rate of the 40 Hz binaural beats group and the relaxing music group decreased in the middle stage of the task, while the 15 Hz binaural beats group and the 240 Hz pure tone group remained unchanged in all stages of the task. The EEG results showed that after fatigue inducement, the average path length of the 15 Hz binaural beats group decreased, and local efficiency showed an increasing tendency, indicating enhanced brain network connectivity. Meanwhile, the 240 Hz pure tone group showed enhanced functional connectivity, suggesting a state of mental fatigue in the group. Conclusions: The results of this study show that listening to 15 Hz binaural beats is a proven intervention for mental fatigue that can contribute to maintaining working memory function, enhancing brain topological structure, and alleviating the decline in brain function that occurs in a mentally fatigued state. As such, these results are of great scientific and practical value.</p>

	<p>Tennis experts need to extract effective visual information from a sphere in high-speed motion, in which motion-in-depth perception plays an important role. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the impact of sphere speed and tennis expertise on motion-in-depth perception by using the expert&amp;amp;ndash;novice task paradigm along with event-related potential (ERP) technology. The study also explored differences in behavior and electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics between tennis experts and novices. Results show that faster sphere movement led to shorter response times and a lower accuracy rate. The P1 component in the occipital&amp;amp;ndash;temporal region showed that the expert group activated earlier and were stronger when the sphere was far away. The latent period of P2 in the occipital region was significantly shorter in the expert group in comparison to the novice group. Faster speed led to the induction of increased P300 volatility and a significant increase in latency. The findings of the current study show that the speed of the sphere movement affects the invocation and allocation of cognitive resources in the process of motion-in-depth perception, irrespective of whether the athletes were experts or novices. There is a special effect in the process of motion-in-depth perception for experts, mainly because attention resources are invested earlier in experts rather than novices.</p>

	<p>Background: Systematic reviews conducted on sleep disturbances in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have found inconsistent results due to the presence of several moderating variables which were not controlled for in previous studies. The aim of this study was to examine sleep disturbances in children with ADHD compared to their typically developing peers after controlling for moderating variables (age, sex, medication status, body mass index, and psychiatric and medical comorbidities). Methods: ADHD was diagnosed using DSM-IV-TR criteria (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) and Conners&amp;amp;rsquo; Parent Rating Scales. Children recruited (aged 6&amp;amp;ndash;12 years) for the ADHD group (n = 40) met the following criteria: IQ &amp;amp;gt; 80, unmedicated, and no psychiatric or medical comorbidities. The control group consisted of age- and sex-matched typically developing peers (n = 40). Sleep was assessed subjectively (through parent reported questionnaires and sleep logs) and objectively (using video polysomnography). Results: 65% of children with ADHD had a sleep disorder, as compared to 17% of controls. The ADHD group reported more sleep disturbances and disorders, both on subjective measures and objective measures. Conclusions: Sleep disturbances and primary sleep disorders in children with ADHD exist independent of moderating variables and differences in sleep assessment methods, thereby bolstering support for previously documented literature on the ADHD and sleep connection.</p>

	<p>MiR-223 is a miRNA with important functions in apoptosis, carcinogenesis, and inflammation, and it was demonstrated to be over-expressed in brain tissue after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, few studies have focused on its role in protecting brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). This study evaluated the protective effect of miR-223 on BMECs after stretch injury (SI). bEnd.3 cells (BMECs of mouse) were transfected with overexpressing and blocking lentivirus of miR-223, then were subjected to SI. After immunofluorescence assay, it was demonstrated that miR-223 overexpression significantly rescued the SI-induced loss of ZO-1 (Zonula Occludens 1, tight junction protein) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), while miR-223 blocking exacerbated the loss of ZO-1 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Flow cytometry confirmed a significant increase in the proportion of apoptotic bEnd.3 cells after SI, and miR-223 overexpression reduced this proportion (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). The result of Western blot revealed that miR-223 overexpression significantly reduced the expression of cleaved caspase-3 (cl-caspase 3) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) and RhoB (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), while miR-223 blocking increased the expression of these proteins (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Additionally, knockdown of RhoB significantly reduced the expression of cl-caspase 3 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). These findings suggested that miR-223 can alleviate SI-induced apoptosis of BMECs, and this anti-apoptotic effect is at least partially achieved by inhibiting the expression of RhoB. Moreover, miR-223 may play a role in maintaining the integrity of BBB during TBI.</p>

	<p>Epilepsy is a multifactorial neurological disorder with recurrent epileptic seizures. Current research stresses both inflammatory and autoimmune conditions as enablers in the pathophysiological process of epilepsy. In view of the growing concern about the role of adipocytokines in antiepileptic and modulating immune responses, we aimed to investigate the relevance of the adipocytokine signaling pathway in the pathological process of epilepsy and its impacts on peripheral immune characteristics. In this study, expression profiles of 142 peripheral blood samples were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Adipocytokine pathway-related genes were screened out by feature selection using machine-learning algorithms. A nomogram was then constructed and estimated for the efficacy of diagnosis. Cluster analysis was employed for the recognization of two distinct epilepsy subtypes, followed by an estimation of the immune cell infiltration levels using single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). The biological characteristics were analyzed by functional enrichment analysis. The aberrant regulation of adipocytokine signaling pathway was found in the peripheral blood of patients with epilepsy. Twenty-one differently expressed adipocytokine pathway-related genes were identified and five (RELA, PRKAB1, TNFRSF1A, CAMKK2, and CPT1B) were selected to construct a nomogram. Subsequent validations of its forecasting ability revealed that this model has satisfactory predictive value. The immune cell infiltration degrees, such as those of innate immune cells and lymphocytes, were found to significantly correlate to the levels of adipocytokine pathway-related genes. Additionally, 239 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and their biological functions were mainly enriched in the regulation of the immune response. In conclusion, our results confirmed the predictive value of adipocytokine pathway-related genes for epilepsy and explored their effects on immune infiltration, thereby improving our understanding of the pathogenesis of epilepsy and providing assistance in the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Behavioral Forgetting of Olfactory Learning Is Mediated by Interneuron-Regulated Network Plasticity in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Forgetting is important for animals to manage acquired memories to enable adaptation to changing environments; however, the neural network in mechanisms of forgetting is not fully understood. To understand the mechanisms underlying forgetting, we examined olfactory adaptation, a form of associative learning, in <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>. The forgetting of diacetyl olfactory adaptation in <I>C. elegans</I> is regulated by secreted signals from AWC sensory neurons via the TIR-1/JNK-1 pathway. These signals cause a decline of the sensory memory trace in AWA neurons, where diacetyl is mainly sensed. To further understand the neural network that regulates this forgetting, we investigated the function of interneurons downstream of AWA and AWC neurons. We found that a pair of interneurons, AIA, is indispensable for the proper regulation of behavioral forgetting of diacetyl olfactory adaptation. Loss or inactivation of AIA caused the impairment of the chemotaxis recovery after adaptation without causing severe chemotaxis defects in the naive animal. AWA Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging analyses suggested that loss or inactivation of AIA interneurons did not affect the decline of the sensory memory trace after the recovery. Furthermore, AIA responses to diacetyl were observed in naive animals and after the recovery, but not just after the conditioning, suggesting that AIA responses after the recovery are required for the chemotaxis to diacetyl. We propose that the functional neuronal circuit for attractive chemotaxis to diacetyl is changed temporally at the recovery phase so that AIA interneurons are required for chemotaxis, although AIAs are dispensable for attractive chemotaxis to diacetyl in naive animals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Coordination between Eye Movement and Whisking in Head-Fixed Mice Navigating a Plus Maze</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Navigation through complex environments requires motor planning, motor preparation, and the coordination between multiple sensory&ndash;motor modalities. For example, the stepping motion when we walk is coordinated with motion of the torso, arms, head, and eyes. In rodents, movement of the animal through the environment is coordinated with whisking. Even head-fixed mice navigating a plus maze position their whiskers asymmetrically with the bilateral asymmetry signifying the upcoming turn direction. Here we report that, in addition to moving their whiskers, on every trial mice also move their eyes conjugately in the direction of the upcoming turn. Not only do mice move their eyes, but they coordinate saccadic eye movement with the asymmetric positioning of the whiskers. Our analysis shows that asymmetric positioning of whiskers predicted the turn direction that mice will make at an earlier stage than eye movement. Consistent with these results, our observations also revealed that whisker asymmetry increases before saccadic eye movement. Importantly, this work shows that when rodents plan for active behavior, their motor plans can involve both eye and whisker movement. We conclude that, when mice are engaged in and moving through complex real-world environments, their behavioral state can be read out in the movement of both their whiskers and eyes.</p>

                <p>by Elena Piretto, Gianluca Selvaggio, Damiano Bragantini, Enrico Domenici, Luca Marchetti</p>

In this paper, a logical-based mathematical model of the cellular pathways involved in the COVID-19 infection has been developed to study various drug treatments (single or in combination), in different illness scenarios, providing insights into their mechanisms of action. Drug simulations suggest that the effects of single drugs are limited, or depending on the scenario counterproductive, whereas better results appear combining different treatments. Specifically, the combination of the anti-inflammatory Baricitinib and the anti-viral Remdesivir showed significant benefits while a stronger efficacy emerged from the triple combination of Baricitinib, Remdesivir, and the corticosteroid Dexamethasone. Together with a sensitivity analysis, we performed an analysis of the mechanisms of the drugs to reveal their impact on molecular pathways.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mapping of promoter usage QTL using RNA-seq data reveals their contributions to complex traits</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Naoto Kubota, Mikita Suyama</p>

Genomic variations are associated with gene expression levels, which are called expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Most eQTL may affect the total gene expression levels by regulating transcriptional activities of a specific promoter. However, the direct exploration of genomic loci associated with promoter activities using RNA-seq data has been challenging because eQTL analyses treat the total expression levels estimated by summing those of all isoforms transcribed from distinct promoters. Here we propose a new method for identifying genomic loci associated with promoter activities, called promoter usage quantitative trait loci (puQTL), using conventional RNA-seq data. By leveraging public RNA-seq datasets from the lymphoblastoid cell lines of 438 individuals from the GEUVADIS project, we obtained promoter activity estimates and mapped 2,592 puQTL at the 10% FDR level. The results of puQTL mapping enabled us to interpret the manner in which genomic variations regulate gene expression. We found that 310 puQTL genes (16.1%) were not detected by eQTL analysis, suggesting that our pipeline can identify novel variant–gene associations. Furthermore, we identified genomic loci associated with the activity of “hidden” promoters, which the standard eQTL studies have ignored. We found that most puQTL signals were concordant with at least one genome-wide association study (GWAS) signal, enabling novel interpretations of the molecular mechanisms of complex traits. Our results emphasize the importance of the re-analysis of public RNA-seq datasets to obtain novel insights into gene regulation by genomic variations and their contributions to complex traits.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Accounting for multiple imputation-induced variability for differential analysis in mass spectrometry-based label-free quantitative proteomics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marie Chion, Christine Carapito, Frédéric Bertrand</p>

Imputing missing values is common practice in label-free quantitative proteomics. Imputation aims at replacing a missing value with a user-defined one. However, the imputation itself may not be optimally considered downstream of the imputation process, as imputed datasets are often considered as if they had always been complete. Hence, the uncertainty due to the imputation is not adequately taken into account. We provide a rigorous multiple imputation strategy, leading to a less biased estimation of the parameters’ variability thanks to Rubin’s rules. The imputation-based peptide’s intensities’ variance estimator is then moderated using Bayesian hierarchical models. This estimator is finally included in moderated <i>t</i>-test statistics to provide differential analyses results. This workflow can be used both at peptide and protein-level in quantification datasets. Indeed, an aggregation step is included for protein-level results based on peptide-level quantification data. Our methodology, named mi4p, was compared to the state-of-the-art limma workflow implemented in the DAPAR R package, both on simulated and real datasets. We observed a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, while the overall performance of mi4p outperforms DAPAR in terms of <i>F</i>-Score.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A multi-objective based clustering for inferring BCR clonal lineages from high-throughput B cell repertoire data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nika Abdollahi, Lucile Jeusset, Anne Langlois De Septenville, Hugues Ripoche, Frédéric Davi, Juliana Silva Bernardes</p>

The adaptive B cell response is driven by the expansion, somatic hypermutation, and selection of B cell clonal lineages. A high number of clonal lineages in a B cell population indicates a highly diverse repertoire, while clonal size distribution and sequence diversity antigen selective pressure. Identifying clonal lineages is fundamental to many repertoire studies, including repertoire comparisons, clonal tracking, and statistical analysis. Several methods have been developed to group sequences from high-throughput B cell repertoire data. Current methods use clustering algorithms to group clonally-related sequences based on their similarities or distances. Such approaches create groups by optimizing a single objective that typically minimizes intra-clonal distances. However, optimizing several objective functions can be advantageous and boost the algorithm convergence rate. Here we propose a new method based on multi-objective clustering. Our approach requires V(D)J annotations to obtain the initial groups and iteratively applies two objective functions that optimize cohesion and separation within clonal lineages simultaneously. We show that our method greatly improves clonal lineage grouping on simulated benchmarks with varied mutation rates compared to other tools. When applied to experimental repertoires generated from high-throughput sequencing, its clustering results are comparable to the most performing tools and can reproduce the results of previous publications. The method based on multi-objective clustering can accurately identify clonally-related antibody sequences and presents the lowest running time among state-of-art tools. All these features constitute an attractive option for repertoire analysis, particularly in the clinical context. MobiLLe can potentially help unravel the mechanisms involved in developing and evolving B cell malignancies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A simple model of the attentional blink and its modulation by mental training</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nadav Amir, Naftali Tishby, Israel Nelken</p>

The attentional blink (AB) effect is the reduced probability of reporting a second target (T2) that appears shortly after a first one (T1) within a rapidly presented sequence of distractors. The AB effect has been shown to be reduced following intensive mental training in the form of mindfulness meditation, with a corresponding reduction in T1-evoked P3b brain potentials. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unknown. We propose a dynamical-systems model of the AB, in which attentional load is described as the response of a dynamical system to incoming impulse signals. Non-task related mental activity is represented by additive noise modulated by meditation. The model provides a parsimonious computational framework relating behavioral performance, evoked brain potentials and training through the concept of reduced mental noise.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multiscale modelling of desquamation in the interfollicular epidermis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Claire Miller, Edmund Crampin, James M. Osborne</p>

Maintenance of epidermal thickness is critical to the barrier function of the skin. Decreased tissue thickness, specifically in the stratum corneum (the outermost layer of the tissue), causes discomfort and inflammation, and is related to several severe diseases of the tissue. In order to maintain both stratum corneum thickness and overall tissue thickness it is necessary for the system to balance cell proliferation and cell loss. Cell proliferation in the epidermis occurs in the basal layer and causes constant upwards movement in the tissue. Cell loss occurs when dead cells at the top of the tissue are lost to the environment through a process called desquamation. Desquamation is thought to occur through a gradual reduction in adhesion between cells, due to the cleaving of adhesion proteins by enzymes, in the stratum corneum.
In this paper we will investigate combining a (mass action) subcellular model of desquamation with a three dimensional (cell centre based) multicellular model of the interfollicular epidermis to better understand maintenance of epidermal thickness. Specifically, our aim is to determine if a hypothesised biological model for the degradation of cell-cell adhesion, from the literature, is sufficient to maintain a steady state tissue thickness. These investigations show the model is able to provide a consistent rate of cell loss in the multicellular model. This loss balances proliferation, and hence maintains a homeostatic tissue thickness. Moreover, we find that multiple proliferative cell populations in the basal layer can be represented by a single proliferative cell population, simplifying investigations with this model.
The model is used to investigate a disorder (Netherton Syndrome) which disrupts desquamation. The model shows how biochemical changes can cause disruptions to the tissue, resulting in a reduced tissue thickness and consequently diminishing the protective role of the tissue. A hypothetical treatment result is also investigated: we compare the cases of a partially effective homogeneous treatment (where all cells partially recover) and a totally effective heterogeneous treatment (in which a proportion of the cells totally recover) with the aim to determine the difference in the response of the tissue to these different scenarios. Results show an increased benefit to corneum thickness from the heterogeneous treatment over the homogeneous treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cross-fitted instrument: A blueprint for one-sample Mendelian randomization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by William R. P. Denault, Jon Bohlin, Christian M. Page, Stephen Burgess, Astanand Jugessur</p>

Bias from weak instruments may undermine the ability to estimate causal effects in instrumental variable regression (IVR). We present here a new approach to handling weak instrument bias through the application of a new type of instrumental variable coined ‘Cross-Fitted Instrument’ (CFI). CFI splits the data at random and estimates the impact of the instrument on the exposure in each partition. These estimates are then used to perform an IVR on each partition. We adapt CFI to the Mendelian randomization (MR) setting and term this adaptation ‘Cross-Fitting for Mendelian Randomization’ (CFMR). We show that, even when using weak instruments, CFMR is, at worst, biased towards the null, which makes it a conservative one-sample MR approach. In particular, CFMR remains conservative even when the two samples used to perform the MR analysis completely overlap, whereas current state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., MR RAPS) display substantial bias in this setting. Another major advantage of CFMR lies in its use of all of the available data to select genetic instruments, which maximizes statistical power, as opposed to traditional two-sample MR where only part of the data is used to select the instrument. Consequently, CFMR is able to enhance statistical power in consortia-led meta-analyses by enabling a conservative one-sample MR to be performed in each cohort prior to a meta-analysis of the results across all the cohorts. In addition, CFMR enables a cross-ethnic MR analysis by accounting for ethnic heterogeneity, which is particularly important in meta-analyses where the participating cohorts may have different ethnicities. To our knowledge, none of the current MR approaches can account for such heterogeneity. Finally, CFMR enables the application of MR to exposures that are either rare or difficult to measure, which would normally preclude their analysis in the regular two-sample MR setting.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The Madeira cockroach <i>Rhyparobia maderae</i> is a nocturnal insect and a prominent model organism for the study of circadian rhythms. Its master circadian clock, controlling circadian locomotor activity and sleep–wake cycles, is located in the accessory medulla of the optic lobe. For a better understanding of brain regions controlled by the circadian clock and brain organization of this insect in general, we created a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of all neuropils of the cerebral ganglia based on anti-synapsin and anti-γ-aminobutyric acid immunolabeling of whole mount brains. Forty-nine major neuropils were identified and three-dimensionally reconstructed. Single-cell dye fills complement the data and provide evidence for distinct subdivisions of certain brain areas. Most neuropils defined in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> could be distinguished in the cockroach as well. However, some neuropils identified in the fruit fly do not exist as distinct entities in the cockroach while others are lacking in the fruit fly. In addition to neuropils, major fiber systems, tracts, and commissures were reconstructed and served as important landmarks separating brain areas. Being a nocturnal insect, <i>R. maderae</i> is an important new species to the growing collection of 3D insect brain atlases and only the second hemimetabolous insect, for which a detailed 3D brain atlas is available. This atlas will be highly valuable for an evolutionary comparison of insect brain organization and will greatly facilitate addressing brain areas that are supervised by the circadian clock.</p>

<p>Development of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins in the PGN of the cat.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The thalamic reticular nucleus receives axons from the thalamic sensory nuclei and the cerebral cortex. The visual part of this nucleus in carnivores is the perigeniculate nucleus located dorsal to the lateral geniculate nucleus. The perigeniculate nucleus participates in the modulation of visual processing and in the transition of synchronized slow rhythmicity during sleep into desynchronized high-frequency activity during arousal and consists of inhibitory neurons. The main neurochemical markers for perigeniculate neurons are glutamic acid decarboxylase and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein parvalbumin. Previous studies of postnatal development focused on the morphological features of the perigeniculate nucleus; however, its neurochemistry remains poorly understood. In this study, we focused on the postnatal development of perigeniculate neurons using immunohistochemical labeling of parvalbumin, two related Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins (calretinin and calbindin), glutamic acid decarboxylase, and a common neuronal protein, NeuN, in kittens that were 0–123 days old and in adult cats. In parallel with the well-known dominant neuronal populations expressing parvalbumin and GAD67 and persisting until adulthood, transient populations expressing calretinin and calbindin were observed. The calbindin-positive neurons were similar to the main perigeniculate population and showed close morphological features and parvalbumin coexpression. In contrast, the calretinin-positive neurons differed in their morphological characteristics and did not express GAD67, thus distinguishing them from the majority of perigeniculate neurons. A possible link between these populations was revealed, and the development of thalamocortical processing is discussed.</p>

<p>Neuropeptide S (NPS) neurons in the parabrachial region are a subset of <i>Atoh1</i>-derived, <i>Foxp2</i>-expressing neurons that do not express <i>Pdyn</i>, <i>Calca</i>, or <i>Cck</i>. We also identified novel populations of NPS neurons from Cre-reporter expression in the nucleus incertus, anterior hypothalamus, and lateral habenula. 

</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuropeptide S (NPS) increases wakefulness. A small number of neurons in the brainstem express <i>Nps</i>. These neurons are located in or near the parabrachial nucleus (PB), but we know very little about their ontogeny, connectivity, and function. To identify <i>Nps</i>-expressing neurons within the molecular framework of the PB region, we used in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence, and Cre-reporter labeling in mice. The primary concentration of <i>Nps</i>-expressing neurons borders the lateral lemniscus at far-rostral levels of the lateral PB. Caudal to this main cluster, <i>Nps</i>-expressing neurons scatter through the PB and form a secondary concentration medial to the locus coeruleus (LC). Most <i>Nps</i>-expressing neurons in the PB region are <i>Atoh1</i>-derived, <i>Foxp2</i>-expressing, and mutually exclusive with neurons expressing <i>Calca</i> or <i>Lmx1b</i>. Among <i>Foxp2</i>-expressing PB neurons, those expressing <i>Nps</i> are distinct from intermingled subsets expressing <i>Cck</i> or <i>Pdyn</i>. Examining <i>Nps</i> Cre-reporter expression throughout the brain identified novel populations of neurons in the nucleus incertus, anterior hypothalamus, and lateral habenula. This information will help focus experimental questions about the connectivity and function of NPS neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">A locus coeruleus-dorsal CA1 dopaminergic circuit modulates memory linking</a></h4>

              
                Chowdhury et al. discovered a neuromodulatory pathway for linking memories that does not affect memory formation. They demonstrate that locus coeruleus (LC)-dCA1-projecting neurons specifically regulate memory linking in a dopamine-dependent manner by modulating the excitability of dCA1 neurons and the extent of overlap between dCA1 memory ensembles.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parallel cognitive maps for short-term statistical and long-term semantic relationships in the hippocampal formation</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampal-entorhinal system uses cognitive maps to represent spatial knowledge and other types of relational information, such as the transition probabilities between objects. However, objects can often be characterized in terms of different types of relations simultaneously, e.g. semantic similarities learned over the course of a lifetime as well as transitions experienced over a brief timeframe in an experimental setting. Here we ask how the hippocampal formation handles the embedding of stimuli in multiple relational structures that differ vastly in terms of their mode and timescale of acquisition: Does it integrate the different stimulus dimensions into one conjunctive map, or is each dimension represented in a parallel map? To this end, we reanalyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from Garvert et al. (2017) that had previously revealed an entorhinal map which coded for newly learnt statistical regularities. We used a triplet odd-one-out task to construct a semantic distance matrix for presented items and applied fMRI adaptation analysis to show that the degree of similarity of representations in bilateral hippocampus decreases as a function of semantic distance between presented objects. Importantly, while both maps localize to the hippocampal formation, this semantic map is anatomically distinct from the originally described entorhinal map. This finding supports the idea that the hippocampal-entorhinal system forms parallel cognitive maps reflecting the embedding of objects in diverse relational structures.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Locus Coeruleus firing patterns selectively modulate brain activity and dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Noradrenaline (NA) release from the brainstem nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) changes activity and connectivity in neuronal networks across the brain, thus modulating multiple behavioural states. NA release is mediated by both tonic and burst-like neuronal LC activity. However, it remains unknown whether the functional changes in downstream projection areas depend on these firing patterns. Using optogenetics, pupillometry, photometry, and functional MRI in mice, we show that tonic and burst LC firing patterns elicit brain responses that are specific to the activation frequency and temporal pattern. Tonic activation of the LC evokes nonlinear responses in prefrontal, limbic, and cerebellar regions, in line with the proposed inverted-U relationship between LC activity and behaviour. We further demonstrate that LC activity enhances network integration and acts as a facilitator of brain state transitions, hence increasing brain flexibility. Together, these findings reveal how the LC-NA system achieves a nuanced regulation of global circuit operations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The neural signature of magnitude integration between time and numerosity</a></h4>

              
                Magnitude dimensions such as time and numerosity are fundamental components of our visual experience, allowing us to understand the environment and interact with it. Different magnitudes are however not processed independently from each other, but show a relationship whereby the perception of one dimension depends on the others (magnitude integration). In this study, we use electroencephalography (EEG) to address whether such integration may arise from a shared brain processing stage where different dimensions are integrated together, or from independent parallel processes interfering with each other. In the experiment, participants judged either the average numerosity or duration of dynamic dot-array stimuli concurrently modulated in both dimensions. First, the behavioural results show a magnitude integration effect in both tasks, with duration affecting the judgement of numerosity and vice versa. The EEG results further show that both numerosity and duration significantly modulate event-related potentials at several distinct latencies. Crucially, however, we identified a significant interaction between numerosity and duration emerging in a specific latency window (360-460 ms) irrespective of the task performed by participants. In this latency window, the modulation of ERPs provided by the interfering magnitude dimension can be predicted by the strength of the behavioural bias. Our results thus support the idea of different magnitude dimensions converging onto a shared perceptual processing stage mediating their integration. Overall, our results demonstrate a clear electrophysiological signature of magnitude integration between numerosity and time, and provide new evidence for a shared representational system encompassing different magnitude dimensions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parallel streams of raphe VGLUT3-positive inputs target the dorsal and ventral hippocampus in each hemisphere.</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus (HP) receives neurochemically diverse inputs from the raphe nuclei, including glutamatergic fibers characterized by the expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT3. These raphe-HP VGLUT3 (VGLUT3HP) projections have been suggested to play a critical role in HP functions, yet a complete anatomical overview of raphe VGLUT3 projections to the forebrain, and in particular the HP, is lacking. Using anterograde viral tracing, we describe largely non-overlapping VGLUT3-positive projections from the dorsal raphe (DR) and median raphe (MnR) to the forebrain, with the HP receiving inputs from the MnR. A limited subset of forebrain regions such as the amygdaloid complex, claustrum and hypothalamus receive projections from both the DR and MnR that remain largely segregated. This highly complementary anatomical pattern suggests contrasting roles for DR and MnR VGLUT3 neurons. To further analyse the topography of VGLUT3 raphe projections to the HP, we used retrograde tracing and found that VGLUT3HP neurons distribute over several raphe sub-regions (including the MnR, paramedian raphe and B9 nucleus) and lack co-expression of serotonergic markers. Strikingly, two-color retrograde tracing unraveled two parallel streams of VGLUT3-positive projections targeting the dorsal and ventral poles of the HP. These results demonstrate highly organized and segregated VGLUT3-positive projections to the HP, suggesting independent modulation of HP functions such as spatial memory and emotion-related behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptic Expression of TAR-DNA-Binding Protein 43 in the Mouse Spinal Cord Determined Using Super-Resolution Microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Cellular inclusions of hyperphosphorylated TAR-DNA-Binding Protein 43 (TDP-43) are a key hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). ALS is characterised by a loss of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord that is preceded by early-stage changes in synaptic function that may be associated with TDP-43 pathology. However, there has been little characterisation of the synaptic expression of TDP-43 in spinal cord synapses. This study utilises a range of high-resolution and super-resolution microscopy techniques with immunolabelling, as well as an aptamer-based TDP-43 labelling strategy visualised with single-molecule localisation microscopy, to characterise and quantify the presence of phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) in spinal cord synapses. We observe that TDP-43 is expressed in the majority of spinal cord synapses as nanoscale clusters as small as 60 nm in diameter. Synaptic TDP-43 expression is more frequently associated with presynaptic terminals than postsynaptic densities, and is more enriched in VGLUT1-associated synapses, compared to VGLUT2-associated synapses. Our nanoscopy techniques showed no difference in the subsynaptic expression of pTDP-43 in the ALS mouse model, SOD1G93a compared to healthy controls. This research characterizes the basic synaptic expression of TDP-43 with nanoscale precision and provides a framework with which to investigate the potential relationship between TDP-43 pathology and synaptic pathology in neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">HP1 deficiency results in De-Repression of Endogenous Retroviruses and Induction of Neurodegeneration via Complement</a></h4>

              
                In aging cells and animal models of premature aging, heterochromatin loss coincides with the transcriptional activation of normally silenced endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Here we show that loss of heterochromatin maintenance and de-repression of ERVs results in neurodegeneration via the Complement cascade in an age dependent manner. We discovered differential contributions of HP1 proteins to ERV silencing where HP1{gamma} is necessary and sufficient for H4K20me3 deposition and HP1{beta} deficiency is detrimental to DNA maintenance methylation. Progressive ERV de-repression in HP1{beta}/{gamma} DKO mice was followed by stimulation of the integrated stress response, the induction of Complement 3+ reactive astrocytes and increased infiltration and activation of microglia. This chronic inflammatory state coincided with age-dependent reductions in dendrite complexity and cognition. Our results demonstrate the importance of preventing loss of epigenetic maintenance, as this will be the only way postmitotic neuronal genomes can be protected and/or renewed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Circadian distribution of epileptiform discharges in epilepsy: candidate mechanisms of variability</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy is a serious neurological disorder characterised by a tendency to have recurrent, spontaneous, seizures. Classically, seizures are assumed to occur at random. However, recent research has uncovered underlying rhythms both in seizures and in key signatures of epilepsy - so-called interictal epileptiform activity - with timescales that vary from hours and days through to months. Understanding the physiological mechanisms that determine these rhythmic patterns of epileptiform discharges remains an open question. Many people with epilepsy identify precipitants of their seizures, the most common of which include stress, sleep deprivation and fatigue. To quantify the impact of these physiological factors, we analysed 24-hour EEG recordings from a cohort of 107 people with idiopathic generalized epilepsy. We found two subgroups with distinct distributions of epileptiform discharges: one with highest incidence during sleep and the other during day-time. We interrogated these data using a mathematical model that describes the transitions between background and epileptiform activity in large-scale brain networks. This model was extended to include a time-dependent forcing term, where the excitability of nodes within the network could be modulated by other factors. We calibrated this forcing term using independently-collected human cortisol (the primary stress-responsive hormone characterised by circadian and ultradian patterns of secretion) data and sleep-staged EEG from healthy human participants. We found that either the dynamics of cortisol or sleep stage transition, or a combination of both, could explain most of the observed distributions of epileptiform discharges. Our findings provide conceptual evidence for the existence of underlying physiological drivers of rhythms of epileptiform discharges. These findings should motivate future research to explore these mechanisms in carefully designed experiments using animal models or people with epilepsy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Small Training Dataset Convolutional Neural Networks for Application Specific Super-Resolution Microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Machine learning (ML) models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used to significantly increase microscopy resolution, speed (signal-to-noise ratio), and data interpretation. The bottleneck in developing effective ML systems is often the need to acquire large datasets to train the neural network. This paper demonstrates how adding a dense encoder-decoder block can be useful to effectively train a CNN that provides super-resolution images from conventional diffraction-limited microscopy images when trained using a small dataset containing 15 field-of-views (FOVs). DenseED blocks use a dense layer that concatenates features from the previous convolutional layer to the next convolutional layer. Demonstrate using DenseED blocks in fully convolutional networks (FCNs) to estimate the super-resolution images when trained with a small training dataset (15 FOVs) of human cells from the Widefield2SIM dataset and the fluorescent-labeled fixed bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (BPAE samples). Conventional ML models without DenseED blocks trained on small datasets fail to accurately estimate super-resolution images while models, including the DenseED blocks can. The average resolution and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) improvements achieved using DenseED blocks in FCNs when trained with 15 FOVs are 2 times and ~3.2 dB, respectively. In addition, we evaluated various configurations of target image generation methods (experimentally captured target and computationally generated target) that are used to train the FCNs with and without DenseED blocks and showed with DenseED blocks outperform compared to simple FCNs without DenseED blocks. Hence, the proposed approach indicates that microscopy applications can use DenseED blocks to train on smaller datasets that are application specific/experimental modality specific imaging platforms such as MRI/X-ray and other in vivo imaging modalities.

                The sense of body ownership, defined as the sensation that one's body belongs to oneself, is a fundamental component of bodily self-consciousness. Several studies have shown the importance of multisensory integration for the emergence of the sense of body ownership, together with the involvement of the parieto-premotor and extrastriate cortices in bodily awareness. However, whether the sense of body ownership elicited by different sources of signal, especially visuotactile and visuomotor inputs, is represented by common neural patterns remains to be elucidated. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the existence of neural correlates of the sense of body ownership independent of the sensory modalities. Participants received tactile stimulation or executed finger movements while given synchronous and asynchronous visual feedback of their hand. We used multi-voxel patterns analysis (MVPA) to decode the synchronous and asynchronous conditions with cross-classification between two modalities: the classifier was first trained in the visuotactile sessions and then tested in the visuomotor sessions and vice versa. Regions of interest-based and searchlight analyses revealed significant above-chance cross-classification accuracies in the bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS), the bilateral ventral premotor cortex (PMv), and the left extrastriate body area (EBA). Moreover, we observed a significant positive correlation between the cross-classification accuracy in the left PMv and the difference in subjective ratings of the sense of body ownership between the synchronous and asynchronous conditions. Our findings revealed the neural representations of the sense of body ownership in the IPS, PMv, and EBA that is invariant to the sensory modalities.

                Many mental illnesses are accompanied by abnormal risk-avoidance behavior, yet we have only a limited understanding of the neuronal regulatory mechanisms involved. We previously established an inducible DISC1-N terminal fragment transgenic mouse (DISC1-NTM) model which has exhibited risk-avoidance deficiency. Using this model, we analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using snRNA-seq and the results indicate impaired neuron-astrocyte interactions. We used optogenetic tools to modulate astrocytes in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and found that ChR2-expressing astrocytes were able to rescue risk-avoidance impairment in DISC1-NTM mice. Using patch clamp recordings combined with signal-cell qPCR, we found impaired excitability of BLAWFS1 neurons in DISC1-NTM mice and that ChR2-expressing astrocytes can induce action potentials (APs) in WFS1 neurons, which restores WFS1 neuronal activity. WFS1 neurons are necessary for BLA astrocytes to modulate impaired risk-avoidance behavior. These finding provide new insights into mechanisms of astrocyte-neuron interactions and suggest that BLA astrocytes may be a promising target for impaired risk avoidance in mental illness.

                Recent work indicates that pupil-linked phasic arousal signals reduce the impact of prior expectations and biases on decision formation. It has remained unclear whether phasic arousal (i) causes the bias reduction, if (ii) choosing against one's bias causes phasic arousal, or if (iii) a third variable is driving both. Here, using an auditory accessory stimulus, we found evidence for the first scenario: on accessory stimulus vs normal trials, pupil-linked phasic arousal was robustly elevated and choice bias was reduced. With computational modeling of behavior, we established that the bias reduction was not due to a change in response caution (i.e., speed-accuracy tradeoff), but due to a change in a bias in the accumulation of evidence leading up to a choice. Thus, pupil-linked phasic arousal shapes choice behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">LSD-induced increase of Ising temperature and algorithmic complexity of brain dynamics</a></h4>

              
                A topic of growing interest in computational neuroscience is the discovery of fundamental principles underlying global dynamics and self-organization of the brain. Statistical physics offers powerful tools to analyze complex many-body systems and has delivered computational models such as the generalized Ising model, one of the simplest known systems displaying phase transitions. Prior work has shown that different brain states may be mapped into pairwise maximum entropy Ising models at varying distances from the critical temperature. Here, we use this framework to analyze resting state fMRI BOLD data collected in an earlier study from fifteen subjects in a control condition (placebo) and during psychedelic ingestion (LSD). We first parcellate the data in AAL space and, to address the limited quantity of data available from typical fMRI BOLD studies, we create an "archetype" pairwise maximum entropy or Ising model representative of the entire dataset. The archetype model is then personalized for each individual and condition through an adjustment of the system temperature. We analyze the resulting set of temperatures to show first that, at the group level and in both conditions, the model is near criticality but situated in the paramagnetic phase. Second, the individualized Ising temperature increases significantly under the effects of LSD compared with the placebo condition (p = 9 x 10-5). That is, LSD ingestion shifts the system away from the critical point between paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases to a more disordered state. Next, we estimate the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) complexity of the binarized BOLD data (flattened along the spatial dimension first) for each participant and condition and of the synthetic data generated with the individualized model using the Metropolis algorithm. We find that the LZW complexity computed directly from experimental data reveals a weak statistical relationship with the condition (p = 0.04 one-tailed Wilcoxon test), and none with Ising temperature (r(13) = 0.13, p = 0.65), presumably due to the short length of the time series and group size. However, the LZW complexity computed using synthetic data from the personalized archetype model correlates strongly with individualized temperature (p = 2.7 x 10-6) and hence with condition (p = 9 x 10-5, one-tailed Wilcoxon test). We then explored the estimation of algorithmic complexity using the block decomposition method (BDM). The BDM complexity of the experimental data displayed a robust correlation with Ising temperature (r(13) = 0.56, p = 0.03) and a weak but significant correlation with condition (p = 0.04, one-tailed Wilcoxon test). We also calculated the BDM complexity of the synthetic data generated by the model, and it correlates strongly with Ising temperature (r(13) = 0.97, p = 8.9 x 10-10) and hence condition (p = 2 x 10-4, one-tailed Wilcoxon test). This study suggests, together with prior ones, that the effects of LSD increase the complexity of brain dynamics. In agreement with earlier work using the Ising formalism, we find the brain state in the placebo condition is already above the critical point, with LSD resulting in a shift away from criticality into a more disordered state.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A computational framework linking synaptic adaptation to circuit behaviors in the early visual system</a></h4>

              
                Retina ribbon synapses are the first synapses in the visual system. Unlike the conventional synapses in the central nervous system triggered by action potentials, ribbon synapses are uniquely driven by graded membrane potentials and are thought to transfer early sensory information faithfully. However, how ribbon synapses compress the visual signals and contribute to visual adaptation in retina circuits is less understood. To this end, we introduce a physiologically constrained module for the ribbon synapse, termed Ribbon Adaptive Block (RAB), and an extended "hierarchical Linear-Nonlinear-Synapse" (hLNS) framework for the retina circuit. Our models can elegantly reproduce a wide range of experimental recordings on synaptic and circuit-level adaptive behaviors across different cell types and species. In particular, it shows strong robustness to unseen stimulus protocols. Intriguingly, when using the hLNS framework to fit intra-cellular recordings from the retina circuit under stimuli similar to natural conditions, we revealed rich and diverse adaptive time constants of ribbon synapses. Furthermore, we predicted a frequency-sensitive gain-control strategy for the synapse between the photoreceptor and the CX bipolar cell, which differ from the classic contrast-based strategy in retina circuits. Overall, our framework provides a powerful analytical tool for exploring synaptic adaptation mechanisms in early sensory coding.

                Grid cells play a principal role in enabling mammalian cognitive representations of ambient environments. The key property of these cells---the regular arrangement of their firing fields---is commonly viewed as means for establishing spatial scales or encoding specific locations. However, using grid cells' spiking outputs for deducing spatial orderliness proves to be a strenuous task, due to fairly irregular activation patterns triggered by the animal's sporadic visits to the grid fields. The following discussion addresses statistical mechanisms enabling emergent regularity of grid cell firing activity, from the perspective of percolation theory. In particular, it is shown that the range of neurophysiological parameters required for spiking percolation phenomena matches experimental data, which points at biological viability of the percolation approach and casts a new light on the role of grid cells in organizing the hippocampal map.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Large-Scale ENIGMA Multisite Replication Study of Brain Age in Depression</a></h4>

              
                Background: Several studies have evaluated whether depressed persons have older appearing brains than their nondepressed peers. However, the estimated neuroimaging derived brain age gap has varied from study to study, likely driven by differences in training and testing sample (size), age range, and used modality/features. To validate our previously developed ENIGMA brain age model and the identified brain age gap, we aim to replicate the presence and effect size estimate previously found in the largest study in depression to date (N=2,126 controls & N=2,675 cases; +1.08 years [SE 0.22], Cohen's d=0.14, 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.20), in independent cohorts that were not part of the original study. Methods: A previously trained brain age model (www.photon-ai.com/enigma_brainage) based on 77 FreeSurfer brain regions of interest was used to obtain unbiased brain age predictions in 751 controls and 766 persons with depression (18-75 years) from 13 new cohorts collected from 20 different scanners. Results: Our ENIGMA MDD brain age model generalized reasonably well to controls from the new cohorts (predicted age vs. age: r = 0.73, R2=0.47, MAE=7.50 years), although the performance varied from cohort to cohort. In these new cohorts, on average, depressed persons showed a significantly higher brain age gap of +1 year (SE 0.35) (Cohen's d=0.15, 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.25) compared with controls, highly similar to our previous finding. Conclusions: This study further validates our previously developed ENIGMA brain age algorithm. Importantly, we replicated the brain age gap in depression with a comparable effect size. Thus, two large-scale independent mega-analyses across in total 32 cohorts and >3,400 patients and >2,800 controls worldwide show reliable but subtle effects of brain aging in adult depression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A low dimensional cognitive-network space in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia</a></h4>

              
                Network neuroscience is a promising approach to explore cognitive processes in neurological disorders. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) show network dysfunctions linked with cognitive deficits. Within this framework, network abnormalities between AD and FTD show both convergent and divergent patterns. However, these functional patterns are far from being established and their relevance to cognitive processes remains to be elucidated. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between cognition and functional connectivity of major cognitive networks in these diseases. Twenty-three bvFTD, 22 AD and 20 controls underwent cognitive evaluation and resting-state functional MRI. Principal component analysis was used to describe cognitive variance across participants. Brain network connectivity was estimated with connectome analysis. Connectivity matrices were created assessing correlations between parcels within each functional network. The following cognitive networks were considered: default mode (DMN), dorsal attention (DAN), ventral attention (VAN) and frontoparietal (FPN) networks. The relationship between cognition and connectivity was assessed using a robust convergent correlation-wise and interaction analyses. Three principal cognitive components explained more than 80% of the cognitive variance: the first component (cogPC1) loaded on memory, the second component (cogPC2) loaded on emotion and language, the third component (cogPC3) loaded on the visuo-spatial and attentional domains. Compared to HC, AD and bvFTD showed impairment in all cogPCs (p<0.002), and bvFTD scored worse than AD in cogPC2 (p=0.031). At the network level, the DMN showed a robust association in the whole group with cogPC1 and cogPC2, and the VAN with cogPC2. By contrast, DAN and FPN showed a divergent pattern between diagnosis and connectivity for cogPC2. We confirmed these results by means of a multivariate analysis (canonical correlation). These results suggest that a low-dimensional representation can account for a large variance in cognitive scores in the continuum from normal to pathological aging. Moreover, cognitive components showed both convergent and divergent patterns with connectivity across AD and bvFTD. The convergent pattern was observed across the networks primarily involved in these diseases (i.e., the DMN and VAN), while a divergent FC-cognitive pattern was mainly observed between attention/executive networks and the language/emotion cognitive component, suggesting the co-existence of compensatory and detrimental mechanisms underlying these components.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Local Field Potentials, Spiking Activity, and Receptive Fields in Human Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The concept of receptive field (RF) is central to sensory neuroscience. Neuronal RF properties have been substantially studied in animals, while those in humans remain nearly unexplored. Here, we measured neuronal RFs with intracranial local field potentials (LFPs) and spiking activity in human visual cortex (V1/V2/V3). We recorded LFPs via macro-contacts and discovered that RF sizes estimated from low-frequency activity (LFA, 0.5 to 30 Hz) were larger than those estimated from low-gamma activity (LGA, 30 to 60 Hz) and high-gamma activity (HGA, 60 to 150 Hz). We then took a rare opportunity to record LFPs and spiking activity via microwires in V1 simultaneously. We found that RF sizes and temporal profiles measured from LGA and HGA closely matched those from spiking activity. In sum, this study reveals that spiking activity of neurons in human visual cortex could be well approximated by LGA and HGA in RF estimation and temporal profile measurement, implying the pivotal functions of LGA and HGA in early visual information processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inflammation-induced mitochondrial and metabolic disturbances in sensory neurons control the switch from acute to chronic pain</a></h4>

              
                Pain often persists in patients with inflammatory diseases, even when the inflammation has subsided. The molecular mechanisms leading to this failure in resolution of inflammatory pain and the transition to chronic pain are poorly understood. Mitochondrial dysfunction in sensory neurons has been linked to chronic pain, but its role in resolution of inflammatory pain is unclear. Transient inflammation causes neuronal plasticity, called hyperalgesic priming, which impairs resolution of hyperalgesia induced by a subsequent inflammatory stimulus. We identified that hyperalgesic priming in mice caused disturbances in mitochondrial respiration, oxidative stress, and redox balance in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. Preventing these priming-induced disturbances restored resolution of inflammatory hyperalgesia. Concurrent with these mitochondrial and metabolic changes, the expression of ATPSc-KMT, a mitochondrial methyltransferase, was increased in DRG neurons in primed mice. ATPSc-KMT overexpression in DRG neurons of naive mice induced similar mitochondrial and metabolic changes as observed after priming, leading to failure in pain resolution. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, knockdown of ATPSCKMT expression, or NAD+ supplementation were sufficient to restore resolution of inflammatory pain and prevent chronic pain development. Thus, inflammation-induced mitochondrial-dependent disturbances in DRG neurons promote failure in inflammatory pain resolution and drive the transition to chronic pain.

	<p>Inflammatory reaction after ischemia-reperfusion contributes significantly to a worsened prognosis, and microglia activation is the main resource of inflammation in the nervous system. Targeting STAT5 has been shown to be a highly effective anti-inflammatory therapy; however, the mechanism by which the STAT5 signaling pathway regulates neuroinflammation following brain injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion remains unclear. Dauricine is an effective agent in anti-inflammation and neuroprotection, but the mechanism by which dauricine acts in ischemia-reperfusion remained unknown. This study is the first to find that the anti-inflammation mechanism of dauricine mainly occurs through the STAT5-NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B pathway and that it might act as a STAT5 inhibitor. Dauricine suppresses the inflammation caused by cytokines Eotaxin, KC, TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;, IL-1&amp;amp;alpha;, IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, IL-6, IL-12&amp;amp;beta;, and IL-17&amp;amp;alpha;, as well as inhibiting microglia activation. The STAT5b mutant at Tyr-699 reverses the protective effect of dauricine on the oxygen-glucose deprivation-reperfusion injury of neurons and reactivates the P-NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B expression in microglia. These results suggest that dauricine might be able to suppress the neuroinflammation and protect the neurons from the injury of post-ischemia-reperfusion injury via mediating the microglia activation through the STAT5-NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B pathway. As a potential therapeutic target for neuroinflammation, STAT5 needs to be given further attention regarding its role in ischemic stroke.</p>

	<p>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide novel hands-free interaction strategies. However, the performance of BCIs is affected by the user&amp;amp;rsquo;s mental energy to some extent. In this study, we aimed to analyze the combined effects of decreased mental energy and lack of sleep on BCI performance and how to reduce these effects. We defined the low-mental-energy (LME) condition as a combined condition of decreased mental energy and lack of sleep. We used a long period of work (&amp;amp;gt;=18 h) to induce the LME condition, and then P300- and SSVEP-based BCI tasks were conducted in LME or normal conditions. Ten subjects were recruited in this study. Each subject participated in the LME- and normal-condition experiments within one week. For the P300-based BCI, we used two decoding algorithms: stepwise linear discriminant (SWLDA) and least square regression (LSR). For the SSVEP-based BCI, we used two decoding algorithms: canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and filter bank canonical correlation analysis (FBCCA). Accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR) were used as performance metrics. The experimental results showed that for the P300-based BCI, the average accuracy was reduced by approximately 35% (with a SWLDA classifier) and approximately 40% (with a LSR classifier); the average ITR was reduced by approximately 6 bits/min (with a SWLDA classifier) and approximately 7 bits/min (with an LSR classifier). For the SSVEP-based BCI, the average accuracy was reduced by approximately 40% (with a CCA classifier) and approximately 40% (with a FBCCA classifier); the average ITR was reduced by approximately 20 bits/min (with a CCA classifier) and approximately 19 bits/min (with a FBCCA classifier). Additionally, the amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio of the evoked electroencephalogram signals were lower in the LME condition, while the degree of fatigue and the task load of each subject were higher. Further experiments suggested that increasing stimulus size, flash duration, and flash number could improve BCI performance in LME conditions to some extent. Our experiments showed that the LME condition reduced BCI performance, the effects of LME on BCI did not rely on specific BCI types and specific decoding algorithms, and optimizing BCI parameters (e.g., stimulus size) can reduce these effects.</p>

	<p>Background: Mental disorders linked with dysfunction in the temporal cortex, such as anxiety and depression, can increase the morbidity and mortality of people living with HIV (PLWHA). Expressions of both nucleobindin 1 (NUCB1) and cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1) in the neurons have been found to alter in patients with depressive disorder, but whether it is involved in the development of depression in the context of HIV infection is unknown. Objectives To investigate the effects of NUCB1 on depressive disorder among PLWHA and preliminarily explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. Methods: Individuals who were newly HIV diagnosed were assessed on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS). Then SHIV-infected rhesus monkeys were used to investigate the possible involvement of the NUCB1 and the CNR1 protein in depression-like behavior. Results: The prevalence rate of depression among PLWHA was 27.33% (41/150). The mechanism results showing elevated NUCB1 levels in cerebrospinal fluid from HIV-infected patients suffering from depression were confirmed compared to those of HIV-infected patients. Moreover, the immunohistochemical analysis indicated the expression of NUCB1 in the temporal cortex neurons of SHIV-infected monkeys was higher than that of the healthy control. Conversely, CNR1 expression was down-regulated at protein levels. Conclusions: Depression symptoms are common among PLWHA and associate with NUCB1 expression increases, and NUCB1 may be a potential target for depression.</p>

                SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is known to be attenuated in laboratory animals. Liu et.al. here report that the Omicron variant spike protein enables virus to infect laboratory mice via its interaction with mouse ACE2. The attenuation of Omicron in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice, however, is attributed to mutations outside the spike region.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Linking neuronal and hemodynamic network signatures in the resting human brain</a></h4>

              
                Despite several studies investigating the relationship between blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI) and neuroelectric activity, our understanding is rather incomplete. For instance, the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) is commonly used, regardless of brain region, frequency of electric activity and functional networks. We studied this relationship between BOLD-fMRI and electroencephalography (EEG) signal of the human brain in detail using simultaneous fMRI and EEG in healthy awake human subjects at rest. Signals from EEG sensors were filtered into different frequency bands and projected into three-dimensional source space. The correlation of the time courses of the two modalities were quantified on a voxel-by-voxel basis on full-brain level as well as separately for each resting state network, with different temporal shifts and EEG frequency bands. We found highly significant correlations between the BOLD-fMRI signal and simultaneously measured EEG, yet with varying time-lags for different frequency bands and different resting state networks. Additionally, we found significant negative correlations with a much longer delay in the fMRI BOLD signal. The positive correlations were mostly around 6-8 seconds delayed in the BOLD time course while the negative correlations were noticed with a BOLD offset of around 20 to 26 seconds. These positive and negative correlation patterns included the commonly reported alpha and gamma bands but also extend in other frequency bands giving characteristic profiles for different resting state networks. Our results confirm recent works that suggest that the relationship between the two modalities is rather brain region / network-specific than a global function and suggest that applying a global canonical HRF for electrophysiological data is probably insufficient to account for the different spatial and temporal dynamics of different brain networks. Moreover, our results suggest that the HRF also varies in different frequency bands giving way to further studies investigating cross-frequency coupling and its interplay with resting state networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Boosting of neural circuit chaos at the onset of collective oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Cortical networks in vivo exhibit highly irregular spiking activity to repeated stimuli. One source of such variability is network chaos, ever-present in spiking network models. In order to reliably and robustly represent and transmit information, cortical networks must implement active mechanisms to quench undesired changes in spiking patterns. Neuronal oscillations have been proposed as a mechanism to flexibly gate information flow across the cortex, but whether these collective rhythms would actually contribute to quenching spiking unreliability and tame network chaos by synchronizing activity, or on the contrary, intensify chaos by acting as a common drive to the network, is not easily predictable. Here we investigate the dynamical properties of network models with respect to two known control parameters regulating collective oscillatory activity: delayed re-current inhibition and an external periodic drive. To do so, we advanced the tractability of large spiking networks of exactly solvable neuronal models by developing a strategy that allows for exact characterization of the dynamics on the attractor of effectively delayed network models in a system with fixed and finite degrees of freedom. We find that, below the transition to collective oscillations, neuronal networks have a stereotypical dependence on the delay so far only described for scalar systems and low-dimensional maps. We demonstrate that the emergence of internally generated oscillations induces a complete dynamical reconfiguration, by increasing the dimensionality of the chaotic attractor, the speed at which nearby trajectories separate from one another, and the rate at which the network produces entropy. Our results suggest that simple temporal dynamics of the mean activity can have a profound effect on the structure of the spiking patterns and therefore on the information processing capability of neuronal networks.

Significance StatementRecordings in vivo show that spiking patterns in response to repeated stimuli in cortex are highly variable. Here we investigate whether collective oscillations, either internally generated through delayed recurrent inhibition or by external feed-forward drive, are able to quench chaotic variability by structuring spiking patterns or if they contribute to intensifying chaos. We develop a strategy that allowed us to completely characterize the dynamics of delayed spiking circuit models by means of classic ergodic theory measures. We find that chaos is intensified at the onset of collective oscillations, but that transient oscillatory input, where the dynamics are most resembling those found in biological networks, has only a mild effect on chaos and hence on network variability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Aging Differentially Affects Axonal Autophagosome Formation and Maturation</a></h4>

              
                Misregulation of neuronal autophagy has been implicated in age-related neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinsons disease and Huntingtons disease. We compared autophagosome formation and maturation in primary murine neurons during development and through aging to elucidate how aging affects neuronal autophagy. We observed an age-related decrease in the rate of formation of LC3B-positive autophagosomes leading to a significant decrease in the density of autophagosomes along the axon. Next, we assessed the maturation of autophagic vesicles and identified a surprising increase in their maturation in neurons from aged mice. While we did not detect notable changes in endolysosomal content in the distal axon during aging, we found that autophagic vesicles were transported more efficiently in neurons from adult mice than in neurons from young mice. This efficient transport of autophagic vesicles in both the distal and proximal axon is maintained in neurons from aged mice and indicates that aging alone does not impair transport nor negatively impact the later stages of autophagy. However, the pronounced deficit in autophagosome biogenesis in aged neurons may contribute to a decreased capacity to clear aggregated proteins or dysfunctional organelles and thus contribute to age-related degeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors in the gustatory cortex influence food intake</a></h4>

              
                The gustatory region of the insular cortex (GC) processes taste information in manners important for taste-guided behaviors, including food intake itself. In addition to oral gustatory stimuli, GC activity is also influenced by physiological states including hunger. The specific cell-types and molecular mechanisms that afford with GC with such influences on food intake are unclear. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is produced by neurons in the brain whereafter it can act upon GLP-1 receptor-expressing (GLP-1R+) neurons found in several brain regions. In these brain regions, GLP-1R agonism suppresses homeostatic food intake and dampens the hedonic value of food. Here, we report in mice of both sexes that cells within the GC express GLP-1R mRNA and further, by ex vivo brain slice recordings, that GC GLP-1R+ neurons are depolarized by the selective GLP-1R agonist, exendin-4 (Ex-4). Next we found that chemogenetic stimulation of GLP-1R+ neurons, and also pharmacological stimulation of GC-GLP-1Rs themselves, both reduced homeostatic food intake. When maintained on a high-fat diet, obese mice exhibited impaired food intake responses when Ex-4 was administered into the GC. Yet, when obese mice were switched to a low-fat diet, the effect of GC Ex-4 was restored - indicating that GC GLP-1R influences may depend upon palatability of the food. Together, these results provide evidence for a specific cell population in the GC which may hold roles in both homeostatic and hedonic food intake.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intrinsic neural excitability induces time-dependent overlap of memory engrams</a></h4>

              
                Memories are thought to be stored in neural ensembles known as engrams that are specifically reactivated during memory recall. Recent studies have found that memory engrams of two events that happened close in time tend to overlap in the hippocampus and the amygdala, and these overlaps have been shown to support memory linking. It has been hypothesised that engram overlaps arise from the mechanisms that regulate memory allocation itself, involving neural excitability, but the exact process remains unclear. Indeed, most theoretical studies focus on synaptic plasticity and little is known about the role of intrinsic plasticity, which could be mediated by neural excitability and serve as a complementary mechanism for forming memory engrams. Here, we developed a rate-based recurrent neural network that includes both synaptic plasticity and neural excitability. We obtained structural and functional overlap of memory engrams for contexts that are presented close in time, consistent with experimental studies. Moreover, we showed that enhancing the initial excitability of a subset of neurons just before presenting a context biases the memory allocation to these neurons. We then explored the role of inhibition as a way of controlling competition among neurons from two ensembles. This work suggests mechanisms underlying the role of intrinsic excitability in memory allocation and linking, and yields predictions regarding the dynamics of memory engrams.

	<p>Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage between normal aging and probable Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. It is of great value to screen for MCI in the community. A novel machine learning (ML) model is composed of electroencephalography (EEG), eye tracking (ET), and neuropsychological assessments. This study has been proposed to identify MCI subjects from normal controls (NC). Methods: Two cohorts were used in this study. Cohort 1 as the training and validation group, includes184 MCI patients and 152 NC subjects. Cohort 2 as an independent test group, includes 44 MCI and 48 NC individuals. EEG, ET, Neuropsychological Tests Battery (NTB), and clinical variables with age, gender, educational level, MoCA-B, and ACE-R were selected for all subjects. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were adopted to evaluate the capabilities of this tool to classify MCI from NC. The clinical model, the EEG and ET model, and the neuropsychological model were compared. Results: We found that the classification accuracy of the proposed model achieved 84.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.43% and 88.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.59% in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively. The area under curve (AUC) of the proposed tool achieved 0.941 (0.893&amp;amp;ndash;0.982) in Cohort 1 and 0.966 (0.921&amp;amp;ndash;0.988) in Cohort 2, respectively. Conclusions: The proposed model incorporation of EEG, ET, and neuropsychological assessments yielded excellent classification performances, suggesting its potential for future application in cognitive decline prediction.</p>

	<p>A cochlear implant (CI) is currently the only FDA-approved biomedical device that can restore hearing for the majority of patients with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). While prelingually and postlingually deaf individuals benefit substantially from CI, the outcomes after implantation vary greatly. Numerous studies have attempted to study the variables that affect CI outcomes, including the personal characteristics of CI candidates, environmental variables, and device-related variables. Up to 80% of the results remained unexplainable because all these variables could only roughly predict auditory performance with a CI. Brain structure/function differences after hearing deprivation, that is, cortical reorganization, has gradually attracted the attention of neuroscientists. The cross-modal reorganization in the auditory cortex following deafness is thought to be a key factor in the success of CI. In recent years, the adaptive and maladaptive effects of this reorganization on CI rehabilitation have been argued because the neural mechanisms of how this reorganization impacts CI learning and rehabilitation have not been revealed. Due to the lack of brain processes describing how this plasticity affects CI learning and rehabilitation, the adaptive and deleterious consequences of this reorganization on CI outcomes have recently been the subject of debate. This review describes the evidence for different roles of cross-modal reorganization in CI performance and attempts to explore the possible reasons. Additionally, understanding the core influencing mechanism requires taking into account the cortical changes from deafness to hearing restoration. However, methodological issues have restricted longitudinal research on cortical function in CI. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been increasingly used for the study of brain function and language assessment in CI because of its unique advantages, which are considered to have great potential. Here, we review studies on auditory cortex reorganization in deaf patients and CI recipients, and then we try to illustrate the feasibility of fNIRS as a neuroimaging tool in predicting and assessing speech performance in CI recipients. Here, we review research on the cross-modal reorganization of the auditory cortex in deaf patients and CI recipients and seek to demonstrate the viability of using fNIRS as a neuroimaging technique to predict and evaluate speech function in CI recipients.</p>

	<p>It has been well established that very-high-altitude (&amp;amp;gt;4000 m) environments can affect human cognitive function and brain activity. However, the effects of long-term exposure to moderate altitudes (2000&amp;amp;ndash;3000 m) on cognitive function and brain activity are not well understood. In the present cross-sectional study, we utilized an N-back working memory task and resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy to examine the effects of two years of exposure to 2260 m altitude on working memory and resting-state brain activity in 208 college students, compared with a control group at the sea level. The results showed that there was no significant change in spatial working memory performance after two years of exposure to 2260 m altitude. In contrast, the analysis of resting-state brain activity revealed changes in functional connectivity patterns in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), with the global efficiency increased and the local efficiency decreased after two years of exposure to 2260 m altitude. These results suggest that long-term exposure to moderate altitudes has no observable effect on spatial working memory performance, while significant changes in functional connectivity and brain network properties could possibly occur to compensate for the effects of mild hypoxic environments. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the resting state activity in the PFC associated with working memory in people exposed to moderate altitudes.</p>

	<p>Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are complex disorders which can be associated with many comorbidities and exhibit multifactorial-dependent phenotypes. An important characteristic is represented by the early onset of the symptoms, during childhood or young adulthood, with a great impact on the socio-cognitive functioning of the affected individuals. Thus, the aim of our review is to describe and to argue the necessity of early developmental stages zebrafish models, focusing on NDDs, especially autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and also on schizophrenia. The utility of the animal models in NDDs or schizophrenia research remains quite controversial. Relevant discussions can be opened regarding the specific characteristics of the animal models and the relationship with the etiologies, physiopathology, and development of these disorders. The zebrafish models behaviors displayed as early as during the pre-hatching embryo stage (locomotor activity prone to repetitive behavior), and post-hatching embryo stage, such as memory, perception, affective-like, and social behaviors can be relevant in ASD and schizophrenia research. The neurophysiological processes impaired in both ASD and schizophrenia are generally highly conserved across all vertebrates. However, the relatively late individual development and conscious social behavior exhibited later in the larval stage are some of the most important limitations of these model animal species.</p>

                <h2>Background and Objectives</h2>
<p>We sought to determine clinical significance of neuronal septin autoimmunity and evaluate for potential IgG effects.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Septin-IgGs were detected by indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFAs; mouse tissue and cell based) or Western blot. IgG binding to (and internalization of) extracellular septin epitopes were evaluated for by live rat hippocampal neuron assay. The impact of purified patient IgGs on murine cortical neuron function was determined by recording extracellular field potentials in a multielectrode array platform.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Septin-IgGs were identified in 23 patients. All 8 patients with septin-5-IgG detected had cerebellar ataxia, and 7 had prominent eye movement disorders. One of 2 patients with co-existing septin-7-IgG had additional psychiatric phenotype (apathy, emotional blunting, and poor insight). Fifteen patients had septin-7 autoimmunity, without septin-5-IgG detected. Disorders included encephalopathy (11; 2 patients with accompanying myelopathy, and 2 were relapsing), myelopathy (3), and episodic ataxia (1). Psychiatric symptoms (≥1 of agitation, apathy, catatonia, disorganized thinking, and paranoia) were prominent in 6 of 11 patients with encephalopathic symptoms. Eight of 10 patients with data available (from 23 total) improved after immunotherapy, and a further 2 patients improved spontaneously. Staining of plasma membranes of live hippocampal neurons produced by patient IgGs (subclasses 1 and 2) colocalized with pre- and post-synaptic markers. Decreased spiking and bursting behavior in mixed cultures of murine glutamatergic and GABAergic cortical neurons produced by patient IgGs were attributable to neither antigenic crosslinking and internalization nor complement activation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Septin-IgGs are predictive of distinct treatment-responsive autoimmune central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Live neuron binding and induced electrophysiologic effects by patient IgGs may support septin-specific pathophysiology. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We assessed whether hematoma expansion (HE) and favorable outcome differ according to type of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Among participants with ICH enrolled in the TICH-2 (Tranexamic Acid for Hyperacute Primary Intracerebral Haemorrhage) trial, we assessed baseline scans for hematoma location and presence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) using computed tomography (CT, simplified Edinburgh criteria) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; Boston criteria) and categorized ICH as lobar CAA, lobar non-CAA, and nonlobar. The main outcomes were HE and favorable functional outcome. We constructed multivariate regression models and assessed treatment effects using interaction terms.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 2,298 out of 2,325 participants were included with available CT (98.8%; median age = 71 years, interquartile range = 60-80 years; 1,014 female). Additional MRI was available in 219 patients (9.5%). Overall, 1,637 participants (71.2%) had nonlobar ICH; the remaining 661 participants (28.8%) had lobar ICH, of whom 202 patients had lobar CAA-ICH (8.8%, 173 participants according to Edinburgh and 29 participants according to Boston criteria) and 459 did not (lobar non-CAA, 20.0%). For HE, we found a significant interaction of lobar CAA ICH with time from onset to randomization (increasing risk with time, <i>p</i>
<sub>interaction</sub> &lt; 0.001) and baseline ICH volume (constant risk regardless of volume, <i>p</i>
<sub>interaction</sub> &lt; 0.001) but no association between type of ICH and risk of HE or favorable outcome. Tranexamic acid significantly reduced the risk of HE (adjusted odds ratio = 0.7, 95% confidence interval = 0.6–1.0, <i>p</i> = 0.020) without statistically significant interaction with type of ICH (<i>p</i>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural oscillations in the aging brain associated with interference control in word production</a></h4>

              
                Speaking is not only about retrieving words and structuring them into sentences, but it also requires top-down control to plan and execute speech. In previous electrophysiological research with young-adult speakers, mid-frontal theta oscillations have been observed using a picture-word interference paradigm. With this paradigm, participants name pictures while ignoring superimposed distractor words. In particular, mid-frontal theta power increases for categorically related distractors relative to other types of distractors, reflecting the top-down interference control in resolving the competition between processing streams during word production (Piai, Roelofs, Jensen, Schoffelen, & Bonnefond, 2014). In the present study, we conceptually replicated the magnetoencephalography study by Piai et al. (2014) with an older group of healthy adults (mean age of 60 years). Behaviorally, we replicated distractor semantic interference and Stroop-like interference effects usually observed in young adults. However, we did not find the corresponding theta modulation associated with these interference effects on the neural level. Instead, we found beta power decreases for both effects, mostly pronounced in the left posterior temporal and inferior parietal cortex. The distinct spectro-spatial-temporal profile of the oscillatory effects in the older population suggests different underlying dynamics relative to the midline frontal effect previously found in young-adult speakers. Our results indicate that the neural underpinnings of top-down interference control may be modified by aging, and that the mid-frontal theta cannot be the exclusive mechanism enabling interference control during spoken word production.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Role of mPFC DUSP1 in regulating the sensitivity to cocaine in adolescent cocaine-exposed mice of adulthood</a></h4>

              
                Cocaine abuse during adolescence increases the risk for developing drug addiction in later life, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, adolescent cocaine-exposed (ACE) male mice models were established by giving once-daily intraperitoneal injections of 15 mg/kg cocaine to mice during adolescence (P28-P42). We found that ACE mice exhibited a higher sensitivity to subthreshold dose of cocaine (1 mg/kg) in adulthood, accompanied with triggered activities and dendritic spine density of pyramidal neuron, increased Dusp1 gene, as well as reduced protein levels and activity of dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) in mPFC. Specific overexpression of DUSP1 on mPFC glutamatergic neurons efficiently blocked cocaine-preferred behaviors and reduced mPFC activity, while knockdown of DUSP1 maintained cocaine-preferred behaviors and increased mPFC activity in ACE mice. MAPK-related signals, especially ERK1/2, might underlie the mediating effects of DUSP1. Collectively, these findings suggested that targeting mPFC DUSP1 may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment and attenuation of addiction susceptibility, particularly in addicts with a history of adolescent drugs exposure.

Significance statementCocaine-exposed experience during adolescence enhances the sensitivity of mice to drugs and triggers more activity of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in adulthood, which is rescued by specific overexpression of dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) on glutamatergic neurons of mPFC. MAPK-related signals, especially ERK1/2, might underlie the regulatory effects of DUSP1.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Uman Type NF-L Antibodies Are Effective Reagents for the Imaging of Neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Recent work shows that certain immunological assays for the neurofilament light chain NF-L detect informative signals in the CSF and blood of human and animals affected by a variety of CNS injury and disease states. Much of this work has been performed using two mouse monoclonal antibodies to NF-L, UD1 and UD2, also known as 2.1 and 47.3 respectively. These are the essential components of the Uman Diagnostics NF-Light ELISA kit, the Quanterix Simoa bead based NF-L assay and others. We show here that the antibodies bind to neighboring epitopes in a short, conserved and unusual peptide in the NF-L "rod" Coil 2 region. We also describe a surprising and useful feature of Uman and similar reagents. While other well characterized NF-L antibodies show robust staining of countless cells and processes in CNS sections from healthy rats, both Uman antibodies reveal only a minor subset of presumably spontaneously degenerating or degenerated neurons and their processes. However following experimental mid-cervical injuries to rat spinal cord both Uman antibodies recognize numerous profiles in tissue sections. The Uman positive material was associated with fiber tracts expected to be damaged by the injury administered and the profiles had the swollen, beaded, discontinuous and sinusoidal morphology expected for degenerating and degenerated processes. We also found that several antibodies to the C terminal "tail" region of NF-L stain undamaged axonal profiles but fail to recognize the Uman positive material. The unmasking of the Uman epitopes and the loss of the NF-L tail epitopes can be mimicked by treating sections from healthy animals with proteases suggesting that the immunological changes we have discovered are due to neurodegeneration induced proteolysis. We have also generated a novel panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibody reagents directed against the region of NF-L including the Uman epitopes which have staining properties identical to the Uman reagents. Using these we show that the NF-L region to which the Uman reagents bind contains further hidden epitopes distinct from those recognized by the two Uman reagents. We speculate that the Uman type epitopes are part of a binding region important for higher order neurofilament assembly. The work provides important insights into the properties of the NF-L biomarker, describes novel and useful properties of Uman type and NF-L tail binding antibodies and provides a hypothesis relevant to further understanding of neurofilament assembly.

                Accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) on biopolymers accompany cellular aging and drives poorly understood disease processes. Here, we studied how AGEs contribute to development of early on-set Parkinsons Disease (PD) caused by loss-of-function of DJ1, a protein deglycase. In induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived midbrain organoid models deficient for DJ1 activity, we find that lysosomal proteolysis is impaired, causing AGEs to accumulate, -synuclein (-syn) phosphorylation to increase, and proteins to aggregate. These processes are at least partly driven by astrocytes, as DJ1 loss reduces their capacity to provide metabolic support and triggers acquisition of a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Consistently, in co-cultures, we find that DJ1-expressing astrocytes are able to reverse the proteolysis deficits of DJ1 knockout midbrain neurons. In conclusion, astrocytes capacity to clear toxic damaged proteins is critical to preserve neuronal function and their dysfunction contributes to the neurodegeneration observed in PD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cell-type-specific whole-genome landscape of ΔFOSB binding in nucleus accumbens after chronic cocaine exposure</a></h4>

              
                The ability of neurons to respond to external stimuli involves adaptations of gene expression. The transcription factor, {Delta}FOSB, is important for the development of drug addiction, however, its gene targets have not been identified. Here we use CUT&RUN to map the genome-wide enrichment of {Delta}FOSB binding in the two major neuronal cell types of the nucleus accumbens, a key brain reward region, after cocaine exposure. The binding landscape shows that the majority of {Delta}FOSB peaks occur outside of promoter regions, including intergenic regions, and are surrounded by epigenetic marks indicative of active enhancers. BRG1, the core subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, overlaps with {Delta}FOSB peaks, consistent with earlier studies of {Delta}FOSBs interacting proteins. In addition, in silico analyses predict that {Delta}FOSB cooperatively regulates gene expression with homeobox and T-box transcription factors. These novel findings uncover key elements of {Delta}FOSBs molecular mechanisms in transcriptional regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multimodal brain age estimates relate to Alzheimer disease biomarkers and cognition in early stages: a cross-sectional observational study</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundEstimates of "brain-predicted age" quantify apparent brain age compared to normative trajectories of neuroimaging features. The brain age gap (BAG) between predicted and chronological age is elevated in symptomatic Alzheimer disease (AD), but has not been well explored in preclinical AD. Prior studies have typically modeled BAG with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but more recently other modalities, including functional connectivity (FC) and multimodal MRI, have been explored.

MethodsWe trained three models to predict age from FC, volumetric (Vol), or multimodal MRI (Vol+FC) in 390 control participants (18-89 years old). In independent samples of 144 older adult controls, 154 preclinical AD participants, and 154 cognitively impaired (CI; CDR > 0) participants, we tested relationships between BAG and AD biomarkers of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration, as well as a global cognitive composite.

ResultsAll models predicted age in the control training set, with the multimodal model outperforming the unimodal models. All three BAG estimates were significantly elevated in CI compared to controls. FC-BAG and Vol+FC-BAG were marginally reduced in preclinical AD participants compared to controls. In CI participants only, elevated Vol-BAG and Vol+FC-BAG were associated with more advanced AD pathology and lower cognitive performance.

ConclusionsBoth FC-BAG and Vol-BAG are elevated in CI participants. However, FC and volumetric MRI also capture complementary signals. Specifically, FC-BAG may capture a unique biphasic response to preclinical AD pathology, while Vol-BAG may capture pathological progression and cognitive decline in the symptomatic stage. A multimodal age-prediction model captures these modality-specific patterns, and further, improves sensitivity to healthy age differences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tracking neural correlates of prioritizing working memory representations through retrospective attentional strengthening</a></h4>

              
                Previous work has proposed two potentials benefits of retrospective attention on working memory (WM): target strengthening and non-target inhibition. It remains unknown which hypothesis contributes to the improved WM performance, yet the neural mechanisms responsible for this attentional benefit are unclear. Here, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) signals while 33 participants performed a retrospective-cue WM task. Multivariate pattern classification analysis revealed that only representations of target features were enhanced by valid retrospective attention during the retention, supporting the target strengthening hypothesis. Further univariate analysis found that mid-frontal theta inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) and ERP components were modulated by valid retrospective attention and correlated with individual differences and moment-to-moment fluctuations on behavioral outcomes, suggesting that both trait- and state-level variability in attentional preparatory processes influence goal-directed behavior. Furthermore, task-irrelevant target spatial location could be decoded from EEG signals, indicating that enhanced spatial binding of target representation promotes high WM precision. Importantly, frontoparietal theta-alpha phase-amplitude-coupling was increased by valid retrospective attention and predicted the reduced randomly guessing rates. This long-range connection supported top-down information flow in engagement of frontoparietal networks, which might organize attentional states to integrate target features. Altogether, these results provide neurophysiological bases that retrospective attention improves WM precision through enhancing representation of target and emphasize the critical role of frontoparietal attentional network in the control of WM representations.

	<p>Purpose: To examine the optical coherence tomography (OCT) features of the retina in patients with chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy (CRION) and compare them with those of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) with and without optic neuritis (ON), and healthy controls (HC). Methods: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we used spectral domain OCT to evaluate the retinal structure of 14 participants with CRION, 22 with NMOSD, 40 with RRMS with unilateral ON, and 20 HC. The peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL), total macular volume (TMV), and papillomacular bundle (PMB) were measured, and intra-retinal segmentation was performed to obtain the retinal nerve fiber (RNFL), ganglion cell (GCL), inner plexiform (IPL), inner nuclear (INL), outer plexiform (OPL) and outer nuclear (ONL) layer volumes. Results: The global pRNFL [39.33(&amp;amp;plusmn;1.8) &amp;amp;micro;m] and all its quadrants are significantly thinner in CRION compared with all other groups (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). CRION patients have decreased volumes of TMV, RNFL, GCL, and IPL compared with all other groups (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Severe thinning in pRNFL and thinning in intra-retinal segments of IPL, GCL, RNFL, and TMV could be helpful in differentiating CRION from NMOSD and RRMS.</p>

	<p>Neurodegenerative parkinsonian disorders are characterized by a great diversity of clinical symptoms and underlying neuropathology, yet differential diagnosis during lifetime remains probabilistic. Molecular imaging is a powerful method to detect pathological changes in vivo on a cellular and molecular level with high specificity. Thereby, molecular imaging enables to investigate functional changes and pathological hallmarks in neurodegenerative disorders, thus allowing to better differentiate between different forms of degenerative parkinsonism, improve the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis and disentangle the pathophysiology of disease-related symptoms. The past decade led to significant progress in the field of molecular imaging, including the development of multiple new and promising radioactive tracers for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) as well as novel analytical methods. Here, we review the most recent advances in molecular imaging for the diagnosis, prognosis, and mechanistic understanding of parkinsonian disorders. First, advances in imaging of neurotransmission abnormalities, metabolism, synaptic density, inflammation, and pathological protein aggregation are reviewed, highlighting our renewed understanding regarding the multiplicity of neurodegenerative processes involved in parkinsonian disorders. Consequently, we review the role of molecular imaging in the context of disease-modifying interventions to follow neurodegeneration, ensure stratification, and target engagement in clinical trials.</p>

	<p>Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor, and median survival is relatively short despite aggressive standard treatment. Natural killer (NK) cell dysfunction is strongly associated with tumor recurrence and metastasis but is unclear in glioblastoma. NK activity (NKA) represents NK cell-secreted interferon-&amp;amp;gamma; (IFN-&amp;amp;gamma;), which modulates immunity and inhibits cancer progression. This study aimed to analyze NKA in glioblastoma patients to obtain a clearer overview of immunity surveillance. From 2020 to 2021, a total of 20 patients and six healthy controls were recruited. Peripheral blood samples were collected preoperatively and on postoperative days (POD) 3 and 30. Then, NKA was measured using the NK VUE kit. Although NKA decreased on POD3, it recovered and further significantly enhanced on POD30, with a nearly five-fold increase compared to baseline (p = 0.004). Furthermore, the percentage of CD56brightCD16&amp;amp;minus; NK cells decreased significantly on POD3 (p = 0.022) and further recovered on PO30. Subgroup analysis of extent surgical resection further revealed that the recovery of impaired NKA was attributable to gross total resection (GTR) rather than subtotal resection (STR). In conclusion, NKA is significantly impaired in glioblastoma, and GTR has demonstrated superior benefit in improving the suppressed NKA and increased CD56brightCD16&amp;amp;minus; NK subset in glioblastoma patients, which may be associated with subsequent patients&amp;amp;rsquo; prognosis. Therefore, the goal of performing GTR for glioblastoma should be achieved when possible since it appears to increase NKA cell immunity.</p>

	<p>Due to the complexity of medical imaging techniques and the high heterogeneity of glioma surfaces, image segmentation of human gliomas is one of the most challenging tasks in medical image analysis. Current methods based on convolutional neural networks concentrate on feature extraction while ignoring the correlation between local and global. In this paper, we propose a residual mix transformer fusion net, namely RMTF-Net, for brain tumor segmentation. In the feature encoder, a residual mix transformer encoder including a mix transformer and a residual convolutional neural network (RCNN) is proposed. The mix transformer gives an overlapping patch embedding mechanism to cope with the loss of patch boundary information. Moreover, a parallel fusion strategy based on RCNN is utilized to obtain local&amp;amp;ndash;global balanced information. In the feature decoder, a global feature integration (GFI) module is applied, which can enrich the context with the global attention feature. Extensive experiments on brain tumor segmentation from LGG, BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 demonstrated that our proposed RMTF-Net is superior to existing state-of-art methods in subjective visual performance and objective evaluation.</p>

	<p>Background: Moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise programs have proven to exert positive effects on the cognitive performance of older people. However, the specific effects sport-based exercise programs have on cognitive performance, upon executive functions, remain unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to clarify the effects of sport-based exercise programs on executive functions in older adults, through a systematic review protocol of the scientific literature, with a meta-analysis. Methods: The search was performed in the Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and EBSCO electronic databases by combining keywords and different medical subject headings (MeSH) to identify and evaluate the relevant studies from inception up until June 2022. This study considers longitudinal studies with at least one experimental group and pre- and post-intervention measurements involving healthy older adults of 60 years of age or older. Studies have to consider one or more measures of executive function, including dimensions of working memory, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility, in order to meet the eligibility criteria for inclusion in this report. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale was used for methodological quality assessment studies. The DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was used to compute the meta-analyses and report effect sizes (ES, i.e., Hedges&amp;amp;rsquo; g) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), and a statistical significance set at p &amp;amp;le; 0.05. The ES values were calculated for executive function globally and for each dimension of executive function (e.g., working memory, inhibition, cognitive flexibility) in the experimental and control/comparator groups using the mean and standard deviation values before and after the intervention period. Conclusions: Our systematic review aims to clarify the effects of sport-based exercise programs on executive functions in older adults. The results may help practitioners and stakeholders to provide better evidence-based decisions regarding sport-based exercise program implementation for older adults, and to help them to optimize cognitive functions during the aging process. Ethical permission is not required for this study. Systematic review registration: this systematic review is registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; registration number: CRD42022284788).</p>

	<p>Brain-Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) expression is decreased in conditions associated with cognitive decline as well as metabolic diseases. One potential strategy to improve metabolic health and elevate BDNF is by increasing circulating ketones. Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) stimulates BDNF expression, but the association of circulating BHB and plasma BDNF in humans has not been widely studied. Here, we present results from three studies that evaluated how various methods of inducing ketosis influenced plasma BDNF in humans. Study 1 determined BDNF responses to a single bout of high-intensity cycling after ingestion of a dose of ketone salts in a group of healthy adults who were habitually consuming either a mixed diet or a ketogenic diet. Study 2 compared how a ketogenic diet versus a mixed diet impacts BDNF levels during a 12-week resistance training program in healthy adults. Study 3 examined the effects of a controlled hypocaloric ketogenic diet, with and without daily use of a ketone-salt, on BDNF levels in overweight/obese adults. We found that (1) fasting plasma BDNF concentrations were lower in keto-adapted versus non keto-adapted individuals, (2) intense cycling exercise was a strong stimulus to rapidly increase plasma BDNF independent of ketosis, and (3) clinically significant weight loss was a strong stimulus to decrease fasting plasma BDNF independent of diet composition or level of ketosis. These results highlight the plasticity of plasma BDNF in response to lifestyle factors but does not support a strong association with temporally matched BHB concentrations.</p>

	<p>Objective: Recently, many emotional diseases, such as anxiety and depression, have prevailed, and it is expected that emotional disease will be the leading cause of social and economic burden in 2030. These emotional diseases may be due to certain personality traits, which could be the reasons for the development of mental illness. Personality theories have been constantly developed over the past hundreds of years, and different dimensions of personality traits corresponding to different physiological bases and emotional feelings have been proposed. However, personality may be the least studied area in psychology. Methods: In this paper, we will give a short review on the development of personality theories as well as dimensional emotional theory. Then, we will compare the similarities between the emotional dimension and personality dimension. Furthermore, we will also investigate the neural mechanisms of personality and emotions, focusing on neuromodulators for anxiety-related personality traits, in order to provide a clear relationship between different neurotransmitters and anxiety-related personality traits. Results: The results of our study suggest that the emotional dimension and personality dimension may be somewhat related, for example, the extrovert/introvert dimension of personality might be related to the hedonic dimension, which includes happiness/sadness, and the neurotic dimensions might be related to emotional arousal. In addition, our study found that personality traits are also related to basic emotions, for instance, people who are too self-centered are prone to feeling a mood of disgust or depression, while anger and fear correspond to unstable personality traits. The analysis suggested that the neural substrates of both personality and emotions might be described as follows: extroverted&amp;amp;ndash;joy&amp;amp;ndash;dopamine (DA); introverted&amp;amp;ndash;disgust&amp;amp;ndash;5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT); unstable (neuroticism)&amp;amp;ndash;anger/fear&amp;amp;ndash;noradrenaline (NE); stable&amp;amp;ndash;calmness. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that there is a correlation between personality traits and emotions, and both depend on monoamine neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin). In addition, personality disorders can be interfered via the regulation of emotions and neurotransmitters. This paper opens up a whole new perspective for future research on personality traits and emotional diseases and has great clinical value and practical significance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Dscam1 Has Diverse Neuron Type-Specific Functions in the Developing Drosophila CNS</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Two key features endow <I>Drosophila</I> Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule 1 (Dscam1) with the potential to provide a ubiquitous code for neuronal arbor self-avoidance. First, Dscam1 contains three large cassettes of alternative exons, so that stochastic alternative splicing yields 19,008 Dscam1 isoforms with different Ig ectodomains. Second, each neuron expresses a different subset of Dscam1 isoforms, and isoform-specific homophilic binding causes repulsion. This results in even spacing of self-arbors, while processes of other neurons can intermingle and share the same synaptic partners. In principle, this Dscam1 code could ensure arbor spacing of all neurons in <I>Drosophila</I>. This model is strongly supported by studies on dendrite spacing in the peripheral nervous system and studies on axonal branch segregation during brain development. However, the situation is less clear for central neuron dendrites, the major substrate for synaptic input in the CNS. We systematically tested the role of Dscam1 for dendrite growth and spacing in eight different types of identified central neurons. Knockdown of Dscam1 causes severe dendritic clumping and length reductions in efferent glutamatergic and aminergic neurons. The primary cause for these dendritic phenotypes could be impaired self-avoidance, a growth defect, or both. In peptidergic efferent neurons, many central arbors are not formed, arguing for a growth defect. By contrast, knockdown of Dscam1 does not affect dendrite growth or spacing in any of the five different types of interneurons tested. Axon arbor patterning is not affected in any neuron type tested. We conclude that Dscam1 mediates diverse, neuron type-specific functions during central neuron arbor differentiation.</p>

                Background: The replicative forms of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is found in several types of white blood cells within the host defense system. To determine the dimensionality of the extrahepatic manifestation of HBV in host white blood cells, it is important to understand the complete biology of its pathogenesis and lymphotropic nature. Methods: Deep curation of the literature from the PubMed database pertaining to the HBV manifestation in the human host white blood cells was conducted and then manually filtered to determine the behavioral trend of the virus within the human white blood cells. Results: The curation of 198 research articles identified 28 genes, 92 proteins, and 20 Peripheral Blood Mononuclear cells involved in HBV pathogenesis, while 20 immune cells were found to be permissive for the viral penetration and replication. The presence of the replicative forms of HBV in the host immune cells led to the further elucidation of 28 genes and 92 proteins that interact with one or more viral genes and proteins. Conclusions: A multi-dimensional analysis using deep curation identified a possible lymphotropic character of HBV. Moreover, there are certain pathways that could aid in the propagation of viral infection by using immune cells to its advantage. Thus, instead of eliminating HBV, the immune system may contribute to the population expansion of the virus.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is a brain region involved in critical cognitive functions including memory, planning, and spatial navigation and is commonly affected in neurodegenerative diseases. Subregions of RSC are typically described as Brodmann areas 29 and 30, which are defined by cytoarchitectural features. Using immunofluorescence, we studied the distributions of neurons immunoreactive for NeuN, latexin, and calcium binding proteins (calbindin, calretinin, and parvalbumin) in RSC of <i>Carollia perspicillata</i>, Seba's short-tailed fruit bat. We observed that latexin was specifically present in areas 29a and 29b but not 29c and 30. We further identified distribution patterns of calcium binding proteins that group areas 29a and 29b separately from areas 29c and 30. We conclude first that latexin is a useful marker to classify subregions of RSC and second that these subregions contain distinct patterns of neuronal immunoreactivity for calcium binding proteins. Given the long lifespan of <i>Carollia</i>, bat RSC may be a useful model in studying age-related neurodegeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Learning‐related changes in cellular activity within mouse dentate gyrus during trace eyeblink conditioning</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Because the dentate gyrus serves as the first site for information processing in the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit, it an important structure for the formation of associative memories. Previous findings in rabbit had recorded populations of cells within dentate gyrus that may bridge the temporal gap between stimuli to support memory formation during trace eyeblink conditioning, an associative learning task. However, this previous work was unable to identify the types of cells demonstrating this type of activity. To explore these changes further, we did in vivo single-neuron recording in conjunction with physiological determination of cell types to investigate the functional role of granule cells, mossy cells, and interneurons in dentate gyrus during learning. Tetrode recordings were performed in young-adult mice during training on trace eyeblink conditioning, a hippocampal-dependent temporal associative memory task. Conditioned mice were able to successfully learn the task, with male mice learning at a faster rate than female mice. In the conditioned group, granule cells tended to show an increase in firing rate during conditioned stimulus presentation while mossy cells showed a decrease in firing rate during the trace interval and the unconditioned stimulus. Interestingly, populations of interneurons demonstrated learning-related increases and decreases in activity that began at onset of the conditioned stimulus and persisted through the trace interval. The current study also found a significant increase in theta power during stimuli presentation in conditioned animals, and this change in theta decreased over time. Ultimately, these data suggest unique involvement of granule cells, mossy cells, and interneurons in dentate gyrus in the formation of a trace associative memory. This work expands our knowledge of dentate gyrus function, helping to discern how aging and disease might disrupt this process.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">RAFFT: Efficient prediction of RNA folding pathways using the fast Fourier transform</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vaitea Opuu, Nono S. C. Merleau, Vincent Messow, Matteo Smerlak</p>

We propose a novel heuristic to predict RNA secondary structure formation pathways that has two components: (i) a folding algorithm and (ii) a kinetic ansatz. This heuristic is inspired by the kinetic partitioning mechanism, by which molecules follow alternative folding pathways to their native structure, some much faster than others. Similarly, our algorithm RAFFT starts by generating an ensemble of concurrent folding pathways ending in multiple metastable structures, which is in contrast with traditional thermodynamic approaches that find single structures with minimal free energies. When we constrained the algorithm to predict only 50 structures per sequence, near-native structures were found for RNA molecules of length ≤ 200 nucleotides. Our heuristic has been tested on the coronavirus frameshifting stimulation element (CFSE): an ensemble of 68 distinct structures allowed us to produce complete folding kinetic trajectories, whereas known methods require evaluating millions of sub-optimal structures to achieve this result. Thanks to the fast Fourier transform on which RAFFT (RNA folding Algorithm wih Fast Fourier Transform) is based, these computations are efficient, with complexity O ( L 2logL ).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Seasonal variation in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in temperate climates: A Bayesian modelling study in 143 European regions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tomáš Gavenčiak, Joshua Teperowski Monrad, Gavin Leech, Mrinank Sharma, Sören Mindermann, Samir Bhatt, Jan Brauner, Jan Kulveit</p>

Although seasonal variation has a known influence on the transmission of several respiratory viral infections, its role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission remains unclear. While there is a sizable and growing literature on environmental drivers of COVID-19 transmission, recent reviews have highlighted conflicting and inconclusive findings. This indeterminacy partly owes to the fact that seasonal variation relates to viral transmission by a complicated web of causal pathways, including many interacting biological and behavioural factors. Since analyses of specific factors cannot determine the aggregate strength of seasonal forcing, we sidestep the challenge of disentangling various possible causal paths in favor of a holistic approach. We model seasonality as a sinusoidal variation in transmission and infer a single Bayesian estimate of the overall seasonal effect. By extending two state-of-the-art models of non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) effects and their datasets covering 143 regions in temperate Europe, we are able to adjust our estimates for the role of both NPIs and mobility patterns in reducing transmission. We find strong seasonal patterns, consistent with a reduction in the time-varying reproduction number <i>R</i>(<i>t</i>) (the expected number of new infections generated by an infectious individual at time <i>t</i>) of 42.1% (95% CI: 24.7%—53.4%) from the peak of winter to the peak of summer. These results imply that the seasonality of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is comparable in magnitude to the most effective individual NPIs but less than the combined effect of multiple interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Integrative experimental/computational approach establishes active cellular protrusion as the primary driving force of phagocytic spreading by immune cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Emmet A. Francis, Volkmar Heinrich</p>

The dynamic interplay between cell adhesion and protrusion is a critical determinant of many forms of cell motility. When modeling cell spreading on adhesive surfaces, traditional mathematical treatments often consider passive cell adhesion as the primary, if not exclusive, mechanistic driving force of this cellular motion. To better assess the contribution of active cytoskeletal protrusion to immune-cell spreading during phagocytosis, we here develop a computational framework that allows us to optionally investigate both purely adhesive spreading (“Brownian zipper hypothesis”) as well as protrusion-dominated spreading (“protrusive zipper hypothesis”). We model the cell as an axisymmetric body of highly viscous fluid surrounded by a cortex with uniform surface tension and incorporate as potential driving forces of cell spreading an attractive stress due to receptor-ligand binding and an outward normal stress representing cytoskeletal protrusion, both acting on the cell boundary. We leverage various model predictions against the results of a directly related experimental companion study of human neutrophil phagocytic spreading on substrates coated with different densities of antibodies. We find that the concept of adhesion-driven spreading is incompatible with experimental results such as the independence of the cell-spreading speed on the density of immobilized antibodies. In contrast, the protrusive zipper model agrees well with experimental findings and, when adapted to simulate cell spreading on discrete adhesion sites, it also reproduces the observed positive correlation between antibody density and maximum cell-substrate contact area. Together, our integrative experimental/computational approach shows that phagocytic spreading is driven by cellular protrusion, and that the extent of spreading is limited by the density of adhesion sites.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Combining biomarker and virus phylogenetic models improves HIV-1 epidemiological source identification</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Erik Lundgren, Ethan Romero-Severson, Jan Albert, Thomas Leitner</p>

To identify and stop active HIV transmission chains new epidemiological techniques are needed. Here, we describe the development of a multi-biomarker augmentation to phylogenetic inference of the underlying transmission history in a local population. HIV biomarkers are measurable biological quantities that have some relationship to the amount of time someone has been infected with HIV. To train our model, we used five biomarkers based on real data from serological assays, HIV sequence data, and target cell counts in longitudinally followed, untreated patients with known infection times. The biomarkers were modeled with a mixed effects framework to allow for patient specific variation and general trends, and fit to patient data using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Subsequently, the density of the unobserved infection time conditional on observed biomarkers were obtained by integrating out the random effects from the model fit. This probabilistic information about infection times was incorporated into the likelihood function for the transmission history and phylogenetic tree reconstruction, informed by the HIV sequence data. To critically test our methodology, we developed a coalescent-based simulation framework that generates phylogenies and biomarkers given a specific or general transmission history. Testing on many epidemiological scenarios showed that biomarker augmented phylogenetics can reach 90% accuracy under idealized situations. Under realistic within-host HIV-1 evolution, involving substantial within-host diversification and frequent transmission of multiple lineages, the average accuracy was at about 50% in transmission clusters involving 5–50 hosts. Realistic biomarker data added on average 16 percentage points over using the phylogeny alone. Using more biomarkers improved the performance. Shorter temporal spacing between transmission events and increased transmission heterogeneity reduced reconstruction accuracy, but larger clusters were not harder to get right. More sequence data per infected host also improved accuracy. We show that the method is robust to incomplete sampling and that adding biomarkers improves reconstructions of real HIV-1 transmission histories. The technology presented here could allow for better prevention programs by providing data for locally informed and tailored strategies.

Lung branching morphogenesis requires reciprocal interactions between the epithelium and mesenchyme. How the lung branches are generated at a defined location and projected toward a specific direction remains a major unresolved issue. In this study, we investigated the function of Wnt signaling in lung branching in mice. We discovered that <i>Wnt5a</i> in both the epithelium and the mesenchyme plays an essential role in controlling the position and direction of lung branching. The <i>Wnt5a</i> signal is mediated by <i>Vangl1/2</i> to trigger a cascade of noncanonical or planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling. In response to noncanonical <i>Wnt</i> signaling, lung cells undergo cytoskeletal reorganization and change focal adhesions. Perturbed focal adhesions in lung explants are associated with defective branching. Moreover, we observed changes in the shape and orientation of the epithelial sheet and the underlying mesenchymal layer in regions of defective branching in the mutant lungs. Thus, PCP signaling helps define the position and orientation of the lung branches. We propose that mechanical force induced by noncanonical <i>Wnt</i> signaling mediates a coordinated alteration in the shape and orientation of a group of epithelial and mesenchymal cells. These results provide a new framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms by which a stereotypic branching pattern is generated.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">HypDB: A functionally annotated web-based database of the proline hydroxylation proteome</a></h4>

Proline hydroxylation (Hyp) regulates protein structure, stability, and protein–protein interaction. It is widely involved in diverse metabolic and physiological pathways in cells and diseases. To reveal functional features of the Hyp proteome, we integrated various data sources for deep proteome profiling of the Hyp proteome in humans and developed HypDB (https://www.HypDB.site), an annotated database and web server for Hyp proteome. HypDB provides site-specific evidence of modification based on extensive LC-MS analysis and literature mining with 14,413 nonredundant Hyp sites on 5,165 human proteins including 3,383 Class I and 4,335 Class II sites. Annotation analysis revealed significant enrichment of Hyp on key functional domains and tissue-specific distribution of Hyp abundance across 26 types of human organs and fluids and 6 cell lines. The network connectivity analysis further revealed a critical role of Hyp in mediating protein–protein interactions. Moreover, the spectral library generated by HypDB enabled data-independent analysis (DIA) of clinical tissues and the identification of novel Hyp biomarkers in lung cancer and kidney cancer. Taken together, our integrated analysis of human proteome with publicly accessible HypDB revealed functional diversity of Hyp substrates and provides a quantitative data source to characterize Hyp in pathways and diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin drives development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice by affecting Th17 differentiation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Katie J. Smith, Danielle Minns, Brian J. McHugh, Rebecca K. Holloway, Richard O’Connor, Anna Williams, Lauren Melrose, Rhoanne McPherson, Veronique E. Miron, Donald J. Davidson, Emily Gwyer Findlay</p>

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a highly prevalent demyelinating autoimmune condition; the mechanisms regulating its severity and progression are unclear. The IL-17-producing Th17 subset of T cells has been widely implicated in MS and in the mouse model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, the differentiation and regulation of Th17 cells during EAE remain incompletely understood. Although evidence is mounting that the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin profoundly affects early T cell differentiation, no studies have looked at its role in longer-term T cell responses. Now, we report that cathelicidin drives severe EAE disease. It is released from neutrophils, microglia, and endothelial cells throughout disease; its interaction with T cells potentiates Th17 differentiation in lymph nodes and Th17 to exTh17 plasticity and IFN-γ production in the spinal cord. As a consequence, mice lacking cathelicidin are protected from severe EAE. In addition, we show that cathelicidin is produced by the same cell types in the active brain lesions in human MS disease. We propose that cathelicidin exposure results in highly activated, cytokine-producing T cells, which drive autoimmunity; this is a mechanism through which neutrophils amplify inflammation in the central nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Macrophages take up VLDL-sized emulsion particles through caveolae-mediated endocytosis and excrete part of the internalized triglycerides as fatty acids</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lei Deng, Frank Vrieling, Rinke Stienstra, Guido J. Hooiveld, Anouk L. Feitsma, Sander Kersten</p>

Triglycerides are carried in the bloodstream as part of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and chylomicrons, which represent the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants contribute to atherosclerosis, possibly by carrying remnant cholesterol and/or by exerting a proinflammatory effect on macrophages. Nevertheless, little is known about how macrophages process triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Here, using VLDL-sized triglyceride-rich emulsion particles, we aimed to study the mechanism by which VLDL triglycerides are taken up, processed, and stored in macrophages. Our results show that macrophage uptake of VLDL-sized emulsion particles is dependent on lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and requires the lipoprotein-binding C-terminal domain but not the catalytic N-terminal domain of LPL. Subsequent internalization of VLDL-sized emulsion particles by macrophages is carried out by caveolae-mediated endocytosis, followed by triglyceride hydrolysis catalyzed by lysosomal acid lipase. It is shown that STARD3 is required for the transfer of lysosomal fatty acids to the ER for subsequent storage as triglycerides, while NPC1 likely is involved in promoting the extracellular efflux of fatty acids from lysosomes. Our data provide novel insights into how macrophages process VLDL triglycerides and suggest that macrophages have the remarkable capacity to excrete part of the internalized triglycerides as fatty acids.

                Background: Hypertensive African Americans have a ~50% response rate to thiazide diuretic treatment. This contributes to a high prevalence of uncontrolled high blood pressure. Here, we examined the role of the mitochondrial genome on thiazide diuretic treatment response in hypertensive African Americans enrolled in a clinical trial. Methods: Participants from the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT, n= 4279) were genotyped using the Illumina Infinium Multi-Ethnic Beadchip. Haplotype groups were called using HaploGrep. We used a linear regression analysis to examine the association between mitochondrial haplogroups (L, M, and N) and changes in blood pressure and fasting glucose over six months and two years, respectively. Results: The analysis revealed a null association between mitochondrial haplogroups M and N versus L for each of the outcomes. In subgroup analysis, the L subclades L1, L2, and L3/L4 (versus L0) were each inversely associated with fasting glucose response (p < 0.05). Conclusions: This discovery analysis suggests the mitochondrial genome has a small effect on fasting glucose response, but not that of blood pressure, to thiazide diuretic treatment in African Americans.

                Background: This paper unveils the role of security intelligence in facilitating the war against cybercrime in organizations. it introduces the term cybercrime and security intelligence with financial organizations in Nigeria. Since the invention of information and communication technology in Nigeria, citizens have become fascinated and engrossed. Unfortunately, this opened the door for people with malicious intent to attack individuals, organizations, and nations. Thus, this paper examines the problem of information vulnerability, identifies the level of cybercrime in financial entities, establishes the type of cybercrime, and assesses security intelligence awareness among staff and customers. Methods: The paper employed the simple-random sampling technique, using a primary and secondary source of information, analyzing frequency counts, percentages, and charts for the demographic variables, and used chi-square through SPSS data processing. Results: The results state the ubiquity of cybercrime among financial organizations and reveals that phishing scams, website spoofing, piracy, ransomware, and hacking are the top cyber-crime types commonly used. Conclusions: Thus, the administration of security intelligence can reduce internal and external threats in an organization. Furthermore, the paper states that security intelligence intervention is independent of the nature of cybercrime across the organization. However, the paper recommends that organizations need to enlighten their staff and customers with measures to safeguard information against cybercrime with the usage of security intelligence techniques and other proactive measures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A novel method for measuring sublingual temperature using conventional non-contact forehead thermometer [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sublingual temperature measurement is a quick and accurate representation of oral temperature and corresponds closely with core temperature. Sub-lingual temperature measurement using non-contact infrared thermometers has not been studied for this purpose and if accurate they would be a reliable and convenient way of recording temperature of a patient very quickly. The aim of the study was to evaluate the utility of recording sublingual temperature using an infrared non-contact thermometer and establish its accuracy by comparing the readings with tympanic thermometer recordings. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in 29 patients (328 paired recordings from sublingual and tympanic sites simultaneously). Subjects were requested to keep their mouth closed for five minutes before recording the temperature. Sublingual recordings were performed for each patient at different times of the day using an infrared thermometer. The infrared thermometer was quickly brought 1cm away from the sublingual part of the tongue and the recordings were then done immediately. Readings were compared with the corresponding tympanic temperature. Results: The non-contact sublingual temperature correlated very closely with tympanic temperature (r=0.86, p<0.001). The mean difference between the infrared sublingual and tympanic temperature was 0.21°C (standard deviation [SD]:0.48°C, 95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.16-0.27). The intra-class correlation co-efficient (ICC) between core and sublingual temperatures was 0.830 (95% CI: 0.794 to 0.861) p<0.001. The sensitivity of sublingual IR (infrared) temperature of 37.65°C was 90% and specificity was 89% for core temperature >38°C. Conclusions: This innovative modification of using the forehead infrared thermometer to measure the sublingual temperature offers an accurate, rapid and non-contact estimation of core temperature.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Generic model for biological regulation [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                A substantial portion of molecules in an organism are involved in regulation of a wide spectrum of biological processes. Several models have been presented for various forms of biological regulation, including gene expression regulation and physiological regulation; however, a generic model is missing. Recently a new unifying theory in biology, poikilosis, was presented.  Poikilosis indicates that all systems display intrinsic heterogeneity. The concept of poikilosis allowed development of a model for biological regulation applicable to all types of regulated systems. The perturbation-lagom-TATAR countermeasures-regulator (PLTR) model combines the effects of perturbation and lagom (allowed and sufficient extent of heterogeneity) in a system with tolerance, avoidance, repair, attenuation and resistance (TARAR) countermeasures, and possible regulators. There are three modes of regulation, two of which are lagom-related. In the first scenario, lagom is maintained, both intrinsic (passive) and active TARAR countermeasures can be involved. In the second mode, there is a shift from one lagom to another. In the third mode, reguland regulation, the regulated entity is the target of a regulatory shift, which is often irreversible or requires action of another regulator to return to original state. After the shift, the system enters to lagom maintenance mode, but at new lagom extent. The model is described and elaborated with examples and applications, including medicine and systems biology. Consequences of non-lagom extent of heterogeneity are introduced, along with a novel idea for therapy by reconstituting biological processes to lagom extent, even when the primary effect cannot be treated.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the COVID-19 Emergency Field Hospital of Bangkalan, Indonesia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Following the surge of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in the epicenter of East Java Province, this study aimed to determine the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 at one of the emergency field hospitals in Indonesia. Methods: This was a single-centered, retrospective descriptive study of 763 patients admitted to the COVID-19 Emergency Field Hospital of Bangkalan from July 5 2021 to September 30 2021. The demographic data, clinical signs and symptoms, pre-existing comorbidities, therapy, and clinical outcomes of the patients were analyzed using SPSS. Results: The clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 at the emergency hospital were varied. A total of 763 patients were included. The most common age was between 40 and 49 years (31.1%), a slight majority were women (51.5%), and most had travelled abroad in the last 14 days (99.1%). Of the 763 patients, 70.9% had no comorbidities. Half of the patients were asymptomatic (49.4%), 46% were mild cases, 4.1% were moderate, and 0.5% severe. The most common symptoms were productive cough (15.7%) and headache (15.3%). Supportive and comorbidity therapy were given which showed excellent clinical outcomes. Conclusions: This study presents the description of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients during high surge cases of COVID-19 that are mostly dominated by Indonesian migrant workers in a field hospital. majority of COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic and therapy without antibiotics or antivirals showed positive outcomes in COVID-19 patients.
