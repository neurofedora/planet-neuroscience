              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02013">Non-invasive two-step strategy BCI: brain-muscle-hand interface</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.02013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-computer interface enables direct interaction between brain and device. However, common brain-computer interfaces often employ one-step strategy that rely on non-natural paradigms, such as SSVEP-BCI and MI-BCI, are limited to specific scenarios, restricting their broader application. This paper first proposes a two-step strategic brain-muscular-hand interface (BMHI) based on biological evolutionary selection mechanism, by integrating the brain-muscle (BM) interface with the muscle-hand (MH) interface through crosstalk ("BMHI = BM + MH"). To verify the effectiveness of BMHI and the advantages of a two-step strategy inspired by natural evolution, we conducted offline, comparison (comparing BMHI (two-step) and brain-hand interface (one-step)), and online experiments (using BMHI to control a virtual/machine hand for daily tasks). The results show that: (1) BMHI is feasible and the prediction accuracy is 0.79; (2) Unlike traditional multi-layer neural networks that attempt to establish a direct brain-signal-to-action mapping through a single end-to-end process (brain-hand interface), BMHI incorporates the neuro-muscular transmission mechanisms evolved in biological systems as an intermediate constraint layer. This phased decoding strategy can reduce training time by approximately 18-fold and improve decoding accuracy; (3) In the online control experiment, both the virtual hand and the manipulator were able to successfully complete tasks, like moving objects such as boxes or plates and holding water glasses. The results show that BMHI adopts a two-step decoding strategy that mimics natural human neural motor pathways, improves training efficiency and prediction accuracy, and promotes the development of BCI technology to a more natural interaction mode.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02044">A Brain Graph Foundation Model: Pre-Training and Prompt-Tuning for Any Atlas and Disorder</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.02044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to revolutionize AI research, there is a growing interest in building large-scale brain foundation models to advance neuroscience. While most existing brain foundation models are pre-trained on time-series signals or region-of-interest (ROI) features, we propose a novel graph-based pre-training paradigm for constructing a brain graph foundation model. In this paper, we introduce the Brain Graph Foundation Model, termed BrainGFM, a unified framework that leverages graph contrastive learning and graph masked autoencoders for large-scale fMRI-based pre-training. BrainGFM is pre-trained on a diverse mixture of brain atlases with varying parcellations, significantly expanding the pre-training corpus and enhancing the model's ability to generalize across heterogeneous fMRI-derived brain representations. To support efficient and versatile downstream transfer, we integrate both graph prompts and language prompts into the model design, enabling BrainGFM to flexibly adapt to a wide range of atlases, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and task settings. Furthermore, we employ meta-learning to optimize the graph prompts, facilitating strong generalization to previously unseen disorders under both few-shot and zero-shot learning conditions via language-guided prompting. BrainGFM is pre-trained on 27 neuroimaging datasets spanning 25 common neurological and psychiatric disorders, encompassing 2 types of brain atlases (functional and anatomical) across 8 widely-used parcellations, and covering over 25,000 subjects, 60,000 fMRI scans, and a total of 400,000 graph samples aggregated across all atlases and parcellations. The code is available at: https://github.com/weixinxu666/BrainGFM

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02263">Identifying interactions across brain areas while accounting for individual-neuron dynamics with a Transformer-based variational autoencoder</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.02263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in large-scale recording technologies now enable simultaneous measurements from multiple brain areas, offering new opportunities to study signal transmission across interacting components of neural circuits. However, neural responses exhibit substantial trial-to-trial variability, often driven by unobserved factors such as subtle changes in animal behavior or internal states. To prevent evolving background dynamics from contaminating identification of functional coupling, we developed a hybrid neural spike train model, GLM-Transformer, that incorporates flexible, deep latent variable models into a point process generalized linear model (GLM) having an interpretable component for cross-population interactions. A Transformer-based variational autoencoder captures nonstationary individual-neuron dynamics that vary across trials, while standard nonparametric regression GLM coupling terms provide estimates of directed interactions between neural populations. We incorporate a low-rank structure on population-to-population coupling effects to improve scalability. Across synthetic datasets and mechanistic simulations, GLM-Transformer recovers known coupling structure and remains robust to shared background fluctuations. When applied to the Allen Institute Visual Coding dataset, it identifies feedforward pathways consistent with established visual hierarchies. This work offers a step toward improved identification of neural population interactions, and contributes to ongoing efforts aimed at achieving interpretable results while harvesting the benefits of deep learning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03088">Modelling the Effects of Hearing Loss on Neural Coding in the Auditory Midbrain with Variational Conditioning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.03088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mapping from sound to neural activity that underlies hearing is highly non-linear. The first few stages of this mapping in the cochlea have been modelled successfully, with biophysical models built by hand and, more recently, with DNN models trained on datasets simulated by biophysical models. Modelling the auditory brain has been a challenge because central auditory processing is too complex for models to be built by hand, and datasets for training DNN models directly have not been available. Recent work has taken advantage of large-scale high resolution neural recordings from the auditory midbrain to build a DNN model of normal hearing with great success. But this model assumes that auditory processing is the same in all brains, and therefore it cannot capture the widely varying effects of hearing loss.
  We propose a novel variational-conditional model to learn to encode the space of hearing loss directly from recordings of neural activity in the auditory midbrain of healthy and noise exposed animals. With hearing loss parametrised by only 6 free parameters per animal, our model accurately predicts 62\% of the explainable variance in neural responses from normal hearing animals and 68% for hearing impaired animals, within a few percentage points of state of the art animal specific models. We demonstrate that the model can be used to simulate realistic activity from out of sample animals by fitting only the learned conditioning parameters with Bayesian optimisation, achieving crossentropy loss within 2% of the optimum in 15-30 iterations. Including more animals in the training data slightly improved the performance on unseen animals. This model will enable future development of parametrised hearing loss compensation models trained to directly restore normal neural coding in hearing impaired brains, which can be quickly fitted for a new user by human in the loop optimisation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21777">Memorization to Generalization: Emergence of Diffusion Models from Associative Memory</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.21777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hopfield networks are associative memory (AM) systems, designed for storing and retrieving patterns as local minima of an energy landscape. In the classical Hopfield model, an interesting phenomenon occurs when the amount of training data reaches its critical memory load $- spurious\,\,states$, or unintended stable points, emerge at the end of the retrieval dynamics, leading to incorrect recall. In this work, we examine diffusion models, commonly used in generative modeling, from the perspective of AMs. The training phase of diffusion model is conceptualized as memory encoding (training data is stored in the memory). The generation phase is viewed as an attempt of memory retrieval. In the small data regime the diffusion model exhibits a strong memorization phase, where the network creates distinct basins of attraction around each sample in the training set, akin to the Hopfield model below the critical memory load. In the large data regime, a different phase appears where an increase in the size of the training set fosters the creation of new attractor states that correspond to manifolds of the generated samples. Spurious states appear at the boundary of this transition and correspond to emergent attractor states, which are absent in the training set, but, at the same time, have distinct basins of attraction around them. Our findings provide: a novel perspective on the memorization-generalization phenomenon in diffusion models via the lens of AMs, theoretical prediction of existence of spurious states, empirical validation of this prediction in commonly-used diffusion models.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02164">Quantifying task-relevant representational similarity using decision variable correlation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.02164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies have compared the brain and deep neural networks trained on image classification. Intriguingly, while some suggest that their representations are highly similar, others argued the opposite. Here, we propose a new approach to characterize the similarity of the decision strategies of two observers (models or brains) using decision variable correlation (DVC). DVC quantifies the correlation between decoded decisions on individual samples in a classification task and thus can capture task-relevant information rather than general representational alignment. We evaluate this method using monkey V4/IT recordings and models trained on image classification tasks.
  We find that model--model similarity is comparable to monkey--monkey similarity, whereas model--monkey similarity is consistently lower and, surprisingly, decreases with increasing ImageNet-1k performance. While adversarial training enhances robustness, it does not improve model--monkey similarity in task-relevant dimensions; however, it markedly increases model--model similarity. Similarly, pre-training on larger datasets does not improve model--monkey similarity. These results suggest a fundamental divergence between the task-relevant representations in monkey V4/IT and those learned by models trained on image classification tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03089">Explicitly Modeling Subcortical Vision with a Neuro-Inspired Front-End Improves CNN Robustness</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.03089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on object recognition achieve high task performance but continue to exhibit vulnerability under a range of visual perturbations and out-of-domain images, when compared with biological vision. Prior work has demonstrated that coupling a standard CNN with a front-end block (VOneBlock) that mimics the primate primary visual cortex (V1) can improve overall model robustness. Expanding on this, we introduce Early Vision Networks (EVNets), a new class of hybrid CNNs that combine the VOneBlock with a novel SubcorticalBlock, whose architecture draws from computational models in neuroscience and is parameterized to maximize alignment with subcortical responses reported across multiple experimental studies. Without being optimized to do so, the assembly of the SubcorticalBlock with the VOneBlock improved V1 alignment across most standard V1 benchmarks, and better modeled extra-classical receptive field phenomena. In addition, EVNets exhibit stronger emergent shape bias and overperform the base CNN architecture by 8.5% on an aggregate benchmark of robustness evaluations, including adversarial perturbations, common corruptions, and domain shifts. Finally, we show that EVNets can be further improved when paired with a state-of-the-art data augmentation technique, surpassing the performance of the isolated data augmentation approach by 7.3% on our robustness benchmark. This result reveals complementary benefits between changes in architecture to better mimic biology and training-based machine learning approaches.

Abstract: We present a minimalistic representation model for the head direction (HD) system, aiming to learn a high-dimensional representation of head direction that captures essential properties of HD cells. Our model is a representation of rotation group $U(1)$, and we study both the fully connected version and convolutional version. We demonstrate the emergence of Gaussian-like tuning profiles and a 2D circle geometry in both versions of the model. We also demonstrate that the learned model is capable of accurate path integration.

                arXiv:2505.14806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hippocampus enables spatial navigation through place cell populations forming cognitive maps. We propose proximity-preserving neural embeddings to encode multi-scale random walk transitions, where the inner product $\langle h(x, t), h(y, t) \rangle = q(y|x, t)$ represents normalized transition probabilities, with $h(x, t)$ as the embedding at location $x$ and $q(y|x, t)$ as the transition probability at scale $\sqrt{t}$. This scale hierarchy mirrors hippocampal dorsoventral organization. The embeddings $h(x, t)$ reduce pairwise spatial proximity into an environmental map, with Euclidean distances preserving proximity information. We use gradient ascent on $q(y|x, t)$ for straight-forward path planning, employing adaptive scale selection for trap-free, smooth trajectories, equivalent to minimizing embedding space distances. Matrix squaring ($P_{2t} = P_t^2$) efficiently builds global transitions from local ones ($P_1$), enabling preplay-like shortcut prediction. Experiments demonstrate localized place fields, multi-scale tuning, adaptability, and remapping, achieving robust navigation in complex environments. Our biologically plausible framework, extensible to theta-phase precession, unifies spatial and temporal coding for scalable navigation.

Abstract: In cognitive neuroscience research, Representational Dissimilarity Matrices (RDMs) are often incomplete because pairwise similarity judgments cannot always be exhaustively collected as the number of pairs rapidly increases with the number of conditions. Existing methods to fill these missing values, such as deep neural network imputation, are powerful but computationally demanding and relatively opaque. We introduce a simple algorithm based on geometric inference that fills missing dissimilarity matrix entries using known distances. We use tests on publicly available empirical cognitive neuroscience datasets, as well as simulations, to demonstrate the method's effectiveness and robustness across varying sparsity and matrix sizes. We have made this geometric reconstruction algorithm, implemented in Python and MATLAB, publicly available. This method provides a fast and accurate solution for completing partial dissimilarity matrices in the cognitive neurosciences.

                arXiv:2506.02813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brain is made up of a vast set of heterogeneous regions that dynamically organize into pathways as a function of task demands. Examples of such pathways can be seen in the interactions between cortical and subcortical networks during learning. This raises the question of how exactly brain regions organize into these dynamic groups. In this work, we use an extension of the Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts architecture, to show that heterogeneous regions do not form processing pathways by themselves, implying that the brain likely implements specific constraints which result in reliable formation of pathways. We identify three biologically relevant inductive biases that encourage pathway formation: a routing cost imposed on the use of more complex regions, a scaling factor that reduces this cost when task performance is low, and randomized expert dropout. When comparing our resulting Mixture-of-Pathways model with the brain, we observe that the artificial pathways match how the brain uses cortical and subcortical systems to learn and solve tasks of varying difficulty. In summary, we introduce a novel framework for investigating how the brain forms task-specific pathways through inductive biases which may make Mixture-of-Experts architectures in general more adaptive.

                arXiv:2506.02120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A random-key genetic algorithm is an evolutionary metaheuristic for discrete and global optimization. Each solution is encoded as a vector of N random keys, where a random key is a real number randomly generated in the continuous interval [0, 1). A decoder maps each vector of random keys to a solution of the optimization problem being solved and computes its cost. The benefit of this approach is that all genetic operators and transformations can be maintained within the unitary hypercube, regardless of the problem being addressed. This enhances the productivity and maintainability of the core framework. The algorithm starts with a population of P vectors of random keys. At each iteration, the vectors are partitioned into two sets: a smaller set of high-valued elite solutions and the remaining non-elite solutions. All elite elements are copied, without change, to the next population. A small number of random-key vectors (the mutants) is added to the population of the next iteration. The remaining elements of the population of the next iteration are generated by combining, with the parametrized uniform crossover of Spears and DeJong (1991), pairs of solutions. This chapter reviews random-key genetic algorithms and describes an effective variant called biased random-key genetic algorithms.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks have earned increased recognition in recent years owing to their biological plausibility and event-driven computation. Spiking neurons are the fundamental building components of Spiking Neural Networks. Those neurons act as computational units that determine the decision to fire an action potential. This work presents a methodology to implement biologically plausible yet scalable spiking neurons in hardware. We show that it is more efficient to design neurons that mimic the $I_{Na,p}+I_{K}$ model rather than the more complicated Hodgkin-Huxley model. We demonstrate our methodology by presenting eleven novel minimal spiking neuron circuits in Parts I and II of the paper. We categorize the neuron circuits presented into two types: Resonators and Integrators. We discuss the methodology employed in designing neurons of the resonator type in Part I, while we discuss neurons of the integrator type in Part II. In part I, we postulate that Sodium channels exhibit type-N negative differential resistance. Consequently, we present three novel minimal neuron circuits that use type-N negative differential resistance circuits or devices as the Sodium channel. Nevertheless, the aim of the paper is not to present a set of minimal neuron circuits but rather the methodology utilized to construct those circuits.

                arXiv:2506.02566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charting the lifespan evolutionary trajectory of brain function serves as the normative standard for preventing mental disorders during brain development and aging. Although numerous MRI studies have mapped the structural connectome for young cohorts, the EEG-based functional connectome is unknown to characterize human lifespan, limiting its practical applications for the early detection of brain dysfunctions at the community level. This work aimed to undertake normative modeling from the perspective of EEG network topology. Frequency-dependent scalp EEG functional networks were constructed based on EEG cross-spectra aged 5-97 years from 9 countries and network characteristics were quantified. First, GAMLSS were applied to describe the normative curves of the network characteristics in different frequency bands. Subsequently, addressing the limitations of existing regression approaches for whole brain network analysis, this paper proposed an interpretable encoder-decoder framework, Generative Age-dependent brain Network nORmative Model (GANORM). Building upon this framework, we established an age-dependent normative trajectory of the complete brain network for the entire lifespan. Finally, we validated the effectiveness of the norm using EEG datasets from multiple sites. Subsequently, we evaluated the effectiveness of GANORM, and the tested performances of BPNN showed the R^2 was 0.796, the MAE was 0.081, and the RMSE was 0.013. Following established lifespan brain network norm, GANORM also exhibited good results upon verification using healthy and disease data from various sites. The deviation scores from the normative mean for the healthy control group were significantly smaller than those of the disease group.

Abstract: Artificial life aims to understand the fundamental principles of biological life by creating computational models that exhibit life-like properties. Although artificial life systems show promise for simulating biological evolution, achieving open-endedness remains a central challenge. This work investigates mechanisms to promote exploration and unbounded innovation within evolving populations of Lenia continuous cellular automata by evaluating individuals against each other with respect to distinctiveness, population sparsity, and homeostatic regulation. Multi-objective ranking of these intrinsic fitness objectives encourages the perpetual selection of novel and explorative individuals in sparse regions of the descriptor space without restricting the scope of emergent behaviors. We present experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of our multi-objective approach and emphasize that intrinsic evolution allows diverse expressions of artificial life to emerge. We argue that adaptive exploration improves evolutionary dynamics and serves as an important step toward achieving open-ended evolution in artificial systems.

                arXiv:2506.01968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in numerous tasks, but deployment in resource-constrained environments remains a challenge due to their high computational and memory requirements. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) operate through discrete spike events and offer superior energy efficiency, providing a bio-inspired alternative. However, current ANN-to-SNN conversion often results in significant accuracy loss and increased inference time due to conversion errors such as clipping, quantization, and uneven activation. This paper proposes a novel ANN-to-SNN conversion framework based on error compensation learning. We introduce a learnable threshold clipping function, dual-threshold neurons, and an optimized membrane potential initialization strategy to mitigate the conversion error. Together, these techniques address the clipping error through adaptive thresholds, dynamically reduce the quantization error through dual-threshold neurons, and minimize the non-uniformity error by effectively managing the membrane potential. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet datasets show that our method achieves high-precision and ultra-low latency among existing conversion methods. Using only two time steps, our method significantly reduces the inference time while maintains competitive accuracy of 94.75% on CIFAR-10 dataset under ResNet-18 structure. This research promotes the practical application of SNNs on low-power hardware, making efficient real-time processing possible.

                arXiv:2506.02049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce EvoGit, a decentralized multi-agent framework for collaborative software development driven by autonomous code evolution. EvoGit deploys a population of independent coding agents, each proposing edits to a shared codebase without centralized coordination, explicit message passing, or shared memory. Instead, all coordination emerges through a Git-based phylogenetic graph that tracks the full version lineage and enables agents to asynchronously read from and write to the evolving code repository. This graph-based structure supports fine-grained branching, implicit concurrency, and scalable agent interaction while preserving a consistent historical record. Human involvement is minimal but strategic: users define high-level goals, periodically review the graph, and provide lightweight feedback to promote promising directions or prune unproductive ones. Experiments demonstrate EvoGit's ability to autonomously produce functional and modular software artifacts across two real-world tasks: (1) building a web application from scratch using modern frameworks, and (2) constructing a meta-level system that evolves its own language-model-guided solver for the bin-packing optimization problem. Our results underscore EvoGit's potential to establish a new paradigm for decentralized, automated, and continual software development.

                arXiv:2409.16757v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES) is one of the most advanced algorithms in numerical black-box optimization. For noisy objective functions, several approaches were proposed to mitigate the noise, e.g., re-evaluations of the same solution or adapting the population size.
  In this paper, we devise a novel method to adaptively choose the optimal re-evaluation number for function values corrupted by additive Gaussian white noise. We derive a theoretical lower bound of the expected improvement achieved in one iteration of CMA-ES, given an estimation of the noise level and the Lipschitz constant of the function's gradient. Solving for the maximum of the lower bound, we obtain a simple expression of the optimal re-evaluation number.
  We experimentally compare our method to the state-of-the-art noise-handling methods for CMA-ES on a set of artificial test functions across various noise levels, optimization budgets, and dimensionality. Our method demonstrates significant advantages in terms of the probability of hitting near-optimal function values.

                arXiv:2411.15111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate learnable activation functions in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), comparing traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) with fixed and trainable activations against Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) that employ learnable basis functions. While PINNs effectively incorporate physical laws into the learning process, they suffer from convergence and spectral bias problems, which limit their applicability to problems with rapid oscillations or sharp transitions. In this work, we study and evaluate various activation and basis functions across diverse PDEs, including oscillatory, nonlinear wave, mixed-physics, and fluid dynamics problems. Using empirical Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis and Hessian eigenvalue decomposition, we assess convergence behavior, stability, and high-frequency approximation capacity. While KANs offer improved expressivity for capturing complex, high-frequency PDE solutions, they introduce new optimization challenges, especially in deeper networks. Our findings show that KANs face a curse of functional dimensionality, creating intractable optimization landscapes in deeper networks. Low spectral bias alone does not guarantee good performance; adaptive spectral bias approaches such as B-splines achieve optimal results by balancing global stability with local high-frequency resolution. Different PDE types require tailored strategies: smooth global activation functions excel for wave phenomena, while local adaptive activation functions suit problems with sharp transitions.

                arXiv:2506.00490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are widely encountered in real-world applications. Designing high-quality heuristic algorithms that efficiently approximate optimal solutions within reasonable time is a critical research challenge. In recent years, many works have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Evolutionary Algorithms to automate heuristic algorithm design through prompt engineering. However, these approaches generally adopt a problem-specific paradigm, applying a single algorithm across all problem instances, failing to account for the heterogeneity across instances. In this paper, we propose InstSpecHH, a novel framework that introduces the concept of instance-specific heuristic generation. InstSpecHH partitions the overall problem class into sub-classes based on instance features and performs differentiated, automated heuristic design for each problem subclass. By tailoring heuristics to the unique features of different sub-classes, InstSpecHH achieves better performance at the problem class level while avoiding redundant heuristic generation for similar instances, thus reducing computational overhead. This approach effectively balances the trade-off between the cost of automatic heuristic design and the quality of the obtained solutions. To evaluate the performance of InstSpecHH, we conduct experiments on 4,500 subclasses of the Online Bin Packing Problem (OBPP) and 365 subclasses of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). Experimental results show that InstSpecHH demonstrates strong intra-subclass and inter-subclass generalization capabilities. Compared to previous problem-specific methods, InstSpecHH reduces the average optimality gap by more than 5.6\% for OBPP and 0.9\% for CVRP. These results highlight the potential of instance-aware automatic heuristic design to further enhance solution quality.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01607">Real-time respiratory motion forecasting with online learning of recurrent neural networks for accurate targeting in externally guided radiotherapy</a></h4>

Abstract: In lung radiotherapy, infrared cameras can track reflective objects on the chest to estimate tumor motion due to breathing, but treatment system latencies hinder radiation beam precision. Real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) is a potential solution that can learn patterns within non-stationary respiratory data but has high complexity. This study assesses the capabilities of resource-efficient online RNN algorithms, namely unbiased online recurrent optimization (UORO), sparse-1 step approximation (SnAp-1), and decoupled neural interfaces (DNI) to forecast respiratory motion during radiotherapy treatment accurately. We use time series containing the 3D positions of external markers on the chest of healthy subjects. We propose efficient implementations for SnAp-1 and DNI that compress the influence and immediate Jacobian matrices and accurately update the linear coefficients used in credit assignment estimation, respectively. Data was originally sampled at 10Hz; we resampled it at 3.33Hz and 30Hz to analyze the effect of the sampling rate on performance. We use UORO, SnAp-1, and DNI to forecast each marker's 3D position with horizons h<=2.1s (the time interval in advance for which the prediction is made) and compare them with RTRL, least mean squares, kernel support vector regression, and linear regression. RNNs trained online achieved similar or better accuracy than most previous works using larger training databases and deep learning, even though we used only the first minute of each sequence to predict motion within that exact sequence. SnAp-1 had the lowest normalized root mean square errors (nRMSEs) averaged over the horizon values considered, equal to 0.335 and 0.157, at 3.33Hz and 10.0Hz, respectively. Similarly, UORO had the lowest nRMSE at 30Hz, equal to 0.086. DNI's inference time (6.8ms per time step at 30Hz, Intel Core i7-13700 CPU) was the lowest among the RNN methods.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00765">Structured and Balanced Multi-Component and Multi-Layer Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2407.00765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a balanced multi-component and multi-layer neural network (MMNN) structure to accurately and efficiently approximate functions with complex features, in terms of both degrees of freedom and computational cost. The main idea is inspired by a multi-component approach, in which each component can be effectively approximated by a single-layer network, combined with a multi-layer decomposition strategy to capture the complexity of the target function. Although MMNNs can be viewed as a simple modification of fully connected neural networks (FCNNs) or multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) by introducing balanced multi-component structures, they achieve a significant reduction in training parameters, a much more efficient training process, and improved accuracy compared to FCNNs or MLPs. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MMNNs in approximating highly oscillatory functions and their ability to automatically adapt to localized features.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13541">Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-Modal Meta-Learning for Fine-grained Emotion Recognition</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.13541v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-grained emotion recognition (FER) plays a vital role in various fields, such as disease diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and multimedia mining. However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12012">Evolving Hard Maximum Cut Instances for Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.12012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms, such as the Recursive Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (RQAOA), have become increasingly popular, offering promising avenues for employing Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices to address challenging combinatorial optimization tasks like the maximum cut problem. In this study, we utilize an evolutionary algorithm equipped with a unique fitness function. This approach targets hard maximum cut instances within the latent space of a Graph Autoencoder, identifying those that pose significant challenges or are particularly tractable for RQAOA, in contrast to the classic Goemans and Williamson algorithm. Our findings not only delineate the distinct capabilities and limitations of each algorithm but also expand our understanding of RQAOA's operational limits. Furthermore, the diverse set of graphs we have generated serves as a crucial benchmarking asset, emphasizing the need for more advanced algorithms to tackle combinatorial optimization challenges. Additionally, our results pave the way for new avenues in graph generation research, offering exciting opportunities for future explorations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00377">A Systematic Review of Metaheuristics-Based and Machine Learning-Driven Intrusion Detection Systems in IoT</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.00377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) has raised a new challenge for developers since it is prone to known and unknown cyberattacks due to its heterogeneity, flexibility, and close connectivity. To defend against such security breaches, researchers have focused on building sophisticated intrusion detection systems (IDSs) using machine learning (ML) techniques. Although these algorithms notably improve detection performance, they require excessive computing power and resources, which are crucial issues in IoT networks considering the recent trends of decentralized data processing and computing systems. Consequently, many optimization techniques have been incorporated with these ML models. Specifically, a special category of optimizer adopted from the behavior of living creatures and different aspects of natural phenomena, known as metaheuristic algorithms, has been a central focus in recent years and brought about remarkable results. Considering this vital significance, we present a comprehensive and systematic review of various applications of metaheuristics algorithms in developing a machine learning-based IDS, especially for IoT. A significant contribution of this study is the discovery of hidden correlations between these optimization techniques and machine learning models integrated with state-of-the-art IoT-IDSs. In addition, the effectiveness of these metaheuristic algorithms in different applications, such as feature selection, parameter or hyperparameter tuning, and hybrid usages are separately analyzed. Moreover, a taxonomy of existing IoT-IDSs is proposed. Furthermore, we investigate several critical issues related to such integration. Our extensive exploration ends with a discussion of promising optimization algorithms and technologies that can enhance the efficiency of IoT-IDSs.

                <p>Lifelong premature ejaculation (LPE) is associated with abnormal brain function, as evidenced by functional MRI (fMRI) studies. This study investigates the stability of brain network architectures in resting-state conditions following perturbation by erotic tasks in individuals with LPE. We assessed the resting-state fMRI in the task-free and task-modulated dataset in the 28 right-hand LPE and 17 age-matched normal controls (NCs). The dynamic functional connectome based on the phase-locking algorithm and ROI-wise gradient mapping was compared. The stability of dynamic functional gradient mapping was measure by linear mixed effects across the two datasets in the LPE and NCs. In both groups, the brain functional gradient exhibited a clear transition from unimodal to transmodal in the principal gradient. Additionally, there was a segregation of primary networks observed in the secondary gradient, either before or after the task. In LPE patients, we observed increased stability in the bilateral dorsal prefrontal cortex (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05, Bonferroni corrected) and right temporo-occipital-parietal cortex (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05, Bonferroni corrected) between the pre- and post-task fMRI datasets. The changes of the gradient stability were significantly correlated with the sexual behavior. Our findings suggest that dysfunction in the salience and default mode networks may contribute to delayed recovery from erotic task stimulation in LPE patients.</p>

                <p>The rodent brain contains 70,000,000+ neurons interconnected via complex axonal circuits with varying architectures. Neural pathologies are often associated with anatomical changes in these axonal projections and synaptic connections. Notably, axonal density variations of local and long-range projections increase or decrease as a function of the strengthening or weakening, respectively, of the information flow between brain regions. Traditionally, histological quantification of axonal inputs relied on assessing the fluorescence intensity in the brain region of interest. Despite yielding valuable insights, this conventional method is notably susceptible to background fluorescence, postacquisition adjustments, and inter-researcher variability. Additionally, it fails to account for nonuniform innervation across brain regions, thus overlooking critical data such as innervation percentages and axonal distribution patterns. In response to these challenges, we introduce AxoDen, an open-source semiautomated platform designed to increase the speed and rigor of axon quantifications for basic neuroscience discovery. AxoDen processes user-defined brain regions of interests incorporating dynamic thresholding of grayscale-transformed images to facilitate binarized pixel measurements. Here, in mice, we show that AxoDen segregates the image content into signal and nonsignal categories, effectively eliminating background interference and enabling the exclusive measurement of fluorescence from axonal projections. AxoDen provides detailed and accurate representations of axonal density and spatial distribution. AxoDen's advanced yet user-friendly platform enhances the reliability and efficiency of axonal density analysis and facilitates access to unbiased high-quality data analysis with no technical background or coding experience required. AxoDen is <I>ad libitum</I> available to everyone as a valuable neuroscience tool for dissecting axonal innervation patterns in precisely defined brain regions.</p>

                The Japanese Civil Code (JCC) was enacted in 1896. Since then, the Law of Obligations of the JCC had not undergone any major amendments for a long time. It was in 2017 that a significant revision was undertaken. And this revision also included the provisions regarding set-off. This paper explains the various set-off requirements stipulated by Japanese current law. In Japan, the conditions under which the statutory requirements for set-off are satisfied are described as “eligibility for set-off” (Sousai-Tekijou), and the legal status of the parties in the set-off is called the right to set-off. Even if this eligibility for set-off arises, the parties may not exercise the right to set-off if there are circumstances that restrict the set-off. In addition, the Japanese Bankruptcy Act (JBA) modifies the requirements provided by the JCC to accommodate bankruptcy proceedings. In this paper, we will review in order the affirmative requirements for creating eligibility for set-off, the negative requirements for restricting the exercise of the right to set-off, and the requirements for set-off in bankruptcy proceedings. Please note that under Japanese law, when A intends to extinguish B’s claim β against him by set-off against his claim α, A’s claim α is referred to as an active claim (Jido-Saiken), and B’s cross-claim β as a passive claim (Judo-Saiken). This paper will also be described based on this terminology 1 .

                Aims To examine the correlation between iron, ferritin concentrations, and C. albicans infection in individuals with beta-thalassemia major and beta-thalassemia minor compared with healthy subjects. Materials and methods It involved 90 participants, thirty patients with thalassemia major and thirty patients with thalassemia minor compared with thirty healthy controls. Saliva samples were obtained and cultivated to isolate, identify, and calculate the viable colony count of C. albicans in (cfu/ml). In contrast, serum levels of iron and ferritin were quantified using chemical analyzers. Result Showed that 73.33% of thalassemia major group exhibited oral C. albicans colonization, which is significantly higher than that of thalassemia minor group 40% and control group 6.67%. Biochemical analyses revealed significantly higher iron 278.82 μg/dl and ferritin 2783.80 ng/ml levels in major group p<0.001 when compared with both thalassemia minor group 122.652 μg/dl, 74.723 ng/ml and control groups 127.438 μg/dl and 63.150 ng/ml respectively. C. albicans colony count in saliva was significantly elevated in beta-thalassemia major, as compared with beta-thalassemia minor group and control group. Conclusion Findings suggest that iron overload, which results from recurrent blood transfusions and causes immune dysfunction, contributes to higher risk of oral fungal infections in Beta-thalassemia patients compared with controls.

                Introduction Uterine arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a rare cause of chronic to catastrophic vaginal bleeding. The basic pathology is an abnormal arteriovenous connection in the uterine myometrium, which is observed as an entangled serpentine vascular architecture on ultrasound. Color Doppler and higher imaging modalities with angiography are usually used to confirm a diagnosis. Materials and methods An electronic database of Obstetrics and Gynecology departments was searched for cases of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) between 2021 and 2025. Only cases of AVM confirmed by ultrasound or higher imaging were considered. Results We comprehensively reported 15 cases of arteriovenous malformations. All patients had acquired AVMs, with abnormal uterine bleeding as the main symptom in 93% of cases. The treatment provided was medical management in 26% of patients, conservative management by transcatheter embolization in 66%, and hysterectomy in 6.6%. Conclusion AVMs are rare in clinical practice, and an understanding of their pathophysiology and prompt diagnosis are highly important for managing this emergency. Fertility-preserving treatments include medical therapy and uterine artery embolization. Hysterectomy is the definitive treatment for this condition.

                Background Critical thinking is a collection of dispositions and abilities related to individuals’ analytical, creative, and practical cognitive and decision-making skills. The development of optimal critical thinking skills better prepares students for college and their careers. The measurement of critical thinking actual abilities like inquisitiveness, open-mindedness, or systemic thinking among college students is limited. Similarly, the assessment of all types of critical thinking like creative or practical from the perspectives of students is meager. Methods This research utilizes original data collected from 803 college students between 2020 and 2021 after securing institutional review approval for the research. Self-reported data on 30 items instrument measuring students’ ratings of their analytical, creative, and practical thinking is used. Descriptive statistics, independent samples t-tests, and correlation analysis all were used to estimate the prevalence of critical thinking, and whether gender or language influence it or not. Results Results indicate that undergraduate students rated their abilities in critical thinking is very high. On all three types of critical thinking (analytical thinking, creative thinking, practical thinking), students scored between 117 and 123 on a 30-150 scale, indicating a high score. Additionally, gender and language have little to no influence over critical thinking scores. Further, analytical, creative, and practical thinking are independent from each other evident in the low correlations among all three elements. The results suggest the emergence of the Dunning-Kruger effect concerning students’ critical thinking assessment. Conclusions There is a colossal gap between students- self-reported ratings and their actual performance on critical thinking instruments. More rigorous assessments of dispositions and abilities are needed utilizing existing validated instruments in literature.

Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) has emerged as a critical treatment strategy for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) that halts the immune escape of the tumor cells. Increasing evidence suggests that the onset, progression, and lack of/no response of HNSCC to ICI are emergent properties arising from the interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Deciphering how the diversity of cellular and molecular interactions leads to distinct HNSCC TME subtypes subsequently governing the ICI response remains largely unexplored. We developed a cellular-molecular model of the HNSCC TME that incorporates multiple cell types, cellular states, and transitions, and molecularly mediated paracrine interactions. Simulation across the selected parameter space of the HNSCC TME network shows that distinct mechanistic balances within the TME give rise to the five clinically observed TME subtypes such as immune/non-fibrotic, immune/fibrotic, fibrotic only and immune/fibrotic desert. We predict that the cancer-associated fibroblast, beyond a critical proliferation rate, drastically worsens the ICI response by hampering the accessibility of the CD8 + killer T cells to the tumor cells. Our analysis reveals that while an Interleukin-2 (IL-2) + ICI combination therapy may improve response in the immune desert scenario, Osteopontin (OPN) and Leukemia Inhibition Factor (LIF) knockout with ICI yields the best response in a fibro-dominated scenario. Further, we predict Interleukin-8 (IL-8), and lactate can serve as crucial biomarkers for ICI-resistant HNSCC phenotypes. Overall, we provide an integrated quantitative framework that explains a wide range of TME-mediated resistance mechanisms for HNSCC and predicts TME subtype-specific targets that can lead to an improved ICI outcome.

                <p>by Katherine Owens, Aminur Rahman, Ivana Bozic</p>

The success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in treating hematologic malignancies has generated widespread interest in translating this technology to solid cancers. However, issues like tumor infiltration, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and tumor heterogeneity limit its efficacy in the solid tumor setting. Recent experimental and clinical studies propose local administration directly into the tumor or at the tumor site to increase CAR T-cell infiltration and improve treatment outcomes. Characteristics of the types of solid tumors that may be the most receptive to this treatment approach remain unclear. In this work, we develop a simplified spatiotemporal model for CAR T-cell treatment of solid tumors, and use numerical simulations to compare the effect of introducing CAR T cells via intratumoral injection versus intracavitary administration in diverse cancer types. We demonstrate that the model can reproduce tumor and CAR T-cell data from small imaging studies of local administration of CAR T cells in mouse models. Our results suggest that locally administered CAR T cells will be most successful against slowly proliferating, highly diffusive tumors. In our simulations, assuming equal detectable tumor diameters at the time of treatment, low average tumor cell density is a better predictor of treatment success than total tumor burden or volume doubling time. These findings affirm the clinical observation that CAR T cells will not perform equally across different types of solid tumors, and suggest that measuring tumor density may be helpful when considering the feasibility of CAR T-cell therapy and planning dosages for a particular patient. We additionally find that local delivery of CAR T cells can result in deep tumor responses, provided that the initial CAR T-cell dose does not contain a significant fraction of exhausted cells.

                <p>by Ada Wing Chi Yan, Ildar Sadreev, Jonas Mackerodt, Yan Zhang, Derek Macallan, Robert Busch, Becca Asquith</p>

Stable isotope labelling is one of the best methods currently available for quantifying cell dynamics <i>in vivo</i>, particularly in humans where the absence of toxicity makes it preferable over other techniques such as CFSE or BrdU. Interpretation of stable isotope labelling data (as for BrdU and CFSE) necessitates simplifying assumptions. Here we investigate the impact of three of the most commonly used simplifying assumptions: (i) that the cell population of interest is closed, (ii) that the population of interest is kinetically homogeneous, and (iii) that the population is spatially homogeneous and suggest pragmatic ways in which the resulting errors can be reduced.

Inhaled anesthetics were first introduced into clinical use in the 1840s. Molecular and transgenic animal studies indicate that inhaled anesthetics act through several ion channels, including γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) and two-pore domain K<sup>+</sup> (K2P) channels, but other targets may mediate anesthetic effects. Mutations in the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1), which is a calcium release channel on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, are relevant to malignant hyperthermia, a condition that can be induced by inhaled anesthetics. However, it was previously uncertain whether inhaled anesthetics directly interact with RyR1. In our study, we demonstrated that isoflurane and other inhaled anesthetics activate wild-type RyR1. By employing systematic mutagenesis, we discovered that altering just one amino acid residue negates the response to isoflurane, thus helping us to pinpoint the potential binding site. Knock-in mice engineered to express a mutant form of RyR1 that is insensitive to isoflurane exhibited resistance to the loss of righting reflex (LORR) when exposed to isoflurane anesthesia. This observation suggests a connection between RyR1 activation and the anesthetic effects in vivo. Moreover, it was shown that RyR1 is involved in the neuronal response to isoflurane. Additionally, administering new RyR1 agonists, which share the same binding site as isoflurane, resulted in a sedation-like state in mice. We propose that isoflurane directly activates RyR1, and this activation is pertinent to its anesthetic/sedative effects.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27267?af=R">Longitudinal Analysis of Neuroradiological Biomarkers for Fragile X‐Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome and Implications for Clinical Trials</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to show the capacity of structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures to serve as monitoring biomarkers for Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>From 2 longitudinal studies of male <i>FMR1</i> premutation carriers, 2 brain MRI scans were selected from each participant, collected within a period of 2 years (12 healthy controls, 17 carriers without FXTAS, and 51 carriers with FXTAS; all men, ages 40 to 80 years), along with clinical measurements and <i>FMR1</i> cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) repeat numbers. Candidate MRI biomarkers included whole brain white matter hyperintensity (WMH) and cerebellar, brainstem, and whole brain volumes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the FXTAS group, mixed-effects models demonstrated significant volume loss across an average interval of 1.32 years for the whole brain, cerebellum and brain stem volumes, and significant increases in WMH, with large magnitude effects for whole brain and WMH volumes. All MRI measures showed deterioration with advancing FXTAS stage, with the strongest pattern shown in WMH volume. CGG repeat number showed significant nonlinear associations with all 4 brain MRI metrics, with mid-range CGG repeat carriers evidencing the worst brain atrophy and WMHs.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Structural brain MRI measurements, especially those capturing white matter deterioration, are correlated with <i>FMR1</i> premutation size of CGG repeat length and sensitive to FXTAS disease progression across a relatively short interval of less than 2 years, making them potentially suitable as surrogate end points for clinical trials.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70016?af=R">Loss of NFIA Impairs Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is the process by which new neurons are continuously generated from neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) in the adult dentate gyrus. AHN plays a pivotal role in cognitive functions, including learning, memory, and mood regulation. Transcription factors regulate AHN by maintaining the NSPC pool and facilitating lineage progression. The nuclear factor I (NFI) transcription factor family member NFIA is critical for neurogenesis and gliogenesis during early brain development, but its role in adult neurogenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we generated an inducible <i>Nfia</i> loss-of-function mouse model to investigate the role of NFIA in <i>Ascl1-</i>lineage adult-born neurons. By tracking lineage progression from NSPCs to mature neurons, we found that NFIA deletion significantly reduced neurogenesis. Populations of NSPCs, neuroblasts, and mature granule neurons were all similarly diminished, indicating a primary defect in NSPC maintenance. Behaviorally, NFIA loss impaired hippocampal-dependent contextual fear memory without affecting locomotor activity, anxiety levels, spatial memory, or cued fear memory. Our findings demonstrate that NFIA is crucial for AHN and hippocampus-dependent contextual memory, thereby providing insights into its role in adult neurogenesis.</p>

                Background of the study The systematic impact of macroeconomic variables on stock market returns makes it crucial to comprehend the link between macroeconomic variables and the stock market. Stock prices are closely linked to macroeconomic indicators, a crucial aspect for investors, policymakers, and researchers in emerging markets like India, influencing investment decisions and policy formulation. Methods The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model was used in this study to examine the causal links between specific macroeconomic factors and Indian stock prices from April 2009 to March 2023. Results The outcomes of the research suggest that macroeconomic variables exert influence on the Indian stock market, across the short and long term. Moreover, the results of the paired Granger causality test suggest that the domestic macroeconomic variables possess predictive significance for stock prices in the Indian stock market. Conclusion The study reveals that macroeconomic variables significantly impact the Indian stock market, highlighting the need for investors and portfolio managers to monitor these conditions to optimize returns and mitigate risks. The Reserve Bank of India should maintain an optimal money supply to prevent inflation and exchange rate fluctuations, while bolstering the export sector and facilitating imports through initiatives like Atma-nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan and Make in India. Policies focusing on productivity, infrastructure, and a favourable business environment are also crucial. Therefore, it is crucial for investors and portfolio managers to consistently analyse the current macroeconomic conditions in order to maximize their profits and minimize risks. This research has extensive significance for comprehending the intricate connections between the stock market and macroeconomic issues.

<p>Prenatal VPA exposure to pregnant Wistar rat dams causes autism-like symptoms in the offspring, possibly via abnormal CREB signaling (decreased phosphorylation). Treatment with Forskolin, an AC activator, increases phosphorylation of CREB at ser133 and ameliorates autism-like symptoms in these VPA-induced ASD Wistar rats.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by social deficits, restricted interest, and repetitive behaviors. The prevalence is higher in males (4:1). FDA-approved drugs, Aripiprazole, and risperidone, only target comorbid conditions and have significant side effects. Dysregulation in cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) signaling is reported in autistic individuals. Forskolin is traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine with lesser side effects. It is a potent adenylyl cyclase (AC) activator, increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, thereby activating the protein kinase A (PKA)/CREB pathway with clinically proven benefits as an anticancer, anti-asthmatic, and in metabolic disorder, and crosses the blood–brain-barrier (BBB) junction. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of Forskolin and sought to explore the role of estrogen beta (ERβ/ESR2) receptors in a valproic acid (VPA) model of ASD. Pregnant Wistar rats received VPA or an equal volume of saline on gestational day (GD) 12.5. From postnatal day (PND) 23, male and female rats were divided separately into control, VPA, risperidone, and Forskolin (10–30 mg/kg) groups. Systemic administration of Forskolin ameliorated anxiety, social deficit, repetitive behavior, spatial recognition memory, motor coordination, gastrointestinal (GIT) motility, brain edema, and BBB permeability in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, chronic Forskolin treatment significantly alleviated VPA-induced neuronal damage in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus (HC), and cerebellum, and increased the intracellular CREB ser133 protein phosphorylation. Forskolin upregulated the mRNA expression of CREB signaling, which was altered by prenatal VPA administration. Our findings indicate that Forskolin provides neuroprotection through CREB signaling, suggesting its therapeutic potential for ASD.</p>

                Hohsfield et al. reveal a novel gateway for immune cells to enter the brain: the velum interpositum. This structure serves as a crucial entry point for myeloid cells under various brain states. The discovery sheds light on neuroimmune interactions and may have significant implications for understanding and treating neurological diseases.

CRISPR-Cas9-mediated miR-7 knockout combined with GABA delivery via the digestive tract reveals that midgut dysfunction subsequently impairs reproductive fitness.

                AVP and OT regulate essential physiological functions. Francesconi and Olivera-Pasilio et al., demonstrate that AVP and OT inputs excite the BNST via OTR. The OTR-expressing BNST neurons reduce anxious arousal, helping to balance external-threat risk with internal physiological demands.

                Lish et al. present a co-culture system of iPSC-derived human microglia, astrocytes, and neurons to investigate intercellular communication across different environmental and genetic contexts. Transcriptomic and protein analyses show that co-culture drives distinct cell states, with astrocytes inducing disease-associated microglia. Notably, neurons with familial Alzheimer’s disease mutations disrupt this process.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91771">The role of GABA in semantic memory and its neuroplasticity</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is understanding neural functioning and plasticity of the brain. The anterior temporal lobe (ATL) is a hub for semantic memory, which generates coherent conceptual representations. GABAergic inhibition plays a crucial role in shaping human cognition and plasticity, but it is unclear how this inhibition relates to human semantic memory and its plasticity. Here, we employed a combination of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), MR spectroscopy and fMRI to investigate the role of GABA in semantic memory and its neuroplasticity. We found that inhibitory cTBS increased GABA concentrations in the ATL and reduced blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activation during semantic tasks. Crucially, changes in GABA were tightly linked to changes in regional activity, suggesting that GABA mediates cTBS-induced plasticity. Individuals with better semantic performance exhibited selective activity in the ATL, attributable to higher GABA levels, which can sharpen distributed semantic representations. Our results revealed a non-linear, inverted-U-shape relationship between GABA levels in the ATL and semantic performance, thus offering an explanation for the individual differences in semantic memory function and neuromodulation outcomes. These findings offer a neurochemical explanation for individual variability in neuromodulation and provide insights for developing targeted interventions for semantic impairments.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103663">HNF4α-TET2-FBP1 axis contributes to gluconeogenesis and type 2 diabetes</a></h4>

              
                The control of gluconeogenesis is critical for glucose homeostasis and the pathology of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here, we uncover a novel function of TET2 in the regulation of gluconeogenesis. In mice, both fasting and a high-fat diet (HFD) stimulate the expression of TET2, and <i>TET2</i> knockout impairs glucose production. Mechanistically, FBP1, a rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis, is positively regulated by TET2 in liver cells. TET2 is recruited by HNF4α, contributing to the demethylation of the <i>FBP1</i> promoter and activating its expression in response to glucagon stimulation. Moreover, metformin treatment increases the phosphorylation of HNF4α on Ser313, which prevents its interaction with TET2, thereby decreasing the expression level of FBP1 and ameliorating the pathology of T2D. Collectively, we identify an HNF4α-TET2-FBP1 axis in the control of gluconeogenesis, which contributes to the therapeutic effect of metformin on T2D and provides a potential target for the clinical treatment of T2D.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99200">Confirmation of HLA-II associations with TB susceptibility in admixed African samples</a></h4>

              
                Previously, the International Tuberculosis Host Genetics Consortium (ITHGC) demonstrated the power of large-scale GWAS analysis across diverse ancestries in identifying tuberculosis (TB) susceptibility loci (Schurz et al., 2024). Despite identifying a significant genetic correlate in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-II region, this association did not replicate in the African ancestry-specific analysis, due to small sample size and the inclusion of admixed samples. Our study aimed to build upon the findings from the ITHGC and identify TB susceptibility loci in an admixed South African cohort using the local ancestry allelic adjusted association (LAAA) model. We identified a suggestive association peak (<i>rs3117230</i>, p-value = 5.292 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, OR = 0.437, SE = 0.182) in the <i>HLA-DPB1</i> gene originating from KhoeSan ancestry. These findings extend the work of the ITHGC, underscore the need for innovative strategies in studying complex admixed populations, and confirm the role of the HLA-II region in TB susceptibility in admixed South African samples.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100071">Pathway activation model for personalized prediction of drug synergy</a></h4>

              
                Targeted monotherapies for cancer often fail due to inherent or acquired drug resistance. By aiming at multiple targets simultaneously, drug combinations can produce synergistic interactions that increase drug effectiveness and reduce resistance. Computational models based on the integration of omics data have been used to identify synergistic combinations, but predicting drug synergy remains a challenge. Here, we introduce Drug synergy Interaction Prediction (DIPx), an algorithm for personalized prediction of drug synergy based on biologically motivated tumor- and drug-specific pathway activation scores (PASs). We trained and validated DIPx in the AstraZeneca-Sanger (AZS) DREAM Challenge human cell-line dataset using two separate test sets: Test Set 1 comprised the combinations already present in the training set, while Test Set 2 contained combinations absent from the training set, thus indicating the model’s ability to handle novel combinations. The Spearman’s correlation coefficients between predicted and observed drug synergy were 0.50 (95% CI: 0.47–0.53) in Test Set 1 and 0.26 (95% CI: 0.22–0.30) in Test Set 2, compared to 0.38 (95% CI: 0.34–0.42) and 0.18 (95% CI: 0.16–0.20), respectively, for the best performing method in the Challenge. We show evidence that higher synergy is associated with higher functional interaction between the drug targets, and this functional interaction information is captured by PAS. We illustrate the use of PAS to provide a potential biological explanation in terms of activated pathways that mediate the synergistic effects of combined drugs. In summary, DIPx can be a useful tool for personalized prediction of drug synergy and exploration of activated pathways related to the effects of combined drugs.

">Accurate spatial localization of Allen Human Brain Atlas gene expression data for human neuroimaging</a></h4>

              
                The Allen Human Brain Atlas has been a tremendously impactful resource in neuroimaging. The usefulness of this resource in neuroimaging arises from spatial coordinates of dissected tissue samples being provided in relation to a Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)-space standard brain template, thereby allowing for the integration of gene expression and spatially standardized neuroimaging data. In fact, two previous sets of spatial coordinates exist, and surprisingly, the accuracy of these coordinates in placing dissected tissue samples in correct anatomical locations within MNI space have not been examined. Here, we show that there are significant inaccuracies in the two previous sets of coordinates, and provide a refined set of coordinates as a resource to the neuroscience community. We show (through analyses of meta-analytic data and a re-analysis of real study data) that using previous inaccurate coordinates can result in dramatically different genes being identified, which could compromise further downstream analyses.

">Human brain network control of creativity</a></h4>

              
                The ability to think creatively is fundamental to human cognition, shaping how we interact with the world and navigate complex problems. Creativity depends on the interaction of multiple large-scale brain networks, but how these networks represent creative thought and distinguish it from other cognitive states remains unclear. Here, we use invasive intracranial recordings in the human brain to explore the network-level representations underlying creative thinking. Our results demonstrate that cortical networks in the human brain differentially encode distinct cognitive states: we found unique brain states underlying creative thinking vs. arithmetic calculations, particularly in the default mode network. Further, in the dorsal attention network, we uncovered nonlinear, high-dimensional representations of moment-by-moment fluctuations in creative performance. These representations define a neural creativity axis shared between network-level and single-neuron computations. Our findings reveal widespread neural representations of cognitive state and suggest distinct roles of specific cortical networks in controlling creativity, with the default mode network gating access to creative states and the dorsal attention network regulating the quality of creative output.

">Hierarchical diversification of instinctual behavior neurons by lineage, birth order, and sex</a></h4>

              
                Brain regions devoted to instinctual behaviors, including the vertebrate hypothalamus and arthropod cerebrum, contain bespoke neural circuits dedicated to perceptual and internal regulation of many behavioral states. These circuits are usually complex in structure and contain an extensive diversity of cell types. The regulatory mechanisms that pattern circuits for instinctual behaviors have been challenging to elucidate. Here, we developed methods in Drosophila to transcriptionally profile identified neuronal stem cell lineages in the cerebrum. We applied this method to lineages that generate sex-differentiated neurons with known circuit roles. We identified 91 transcription factors that, in combinations of 6-8, delineate cerebral hemilineages - classes of postmitotic neurons born from the same stem cell and sharing Notch status. Hemilineages comprise the major anatomic classes in the cerebrum and these transcription factors are required to generate their gross features. We further identified 33 transcription factors characteristic of neuronal birth order within lineages; these subtly differentiate neuronal subtypes to provide common computational modules to circuits regulating different behaviors. Our findings suggest that hemilineage and birth order transcription factors operate in a hierarchical system to build, diversify, and sexually differentiate lineally-related neurons that compose complex instinctual circuits.

">Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Invariant Face Representations in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                The human brain can effortlessly extract a familiar faces age, gender, and identity despite dramatic changes in appearance, such as head orientation, lighting, or expression. Yet, the spatiotemporal dynamics underlying this ability, and how they depend on task demands, remain unclear. Here, we used multivariate decoding of magnetoencephalography (MEG) responses and source localization to characterize the emergence of invariant face representations. Human participants viewed natural images of highly familiar celebrities that systematically varied in viewpoint, gender, and age, while performing a one-back task on the identity or the image. Time-resolved decoding revealed that identity information emerged rapidly and became increasingly invariant to viewpoint over time. We observed a temporal hierarchy: view-specific identity information appeared at 64 ms, followed by mirror-invariant representations at 75 ms and fully view-invariant identity at 89 ms. Identity-invariant age and gender information emerged around the same time as view-invariant identity. Task demands modulated only late-stage identity and gender representations, suggesting that early face processing is predominantly feedforward. Source localization at peak decoding times showed consistent involvement of the occipital face area (OFA) and fusiform face area (FFA), with stronger identity and age signals than gender. Our findings reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics by which the brain extracts view-invariant identity from familiar faces, suggest that age and gender are processed in parallel, and show that task demands modulate later processing stages. Together, these results offer new constraints on computational models of face perception.

">Neural Traces of Forgotten Memories Persist in Humans and are Behaviorally Relevant</a></h4>

              
                For a long time, forgetting has been taken as the dissipation of the neural memory traces (engrams). However, recent engram research in mice suggests that the engrams of forgotten memories do persist. This raises the question whether engrams underlying human episodic memories also persist despite forgetting? And do forgotten memories influence human behavior implicitly? To address this question, 40 men and women learned 96 face-object pairs. Using high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging at 7 Tesla we mapped the fate of the 96 memories at the systems level from learning to a 30-minute and onward to a 24-hour memory test. Upon each retrieval attempt, participants indicated whether they remembered or forgot the memory. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the functional brain data revealed that the engrams of forgotten memories remain implemented in the episodic memory network and continue to influence the accuracy of guessing responses at test. Overnight, the engrams of forgotten memories became implemented more deeply within bilateral hippocampus, while consciously accessible memories were neocorticalized overnight. The engrams of both consciously accessible and inaccessible (forgotten) memories were shifted from the 30-minute to the 24-hour retrieval within the right hippocampus and anterior cingulate gyrus such that pattern dissimilarities supported the correct retrieval responses at 24 hours. This is evidence that forgotten human episodic memories remain implemented in the episodic memory network and continue to influence human behavior implicitly.

">Ethanol inhibits dorsomedial striatum acetylcholine release</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol use disorder (AUD) has severe adverse health and economic impacts totaling over $240 billion annually. Despite this, FDA approved treatments for AUD are limited. For this reason, further understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms in AUD is required for new treatments. An aspect of AUD involves deficits in behavioral flexibility that is similarly seen in animal models with depletion of dorsal striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs). We found that acute EtOH (40 mM) inhibits the firing rate of dorsal striatal CINs, which are the primary source of acetylcholine (ACh) in the dorsal striatum. Additionally, we found through slice photometry recordings using an intensity-based ACh sensing fluorescent reporter (iAChSnFR) that acute EtOH (40 mM) inhibits dorsal striatal ACh release. In accord, in vivo fiber photometry with iAChSnFR also showed inhibition of ACh release following acute EtOH (2 g/kg ip). To induce EtOH dependence in mice, we used the chronic intermittent EtOH (CIE) vapor exposure model. Following CIE, we found that CIE-treated mice had a significant depression of ACh release compared to control mice in the dorsomedial but not dorsolateral striatum. Then, we performed stereological cell counts of CINs in CIE and control mice to examine the cause of this ACh deficit and found that CIE mice had a significant decrease in CINs in the dorsomedial but not dorsolateral striatum. In conclusion, our data show that EtOH inhibits dorsal striatal cholinergic signaling in a subregion specific manner that may contribute to AUD related behaviors.

">eyeris: A flexible, extensible, and reproducible pupillometry preprocessing framework in R</a></h4>

              
                Pupillometry provides a non-invasive window into the mind and brain, particularly as a psychophysiological readout of autonomic and cognitive processes like arousal, attention, stress, and emotional states. Pupillometry research lacks a robust, standardized framework for data preprocessing, whereas in functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography, researchers have converged on tools such as fMRIPrep, EEGLAB and MNE-Python; these tools are considered the gold standard in the field. Many established pupillometry preprocessing packages and workflows fall short of serving the goal of enhancing reproducibility, especially since most existing solutions lack designs based on Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles. To promote FAIR and open science practices for pupillometry research, we developed eyeris, a complete pupillometry preprocessing suite designed to be intuitive, modular, performant, and extensible (https://github.com/shawntz/eyeris). Out-of-the-box, eyeris provides a recommended preprocessing workflow and considers signal processing best practices for tonic and phasic pupillometry. Moreover, eyeris further enables open and reproducible science workflows, as well as quality control workflows by following a well-established file management schema and generating interactive output reports for both record keeping/sharing and quality assurance of preprocessed pupil data prior to formal analysis. Taken together, eyeris provides a robust all-in-one transparent and adaptive solution for high-fidelity pupillometry preprocessing with the aim of further improving reproducibility in pupillometry research.

">Human intention inference with a large language model can enhance brain-computer interface control: A proof-of-concept study</a></h4>

              
                Brain-computer interface (BCI) control enables direct communication between the brain and external devices. However, BCI control accuracy with intention inferred from non-invasive modalities is limited, even when using data-driven approaches to tailor neural decoders. In this study, we propose a knowledge-driven framework for inferring human intention, leveraging large language models (LLMs) as an alternative to conventional data-driven approaches. We developed a neural decoder that integrates neural and oculomotor signals with contextual information using an LLM agent. Its feasibility was tested in a real-world BCI task to control a computer application. The LLM-based decoder achieved an average accuracy of 79% for responders (11 out of 20) in inferring the intention to select arbitrary posts in a social networking service. Ablation analyses revealed that integration of contextual information, multimodal signals, and empirical knowledge is critical for decoding accuracy. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a neural decoding framework using an LLM, paving the way for improved performance in BCI-driven external device operation for patients with disability.

">NeuID, a novel neuron-specific lncRNA, resolved a key epigenetic mechanisms linking gene silencing to Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                The increasing evidence that non-coding RNAs can become deregulated during pathogenesis is dramatically expanding the space for drug discovery beyond the protein-coding genome. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as key regulators of cellular function, yet most remain uncharacterized. Here, we identify a previously unstudied lncRNA, which we named Neuronal Identity (NeuID), a conserved, brain-enriched transcript expressed exclusively in neurons. NeuID is downregulated in the brains of Alzheimers disease (AD) patients. Mechanistically, NeuID maintains neuronal identity by repressing developmental and glial genes via interaction with the PRC2 subunit EZH2 and regulation of H3K27me3. Knockdown of NeuID disrupts this repression, leading to impaired neuronal activity and memory formation. Importantly, CRISPRa-mediated NeuID overexpression restores neuronal function in amyloid beta-treated neurons. These findings identify NeuID as a critical regulator of neuronal plasticity and position it as a promising therapeutic target for AD.

">Resting-state functional dynamics alterations relate to plasma amyloid markers and explain memory impairments in the TgF344-AD model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state (RS) fMRI studies of Alzheimer's disease's (AD) impact on brain function commonly use functional connectivity (FC), ignoring short-timescale network dynamics, captured by co-activation patterns (CAPs), shown to accurately classify transgenic rodents from the wild-type (WT). We acquired high temporal resolution RS-fMRI data in the TgF344-AD rat model at pre-plaque and plaque stages and delineated brain functional alterations using FC and CAPs. We also assessed plaque-stage blood amyloid levels and memory performance in the same animals and investigated the statistical relationship between pathological, RS-functional, and behavioral phenotypes. TgF344-AD (TG) rats had elevated blood amyloid levels, committed more working and reference memory errors and showed reduced hippocampal FC with the lateral cortical and default-mode-like network (DMLN) compared to WT at the plaque stage. They showed DMLN and hippocampal hyper- and hypo-activation at pre- and plaque stages, respectively in multiple CAPs. While blood amyloid levels were explained better by plaque-stage, than pre-plaque stage, FC values and CAP activations, it was the pre-plaque stage, more than the plaque stage, CAP activations that accurately explained memory impairments. Our findings not only identify early signatures of AD in brain functional dynamics in this translational rat model but demonstrate their relevance for prognosis of memory deficits.

">Paraventricular Thalamus Hyperactivity Mediates Stress-Induced Sensitization of Unlearned Fear but Not Stress-Enhanced Fear Learning (SEFL)</a></h4>

              
                Exposure to stress can cause long-lasting enhancement of fear and other defensive responses that extend beyond the cues or contexts associated with the original traumatic event. These nonassociative consequences of stress, referred to as fear sensitization, are thought to underlie some symptoms of trauma-related disorders. Fear sensitization has been predominately studied using the Stress-Enhanced Fear Learning (SEFL) paradigm, which models the stress-induced amplification of fear learning. Less is known about the mechanisms through which unlearned fear responses are sensitized by stress. Here, we investigated the neural mechanisms for sensitization of unlearned fear responses using a paradigm we termed Stress-Enhanced Fear Responding (SEFR). In this model, mice exposed to a single session of footshock stress exhibit enhanced freezing to a novel tone stimulus. To investigate brain regions that might mediate SEFR, we first used c-Fos mapping to identify neural activity changes associated with stress-induced enhancement of unlearned fear. Our c-Fos screen identified the posterior paraventricular thalamus (pPVT) as a region that was persistently hyperactive after footshock stress and whose activity correlated with behavioral expression of SEFR. Using fiber photometry, we observed that SEFR, but not SEFL, was associated with increased activity in the pPVT. Next, we found that chemogenetic inhibition of the pPVT blocked both the induction of SEFR during stress and its later expression, while artificial stimulation of pPVT in stress-naive mice was sufficient to recapitulate SEFR. Interestingly, pPVT inhibition or stimulation did not affect acquisition or expression of SEFL. In conclusion, our results indicate that sensitization of fear learning (SEFL) and sensitization of unlearned fear (SEFR) have distinct neural mechanisms. Our results identify pPVT hyperactivity as a mechanism for stress-induced sensitization of unlearned fear and highlight pPVT as a potential target for treating arousal and reactivity symptoms of trauma- and stressor-related disorders.

">Novel mouse model reveals neurodevelopmental origin of PMM2-CDG brain pathology</a></h4>

              
                Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a group of neurogenetic conditions resulting from disruptions in the cellular glycosylation machinery. The majority of CDG patients have compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in the phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2) gene. Individuals with PMM2-CDG exhibit multi-systemic symptoms, prominently featuring neurological deficits with nearly all patients exhibiting cerebellar hypoplasia and ataxia. To overcome embryonic lethality caused by whole body knock-out of Pmm2 and mimic patient-related compound heterozygous pathogenic variants, we paired a Pmm2 flox allele (Pmm2fl) with a catalytically inactive knock-in allele (Pmm2R137H), commonly present in PMM2-CDG patients. Mice with post-mitotic loss of PMM2 from neurons or astrocytes are indistinguishable from unaffected littermates, including in a broad battery of neurological assessments. In contrast, removal of PMM2 from embryonic neural precursor cells leads to cerebellar hypoplasia, ataxia, seizures, and early lethality. Comprehensive multi-omics profiling, including metabolomics, glycomics, single-cell transcriptomics, proteomics, and glycoproteomics, reveal widespread molecular disturbances throughout the brain, with the cerebellum showing the most pronounced disruption. These findings highlight the heightened dependency of the developing cerebellum on intact N-glycosylation, aligning with clinical observations in PMM2-CDG patients. Importantly, glycoproteomic alterations identified in our mouse model are corroborated in PMM2-CDG patient post-mortem cerebellar tissue, underscoring the translational relevance of our findings and implicating impaired synaptic transmission as a key pathogenic mechanism.

">A genetically encoded fluorescent sensor for monitoring spatiotemporal prostaglandin E2 dynamics in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is an important lipid signaling molecule that regulates a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. However, its dynamics during these processes are largely unknown due to the lack of tools to directly visualize PGE2 with high spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we developed and characterized a genetically encoded PGE2 sensor, which we call GRABPGE2-1.0 (PGE2-1.0), that has high specificity for PGE2, nanomolar affinity, rapid kinetics, and high spatial resolution when expressed both in vitro and in vivo. Using fiber-photometry recordings, we found that PGE2-1.0 can reliably monitor endogenous PGE2 dynamics in the preoptic area in the brain during acute inflammation. The wide-field in vivo imaging with PGE2-1.0 reveals spatial heterogeneity in cortex-wide PGE2 dynamics during acute inflammation and seizure. Thus, our PGE2-1.0 sensor can be used to detect endogenous PGE2 dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolution, providing a robust tool for studying PGE2 under specific physiological and pathological conditions.

">Neuronal avalanches as a predictive biomarker of BCI performance- towards a tool to guide tailored training</a></h4>

              
                Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery (MI) hold promise for restoring control in individuals with motor impairments. However, up to 30% of users remain unable to effectively use BCIs: a phenomenon termed BCI inefficiency. This study addresses a major limitation in current BCI training protocols: the use of fixed-length training paradigms that ignore individual learning variability. We propose a novel approach that leverages neuronal avalanches, spatiotemporal cascades of brain activity, as biomarkers to characterize and predict user-specific learning mechanism. Using electroencephalography (EEG) data collected across four MI-BCI training sessions in 20 healthy participants, we extracted two features: avalanche length and activations. These features revealed significant training and task-condition effects, particularly in later sessions. Crucially, changes in these features across sessions (avalanche length and activations) correlated significantly with BCI performance and enabled prediction of future BCI success via longitudinal Support Vector Regression and Classification models. Predictive accuracy reached up to 91%, with notable improvements after spatial filtering based on selected regions of interest. These findings demonstrate the utility of neuronal avalanche dynamics as robust biomarkers for BCI training, supporting the development of personalized protocols aimed at mitigating BCI illiteracy.

">Direct Binding of FGFR3 Autoantibodies to Sensory Neurons Drives Hyperexcitability and Mechanical Hypersensitivity</a></h4>

              
                Sensory neuronopathies (SNN) and small fiber neuropathies (SFN) are debilitating disorders often associated with neuropathic pain, yet their underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Autoantibodies against fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (-FGFR3) have been identified in a subset of patients, but their pathological significance has not been established. Here, we describe that -FGFR3-positive patients consistently report neuropathic pain and display a distinct clinical phenotype characterized by large-fiber involvement and non-length-dependent fiber loss, suggesting dorsal root ganglia (DRG) dysfunction. We demonstrate that -FGFR3 bind to sensory neurons within dorsal root ganglia (DRG). We validated both at the transcript and protein level that the target of autoantibodies, FGFR3, is expressed in human sensory neurons and that therefore -FGFR3 could find their target in primary afferents. DRG neurons exposed to -FGFR3 rapidly acquired a hyperexcitability phenotype. Injection of -FGFR3-positive patient serum in rats caused mechanical hypersensitivity, mirroring patient-reported pain symptoms. Mechanistically, -FGFR3 activated the Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling cascade, specifically extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38, which are known to enhance neuronal excitability. Epitope mapping revealed key extracellular epitopes on FGFR3. Blocking these epitopes prevented -FGFR3-induced sensory neuron hyperexcitability, thus showing that the autoantibody binding of the FGFR3 extracellular domain is a key factor affecting DRG neurons. Our work suggests that beyond their role as biomarkers, -FGFR3 actively contribute to pain hypersensitivity by acting on the DRG. This positions both -FGFR3 and FGFR3 signaling as a potential therapeutic targets for modulating sensory neuron excitability and treating autoimmune neuropathies

">Measurements and simulations of transmembrane water exchange by diffusion NMR methods: From yeast cells to optic nerve ex vivo</a></h4>

              
                Non-invasive measurements of exchange is paramount in different fields, ranging from material to biological sciences, and may even blur micro-structural or other characteristics of multi compartmental systems studied by MR methods. Despite the growing interest in diffusion-exchange studies of complex systems--where at least one exchanging component exhibits non-Gaussian diffusion--comparative studies remain scarce. Most existing investigations have applied different diffusion MR methods to different biological samples under varying experimental conditions, making direct comparisons difficult. Moreover, the lack of a gold standard for exchange rate measurements further complicates efforts to validate and interpret results. To address these challenges, we employed two diffusion NMR-based methods--the constant-gradient pulsed field gradient (CG-PFG) and the recently introduced filter-exchange NMR spectroscopy (FEXSY)--to investigate apparent water exchange in yeast cells and optic nerves, both before and after fixation. We first evaluated the effect of the q-values on the extracted indices and then evaluated the stability and reproducibility of the measurements. The CG-PFG and FEXSY experiments were collected on the same sample to allow for comparison of the results. The intracellular mean residence times (MRTs) ({tau}i) extracted from the log-linear fit of the CG-PFG NMR experiments were found to be 554{+/-}6ms and 337{+/-}10ms for yeast cells before and after fixation, respectively. The respective {tau}i values extracted from the FEXSY experiments before and after fixation were found to be 368{+/-}14ms and 146{+/-}24ms, respectively. Despite the difference in absolute values of the MRTs, the same qualitative behavior is observed in the two methodologies, and both could be analyzed using the bi-compartmental Karger model. The same methodologies were then used to study exchange in the more complex porcine optic nerves. There, the bi-compartmental Karger model analysis is shown to be inadequate. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are used to narrow down on the most possible explanation, suggesting that optic nerves are multi-compartmental systems where not all spins are free to undergo exchange. Supporting theoretical calculation point to the existence of at least one additional non-exchanging restricted compartment. Thus, a tri-compartmental model is derived and used to analyze the data. The new model fits the data significantly better and results in dramatically different exchange rates when used on white matter (WM) data: CG-PFG experiments were found to be 730{+/-}40ms and 803{+/-}16ms for optic nerve before and after fixation, respectively. The respective {tau}i values extracted from the FEXSY experiments before and after fixation were found to be 530{+/-}125ms and 387{+/-}104ms, respectively. These values are considerably smaller than values that were previously reported. Finally, we use simulations to show that the quantitative discrepancy between the CG-PFG and FEXSY can be attributed, at least partially, to the difference in T2 values between the intra- and extracellular compartments. We thus encourage the pairing of exchange and spin-spin relaxation measurements in future works. We end with a discussion on the current state of the diffusion-exchange, and in an attempt to put a spotlight on essential corner stones that are still missing despite the great advance of recent years -- experimental standardization, method comparison and adequate modeling.

">A characterization of mouse retinal ganglion cell types labeled with AAV tools</a></h4>

              
                The mouse retina is made-up of approximately 150 types of neurons each with unique characteristics and functions in interpreting visual information. Recent efforts to categorize cell types using molecular markers, morphology, and electrophysiological response properties have provided a wealth of information and a host of tools for studying specific cell types. AAV-based approaches have several advantages over transgenic mouse lines, including ease of application to many different animal models without extensive crossing and their amenability to intersectional approaches. Here, we provide an in-depth characterization of retinal ganglion cell types labeled by two AAV vectors drawn from a recent panel of constructs with synthetic promoters. Each promoter analyzed here was derived from a gene expressed in a cell type specific manner. Using a combination of morphology, molecular markers, and electrophysiological measurement of light responses, we found that each vector labeled distinct subsets of RGCs. However, both labeled more cell types than expected from the expression pattern of the promoters endogenous gene. We then characterized the projection patterns of these RGC types to the brain, finding that each AAV type labeled distinct axonal populations. These tools provide new access to a unique subset of cells and will be instrumental to future studies analyzing their functions and connectivity.

                In the accompanying study, we describe two pairs of MDGA1 missense mutations (Val116Met/Ala688Val and Tyr635Cys/Glu756Gln) from two patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and how these mutations exert distinct abnormalities in biological processes during central nervous system development. Here, we generated knockin (KI) mice harboring the murine version of Tyr635Cys/Glu756Gln MDGA1 (Mdga1Y636C/E751Q) and performed extensive behavioral analyses. Male KI mouse pups and adults exhibited impaired ultrasonic vocalizations and sensorimotor gating (ASD-relevant behavioral deficits), and thus exhibited phenotypes different from those of male Mdga1 conditional knockout (cKO) mice. In contrast, adult female KI mice did not exhibit a range of ASD-like behavioral abnormalities. Electrophysiological analyses performed using both juvenile and adult Mdga1Y636C/E751Q mice revealed sexually dimorphic and developmental stage-dependent compromises of GABAergic synaptic inhibition. In addition, proteomics analyses showed that the phospho-proteomic phenotypes differed between Mdga1Y636C/E751Q and Mdga1-cKO mice. Treatment of male Mdga1Y636C/E751Q KI mice with the FDA-approved estrogen receptor modulator, bazedoxifene, restores the KI-related molecular, GABAergic synapse, and behavioral changes. Collectively, our results suggest a novel treatment strategy for ASDs that present developmentally regulated and/or sexually dimorphic features.

">How individual vigor shapes human-human physical interaction</a></h4>

              
                The speed of voluntary movements varies systematically, with some individuals moving consistently faster than others across different actions. These variations, conceptualized as vigor, reflect a time-effort-accuracy tradeoff in motor planning. How do two mechanically coupled partners with different individual vigors collaborate, e.g. to move a table together? Here, we show that such dyads coordinate goal-directed movements with minimal interaction force, exhibiting a dyadic vigor with similar characteristics as individual vigor. The emerging dyadic motor plan is strongly influenced by the slower partner, whose vigor predicts dyadic vigor, with effects lasting beyond connected practice. Computational modeling reveals the critical role of the partners' movement timing's uncertainty and vigor in shaping coordination, allowing to predict dyadic movements from individual behavior across diverse conditions. These findings shed light on the mechanisms underlying successful human collaboration, and may be used in applications ranging from physical training and rehabilitation to collaborative robotics for manufacturing.

">Non-conscious Multisensory Integration in the Ventriloquist Effect</a></h4>

              
                The degree to which information from distinct sensory modalities can interact in the absence of conscious awareness remains controversial. According to the Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT), unconscious sensory information remains relatively confined to sensory cortex and should not be capable of interacting with other modalities until it is broadcast into the (conscious) global workspace comprising late (>300ms) frontal-parietal activation. The ventriloquist effect is a classical multisensory integration phenomenon that refers to the misperception of sound location towards concurrent visual stimulation, such as perceiving the voice of a ventriloquist actor as coming from the moving dummy. Here we used meta-contrast masking to render a brief flash stimulus non-conscious while participants performed a sound localization task. We found that, despite being at chance performance in discriminating the flash location, participants were nevertheless biased to localize sounds towards the unconscious flash locations. The effect was present in virtually all participants, was nearly as large as the effect on conscious trials, and was robust to controls for individual differences in task performance. Decoding analyses of concurrently recorded EEG signals showed that the non-conscious flash location information was present up until around 230ms but not after; confirming that the visual influence on sound perception likely occurred before conscious broadcast. Our findings suggest that subjective perception is not required for the integration of signals originating in distinct sensory modalities prompting new questions about the role of subjective perception in multisensory integration.

">The Neuromuscular system of Chironomus vitellinus (Diptera: Chironomidae)</a></h4>

              
                Chironomids are important laboratory model organisms used to assess toxicity in freshwater environments. Cell and tissue features are not commonly used as chironomid markers to detect toxicity, but they could be extremely helpful in identifying acute and chronic effects of pollutants. The nervous system is an excellent cellular candidate since it is reactive to toxic substances. However, a detailed description of the chironomid nervous system is required prior to considering it as a candidate for a cellular toxicity marker. The present study describes the central ganglia, nerves, axons, and the neuromuscular system of Chironomus vitellinus (Freeman, 1961) to facilitate its use as a model organism in environmental studies. We find that the structure of the C. vitellinus central nervous system is identical to that observed in other Chironomus larvae. We then focused our study on the first abdominal segment and labeled the 31 hemi-segmental muscles according to a nomenclature based on their position and orientation. We also characterized their innervation and assigned the nerves a nomenclature based on their terminals location in the muscle tissue. Finally, we investigated the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) throughout this segment and defined four types of NMJs illustrating their great variability in size and shape. We selected a model NMJ, VEL 2, and quantified its mean bouton number and muscle size. Together with documenting a neurobiological system that could be informative to insects comparative biology, these results could help establish the Chironomus NMJ as an aquatic toxicity marker.

">Non-Physiological Potassium Concentrations in Commercial Culture Media Trigger Acute Epileptiform Activity in Human iPSC-Derived Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal in vitro cultures are pivotal for studying brain electrophysiological function and dysfunction. Neuronal activity and communication are regulated by extracellular ion concentrations. Therefore, cell culture medium ion concentrations should ideally mimic those of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) - considered as the milieu for brain cells in vivo. In this study, we demonstrate that commonly used cell culture media, including Neurobasal (+/- A), Neurobasal Plus, and BrainPhys media, do not accurately replicate human CSF ion concentrations. Using human iPSC-derived neuronal networks on microelectrode arrays, we show that the abnormally high potassium concentrations present in all tested cell culture media induce acute epileptiform activity, similar to that elicited by the convulsive drug 4-aminopyridine. These findings raise a critical question: How can human in vitro neuronal activity be defined as physiological and reliably distinguished from pathophysiological activity, if the routinely used ion concentrations in in vitro experiments are causing aberrant neuronal activity?

">Social experience alters behaviors by reprogramming the Fruitless pathway and circadian state in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Animals thrive with social interactions and suffer significant adverse mental and physical health consequences when isolated. From flies to humans, social experience affects various cognitive and behavioral processes. Here, we use the fruit flies to show that group housing suppresses male courtship vigor as a result of a decrease in the evoked neural responses in courtship circuits. Bulk tissue RNAseq and single-cell RNAseq from fru- and dsx-positive cells from grouped or isolated male brains revealed that social isolation increases the number of fru- and dsx-positive neurons, elevates fru transcript levels in specific clock neurons, and dsx transcript levels throughout the brain. Knocking down fruM in the fru-positive neurons in brains decreases courtship in isolated males to levels comparable to those of group-housed males. Furthermore, group housing increases the expression of sr and Hr38 genes encoding neural activity-induced transcription factors in most neurons within social circuits. We found that knocking down sr in fru positive neurons effectively eliminates the impact of social experience by increasing courtship in group-housed males. Importantly, social experience also alters the expression of FruM/DsxM target genes regulating circadian states throughout the brain. Disrupting circadian gene function also diminishes the effect of group housing on courtship. Our findings suggest that group housing/social enrichment suppress courtship by reprogramming the circadian arousal state, whereas courtship-elevating effects of social isolation rely on changes in FruM expression and function. These results are significant as they point to modulation of circadian arousal state as a possible central strategy for mediating the pleiotropic effects of social experience on organismal responses.

Seizures can be conceptualized as composites of different electrographic patterns including (1) spike, (2) ripple-on-spike, and (3) ripple-on-oscillation. This study also performs a basic CFC analysis of each of these components which has potential to further the understanding of epileptogenic processes. Methods: In this study, deep learning networks including Stacked Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) are trained to detect seizures and help characterize CFC patterns for these three common seizure components. The analysis uses intracranial EEG (iEEG) records from the ieeg.org (Mayo Clinic files) database. Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) seizures (n = 120) from 26 patients were analyzed along with segments of background activity. Power-to-power coupling was calculated between all frequencies 1-250 Hz pairwise using the EEGLAB toolbox. CFC matrices of seizure and background activity were used as training or testing inputs to the autoencoder. Results: The trained network was able to recognize background and seizure segments (not used in training) with a sensitivity of 90.2%, specificity of 96.8% and overall accuracy of 93.4%. The three seizure components (spike, ripple-on-spike, ripple-on-oscillation) were also observed to have unique CFC signatures. Conclusions: The results provide evidence both for (1) the relevance of power-to-power coupling (PPC) for TLE seizure detection in iEEG, as well as (2) there existing unique PPC signatures of three common seizure components.

">A theoretical mechanism for ocular emmetropization.</a></h4>

              
                Currently, the human myopia epidemic is estimated to affect nearly 3 billion persons, yet experimental refractive error research is still hampered by the lack of a plausible theoretical mechanism explaining how the eye detects defocus and grows to minimise error (emmetropization). Applied lens defocus, either positive or negative, to animals including human, induces rapid changes in both refraction and axial length. Such changes have been linked to the rate of transfer of fluid from the vitreous chamber across the Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE). However, the theoretical basis of sensing the sign of defocus still eludes, as does the physiological operationalisation of this defocus signal. We propose that the signal for the sign of defocus is contained within the pattern of temporal modulation of light on the retina during the myriad saccadic eye movements performed every minute. This pattern is generated by a combination of the ocular point spread function for the defocused eye, narrow cone photoreceptor acceptance of light and the modification of photoreceptor directionality by the retinal shear that accompanies saccadic eye movements. Thus, under conditions of defocus, performing a saccade across a simple visual grating produces an out of focus dynamic stimulus pattern on the retina which is sawtooth-like, the profile being dependent on the sign of defocus. Positive lens defocus induces a fast-OFF/slow-ON sawtooth-like luminance modulation transfer function, while negative lens defocus results in a fast-ON/slow-OFF temporal pattern. Such patterns produce relative incremental or decremental changes in the trans-epithelial electrical potential and consequent changes in fluid absorption across the RPE. Thus, rearing with positive lens defocus is associated with an increase in trans-epithelial potential, increasing trans-epithelial absorption and decreasing vitreous chamber size, while rearing with a negative lens decreases the trans-epithelial electrical potential and decreases RPE fluid absorption, increasing eyeball size. In both cases, retinal images become more in-focus, and the refractive error tends to zero. The resultant is emmetropization, modifying eyeball size in response to applied defocus in a stable negative feedback fashion.

">Sleep loss suppresses the motivation to prepare for sleep</a></h4>

              
                In the period preceding sleep, humans and other animals display a stereotyped repertoire of behaviors-including hygiene-related activities and preparing a place to sleep. Evidence suggests that this pre-sleep phase actively contributes to sleep initiation and quality. Nonetheless, individuals can sometimes fall asleep without preparation, even under undesirable circumstances. These abrupt transitions into sleep can have severe consequences, particularly in high-risk environments. Although progress has been made in identifying neuronal populations controlling sleep-wake states and mechanisms regulating cortical oscillations during sleep, little is known about the natural processes that govern the pre-sleep phase, under baseline conditions and following sleep loss. Here, we examine factors regulating pre-sleep behaviors using environmental and behavioral manipulations, video recordings, machine-learning-based tracking, and EEG-EMG analysis in freely-behaving mice. We focus on nest-building, a key pre-sleep behavior, and assess its modulation by time of day and sleep deprivation. We find that mice are highly motivated to build nests during the light phase but show reduced motivation during most of the dark phase. Sleep deprivation significantly suppresses pre-sleep nest-building and promotes the direct initiation of sleep. Varying amounts of sleep deprivation, from 2-6 hours, uniformly suppress nest-building. This suppression is not due to stress, as mice exposed to acute restraint stress engage robustly in nest-building. Our findings provide insight into processes regulating the transition from wakefulness to sleep. Understanding pre-sleep regulation has important implications for treating sleep-onset difficulties-prevalent in insomnia and predictive of cognitive decline, and for mitigating risks associated with uncontrolled sleep onset in high-stakes situations.

">FastACI: A Toolbox for Investigating Auditory Perception using Reverse Correlation</a></h4>

              
                The fastACI toolbox provides a compilation of tools for collecting and analyzing data from auditory reverse-correlation experiments. These experiments involve behavioral listening tasks including one or more target sounds presented with some random fluctuation, typically in the form of additive background noise. In turn, the paired stimulus-response data from each trial can be used to assess the relevant acoustic features that were effectively used by the listener while performing the task. The results are summarized as a matrix of perceptual weights termed auditory classification image (ACI). The framework provided by the toolbox is flexible and it has been so far used to probe different auditory mechanisms such as tone-in-noise detection, amplitude modulation detection, phoneme-in-noise categorization, and word segmentation. In this article, we present the structure of the toolbox, how it can be used to run existing experiments or design new ones, as well as the main options for analyzing the collected data. We then illustrate the capabilities of the toolbox through five case studies: a replication of a pioneering reverse correlation study from 1975, an example of reproduction of the analyses of one of our previous studies, a comparison of the results of three phoneme-categorization experiments, and a quantification of how noise type and estimation method affect the quality of the resulting auditory classification image.

">Molecular Subtyping Based on Hippocampal Cryptic Exon Burden Reveals Proteome-wide Changes Associated with TDP-43 Pathology across the Spectrum of LATE and Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                TDP-43 pathology is a defining feature of Limbic-Predominant Age-Related TDP-43 Encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC) and is frequently comorbid with Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC). However, the molecular consequences of co-occurring LATE-NC and ADNC pathology (TDP-43, {beta}-amyloid, and tau protein pathologies) remain unclear. Here, we conducted a comparative biochemical, molecular, and proteomic analysis of hippocampal tissue from 90 individuals spanning control, LATE-NC, ADNC, and ADNC+LATE-NC groups to assess the impact of cryptic exon (CE) inclusion, phosphorylated TDP-43 pathology (pTDP-43), and AD-related pathologies ({beta}-amyloid, and tau) on the proteome. ADNC+LATE-NC cases exhibited the highest burden of CE inclusion as quantified by measuring the levels of known TDP-43 regulated CEs within eight transcripts: STMN2, UNC13A, ELAVL3, KALRN, ARHGAP32, CAMK2B, PFKP, and SYT7. While CE levels correlated with pTDP-43 pathology, they were more strongly correlated with each other, suggesting that the molecular signature of CE inclusion may serve as a more sensitive measure of TDP-43 dysfunction than pTDP-43 pathology alone. Unbiased classification based on the relative abundance of these eight CEs stratified individual cases into low, intermediate, and high CE burden subtypes, largely independent of {beta}-amyloid and tau pathology. Proteome-wide correlation analysis revealed a bias toward reduced protein levels from genes harboring TDP-43-regulated CEs in cases with high cumulative CE burden. Notably, proteins significantly decreased under high CE burden included canonical STMN2, ELAVL3, and KALRN, as well as kinesin proteins that are genetically associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Co-expression network analysis identified both shared and distinct biological processes across CE subtypes and pathways associated with pTDP-43, tau, {beta}-amyloid pathologies, and CE accumulation in the hippocampus. Protein modules associated with TDP-43 loss of function were prioritized by integrating proteomic data from TDP-43 depleted human neurons with the hippocampal co-expression network. Specifically, we observed decreased endosomal vesicle, microtubule-binding, and synaptic modules, alongside an increase in RNA-binding modules. These results provide new insights into the proteomic impact of CE burden across the spectrum of LATE and AD pathological severity, highlighting the molecular consequences of TDP-43 dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease.

">γ-glutamyl-cysteine is a critical intermediate in glutathione-led amelioration of PFOS-neurotoxicity</a></h4>

              
                Per/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are used in a variety of industrial and consumer applications due to their distinctive properties. Nonetheless, these substances are ubiquitous and pose significant risks to the environment, wildlife, and human health. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), which was previously one of the most commonly utilized PFAS, has prolonged half-life in both humans and the environment. Despite the cessation of its production, PFOS remains one of the prevalent contaminants amongst PFAS. Recent research demonstrates that PFOS is relatively resistant to elimination from the human body and accumulates to a greater extent in older adults. PFOS has been shown to affect the nervous system and its functions, although the intricate mechanisms underlying its toxicity remain largely obscure. Earlier studies utilizing Caenorhabditis elegans indicated that dopaminergic neurons are particularly vulnerable to PFOS neurotoxicity, with glutathione (GSH) playing a role in mitigating neurodegeneration. Curiously, none of the antioxidant treatments evaluated, including N-acetyl-cysteine, produced favorable outcomes, despite N-acetyl-cysteine being a precursor to GSH. This study investigates the GSH synthesis pathway to elucidate critical mechanisms. We assessed the effects of GSH precursors and intermediates on PFOS neurotoxicity. The GSH precursors, cysteine, glutamate, and the combination of cysteine and glutamate did not demonstrate beneficial effects. However, the crucial GSH synthesis intermediate, {gamma}-glutamyl-cysteine, provided neuroprotection comparable to that of GSH. Notably, no changes were observed at the transcriptomic or proteomic levels of GSH synthesis enzymes in C. elegans and SH-SY5Y cells, respectively. This study effectively uncovers a novel mechanism that addresses existing knowledge gaps pertaining to PFOS neurotoxicity.

">Deciphering the combinatorial expression pattern and genetic regulatory mechanisms of Beats and Sides in the olfactory circuits of Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Over the past decades, many critical molecular players have been uncovered to control distinct steps in olfactory circuit assembly in Drosophila. Among these, multi-member gene families of cell surface proteins are of interest because they can act as neuron-specific identification/recognition tags in combinations and contribute to circuit assembly in complex brains through their heterophilic or homophilic interactions. Recently, a multi-protein interactome has been described between the Beat and Side families of IgSF proteins. Here, we use the publicly available single-cell RNA-seq datasets and newly generated gene trap transgenic driver lines to probe the in vivo spatial expression pattern of the beat/side gene families in odorant receptor neurons (ORNs) and their synaptic target projection neurons (PNs). Our results revealed that each ORN and its synaptic target PN class expresses a class-specific combination of beat/side genes, hierarchically regulated by lineage-specific genetic programs. Though ORNs or PNs from closer lineages tend to possess more similar beat/side profiles, we also found many examples of divergence from this pattern among closely related ORNs and closely related PNs. To explore whether the class-specific combination of beats/sides defines ORN-PN matching specificity, we perturbed presynaptic beat-IIa and postsynaptic side-IV in two ORN-PN partners. However, disruption of Beat-IIa-Side-IV interaction did not produce any significant mistargeting in these two examined glomeruli. Though without affecting general glomerular targeting, knockdown of side in ORNs leads to the reduction of synaptic development. Interestingly, we found conserved expression patterns of beat/side orthologs across ORNs in ants and mosquitoes, indicating the shared regulatory strategies specifying the expression of these duplicated paralogs in insect evolution. Overall, this comprehensive analysis of expression patterns lays a foundation for in-depth functional investigations into how Beat/Side combinatorial expression contributes to olfactory circuit assembly.

                Background This study explores the complex relationship between organizational politics, emotional intelligence and employee behavior in contemporary settings. Organizational politics, which is widespread in organizational settings, has a substantial impact on different aspects of employee behavior. Emotional Intelligence has become a vital factor in individuals’ capacity to successfully traverse the complexities of an organization. This study consolidates current material to offer insights into the impact of organizational politics on employee behavior and the mediating role of emotional intelligence in this connection. Methods A survey was undertaken with a sample size of 500 employees hailing from several Information Technology (IT) and Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES) firms in the Dehradun (Uttarakhand) region. The study employed quantitative methodologies to investigate the correlations between Emotional Intelligence, Perceived Organizational Politics and Employee Behavior. The data were evaluated using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) to examine the hypothesized correlations and mediation effects. Results The study identified substantial correlations between Emotional Intelligence, Perceived Organizational Politics, and Employee Behavior. Emotional Intelligence was discovered to have a positive impact on Behavioral Dynamics. Perceived Organizational Politics had a substantial influence on both Emotional Intelligence and Behavioral Dynamics. Factors such as Need for Power, Relationship Conflict, Resource Constraints, Role Conflict, and Workforce Diversity were discovered to have an impact on Perceived Organizational Politics. Conclusions The results confirm strong connections between organizational politics, emotional intelligence, and employee behavior, highlighting the significance of these concepts in comprehending employee behavior in organizational environments. The study proposes that enhancing employees' emotional intelligence can alleviate the adverse effects of organizational politics, resulting in enhanced behavioral dynamics. The study also addresses the limits, outlines potential areas for further research, and highlights the managerial implications. It suggests that firms should prioritize the development of emotional intelligence to cultivate a favorable work environment.

                Objective To develop and test the psychometric properties of the Thai version of the Impact and Burden of Care Scale for Caregivers of Persons with Schizophrenia and Co-occurring Methamphetamine Use (TIBSCSM). Methods This pilot study involved 142 caregivers of individuals with schizophrenia and methamphetamine use. Sample adequacy was assessed using the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) method, while Bartlett’s test evaluated the item correlation matrix. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to identify underlying factors. Results The 32-item TIBSCSM showed convergent validity correlations with two quality-of-life measures. The KMO value was 0.90, and Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity yielded χ2 = 5248.5, df = 496, p < 0.001. The Content Validity Index (CVI) was 1, indicating high internal consistency reliability (α = 0.90). EFA identified four constructs: physical function, self-esteem, role and social enjoyment, and relationship satisfaction. The model exhibited strong reliability and validity, with an average variance extracted (AVE) of 0.948 and composite reliability (CR) of 0.987, accounting for 64.90% of the variance. Conclusion The TIBSCSM scale provides valuable insights for psychiatric nurses and mental health teams to measure the impact and burden experienced by caregivers of individuals with schizophrenia and methamphetamine use. It is particularly useful for nursing, research, education, and clinical practice, especially in addressing the caregiver burdens exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Implication for nursing and research The TIBSCSM, developed in the Thai context, can facilitate studies evaluating variations in caregiver impact across different settings.

                The splenic localization of hydatid cysts is extremely rare. A 50-year-old obese female who consults with a painful and febrile syndrome of the right hypochondrium. Abdominal ultrasound and a CT scan computed tomography revealed a complete situs inversus, a mass of the right hypochondrium measuring 152 mm with membrane detachment, and infiltration of the surrounding fat, evoking a type II complicated splenic hydatic cyst. The patient was operated on in an emergency via midline laparotomy. Exploration revealed situs inversus, an angiant cyst of the spleen. Exposition of the splenic pedicle is difficult. The samples were then infected. Total splenectomy was performed. The postoperative period was unproblematic, and the patient was discharged with antibiotic and antiparasitic treatment and habitual vaccination.

                Introduction Traumatic spinal spondyloptosis, though rare, harbingers a high risk of mortality as well as permanent and disabling neurological deficits. They invariably become socially aloof and marginalized in most parts of our subcontinent owing to the lack of dedicated rehabilitation units amid their poor economic status. There is a paucity of studies pertaining to such rare epiphenomenon within our region. Materials ad Methods A retrospective study of 16 patients presenting with spinal spondyloptosis in a tertiary care center in Nepal was undertaken. The clinical records of the patients were retrieved from the hospital record section to study the demographic variables, modes of injury, American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grades, salient radiological characteristics, management strategies, and the resultant clinical outcomes. Result The mean age of the cohorts in our study was 40 years with an age range of 25-80 years. Most of the patients presented in ASIA ‘A’ neurological grade (75%). The cervical spine was involved in the majority (68.75%) of cases. 8 (50%) patients left against medical advice, 2 (12.5%) were managed conservatively, and 6 (37.5%) were operated. The posterior-only approach was undertaken in 4(66.67%) cases. Tracheo-oesophageal fistula occurred in 2 (33.33%) patients. And cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak occurred in 2 (33.33%) patients. The overall hospital mortality was 3(37.5%). Conclusion Traumatic spinal spondyloptosis on our center mostly involved cervical spine (68.75%). 75% of the patients presented with ASIA ‘A’ neurological grade. 50% of them left against medical advice. 37.5% were operated. The overall hospital mortality was 37.5%. This study emphasizes the implementation of a national spinal trauma data bank and the systematic implementation of dedicated neuro-rehabilitation units. This will thereby help improve the clinical outcome among these ‘socially aloof’ and marginalized subsets of neurosurgical patients.

                Introduction The increasing number of older people and their vulnerability to disaster and medication preparedness as the primary elements of disaster mitigation are necessary to reduce the impact of a disaster. Nevertheless, research on natural disasters and medication preparedness in the elderly population is still lacking. This review aimed to explore natural disaster and medication preparedness among elderly. Methods This review was guided by the Arksey & O’Malley methodological framework and reporting accordance to PRISMA-ScR. A scoping review was performed using the following four databases: Scopus, PubMed, Sage, and Google Scholar. Screening was conducted using the following criteria: articles written in English, open access, and published between 2020 and 2024. Articles must discuss natural disasters and medication preparedness for elderly. In the data search, we input several keywords that include “elderly,” “natural disaster,” “preparedness,” and “medication.” Snowballing was then conducted to find articles on preparedness interventions. Data extraction and analysis were then performed. Results There were 20 articles used in this review and the results highlight that elderly face unique challenges in disaster preparedness including, mobility limitation, restricted access to medication, communication barriers, limited social and social support. Tailored interventions such as disaster education and elderly-focused technology are crucial to improve preparedness and ensure their safety during emergencies. Conclusion The findings from this literature review are the majority of studies showing that most elderly people are not well prepared in facing disasters; however, through various programs that have been implemented by either the government or community, the elderly show more preparation when they encounter any natural disaster.

                Objectives To assess the use of electronic cigarettes among college students, health professionals, and young adults in eastern Saudi Arabia, and the integration of psychosocial and economic factors on its use. Methods An online survey consisting of four sections–demographics, knowledge, use, and factors influencing e-cigarette use–was distributed among a convenience sample of young adults. The survey was distributed via social media platforms using snowball sampling. SPSS was used to analyze the data at a 5% significance level. Results In total, 3017 participants responded to the survey. The majority of the participants were male (63%), had a college degree or higher (65.4%), and were younger than 25 years old (53%). Twenty-two percent of the study sample used e-cigarettes constantly, while 22% used it for the trial. The regression model found that females were more likely to use e-cigarettes than males (OR=1.39), but without significance (95% CI=0.87-2.23). Older participants were significantly more likely to use e-cigarettes than those who were younger than 25 years. Compared to nonsmokers, cigarette smokers and former smokers were significantly more likely to use e-cigarettes. The multidimensional impact of psycho-socio-economics found that economic status was not a significant factor, whereas psychological and social factors were inversely related to the use of e-cigarettes. Conclusion In the presence of all factors, the multidimensional influence of psychosocial factors is either less important or inversely related to e-cigarette use.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-549/v1?src=rss">The classification of walking and phases of gait using EEG: a scoping review protocol. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Brain computer interfaces (BCI) have potential to optimise rehabilitative robotic assisted gait training by ‘closing the loop’ between humans and robotic devices. However, there is a need to first develop classification systems that can recognise distinct gait phases (e.g. stance and swing phases) and walking from other motor activity, before entraining back to robotic devices in real time. No consensus exists on what electroencephalogram (EEG) data is helpful nor the optimal gait classification system. Therefore, this scoping review aims to map and synthesise current practices in gait classification using EEG providing a compendium of successful classification methods. Objective The objective of this scoping review is to collate and summarise the state-of-the art research relating to the use of EEG to classify walking against any other states and classify the different phases of gait in healthy individuals and/or those with a central neurological pathology. Methodology A scoping review will be conducted, adhering to the JBI methodology and the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews reporting guidelines. Searches will be conducted in electronic bases using a search strategy based on key concepts. Identified studies will be exported to Covidence software for screening by two independent reviewers. Articles will be screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria at title/abstract and full manuscript phases. Included studies will be limited to aforementioned populations. Included studies will collect and utilise EEG data to classify the walking state and/or gait phases. Studies analysing brain activity during gait by other means will be excluded. A data charting proforma will be developed to extract pertinent data. This will be presented in tabular form and by narrative analysis. Implication This scoping review will collate the current body of literature addressing gait classification using EEG, mapping current practices and providing a compendium of classification systems developed to date.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) following tibial fractures can lead to permanent neuromuscular dysfunction and limb amputation if not rapidly diagnosed and treated a correct manner. The risk factors for ACS development in detailed classified manner remain limited, and the management strategies to minimize risk are controversial. We conducted this meta-analysis to quantify ACS risk factors and evaluate the impact of treatment modalities on ACS incidence in tibial fractures. Methods We searched multiple literature scientific databases up to 17th of April 2025. Primary studies that investigated ACS risk factors in tibial fractures were included. We conducted random and fixed-effects meta-analyses, subgroup analyses, and meta-regression to estimate the risk factors and treatment effects. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results Seventeen studies with total of 274,962 patients and 10,019 ACS cases met our inclusion criteria. Delayed fixation after 24 hours was associated with 67% reduced ACS risk (OR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.19-0.58) compared to early fixation, with strongest effects in young males with plateau fractures. Proximal tibial fractures demonstrated significantly higher risk than shaft or distal fractures (OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.53-2.66). Male patients had higher risk with two to four folds across age groups. External fixation showed protective effects versus immediate internal fixation, especially for plateau fractures (OR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.27-0.79). Meta-regression identified fracture type, injury mechanism, and patient demographics explaining 67% of treatment effect variance. Conclusion Our study results are going in an opposite direction to the standard approach of early fixation for tibial fractures, suggesting that delayed fixation or temporary spanning external fixation may significantly reduce ACS risk in high-risk patients. A patient tailored risk-stratified treatment algorithm considering fracture location, patient demographics, and injury mechanism could optimize management according to individual profile to reduce the risk of ACS development furtherly.

                While robust tools exist for the analysis of single-cell datasets in both Python and R, interoperability is limited, and analysis tools generally only accept one object class. Considerable programming expertise is required to integrate tools across package ecosystems into a comprehensive analysis, due to their differing languages and internal data structures. This complicates validation of results and leads to inconsistent visualizations between analysis suites. Conversion between object formats is the most common solution, but this is difficult and error-prone due to the rapid pace of development of the analysis suites and their underlying data structures. To address this, we created SCUBA (Single-Cell Unified Backend API), an R package that implements a unified data access API for all common R and Python single-cell object formats. SCUBA extends the data access approach from the widely used Seurat package to SingleCellExperiment and anndata objects. SCUBA also implements new data-specific access functions for all supported object types. Performance scales well across all SCUBA-supported formats. In addition to performance, SCUBA offers several advantages over object conversion for the visualization and further analysis of pre-processed single-cell data. First, SCUBA extracts only data required for the operation at hand, leaving the original object unmodified. This process is simpler, less error prone, and less memory intensive than object conversion, which operates on the entire dataset. Second, code written with SCUBA can use any supported object class as input, with simple and consistent syntax across object formats. This allows a single analysis script or package (like our interactive single-cell browser, scExploreR) to work seamlessly with multiple object types, reducing the complexity of the code and improving both readability and reproducibility. Adoption of SCUBA will ultimately improve collaboration and reproducible research in single-cell analysis by lowering the barriers between package ecosystems.

                <p>by Siyu Chen, Sudhir Venkatesan, Sofie Arnetorp, Klas Bergenheim, Sabada Dube, Wilhelmine Meeraus, Cátia Ferreira, Sylvia Taylor, Lisa J. White</p>

Many immunocompromised individuals mount inadequate immune responses following COVID-19 vaccination, thus relying on other social distancing behaviours, particularly shielding, for protection, impacting their quality of life. However, little is known about historical/current levels and effectiveness of shielding or factors influencing individuals’ decision to continue shielding. Long-acting antibody pre-exposure prophylaxis (LAAB-PrEP) provides direct protection against COVID-19 in immunocompromised individuals who have been and may continue to shield. However, the proportion and incidence of circulating variants for which LAAB-PrEP would be effective is unpredictable. Given this uncertain behavioural and immuno-epidemiological context, we developed a modelling framework to explore features that most impact health outcomes and cost effectiveness of long-term administration of LAAB-PrEP against COVID-19 infection in immunocompromised individuals in the English context. The model predicted that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of LAAB-PrEP against COVID-19 in immunocompromised individuals will be largely driven by features of utility of shielding, current/future shielding behaviour, cost of shielding, risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation among immunocompromised individuals and the time horizon used for the cost-effectiveness analysis. The model estimated that for realistic ranges of influential factors, it is possible for LAAB-PrEP to be cost effective under the conditions that most immunocompromised individuals would shield indefinitely if it were not available but would switch to LAAB-PrEP if it were. Thus, if individuals stop shielding when taking LAAB-PrEP, then LAAB-PrEP is cost effective.

                <p>by Yujia Wen, Zhixue He, Chen Shen, Jun Tanimoto</p>

Indirect punishment traditionally sustains cooperation in social systems through reputation or norms, often by reducing defectors’ payoffs indirectly. In this study, we redefine indirect punishment for structured populations as a spatially explicit mechanism, where individuals on a square lattice target second-order defectors—those harming their neighbors—rather than their own immediate defectors, guided by the principle: “I help you by punishing those who defect against you”. Using evolutionary simulations, we compare this adapted indirect punishment to direct punishment, where individuals punish immediate defectors. Results show that within a narrow range of low punishment costs and fines, adapted indirect punishment outperforms direct punishment in promoting cooperation. However, outside this cost-fine region, outcomes vary: direct punishment may excel, both may be equally effective, or neither improves cooperation, depending on the parameter values. These findings hold even when network reciprocity alone does not support cooperation. Notably, when adapted indirect punishment outperforms direct punishment in promoting cooperation, defectors face stricter penalties without appreciably increasing punishers’ costs, making it more efficient than direct punishment. Overall, our findings provide insights into the role of indirect punishment in structured populations and highlight its importance in understanding the evolution of cooperation.

In order to maintain genomic integrity, DNA replication must be highly coordinated. Disruptions in this process can cause replication stress which is aberrant in many pathologies including cancer. Despite this, little is known about the mechanisms governing the temporal regulation of DNA replication initiation, thought to be related to the limited copy number of firing factors. Here, we present a high (1-kilobase) resolution stochastic model of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> whole-genome replication in which origins compete to associate with limited firing factors. After developing an algorithm to fit this model to replication timing data, we validated the model by reproducing experimental inter-origin distances, origin efficiencies, and replication fork directionality. This suggests the model accurately simulates the aspects of DNA replication most important for determining its dynamics. We also use the model to predict measures of DNA replication dynamics which are yet to be determined experimentally and investigate the potential impacts of variations in firing factor concentrations on DNA replication.

A crucial aspect of auditory perception is the ability to use sound cues to predict future events and to time actions accordingly. For example, the sound of an approaching vehicle signals when it is safe to cross the street; distinct smartphone notification sounds reflect a call that needs to be answered within a few seconds, or a text that can be read later. Other animals similarly use sounds to plan, time and execute behaviors such as hunting, evading predation and tending to offspring. However, the neural mechanisms that underlie sound-guided prediction of upcoming salient event timing are not well understood. To address this gap, we employed an appetitive sound-triggered reward time prediction behavior in head-fixed mice. We find that mice trained on this task reliably estimate the time from a sound cue to upcoming reward on the scale of a few seconds, as demonstrated by learning-dependent well-timed increases in predictive licking for reward. Moreover, mice showed a dramatic impairment in their ability to use sound to predict delayed reward when the auditory cortex was inactivated, demonstrating its causal involvement. To identify the neurophysiological signatures of auditory cortical reward-timing prediction, we recorded local field potentials during learning and performance of this behavior and found that the magnitude of auditory cortical responses to the sound prospectively encoded the duration of the anticipated sound-reward time interval. Next, we explored how and where these sound-triggered time interval prediction signals propagate from the auditory cortex to time and initiate consequent action. We targeted the monosynaptic projections from the auditory cortex to the posterior striatum and found that chemogenetic inactivation of these projections impaired animals’ ability to predict sound-triggered delayed reward. Simultaneous neural recordings in the auditory cortex and posterior striatum during task performance revealed coordination of neural activity across these regions during the sound cue predicting the time interval to reward. Collectively, our findings identify an auditory cortical-striatal circuit supporting sound-triggered timing-prediction behaviors.

                Background Breast cancer in elderly patients, particularly in centenarians, presents unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Encapsulated papillary carcinoma (EPC) is a rare subtype that typically exhibits indolent behavior, but its aggressive course remains poorly understood. This report describes an exceptional case of EPC in a 102-year-old woman with a rapid metastatic progression. Case Presentation A 102-year-old female with hypertension presented with a one-year history of a progressively enlarging, left-sided breast mass. Imaging revealed a 28 cm cystic mass with a 14 cm intracystic nodule. Biopsy confirmed ER-positive, PR-negative, HER2-negative encapsulated papillary carcinoma (T3N0M0). Mastectomy with axillary dissection revealed a 13 cm tumor with close surgical margins (<0.5 mm). The final histologic examination concluded to a pure EPC. Three months postoperatively, metastatic lesions in the sternum and liver were identified. Despite initiating letrozole and CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy, the patient succumbed to cardiac arrest. Conclusion The case of a 102-year-old female with EPC of the breast illustrates several unique and clinically significant features, including the rarity of metastasis, exceptional tumor size, and implications of advanced age on the disease course and management. This case study in accordance with the CARE guidelines.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Schwann cells (SCs) are required for supporting axons, forming myelin, and facilitating repair through remyelination after injury in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Processes of differentiation, myelination, and remyelination of SCs are tightly modulated by a complex network of transcription factors and coregulators, including Sox10, Oct6/Pou3f1, Krox20/Egr2, Nab1/2, YY1, COUP-TFII/NR2F2, YAP/TAZ-TEAD1, c-Jun, Sox2, Zeb2, and Etv1/Er81. These factors can regulate the expression of essential target genes such as <i>Mpz</i> and <i>Mbp</i> in SC myelination and repair. Genetic mutations or dysregulation within this network can lead to peripheral neuropathies such as Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease. However, the transcriptional regulatory network of differentiation, myelination, and remyelination of SCs has not been fully understood yet. Thus, this review briefly introduces processes of differentiation, myelination, and remyelination of SCs and explores the role and molecular mechanisms of each transcription factor and coregulator in differentiation and myelination of SCs and their remyelination following nerve injury. Clinical implications for peripheral neuropathies associated with specific gene mutations and variations of transcription factors and coregulators affecting SC biology are also discussed.</p>

                Border ownership (BOS) neurons signal which side of a border is foreground. Franken and Reynolds identify grouping in V4—fast, persistent centripetal ownership preference—which could underlie BOS signals through feedback. Grouping survives stimulus interruption and emerges de novo after saccades; thus, it may provide continuity in scene segmentation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94502">Post-fertilization transcription initiation in an ancestral LTR retrotransposon drives lineage-specific genomic imprinting of ZDBF2</a></h4>

              
                The imprinted gene <i>ZDBF2</i> is regulated through a unique mechanism involving a transient paternal transcript in early embryos, rather than persistent gametic DNA methylation. In humans and mice, this transcript—<i>CMKLR2-AS</i> (also known as <i>GPR1-AS</i>) or the long isoform of <i>Zdbf2</i> (<i>Liz/Zdbf2linc/Platr12</i>)—arises from the unmethylated paternal allele and initiates secondary epigenetic marks that maintain <i>ZDBF2</i> expression. Here, we investigate the evolutionary origin of this mechanism, and show that the first exon of human <i>GPR1-AS</i> overlaps with a MER21C long terminal repeat (LTR), a retrotransposon subfamily specific to Boreoeutherian mammals. Comparative analyses revealed that this MER21C insertion occurred in the common ancestor of Euarchontoglires, including primates, rodents, and rabbits. Although not annotated, the first exon of mouse <i>Liz</i> displays conserved features with the MER21C-overlapping exon in humans. In rabbit and nonhuman primate placentas, <i>GPR1-AS</i> orthologs with LTR-embedded first exons were also identified. In contrast, in non-Euarchontoglire mammals such as cow and tammar wallaby, <i>ZDBF2</i> is biallelically expressed, suggesting absence of imprinting. These findings suggest that <i>ZDBF2</i> imprinting emerged in Euarchontoglires via MER21C insertion. Together with our prior work on LTR-driven imprinting in oocytes, our findings demonstrate that post-fertilization activation of retrotransposons can also drive lineage-specific acquisition of imprinting.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101579">Image-based identification and isolation of micronucleated cells to dissect cellular consequences</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in isolating cells based on visual phenotypes have transformed our ability to identify the mechanisms and consequences of complex traits. Micronucleus (MN) formation is a frequent outcome of genome instability, triggers extensive changes in genome structure and signaling coincident with MN rupture, and is almost exclusively defined by visual analysis. Automated MN detection in microscopy images has proved challenging, limiting discovery of the mechanisms and consequences of MN. In this study we describe two new MN segmentation modules: a rapid model for classifying micronucleated cells and their rupture status (VCS MN), and a robust model for accurate MN segmentation (MNFinder) from a broad range of cell lines. As proof-of-concept, we define the transcriptome of non-transformed human cells with intact or ruptured MN after chromosome missegregation by combining VCS MN with photoactivation-based cell isolation and RNASeq. Surprisingly, we find that neither MN formation nor rupture triggers a strong unique transcriptional response. Instead, transcriptional changes appear correlated with small increases in aneuploidy in these cell classes. Our MN segmentation modules overcome a significant challenge with reproducible MN quantification, and, joined with visual cell sorting, enable the application of powerful functional genomics assays to a wide-range of questions in MN biology.

                Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive malignancy with limited tools to predict recurrence and drug sensitivity, exhibits ferroptotic heterogeneity across subtypes. However, the tumor microenvironment (TME) mediated by ferroptosis-related genes remains poorly characterized. This study integrates single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing data from the Gene Expression Omnibus to elucidate ferroptosis-driven TME features in TNBC, employing machine learning to develop prognostic and therapeutic response prediction models. At the single-cell level, T cells were classified into three subpopulations and macrophages into two subpopulations, with their infiltration degrees significantly correlated with clinical outcomes. A risk score model constructed based on these findings demonstrated robust predictive performance, validated in external cohorts with 3-, 4-, and 5-year area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.65, 0.67, and 0.71, respectively. Notably, high-risk patients exhibited enhanced sensitivity to 27 therapeutic agents. By delineating ferroptosis-associated immune heterogeneity, this work provides a risk stratification tool to enhance prognostic precision and therapeutic decision-making in TNBC, while identifying genes offer actionable targets for TNBC precision medicine.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93267">Daptomycin forms a stable complex with phosphatidylglycerol for selective uptake to bacterial membrane</a></h4>

              
                Daptomycin is a potent lipopeptide antibiotic used in the treatment of life-threatening Gram-positive infections, but the molecular mechanism of its interaction with bacterial membrane remains unclear. Here, we show that this interaction is divided into two stages, of which the first is a fast and reversible binding of the drug to phospholipid membrane in milliseconds, and the second is a slow and irreversible insertion into membrane in minutes, only in the presence of the bacteria-specific lipid phosphatidylglycerol, to a saturating point where the ratio of the drug to phosphatidylglycerol is 1:2. Fluorescence-based titration showed that the antibiotic simultaneously binds two molecules of phosphatidylglycerol with a nanomolar binding affinity in the presence of calcium ion. The resulting stable complex is easily formed in a test tube and readily isolated from the membrane of drug-treated bacterial cells, strongly supporting a unique drug uptake mechanism in which daptomycin forms a stable multicomponent complex with calcium and phosphatidylglycerol. Revelation of this novel uptake mechanism provides fresh insights into the mode of action of daptomycin and paves the way to new strategies to attenuate resistance to the drug.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102911">Otoacoustic emissions but not behavioral measurements predict cochlear nerve frequency tuning in an avian vocal communication specialist</a></h4>

              
                Frequency analysis by the cochlea forms a key foundation for all subsequent auditory processing. Stimulus-frequency otoacoustic emissions (SFOAEs) are a potentially powerful alternative to traditional behavioral experiments for estimating cochlear tuning without invasive testing, as is necessary in humans. Which methods accurately predict cochlear tuning remains controversial due to only a single animal study comparing SFOAE-based, behavioral, and cochlear frequency tuning in the same species. The budgerigar (<i>Melopsittacus undulatus</i>) is a parakeet species with human-like behavioral sensitivity to many sounds and the capacity to mimic speech. Intriguingly, previous studies of critical bands, psychophysical tuning curves, and critical ratios in budgerigars show that behavioral tuning sharpness increases dramatically with increasing frequency from 1 to 3.5 kHz, doubling once per octave with peak tuning sharpness from 3.5 to 4 kHz. The pattern contrasts with slower monotonic growth of behavioral tuning sharpness with increasing frequency in other animals, including most avian species, suggesting a possible auditory specialization in budgerigars. We measured SFOAE-based and cochlear-afferent tuning in budgerigars, for comparison to previously reported behavioral results. SFOAE-based and cochlear-afferent tuning sharpness both increased monotonically and relatively slowly for higher frequencies, in contrast to the behavioral pattern. SFOAE-based tuning in budgerigars accurately predicted cochlear frequency tuning, and both measures aligned with typical patterns of cochlear tuning in other species. Divergent behavioral tuning in budgerigars is unlikely attributable to the periphery and could reflect specializations for central processing of masked signals. Our findings highlight the value of SFOAEs for estimating cochlear tuning and caution against direct inference of peripheral tuning from behavioral critical bands, psychophysical tuning curves, and critical ratios.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97846">Chemogenetic stimulation of phrenic motor output and diaphragm activity</a></h4>

              
                Impaired respiratory motor output contributes to morbidity and mortality in many neurodegenerative diseases and neurologic injuries. We investigated if expressing designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) in the mid-cervical spinal cord could effectively stimulate phrenic motor output to increase diaphragm activation. Two primary questions were addressed: (1) does effective DREADD-mediated diaphragm activation require focal expression in phrenic motoneurons (vs. non-specific mid-cervical expression), and (2) can this method produce a sustained increase in inspiratory tidal volume? Wild-type (C57Bl/6) and ChAT-Cre mice received bilateral intraspinal (C4) injections of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding the hM3D(Gq) excitatory DREADD. In wild-type mice, this produced non-specific DREADD expression throughout the mid-cervical ventral horn. In ChAT-Cre mice, a Cre-dependent viral construct was used to drive neuronal DREADD expression in the C4 ventral horns, targeting phrenic motoneurons. Diaphragm electromyograms (EMG) were recorded in isoflurane-anesthetized spontaneously breathing mice at 4–9 weeks post-AAV delivery. The DREADD ligand JHU37160 (J60) caused a bilateral, sustained (&gt;1 hr) increase in inspiratory EMG bursting in both groups; the relative increase was greater in ChAT-Cre mice. Additional experiments in ChAT-Cre rats were conducted to determine if spinal DREADD activation could increase inspiratory tidal volume during spontaneous breathing, assessed using whole-body plethysmography without anesthesia. Three to four months after intraspinal (C4) injection of AAV driving Cre-dependent hM3D(Gq) expression, intravenous J60 resulted in a sustained (&gt;30 min) increase in tidal volume. Subsequently, phrenic nerve recordings performed under urethane anesthesia confirmed that J60 evoked a &gt;200% increase in inspiratory output. We conclude that targeting mid-cervical spinal DREADD expression to the phrenic motoneuron pool enables ligand-induced, sustained increases in phrenic motor output and tidal volume. Further development of this technology may enable application to clinical conditions associated with impaired diaphragm activation and hypoventilation.

<p>In this study, we found that astrocyte-specific HSP60 knockout in male mice led to mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence, disrupting neurotransmitter receptor expression and synaptic proteins, impairing neuroregeneration. Urolithin A and S1P inhibitor PF429242 alleviated these effects, highlighting HSP60's role in CNS health and potential therapeutic targets.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Heat Shock Protein 60 (HSP60) plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function in astrocytes and has a significant impact on central nervous system (CNS) health. However, how HSP60 regulates the mitochondrial function of astrocytes to inhibit neuroregeneration remains unknown. In this study, we generated astrocyte-specific HSP60 knockout male mice to investigate the consequences of HSP60 deficiency. Firstly, our results confirmed that HSP60 deficiency caused abnormal expression of mitochondrial function-related genes, causing significant mitochondrial dysfunction, which triggered cellular senescence in astrocytes. Moreover, the alterations of 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HT2AR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 2A (NR2A) expression suggested a disruption in neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. Additionally, the increased levels of site-1 protease (S1P), truncated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (truncated-BDNF), and synaptophysin indicate synaptic structural and functional impairments. Expectedly, our findings demonstrated mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence in astrocytes, leading to altered expression of neurotransmitter receptors in the cortex, as well as reduced neuronal numbers and neurotransmitter levels in the hippocampus after the deletion of HSP60 in astrocytes of the male mice. Notably, Urolithin A (UA) and the S1P inhibitor, PF429242, were found to alleviate astrocyte senescence and promote neuronal regeneration by inhibiting truncated BDNF expression. In conclusion, our study revealed that HSP60 deficiency in astrocytes induces mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence via the S1P/truncated-BDNF pathway, resulting in disrupted neurotransmitter receptor expression, synaptic protein alterations, and impaired neuroregeneration. These insights underscored the importance of HSP60 in CNS health and provided promising avenues for developing treatments for neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

                Immune pathways and cell types that protect against neurodegenerative processes with aging remain poorly understood. Sulka et al. demonstrate that the innate immune adaptor, STING, provides essential protection against blood-brain barrier breaches and neuromotor deficits during physiological aging. Furthermore, microglial STING is sufficient to protect against these aspects of age-associated decline.

                Background Flooding is one of the most frequent and damaging disasters in Malaysia with major social, economic, and psychological consequences. Compared to material and logistical preparedness, the psychological aspects of disaster management are not given much emphasis. Methods This conceptual paper employs a systematic literature review to understand the factors that predict Malaysians psychological preparedness for floods. The literature search was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Academic Search Ultimate, Directory of Open Access Journals, Supplemental Index and Google Scholar with keywords including “disaster preparedness, flood, natural disaster and psychological preparedness”. Articles were included if they focused on preparedness towards disasters as well as examined coping mechanisms, perceptions and preparedness behaviours in the context of flood-related crises and excluded if they lack methodological rigor. The review synthesized findings using a thematic analysis approach, identifying psychological resilience and coping strategies in flood-affected populations, the role of social support networks in preparedness and recovery as well as mental health implications of floods, including anxiety, trauma, and post-disaster recovery. This synthesis informed the development of a conceptual model to address factors that predict Malaysians psychological preparedness for floods. According to contemporary theories of catastrophe risk reduction and psychological resilience, critical variables included are risk perception, outcome expectancy, self-efficacy, anxiety, and social support. Results It was proposed that these factors work together to determine an individual’s psychological preparedness, enhancing their ability to cope with the psychological and emotional strain of a flood disaster. Conclusions By offering these perspectives, the study contributes to the limited academic discussion on psychological preparedness in Malaysia, which aims to improve the psychological resilience of communities vulnerable to flooding. The proposed framework emphasizes the importance of incorporating psychological preparedness into existing disaster management strategies to reduce the overall damage caused by floods.

                Alternative splicing is crucial in gene regulation, with significant implications in clinical settings and biotechnology. This review article compiles bioinformatics short-read RNA-seq tools for investigating differential splicing; offering a detailed examination of their statistical methods, case applications, and benefits. A total of 22 tools are categorised by their statistical family (parametric, non-parametric, and probabilistic) and level of analysis (transcript, exon, and event). The central challenges in quantifying alternative splicing include correct splice site identification and accurate isoform deconvolution of transcripts. Benchmarking studies show no consensus on tool performance, revealing considerable variability across different scenarios. Tools with high citation frequency and continued developer maintenance, such as DEXSeq and rMATS, are recommended for prospective researchers. To aid in tool selection, a guide schematic is proposed based on variations in data input and the required level of analysis. Emerging long-read RNA sequencing technologies are discussed as a complement to short-read methods, promising reduced deconvolution needs and further innovation.

                Background Human males and females show differences in the incidence of neutrophil-associated diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis, and differences in neutrophil physiological responses such as responses to infection, tissue damage, and chemotactic factors. However, little is known about the basis of sex-based differences in human neutrophils. Methods Starting with human neutrophils from healthy donors, we used RNA-seq to examine total RNA profiles, RNAs not associated with ribosomes and thus not being translated, RNAs in monosomes, and RNAs in polysomes and thus heavily translated. Results There were sex-based differences in the levels of RNAs across free RNA, monosome, and polysome fractions. Male neutrophils had increased levels of mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins in the free RNA fractions, indicating low levels of translation. The polysomes of male neutrophils were enriched for mRNAs encoding cytoskeletal organization, cell motility, and cell activation. The polysomes of female neutrophils were enriched for mRNAs associated the regulation of metabolic processes, cytokine responses, and mitochondrial proteins. Conclusions These data indicate that male and female neutrophils have different expression patterns and different translation efficiency of some mRNAs. This may contribute to the observed sex-based differences in neutrophil behavior and neutrophil-associated disease incidence and severity.

                <p>by Inmaculada Villanueva-Baxarias, Anna Pellisé-Tintoré, María Pérez-Rodríguez, Laura Nogué, Pooja Vaziraani, Iris Soveral, Fàtima Crispi, Olga Gómez, Patricia Garcia-Canadilla, Oscar Camara, Bart Bijnens, Gabriel Bernardino</p>

Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is a common congenital heart defect characterized by aortic narrowing. Prenatally, it has mild hemodynamic effects as right ventricular disproportion and ductus arteriosus (DA) dilation occur as adaptive mechanisms, but their impact on CoA hemodynamics remains poorly understood. To investigate this, we built a closed 0D computational model of fetal circulation and simulated different CoA cardiovascular remodeling patterns, including aortic isthmus (AoI) narrowing, ventricular disproportion, and DA dilation. Our results showed mild AoI narrowing (80% of reference diameter) required up to 1.7 right/left ventricular end-diastolic volume ratio and 115% DA dilation to maintain physiological pressures, wall shear stresses, and organ perfusion. In contrast, severe narrowing (20% of reference AoI diameter) required up to 5 right/left ventricular end-diastolic volume ratio and 125% DA dilation, highlighting the necessity of co-occurrence of prenatal ventricular disproportion and DA dilation to compensate for AoI narrowing. These physiological regions were validated with ultrasonographic measurements from 7 controls and 9 CoA patients. We compared blood pressures, velocities, and volumetric flow rates across different fetoplacental anatomical sites. AoI velocity showed a delayed retrograde flow peak and increased antegrade diastolic velocity with greater AoI narrowing, which may aid in diagnosing CoA. Minimal differences were observed in other velocities and pressures. Volumetric flow rates across varying degrees of AoI narrowing decreased in the AoI and mitral and aortic valves, remained stable in the middle cerebral and umbilical arteries, and increased in the DA and tricuspid and pulmonary valves. Therefore, we corroborated that in fetal CoA a redistribution of blood flow occurs to ensure perfusion of the brain and placenta, without a significant alteration in fetal hemodynamics (blood pressure and velocities) except for increased diastolic velocities in the AoI.

                <p>by Katharina Waury, Stefan Lelieveld, Sanne Abeln, Henk-Jan van den Ham</p>

Repertoire sequencing allows us to investigate the antibody-mediated immune response. The clustering of sequences is a crucial step in the data analysis pipeline, aiding in the identification of functionally related antibodies. The conventional clustering approach of clonotyping relies on sequence information, particularly CDRH3 sequence identity and V/J gene usage, to group sequences into clonotypes. It has been suggested that the limitations of sequence-based approaches to identify sequence-dissimilar but functionally converged antibodies can be overcome by using structure information to group antibodies. Recent advances have made structure-based methods feasible on a repertoire level. However, so far, their performance has only been evaluated on single-antigen sets of antibodies. A comprehensive comparison of the benefits and limitations of structure-based tools on realistic and diverse repertoire data is missing. Here, we aim to explore the promise of structure-based clustering algorithms to replace or augment the standard sequence-based approach, specifically by identifying low-sequence identity groups. Two methods, SAAB+ and SPACE2, are evaluated against clonotyping. We curated a dataset of well-annotated pairs of antibodies that show high overlap in epitope residues and thus bind the same region within their respective antigen. This set of antibodies was introduced into a simulated repertoire to compare the performance of clustering approaches on a diverse antibody set. Our analysis reveals that structure-based methods do group more antibodies together compared to clonotyping. However, it also highlights the limitations associated with the need for same-length CDR regions by SPACE2. This work thoroughly compares the utility of different clustering methods and provides insights into what further steps are required to effectively use antibody structural information to group immune repertoire data.

Bacteria encode a wide range of antiphage systems and a subset of these proteins are homologous to components of the human innate immune system. Mammalian nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat containing proteins (NLRs) and bacterial NLR-related proteins use a central NACHT domain to link detection of infection with initiation of an antimicrobial response. Bacterial NACHT proteins provide defense against both DNA and RNA phages. Here we investigate the mechanism of phage detection by the bacterial NLR-related protein bNACHT25 in <i>E. coli</i>. bNACHT25 was specifically activated by <i>Emesvirus</i> ssRNA phages and analysis of MS2 phage escaper mutants that evaded detection revealed a critical role for Coat Protein (CP). A genetic assay showed CP was sufficient to activate bNACHT25 but the two proteins did not directly interact. Instead, we found bNACHT25 requires the host chaperone DnaJ to detect CP and protect against phage. Our data support a model in which bNACHT25 detects a wide range of phages using an indirect mechanism that may involve guarding a host cell process rather than binding a specific phage-derived molecule.

Malaria parasites survive in human erythrocytes by importing and digesting hemoglobin within a specialized organelle, the digestive vacuole (DV). Although chloroquine and other antimalarials act within the DV, the routes used by drugs, ions, and amino acids to cross the DV membrane remain poorly understood. Here, we used single DV patch-clamp to identify a novel large conductance anion channel as the primary conductive pathway on this organelle in <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, the most virulent human pathogen. This Big Vacuolar Anion Channel (BVAC) is primarily open at the DV resting membrane potential and undergoes complex voltage-dependent gating. Ion substitution experiments implicate promiscuous anion flux with Cl<sup>−</sup> being the primary charged substrate under physiological conditions. Conductance and gating are unaffected by antimalarials targeting essential DV activities and are conserved on parasites with divergent drug susceptibility profiles, implicating an unexploited antimalarial target. A conditional knockdown strategy excluded links to PfCRT and PfMDR1, two drug-resistance transporters with poorly defined transport activities. We propose that BVAC functions to maintain electroneutrality during H<sup>+</sup> uptake, allowing DV acidification and efficient hemoglobin digestion. The channel also facilitates amino acid salvage, providing essential building blocks for parasite growth. Direct transport measurements at the DV membrane provide foundational insights into vacuolar physiology, should help clarify antimalarial action and drug resistance, and will guide therapy development against the parasite’s metabolic powerhouse.

                Background The management of organic waste generated in municipal marketplaces has gained increasing prominence over the last two decades due to its critical impact on urban sustainability, public health, and the environment. This study provides a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of research trends in this area, based on 260 publications indexed in Scopus between 2000 and 2023. Methods This study employed a comprehensive bibliometric method using both quantitative and network analysis approaches. Publications were retrieved from Scopus database using a structured search equation incorporating keywords related to organic waste, municipal marketplaces, and waste management strategies. The final dataset included 260 publications spanning from 2000 to 2023, including original research articles, systematic reviews, book chapters, and conference proceedings. Data were processed using Bibliometrix R-package for productivity metrics (annual scientific output, author productivity, journal impact) and VOSviewer for visualization of bibliographic networks. Co-authorship patterns were analyzed at both author and country levels to find collaboration structures. Keyword co-occurrence analysis was conducted to map thematic clusters and research trends. Additionally, a strategic diagram was constructed to categorize research themes based on relevance to the field and degree of development. Results The findings show a notable surge in publications since 2016, driven by circular economic policies, climate change mitigation efforts, and the demand for sustainable urban solutions. Key authors include Zurbrügg, Tilley, Mpanang’ombe, and Zhang, with significant contributions to composting technologies, waste valorization, and bioenergy solutions. Leading journals such as Journal of Cleaner Production (Q1, IF 2023: 9.7), Sustainability (Switzerland) (Q2, IF 2023: 3.3), and Biocycle (Q4, IF 2023: 0.02) have been pivotal in disseminating interdisciplinary research. Conclusions This analysis reveals a global collaborative effort to optimize organic waste management but identifies persistent challenges, including limited integration in developing regions and fragmented co-authorship networks. The study highlights the need for interdisciplinary approaches and fair knowledge transfer to develop scalable, context-specific solutions that enhance urban sustainability.

[version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Academic stress is a significant factor affecting students’ psychological well-being, particularly in higher education. Understanding the mediating roles of social support and self-efficacy can provide insights into how these factors influence students’ psychological well-being in public and private universities. Methods The study examined the mediating roles of social support and self-efficacy in the relationship between academic stress and psychological well-being among university students in Mogadishu, Somalia. Utilizing a stratified sampling technique, data were collected from 663 students across public (52.6%) and private (47.4%) universities through a structured questionnaire and analyzed using path analysis to assess direct and indirect effects. Structural equation modeling technique was used for data analysis. Results The analysis revealed a significant direct effect of academic stress on psychological well-being (β = 0.087, p = 0.001). Social support was significantly related to Academic stress (β = 0.117, p = 0.031) and self-efficacy (β =0.088, p = 0.021). However, both social support (β = 0.099, p = 0.000) and self-efficacy (β = 0.646, p = 0.000) were significantly related to psychological well-being. The mediating analysis showed that social support partially mediated the relationship between academic stress and psychological well-being (Indirect effect = 0.012, CI [0.002, 0.024], p = 0.000), while self-efficacy did not mediate this relationship (Indirect effect = 0.057, CI [0.006, 0.111], p = 0.068). Conclusions The findings suggest a significant positive impact of academic stress on psychological well-being, while social support partially mediates this relationship, highlighting its buffering role. Conversely, self-efficacy, although positively contributing to psychological well-being, does not mediate the effect of academic stress. These results underscore the importance of robust social support systems and targeted interventions to enhance students’ coping mechanisms and overall psychological well-being. Study limitations and implication are discussed.

                Purpose Malaria remains a public health problem in Niger, especially among children under the age of five. To combat this scourge, since 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), a strategy based on the administration of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine (SP-AQ) during the period of high transmission. This systematic review assesses the coverage, efficacy, and challenges of SMC in Niger between 2013 and 2022, analyzing its impact on malaria morbidity and mortality. Materials and methods The PRISMA guidelines were used to ensure a rigorous and comprehensive recording of the systematic review process. Through searches in five different databases, articles were imported into Zotero software, then transferred to the Covidence application, where data processing was carried out. The selected articles were independently evaluated by two reviewers. These included studies that assessed coverage, malaria incidence, and the impact of SMC. Studies published in French and English were included. Data extraction from the included studies was performed, and a quality assessment was conducted, including an evaluation of the risk of bias. Results Among the six studies, three assessed SMC coverage in all eight regions of Niger while also evaluating side effects. They showed high overall coverage but low coverage in some areas. Another study examined the impact in terms of the incidence of complicated malaria, malaria-related hospitalization, and mortality. Another publication revealed that antibody responses against the blood and pre-erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum were higher in the area where SMC was implemented. Conclusions This study demonstrates that SMC has a significant impact on reducing malaria incidence. Although there is high overall coverage, variations exist, particularly in hard-to-reach areas. Few adverse events were reported. However, very few studies are available, highlighting the need for additional research in Niger to better understand this strategy.

                Background The significance of household transmission of hepatitis B virus infection has been identified in different studies. Higher disease related knowledge among Hepatitis B patients improves the practice of transmission prevention and screening of household contacts. This study aims to assess the knowledge and practice of household transmission prevention among people with chronic hepatitis B attending a liver clinic at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH), Ethiopia. Methods A single center cross-sectional study among 229 hepatitis B patients visiting liver clinic for follow up service was undertaken in 2021. Data were collected using a structured interviewer guided questionnaires and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods in SPSS 26. Results Mean age of respondents was 40 years, 68% were male, 65% of respondents scored ≥75 (defined as a high knowledge). In adjusted linear regression, age <40 years, presence of additional infected household members and disease duration >3 years were associated with higher knowledge score (R2= 0.106, F=8.936, P<0.001). Only 38.6% of participants scoring ≥6 (defined as good prevention practice). In Adjusted logistic regression, factors associated with poor practice were; low level of education (OR: 5.218; 95%CI: 1.34-20.23; p=0.017), being on anti HBV treatment (OR: 3.582; 95%CI: 1.04-12.33; p=0.043) and duration of follow up at TASH <2 years (OR: 2.93; 95%CI: 1.14-7.55; p=0.025). Conclusion In contrast to overall good knowledge, largely poor implementation of prevention practices and misunderstandings about transmission through air, kissing, and eating utensils were seen in a significant proportion of participants. Based on the results, any educational programs planned for this population should give special attention to the implementation of recommended prevention practices than simple awareness creation, with priority given to those with low education, <2 years on follow-up, and those on anti-hepatitis B treatment.

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In sleep apnea, repeated hypovolemic ventilation or apnea in sleep leads to intermittent hypoxia (IH) of the brain. Thus, the impacts of sleep apnea on the brain need to be investigated. In this study, a mouse model with sleep-associated chronic IH and behavior tests was used to evaluate how IH impacts brain function and the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-containing neurons in the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area (VTA), and locus coeruleus. In an open-field test, mice subjected to chronic IH (5%–21% oxygen) for 10 and 20 days exhibited a significant decrease in spontaneous locomotor activity compared to the room air (RA, 21% oxygen) control mice. In the Y-maze test, the ability to recognize novel and familiar arms was similar between groups. In immunostaining of the brains of IH mice, TH-positive neurons in the substantia nigra, VTA, and locus coeruleus were significantly reduced compared to RA mice. Furthermore, in the brains of mice with decreased TH-positive neurons induced by IH, the expression of hippocampal neurons has not been affected. In the analysis of glial cells, in IH group mice, a significant increase of microglia was found in the substantia nigra, VTA, locus coeruleus, and hippocampus compared to the RA mice. These findings suggest that there is a loss of TH-containing neurons and neuronal inflammation in the substantia nigra, VTA, and locus coeruleus under chronic IH. Our findings provide precise evidence for the loss of TH-containing neurons in the setting of chronic IH mouse models, which can provide relevant empirical observations for clinicians.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine whether a machine learning model of voxel level [<sup>18</sup>f]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) data could predict progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) pathology, as well as outperform currently available biomarkers.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>One hundred and thirty-seven autopsied patients with PSP (n = 42) and other neurodegenerative diseases (n = 95) who underwent antemortem [<sup>18</sup>f]fluorodeoxyglucose PET and 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were analyzed. A linear support vector machine was applied to differentiate pathological groups with sensitivity analyses performed to assess the influence of voxel size and region removal. A radial basis function was also prepared to create a secondary model using the most important voxels. The models were optimized on the main dataset (n = 104), and their performance was compared with the magnetic resonance parkinsonism index measured on MRI in the independent test dataset (n = 33).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The model had the highest accuracy (0.91) and F-score (0.86) when voxel size was 6mm. In this optimized model, important voxels for differentiating the groups were observed in the thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellar dentate. The secondary models found the combination of thalamus and dentate to have the highest accuracy (0.89) and F-score (0.81). The optimized secondary model showed the highest accuracy (0.91) and F-scores (0.86) in the test dataset and outperformed the magnetic resonance parkinsonism index (0.81 and 0.70, respectively).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The results suggest that glucose hypometabolism in the thalamus and cerebellar dentate have the highest potential for predicting PSP pathology. Our optimized machine learning model outperformed the best currently available biomarker to predict PSP pathology. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>
