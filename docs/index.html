              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70013?af=R">A Theory and Model of Scene Representations With Hippocampal Spatial View Cells</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>A theory and network model are presented of how scene representations are built by forming spatial view cells in the ventromedial visual cortical scene pathway to the hippocampus in primates including humans. Layer 1, corresponding to V1–V4, connects to Layer 2 in the retrosplenial scene area and uses competitive learning to form visual feature combination neurons for the part of the scene being fixated, a visual fixation scene patch. In Layer 3, corresponding to the parahippocampal scene area and hippocampus, the visual fixation scene patches are stitched together to form whole scene representations. This is performed with a continuous attractor network for a whole scene made from the overlapping Gaussian receptive fields of the neurons as the head rotates to view the whole scene. In addition, in Layer 3, gain modulation by gaze direction maps visual fixation scene patches to the correct part of the whole scene representation when saccades are made. Each neuron in Layer 3 is thus a spatial view cell that responds to a location in a viewed scene based on visual features in a part of the scene. The novel conceptual advances are that this theory shows how scene representations may be built in primates, including humans, based on features in spatial scenes that anchor the scene representation to the world being viewed (to allocentric, world-based, space); and how gaze direction contributes to this. This offers a revolutionary approach to understanding the spatial representations for navigation and episodic memory in primates, including humans.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18540">Exploring Visual Complaints through a test battery in Acquired Brain Injury Patients: A Detailed Analysis of the DiaNAH Dataset</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.18540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigated visual impairment complaints in a sample of 948 Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) patients using the DiaNAH dataset, emphasizing advanced machine learning techniques for managing missing data. Patients completed a CVS questionnaire capturing eight types of visual symptoms, including blurred vision and altered contrast perception. Due to incomplete data, 181 patients were excluded, resulting in an analytical subset of 767 individuals. To address the challenge of missing data, an automated machine learning (AutoML) approach was employed for data imputation, preserving the distributional characteristics of the original dataset. Patients were grouped according to singular and combined complaint clusters derived from the 40,320 potential combinations identified through the CVS questionnaire. A linear correlation analysis revealed minimal to no direct relationship between patient-reported visual complaints and standard visual perceptual function tests. This study represents an initial systematic attempt to understand the complex relationship between subjective visual complaints and objective visual perceptual assessments in ABI patients. Given the limitations of sample size and variability, further studies with larger populations are recommended to robustly explore these complaint clusters and their implications for visual perception following brain injury.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18550">Quantum information theoretic approach to the hard problem of consciousness</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.18550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional theories of consciousness, based on emergence of conscious experiences from the execution of a particular function by an insentient brain, face the hard problem of consciousness of explaining why the insentient brain should produce any conscious experiences at all. This problem is exacerbated by the determinism characterizing the laws of classical physics, due to the resulting lack of causal potency of the emergent consciousness, which is not present already as a physical quantity in the deterministic equations of motion of the brain. Here, we present a quantum information theoretic approach to the hard problem of consciousness that avoids all of the drawbacks of emergence. This is achieved through reductive identification of first-person subjective conscious states with unobservable quantum state vectors in the brain, whereas the anatomically observable brain is viewed as a third-person objective construct created by classical bits of information obtained during the measurement of a subset of commuting quantum brain observables by the environment. Quantum resource theory further implies that the quantum features of consciousness granted by quantum no-go theorems cannot be replicated by any classical physical device.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18991">Uncovering potential effects of spontaneous waves on synaptic development: the visual system as a model</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.18991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous waves are ubiquitous during early brain development and are hypothesized to drive the development of receptive fields (RFs). Different stages of spontaneous waves in the retina have been observed to coincide with the development of the retinotopic map, ON-OFF segregation, and orientation selectivity in the early visual pathway of mammals, and can be characterized by different activity patterns in the retina and downstream areas. Stage II waves, which occur in rodents right after birth, have been implicated in a possible synaptic pruning process, relating these stage II retinal waves to the refinement of the retinotopic map. However, the mechanisms underlying the activity-dependent effects of retinal waves on primary visual cortex (V1) are poorly understood. In this work, we build a biologically-constrained model of the development of thalamocortical synapses onto neurons in V1 driven by stage II retinal waves using a spike-timing dependent triplet learning rule. Using this model, together with a reduced rate-based model, we propose possible mechanisms underlying such a pruning process and predict how characteristics of the retinal waves may lead to different RF structures, including periodic RFs. We introduce gap junctions into the V1 network and show that such a coupling can serve to promote precise local retinotopy. Finally, we discuss how the spatial distribution of synaptic weights at the end of stage II may affect the emergence of orientation selectivity of V1 neurons during stage III waves. The mechanisms uncovered in this work may be useful in understanding synaptic structures that emerge across cortical regions during development.

                arXiv:2504.19657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing is a powerful framework for real-time information processing, characterized by its high computational ability and quick learning, with applications ranging from machine learning to biological systems. In this paper, we demonstrate that the memory capacity of a reservoir recurrent neural network scales sublinearly with the number of readout neurons. To elucidate this phenomenon, we develop a theoretical framework for analytically deriving memory capacity, attributing the decaying growth of memory capacity to neuronal correlations. In addition, numerical simulations reveal that once memory capacity becomes sublinear, increasing the number of readout neurons successively enables nonlinear processing at progressively higher polynomial orders. Furthermore, our theoretical framework suggests that neuronal correlations govern not only memory capacity but also the sequential growth of nonlinear computational capabilities. Our findings establish a foundation for designing scalable and cost-effective reservoir computing, providing novel insights into the interplay among neuronal correlations, linear memory, and nonlinear processing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19106">Subtle variations in stiff dimensions of brain networks account for individual differences in cognitive ability</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.19106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explaining individual differences in cognitive abilities requires both identifying brain parameters that vary across individuals and understanding how brain networks are recruited for specific tasks. Typically, task performance relies on the integration and segregation of functional subnetworks, often captured by parameters like regional excitability and connectivity. Yet, the high dimensionality of these parameters hinders pinpointing their functional relevance. Here, we apply stiff-sloppy analysis to human brain data, revealing that certain subtle parameter combinations ("stiff dimensions") powerfully influence neural activity during task processing, whereas others ("sloppy dimensions") vary more extensively but exert minimal impact. Using a pairwise maximum entropy model of task fMRI, we show that even small deviations in stiff dimensions-derived through Fisher Information Matrix analysis-govern the dynamic interplay of segregation and integration between the default mode network (DMN) and a working memory network (WMN). Crucially, separating a 0-back task (vigilant attention) from a 2-back task (working memory updating) uncovers partially distinct stiff dimensions predicting performance in each condition, along with a global DMN-WMN segregation shared across both tasks. Altogether, stiff-sloppy analysis challenges the conventional focus on large parameter variability by highlighting these subtle yet functionally decisive parameter combinations.

                arXiv:2502.10098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective planning is crucial for navigating complex environments and achieving goals efficiently. In this study, we investigated how environmental structure influences the selection of planning strategies. Forty-two participants navigated a space station to collect colored spheres, with environments either structured (spheres grouped by color) or unstructured (spheres scattered randomly). We tested three types of plans: hierarchical (grouping spheres by color), shortest path (minimizing travel distance), and neutral (none of the above). By manipulating environmental structure, we were able to nudge participants toward a preference for hierarchical planning in structured environments, while shortest path plans were favored in unstructured environments. A mismatch between self-reported preferences and actual choices indicated that participants often adopted implicit strategies, unaware of their decision-making processes. These findings highlight the powerful effect of environmental cues on planning and suggest that even subtle changes in structure can guide the selection of planning strategies.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) once showed increasing alignment with primate perception and neural responses as they improved on vision benchmarks, raising hopes that advances in AI would yield better models of biological vision. However, we show across three benchmarks that this alignment is now plateauing - and in some cases worsening - as DNNs scale to human or superhuman accuracy. This divergence may reflect the adoption of visual strategies that differ from those used by primates. These findings challenge the view that progress in artificial intelligence will naturally translate to neuroscience. We argue that vision science must chart its own course, developing algorithms grounded in biological visual systems rather than optimizing for benchmarks based on internet-scale datasets.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06359">Evaluating tDCS Intervention Effectiveness via Functional Connectivity Network on Resting-State EEG Data in Major Depressive Disorder</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.06359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive therapeutic intervention for major depressive disorder (MDD), yet its effects on neural mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study investigates the impact of tDCS in individuals with MDD using resting-state EEG data and network neuroscience to analyze functional connectivity. We examined power spectral density (PSD) changes and functional connectivity (FC) patterns across theta, alpha, and beta bands before and after tDCS intervention. A notable aspect of this research involves the modification of the binarizing threshold algorithm to assess functional connectivity networks, facilitating a meaningful comparison at the group level. Our analysis using optimal threshold binarization techniques revealed significant modifications in network topology, particularly evident in the beta band, indicative of reduced randomization or enhanced small-worldness after tDCS. Furthermore, the hubness analysis identified specific brain regions, notably the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) regions across all frequency bands, exhibiting increased functional connectivity, suggesting their involvement in the antidepressant effects of tDCS. Notably, tDCS intervention transformed the dispersed high connectivity into localized connectivity and increased left-sided asymmetry across all frequency bands. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the effects of tDCS on neural mechanisms in MDD, offering a potential direction for further research and therapeutic development in the field of neuromodulation for mental health disorders.

Abstract: Human learning embodies a striking duality: sometimes, we appear capable of following logical, compositional rules and benefit from structured curricula (e.g., in formal education), while other times, we rely on an incremental approach or trial-and-error, learning better from curricula that are randomly interleaved. Influential psychological theories explain this seemingly disparate behavioral evidence by positing two qualitatively different learning systems -- one for rapid, rule-based inferences and another for slow, incremental adaptation. It remains unclear how to reconcile such theories with neural networks, which learn via incremental weight updates and are thus a natural model for the latter type of learning, but are not obviously compatible with the former. However, recent evidence suggests that metalearning neural networks and large language models are capable of "in-context learning" (ICL) -- the ability to flexibly grasp the structure of a new task from a few examples. Here, we show that the dynamic interplay between ICL and default in-weight learning (IWL) naturally captures a broad range of learning phenomena observed in humans, reproducing curriculum effects on category-learning and compositional tasks, and recapitulating a tradeoff between flexibility and retention. Our work shows how emergent ICL can equip neural networks with fundamentally different learning properties that can coexist with their native IWL, thus offering a novel perspective on dual-process theories and human cognitive flexibility.

                arXiv:2503.10195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising tool for event-based optical flow estimation tasks due to their ability to leverage spatio-temporal information and low-power capabilities. However, the performance of SNN models is often constrained, limiting their application in real-world scenarios. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a novel neural network architecture, ST-FlowNet, specifically tailored for optical flow estimation from event-based data. The ST-FlowNet architecture integrates ConvGRU modules to facilitate cross-modal feature augmentation and temporal alignment of the predicted optical flow, improving the network's ability to capture complex motion dynamics. Additionally, to overcome the challenges associated with training SNNs, we introduce a novel approach to derive SNN models from pre-trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) through ANN-to-SNN conversion or our proposed BISNN method. Notably, the BISNN method alleviates the complexities involved in biological parameter selection, further enhancing the robustness of SNNs in optical flow estimation tasks. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark event-based datasets demonstrate that the SNN-based ST-FlowNet model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior performance in accurate optical flow estimation across a diverse range of dynamic visual scenes. Furthermore, the inherent energy efficiency of SNN models is highlighted, establishing a compelling advantage for their practical deployment. Overall, our work presents a novel framework for optical flow estimation using SNNs and event-based data, contributing to the advancement of neuromorphic vision applications.

                arXiv:2504.18953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the application of the Brain Drain Optimization algorithm -- a swarm-based metaheuristic inspired by the emigration of intellectual elites -- to the N-Queens problem. The N-Queens problem, a classic combinatorial optimization problem, serves as a challenge for applying the BRADO. A designed cost function guides the search, and the configurations are tuned using a TOPSIS-based multicriteria decision making process. BRADO consistently outperforms alternatives in terms of solution quality, achieving fewer threats and better objective function values. To assess BRADO's efficacy, it is benchmarked against several established metaheuristic algorithms, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA), Iterated Local Search (ILS), and basic Local Search (LS). The study highlights BRADO's potential as a general-purpose solver for combinatorial problems, opening pathways for future applications in other domains of artificial intelligence.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19112">Vessel Length Estimation from Magnetic Wake Signature: A Physics-Informed Residual Neural Network Approach</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.19112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marine remote sensing enhances maritime surveillance, environmental monitoring, and naval operations. Vessel length estimation, a key component of this technology, supports effective maritime surveillance by empowering features such as vessel classification. Departing from traditional methods relying on two-dimensional hydrodynamic wakes or computationally intensive satellite imagery, this paper introduces an innovative approach for vessel length estimation that leverages the subtle magnetic wake signatures of vessels, captured through a low-complexity one-dimensional profile from a single airborne magnetic sensor scan. The proposed method centers around our characterized nonlinear integral equations that connect the magnetic wake to the vessel length within a realistic finite-depth marine environment. To solve the derived equations, we initially leverage a deep residual neural network (DRNN). The proposed DRNN-based solution framework is shown to be unable to exactly learn the intricate relationships between parameters when constrained by a limited training-dataset. To overcome this issue, we introduce an innovative approach leveraging a physics-informed residual neural network (PIRNN). This model integrates physical formulations directly into the loss function, leading to improved performance in terms of both accuracy and convergence speed. Considering a sensor scan angle of less than $15^\circ$, which maintains a reasonable margin below Kelvin's limit angle of $19.5^\circ$, we explore the impact of various parameters on the accuracy of the vessel
  length estimation, including sensor scan angle, vessel speed, and sea depth. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed PIRNN method, achieving mean length estimation errors consistently below 5\% for vessels longer than 100m. For shorter vessels, the errors generally remain under 10\%.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19411">A Comparison-Relationship-Surrogate Evolutionary Algorithm for Multi-Objective Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.19411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms often struggle to find high-quality solutions to multi-objective optimization problems on a limited budget of function evaluations (here, a few hundred). A promising direction to improve the efficiency of these methods is to augment the objective functions with a data-driven surrogate model. These ``surrogate-assisted'' optimization algorithms can achieve better solutions than conventional algorithms for the same number of function evaluations on a wide variety of test problems. In this work, we continue to explore the area of surrogate-assisted multi-objective optimization by introducing and testing an algorithm driven by a new type of surrogate model: a comparison-relationship-surrogate model. This model predicts the truth values of the comparison operator evaluated on the objective functions for two candidate solutions. These predictions can be used to infer the domination relationships that power the non-dominated sorting mechanism used by many multi-objective genetic algorithms to select fit individuals. Several numerical experiments are performed on this algorithm using well-known test suites plus a real-world problem from the field of accelerator physics. Statistical analysis of the results demonstrates that the new algorithm can, on average, achieve better-converged solutions to many medium-scale, biobjective problems than existing state-of-the-art methods for a limited budget of function evaluations.

                arXiv:2504.18545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are many different nature-inspired algorithms in the literature, and almost all such algorithms have algorithm-dependent parameters that need to be tuned. The proper setting and parameter tuning should be carried out to maximize the performance of the algorithm under consideration. This work is the extension of the recent work on parameter tuning by Joy et al. (2024) presented at the International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS 2024), and the Firefly Algorithm (FA) is tuned using three different methods: the Monte Carlo method, the Quasi-Monte Carlo method and the Latin Hypercube Sampling. The FA with the tuned parameters is then used to solve a set of six different optimization problems, and the possible effect of parameter setting on the quality of the optimal solutions is analyzed. Rigorous statistical hypothesis tests have been carried out, including Student's t-tests, F-tests, non-parametric Friedman tests and ANOVA. Results show that the performance of the FA is not influenced by the tuning methods used. In addition, the tuned parameter values are largely independent of the tuning methods used. This indicates that the FA can be flexible and equally effective in solving optimization problems, and any of the three tuning methods can be used to tune its parameters effectively.

                arXiv:2504.18902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the forthcoming era of 6G networks, characterized by unprecedented data rates, ultra-low latency, and extensive connectivity, effective management of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) is essential. VNFs are software-based counterparts of traditional hardware devices that facilitate flexible and scalable service provisioning. Service Function Chains (SFCs), structured as ordered sequences of VNFs, are pivotal in orchestrating complex network services. Nevertheless, partitioning SFCs across multi-domain network infrastructures presents substantial challenges due to stringent latency constraints and limited resource availability. Conventional optimization-based methods typically exhibit low scalability, whereas existing data-driven approaches often fail to adequately balance computational efficiency with the capability to effectively account for dependencies inherent in SFCs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Transformer-empowered actor-critic framework specifically designed for sequence-aware SFC partitioning. By utilizing the self-attention mechanism, our approach effectively models complex inter-dependencies among VNFs, facilitating coordinated and parallelized decision-making processes. Additionally, we enhance training stability and convergence using $\epsilon$-LoPe exploration strategy as well as Asymptotic Return Normalization. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions in terms of long-term acceptance rates, resource utilization efficiency, and scalability, while achieving rapid inference. This study not only advances intelligent network orchestration by delivering a scalable and robust solution for SFC partitioning within emerging 6G environments, but also bridging recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) with the optimization of next-generation networks.

                arXiv:2504.19027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important in decision-critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and law. Counterfactual (CF) explanations, a key approach in XAI, provide users with actionable insights by suggesting minimal modifications to input features that lead to different model outcomes. Despite significant advancements, existing CF generation methods often struggle to balance proximity, diversity, and robustness, limiting their real-world applicability. A widely adopted framework, Diverse Counterfactual Explanations (DiCE), emphasizes diversity but lacks robustness, making CF explanations sensitive to perturbations and domain constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce DiCE-Extended, an enhanced CF explanation framework that integrates multi-objective optimization techniques to improve robustness while maintaining interpretability. Our approach introduces a novel robustness metric based on the Dice-Sorensen coefficient, ensuring stability under small input variations. Additionally, we refine CF generation using weighted loss components (lambda_p, lambda_d, lambda_r) to balance proximity, diversity, and robustness. We empirically validate DiCE-Extended on benchmark datasets (COMPAS, Lending Club, German Credit, Adult Income) across multiple ML backends (Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow). Results demonstrate improved CF validity, stability, and alignment with decision boundaries compared to standard DiCE-generated explanations. Our findings highlight the potential of DiCE-Extended in generating more reliable and interpretable CFs for high-stakes applications. Future work will explore adaptive optimization techniques and domain-specific constraints to further enhance CF generation in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in algorithm design. However, when integrated into search frameworks for iterative algorithm search, the underlying fitness landscape--critical for understanding search behaviou--remains underexplored. In this paper, we illustrate and analyze the fitness landscape of LLM-assisted Algorithm Search (LAS) using a graph-based approach, where nodes represent algorithms and edges denote transitions between them. We conduct extensive evaluations across six algorithm design tasks and six commonly used LLMs. Our findings reveal that LAS landscapes are highly multimodal and rugged, particularly in combinatorial optimization tasks, with distinct structural variations across tasks and LLMs. For instance, heuristic design tasks exhibit dense clusters of high-performing algorithms, while symbolic regression tasks show sparse, scattered distributions. Additionally, we demonstrate how population size influences exploration-exploitation trade-offs and the evolving trajectory of elite algorithms. These insights not only advance our understanding of LAS landscapes but also provide practical guidance for designing more effective LAS methods.

Abstract: Developing dedicated mixed-signal neuromorphic computing systems optimized for real-time sensory-processing in extreme edge-computing applications requires time-consuming design, fabrication, and deployment of full-custom neuromorphic processors. To ensure that initial prototyping efforts, exploring the properties of different network architectures and parameter settings, lead to realistic results, it is important to use simulation frameworks that match as best as possible the properties of the final hardware. This is particularly challenging for neuromorphic hardware platforms made using mixed-signal analog/digital circuits, due to the variability and noise sensitivity of their components. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a software spiking neural network simulator explicitly designed to account for the properties of mixed-signal neuromorphic circuits, including device mismatch variability.
  The simulator, called ARCANA (A Realistic Simulation Framework for Analog/Digital Neuromorphic Architectures), is designed to reproduce the dynamics of mixed-signal synapse and neuron electronic circuits with autogradient differentiation for parameter optimization and GPU acceleration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by matching software simulation results with measurements made from an existing neuromorphic processor. We show how the results obtained provide a reliable estimate of the behavior of the spiking neural network trained in software, once deployed in hardware. This framework enables the development and innovation of new learning rules and processing architectures in neuromorphic embedded systems.

                arXiv:2504.17751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of image recognition, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have achieved performance comparable to conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). In such applications, SNNs essentially function as traditional neural networks with quantized activation values. This article focuses on an another alternative perspective,viewing SNNs as binary-activated recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential modeling tasks.From this viewpoint, current SNN architectures face several fundamental challenges in sequence modeling: (1) Traditional models lack effective memory mechanisms for long-range sequence modeling; (2) The biological-inspired components in SNNs (such as reset mechanisms and refractory period applications) remain theoretically under-explored for sequence tasks; (3) The RNN-like computational paradigm in SNNs prevents parallel training across different timesteps.To address these challenges, this study conducts a systematic analysis of the fundamental mechanisms underlying reset operations and refractory periods in binary-activated RNN-based SNN sequence models. We re-examine whether such biological mechanisms are strictly necessary for generating sparse spiking patterns, provide new theoretical explanations and insights, and ultimately propose the fixed-refractory-period SNN architecture for sequence modeling.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17827">Evolution Meets Diffusion: Efficient Neural Architecture Generation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.17827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has gained widespread attention for its transformative potential in deep learning model design. However, the vast and complex search space of NAS leads to significant computational and time costs. Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) addresses this by reframing NAS as a generation problem, enabling the precise generation of optimal architectures for specific tasks. Despite its promise, mainstream methods like diffusion models face limitations in global search capabilities and are still hindered by high computational and time demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose Evolutionary Diffusion-based Neural Architecture Generation (EDNAG), a novel approach that achieves efficient and training-free architecture generation. EDNAG leverages evolutionary algorithms to simulate the denoising process in diffusion models, using fitness to guide the transition from random Gaussian distributions to optimal architecture distributions. This approach combines the strengths of evolutionary strategies and diffusion models, enabling rapid and effective architecture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDNAG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in architecture optimization, with an improvement in accuracy of up to 10.45%. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for time-consuming training and boosts inference speed by an average of 50 times, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: The ability of resource-constrained biological systems such as fruitflies to perform complex and high-speed maneuvers in cluttered environments has been one of the prime sources of inspiration for developing vision-based autonomous systems. To emulate this capability, the perception pipeline of such systems must integrate information cues from tasks including optical flow and depth estimation, object detection and tracking, and segmentation, among others. However, the conventional approach of employing slow, synchronous inputs from standard frame-based cameras constrains these perception capabilities, particularly during high-speed maneuvers. Recently, event-based sensors have emerged as low latency and low energy alternatives to standard frame-based cameras for capturing high-speed motion, effectively speeding up perception and hence navigation. For coherence, all the perception tasks must be trained on the same input data. However, present-day datasets are curated mainly for a single or a handful of tasks and are limited in the rate of the provided ground truths. To address these limitations, we present Flying Event Dataset fOr Reactive behAviour (FEDORA) - a fully synthetic dataset for perception tasks, with raw data from frame-based cameras, event-based cameras, and Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), along with ground truths for depth, pose, and optical flow at a rate much higher than existing datasets.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09990">SHIRE: Enhancing Sample Efficiency using Human Intuition in REinforcement Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.09990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability of neural networks to perform robotic perception and control tasks such as depth and optical flow estimation, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and automatic control has led to their widespread adoption in recent years. Deep Reinforcement Learning has been used extensively in these settings, as it does not have the unsustainable training costs associated with supervised learning. However, DeepRL suffers from poor sample efficiency, i.e., it requires a large number of environmental interactions to converge to an acceptable solution. Modern RL algorithms such as Deep Q Learning and Soft Actor-Critic attempt to remedy this shortcoming but can not provide the explainability required in applications such as autonomous robotics. Humans intuitively understand the long-time-horizon sequential tasks common in robotics. Properly using such intuition can make RL policies more explainable while enhancing their sample efficiency. In this work, we propose SHIRE, a novel framework for encoding human intuition using Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and using it in the Deep RL training pipeline to enhance sample efficiency. Our framework achieves 25-78% sample efficiency gains across the environments we evaluate at negligible overhead cost. Additionally, by teaching RL agents the encoded elementary behavior, SHIRE enhances policy explainability. A real-world demonstration further highlights the efficacy of policies trained using our framework.

                arXiv:2501.19259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of human-intuitive interactions into autonomous systems has been limited. Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems struggle with context and intent understanding, severely restricting human-robot interaction. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed this dynamic, allowing for intuitive and high-level communication through speech and text, and bridging the gap between human commands and robotic actions. Additionally, autonomous navigation has emerged as a central focus in robotics research, with artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly being leveraged to enhance these systems. However, existing AI-based navigation algorithms face significant challenges in latency-critical tasks where rapid decision-making is critical. Traditional frame-based vision systems, while effective for high-level decision-making, suffer from high energy consumption and latency, limiting their applicability in real-time scenarios. Neuromorphic vision systems, combining event-based cameras and spiking neural networks (SNNs), offer a promising alternative by enabling energy-efficient, low-latency navigation. Despite their potential, real-world implementations of these systems, particularly on physical platforms such as drones, remain scarce. In this work, we present Neuro-LIFT, a real-time neuromorphic navigation framework implemented on a Parrot Bebop2 quadrotor. Leveraging an LLM for natural language processing, Neuro-LIFT translates human speech into high-level planning commands which are then autonomously executed using event-based neuromorphic vision and physics-driven planning. Our framework demonstrates its capabilities in navigating in a dynamic environment, avoiding obstacles, and adapting to human instructions in real-time.

                arXiv:2504.11419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial reasoning in partially observable environments has often been approached through passive predictive models, yet theories of embodied cognition suggest that genuinely useful representations arise only when perception is tightly coupled to action. Here we ask whether a recurrent agent, trained solely by sparse rewards to solve procedurally generated planar mazes, can autonomously internalize metric concepts such as direction, distance and obstacle layout. After training, the agent consistently produces near-optimal paths in unseen mazes, behavior that hints at an underlying spatial model. To probe this possibility, we cast the closed agent-environment loop as a hybrid dynamical system, identify stable limit cycles in its state space, and characterize behavior with a Ridge Representation that embeds whole trajectories into a common metric space. Canonical correlation analysis exposes a robust linear alignment between neural and behavioral manifolds, while targeted perturbations of the most informative neural dimensions sharply degrade navigation performance. Taken together, these dynamical, representational, and causal signatures show that sustained sensorimotor interaction is sufficient for the spontaneous emergence of compact, embodied world models, providing a principled path toward interpretable and transferable navigation policies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1503/v3?src=rss">Life Cycle Assessment of Microalgae-Based Products for Carbon Dioxide Utilization in Thailand: Biofertilizer, Fish Feed, and Biodiesel [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Microalgae-based products offer a sustainable solution for food, fuel, and agricultural inputs, presenting environmental benefits and economic opportunities. A comprehensive assessment is needed to understand their potential in supporting sustainability goals, considering the complex interplay between production methods, energy sources, and environmental impacts. Methods This study evaluated the environmental impacts of three microalgae-derived products – biodiesel, fish feed, and biofertilizer – through a comprehensive life cycle assessment. Nine scenarios were explored comparing three electricity profiles (current Thai mix, 50% renewable/50% current mix hybrid, 100% renewable) across the three products. The assessment evaluated environmental impacts and potential economic benefits of transitioning to these microalgae-based alternatives. Results and discussion All products demonstrated potential for significant environmental benefits under increased renewable energy scenarios. Fish feed consistently exhibited the lowest environmental impacts across all categories examined, showing substantial improvements with increased renewable energy use. With an annual demand of 0.4 million tonnes, fish feed could generate USD 560 million in revenue and reduce CO2 emissions by 1.1 million tonnes. Fulfilling the projected biodiesel demand of 4,015 million liters per year through microalgae production could yield approximately USD 3.5 billion in revenue and reduce CO2 emissions by 30 million tonnes compared to conventional fossil-based diesel. Additionally, algal biofertilizer production could meet a 5 million tonnes annual demand, offering USD 2 billion in revenue while reducing CO2 emissions by 6 million tonnes yearly. Collectively, these products could offset 37 million tonnes of CO2, representing about 14% of Thailand’s total CO2 emissions, contributing significantly to the country’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target of 20-30% greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Conclusion Transitioning to microalgae-based products could transform the aquaculture, energy, and agricultural sectors, potentially supporting the national climate change mitigation goals, if implemented.

                <p>The primary motor cortex (M1) is strongly engaged by movement planning and execution. However, the role of M1 activity in voluntary grasping is still not completely understood. Here we analyze recordings of M1 neurons during the execution of a delayed reach-to-grasp task, where monkeys had to actively grasp an object with either a side or a precision grip, and then pull it with a low or high amount of force. Single cell and neural populations analyses showed that grip type was robustly and specifically encoded by a large population of neurons, while force level was weakly and transiently encoded within mixed-selective neurons that also encoded grip type. Notably, the grip type was stably decoded from motor cortical populations during the preparation and execution epochs of the task. Our results are consistent with the idea that planning and performing specific grasping movements are high-level skills that strongly engage M1 neurons, while the execution of pulling force might be prominently encoded at lower stages of the motor system.</p>

                <p>Investigation of neural processes underlying motor control requires behavioral readouts that capture the richness of actions, including both categorical (choice-based) information and motor execution (kinematics). We present an open-source platform for behavioral training of head-fixed mice that combines a stationary or retractable forelimb-based joystick, sound-presentation system, capacitive lick sensor, and water reward dispenser. The setup allows for the creation of multiple behavioral paradigms, two of which are highlighted here: a two-alternative forced-choice auditory-motor discrimination paradigm and a two-armed bandit value-based decision-making task. In the auditory-motor paradigm, mice learn to report high- or low-frequency tones by pushing or pulling the joystick. In the value-based paradigm, mice learn to push or pull the joystick based on the history of rewarded trials. In addition to reporting categorical choices, this setup provides a rich dataset of motor parameters that reflect components of the underlying learning and decision processes in both of these tasks. These kinematic parameters (including joystick speed and displacement, Fr&eacute;chet similarity of trajectories, tortuosity, angular standard deviation, and movement vigor) provide key additional insights into the motor execution of choices that are not as readily assessed in other paradigms. The system's flexibility of task design, joystick readout, and ease of construction represent an advance compared with currently available manipulandum tasks in mice. We provide detailed schematics for constructing the setup and protocols for behavioral training using both paradigms, with the hope that this open-source resource is readily adopted by neuroscientists interested in mechanisms of sensorimotor integration, motor control, and choice behavior.</p>

                <p>Behavioral and neuroscientific studies have shown that watching a speaker's lip movements aids speech comprehension. Intriguingly, even when videos of speakers are presented silently, various cortical regions track auditory features, such as the envelope. Recently, we demonstrated that eye movements track low-level acoustic information when attentively listening to speech. In this study, we investigated whether ocular speech tracking occurs during visual speech and how it influences cortical silent speech tracking. Furthermore, we compared data from hearing individuals, congenitally deaf individuals, and those who became deaf or hard of hearing (DHH) later in life to assess how audiovisual listening experience and auditory deprivation (early vs late onset) affect neural and ocular speech tracking during silent lip-reading. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we examined ocular and neural speech tracking of 75 participants observing silent videos of a speaker played forward and backward. Our main finding is a clear ocular unheard speech tracking effect with dominance of &lt;1&nbsp;Hz, which was not present for lip movements. Similarly, we observed an &le; 1.3&nbsp;Hz effect of neural unheard speech tracking in temporal regions for hearing participants. Importantly, neural tracking was not directly linked to ocular tracking. Strikingly, across listening groups, deaf participants with auditory experience showed higher ocular speech tracking than hearing participants, while no ocular speech tracking effect was revealed for congenitally deaf participants in a very small sample. This study extends previous work by demonstrating the involvement of eye movements in speech processing, even in the absence of acoustic input.</p>

                <p>The re-emergence of task-related activation patterns during awake rest has been reported to play a role in memory consolidation and perceptual learning. This study aimed to test whether such reactivation occurs in the primary sensorimotor cortex following a visuomotor task. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning, 42 healthy participants (13 women and 29 men) learned visuomotor tracking, while a rotational perturbation was introduced between the cursor position and joystick angle. This visuomotor task block was interleaved with a control block, during which participants passively viewed a replay of their previously performed cursor movements. Half of the participants used their right hand, whereas the other half used their left hand to control the joystick. Resting-state scans were acquired before and after the visuomotor task sessions. A multivariate pattern classifier was trained to classify task and control blocks and was then tested on resting-state scans collected before and after the task session. Results revealed a significant increase in the number of volumes classified as "task" during post-task rest compared with pre-task rest, indicating re-emergence of task-related activity. Representational similarity analysis also showed a greater similarity to task-related patterns during the post-task rest period. Furthermore, this effect was specific to the left primary sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the hand used and significantly correlated with motor improvement following rest. Our findings reveal the reactivation of recent task-related experience in the primary sensorimotor cortex.</p>

                Background Vehicle safety and stability are paramount in the automotive industry, with aerodynamics playing a crucial role in enhancing these attributes. Spoilers, often used to modify airflow around vehicles, can significantly impact performance depending on their design and configuration. This study explores the use of airfoils as spoilers with adjustable trailing edges to dynamically control downforce and lift forces, aiming to improve vehicle stability and performance. Methods Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed using ANSYS Fluent ® software (ANSYS, Inc., Canonsburg, PA, USA) The authors confirm that they have obtained the necessary license for the use of this software in academic research. to analyses the aerodynamic effects of spoilers with varying trailing edge angles (AOTE). A Tesla car model was designed in CATIA™ software (Dassault Systèmes), Vélizy-Villacoublay, France), and simulations were conducted at speeds ranging from 120 km/h to 350 km/h. The Shear Stress Transport (SST) k-ω turbulence model was employed to accurately capture airflow patterns. The computational domain was configured as a wind tunnel, and a grid independence study ensured the reliability of the results. Boundary conditions included velocity inlets, pressure outlets, and no-slip walls for the car and spoiler surfaces. Results The study revealed that adjusting the trailing edge angle had a significant impact on downforce and lift forces. At a trailing edge angle of 30 degrees, the negative lift force increased by up to 36%, while at zero degrees, it increased by up to 17%. The positive lift force was optimized to enhance vehicle performance during acceleration, resulting in an overall increase in total lift force by up to 15%. The simulated drag coefficient of 0.256 showed a 6% discrepancy compared to Tesla’s reported value of 0.24, primarily due to differences in mesh refinement and the omission of certain design features. Conclusions This study demonstrates the potential of movable trailing edge spoilers in improving vehicle stability, handling, and acceleration. The ability to dynamically adjust aerodynamic forces offers a practical solution for enhancing vehicle performance and safety. Future research will focus on refining control algorithms and testing under a broader range of driving conditions. These findings provide a strong foundation for integrating advanced aerodynamic features into modern vehicle designs.

     alt="Ontogenetic Changes in Endocranial Anatomy in Gorgosaurus libratus (Theropoda: Tyrannosauridae) Provide Insight Into the Evolution of the Tyrannosauroid Endocranium"/>
<p>Changes through growth (ontogenetic) in the braincase of the eutyrannosaurian tyrannosauroid <i>Gorgosaurus libratus</i> are discussed. Most notably, brain cavity endocasts of immature <i>Gorgosaurus</i> are found to more clearly show details of the brain morphology than more mature individuals, a finding that has implications for improving dinosaur paleoneurology.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Over the past two decades, increased accessibility to computed tomography (CT) scanners has greatly facilitated documentation of the endocranium in numerous extinct theropod taxa. However, most of these studies have focused on the morphology of mature individuals, thus changes or variation through ontogeny of the endocranium in theropods remains largely unknown. The current study sheds light on the endocranial anatomy of the eutyrannosaurian tyrannosauroid, <i>Gorgosaurus libratus</i>, in both an ontogenetic and evolutionary context. Based on CT scans of six <i>Gorgosaurus</i> braincases, including those of two recently discovered juvenile individuals, we virtually reconstruct and describe the endocranial morphology for a growth series of <i>G. libratus</i>. Despite considerable changes in skull architecture, relatively few ontogenetic changes occurred in the endocranium of <i>Gorgosaurus</i>. These changes include a subtle increase in the length of the hindbrain region of the endocast and increased inflation of the tympanic sinus diverticula in adults relative to juveniles. Among the most significant ontogenetic changes is a decrease in the distinctiveness of the brain morphology in endocasts as <i>Gorgosaurus</i> mature. The endocasts of juvenile <i>Gorgosaurus</i> exhibit better defined cerebral hemispheres, optic lobes, and cerebella than those of larger and more mature individuals. This suggests a closer correspondence between the endocast and the brain in juvenile tyrannosaurids, indicating the endocast of juvenile individuals provides a more accurate representation of the structure of the brain and its regions relative to the endocast of more mature individuals. The brain of <i>Gorgosaurus</i> displays a mix of basal archosaurian traits and more derived coelurosaurian traits. More primitive archosaurian features of the <i>Gorgosaurus</i> brain include large olfactory bulbs and tracts, a posteroventrally oriented long axis of the cerebrum, and posteriorly positioned optic lobes, whereas derived features include prominent hindbrain flexure, a somewhat enlarged cerebrum, and a cerebellum that at least partially separates the left and right optic lobes. An understanding of the evolutionary acquisition of such derived features leading to the avian brain may be further elucidated via the study of the endocasts of juvenile individuals (more reflective of the structure/organization of various brain regions) of earlier-diverging theropods (e.g., Allosauroidea, Megalosauroidea, and Coelophysoidea).</p>

     alt="Molecular and Morphological Circuitry of the Octopus Sucker Ganglion"/>
<p>Each of the prehensile suckers on the octopus arm contains a sucker ganglion embedded in the sucker musculature. The function of this ganglion has long been disputed. We provide molecular evidence that the sucker ganglion comprises sensory and motor elements and demonstrate circuit pathways for local processing as well as connections to central nervous system. Thus, the sucker ganglion is well situated for control of sucker reflexes and integrative sensorimotor processing.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The octopus sucker is a profoundly complex sensorimotor structure. Each of the hundreds of suckers that line the octopus arm can move independently or in concert with one another. These suckers also contain an intricate sensory epithelium, enriched with chemotactile receptors. Much of the massive nervous system embedded in the octopus arm mediates control of the suckers. Each arm houses a large axial nerve cord (ANC), which features local enlargements corresponding to each sucker. There is also a sucker ganglion, a peripheral nervous element, situated in the stalk of every sucker. The structure and function of the sucker ganglion remain obscure. We examined the cellular organization and molecular composition of the sucker ganglion in <i>Octopus bimaculoides</i>. The sucker ganglion has an ellipsoid shape and features an unusual organization: the neuropil of the ganglion is distributed as a cap aborally (away from the sucker) and a small pocket orally (toward the sucker), with neuronal cell bodies concentrated in the space between. Using in situ hybridization, we detected positive expression of sensory (<i>PIEZO</i>) and motor (<i>LHX3</i> and <i>MNX</i>) neuron markers in the sucker ganglion cell bodies. Nerve fibers spread out from the sucker ganglion, targeting the surrounding sucker musculature and the oral roots extending to the ANC. Our results indicate that the sucker ganglion is composed of both sensory and motor elements and suggest that this ganglion is not a simple relay for the ANC, but facilitates local reflexes for each sucker.</p>

Passive acoustic monitoring can offer insights into the state of coral reef ecosystems at low-costs and over extended temporal periods. Comparison of whole soundscape properties can rapidly deliver broad insights from acoustic data, in contrast to detailed but time-consuming analysis of individual bioacoustic events. However, a lack of effective automated analysis for whole soundscape data has impeded progress in this field. Here, we show that machine learning (ML) can be used to unlock greater insights from reef soundscapes. We showcase this on a diverse set of tasks using three biogeographically independent datasets, each containing fish community (high or low), coral cover (high or low) or depth zone (shallow or mesophotic) classes. We show supervised learning can be used to train models that can identify ecological classes and individual sites from whole soundscapes. However, we report unsupervised clustering achieves this whilst providing a more detailed understanding of ecological and site groupings within soundscape data. We also compare three different approaches for extracting feature embeddings from soundscape recordings for input into ML algorithms: acoustic indices commonly used by soundscape ecologists, a pretrained convolutional neural network (P-CNN) trained on 5.2 million hrs of YouTube audio, and CNN’s which were trained on each individual task (T-CNN). Although the T-CNN performs marginally better across tasks, we reveal that the P-CNN offers a powerful tool for generating insights from marine soundscape data as it requires orders of magnitude less computational resources whilst achieving near comparable performance to the T-CNN, with significant performance improvements over the acoustic indices. Our findings have implications for soundscape ecology in any habitat.

                <p>by Jin Dou, Andrew J. Anderson, Aaron S. White, Samuel V. Norman-Haignere, Edmund C. Lalor</p>

In recent years, it has become clear that EEG indexes the comprehension of natural, narrative speech. One particularly compelling demonstration of this fact can be seen by regressing EEG responses to speech against measures of how individual words in that speech linguistically relate to their preceding context. This approach produces a so-called temporal response function that displays a centro-parietal negativity reminiscent of the classic N400 component of the event-related potential. One shortcoming of previous implementations of this approach is that they have typically assumed a linear, time-invariant relationship between the linguistic speech features and the EEG responses. In other words, the analysis typically assumes that the response has the same shape and timing for every word – and only varies (linearly) in terms of its amplitude. In the present work, we relax this assumption under the hypothesis that responses to individual words may be processed more rapidly when they are predictable. Specifically, we introduce a framework wherein the standard linear temporal response function can be modulated in terms of its amplitude, latency, and temporal scale based on the predictability of the current and prior words. We use the proposed approach to model EEG recorded from a set of participants who listened to an audiobook narrated by a single talker, and a separate set of participants who attended to one of two concurrently presented audiobooks. We show that expected words are processed faster – evoking lower amplitude N400-like responses with earlier peaks – and that this effect is driven both by the word’s own predictability and the predictability of the immediately preceding word. Additional analysis suggests that this finding is not simply explained based on how quickly words can be disambiguated from their phonetic neighbors. As such, our study demonstrates that the timing and amplitude of brain responses to words in natural speech depend on their predictability. By accounting for these effects, our framework also improves the accuracy with which neural responses to natural speech can be modeled.

                <p>by Neil Philip Hobbs, Ian Hastings</p>

Insecticide resistance management (IRM) is critical to maintain the operational effectiveness of insecticides used in public health vector control. Evaluating IRM strategies rests primarily on computational models. Most models assume monogenic resistance, but polygenic resistance may be a more appropriate assumption. Conventionally, polygenic models assume selection differentials are constant over successive generations. We present a dynamic method for calculating the selection differentials accounting for the level of resistance and insecticide efficacy. This allows the inclusion of key parameters namely insecticide dosing, insecticide decay and cross resistance, increasing biological and operational realism. Two methods for calculating the insecticide selection differential were compared: truncation (only the most resistant individuals in the population survive) and probabilistic (individual survival depends on their level of resistance). The probabilistic calculation is extendable to multiple gonotrophic cycles, whereby mosquitoes may encounter different insecticides over their life span. A range of IRM strategies of direct policy relevance can be simulated, including the implication of reduced dose mixtures. We describe in detail the calculation and calibration of these models. We demonstrate the ability of the models to simulate a variety of IRM strategies and implications of including these features of the models. In simple IRM strategy evaluations, the truncation and probabilistic models give comparable results to each other and against published polygenic and monogenic models. Analysis of model simulations indicates there is often little difference between sequences or rotations of insecticides. Full-dose mixtures remain the best evaluated IRM strategy. Consistency between models increases confidence in their predictions especially when demonstrating model assumptions do not significantly impact key operational decisions. Using the multiple-gonotrophic cycle model we calculate the age distributions of mosquitoes which provides a framework to link resistance management with disease transmission. Future applications will investigate more scenario-specific evaluations of IRM strategies to inform public health policy.

                <p>by Linda Iris Joseph Tomy, Elif Köksal-Ersöz, Anca Nica, Maxime Yochum, Pascal Benquet, Fabrice Wendling</p>

The therapeutic application of centromedian nucleus stimulation (CMS) has been limited by uncertainties regarding its mechanism of action. In this study, we used stereoelectro-encephalography (SEEG) signals recorded from a patient with refractory epilepsy, caused by focal cortical dysplasia, which is a malformation of cortical development. SEEG recordings revealed that neocortical interictal discharges could be suppressed by CMS. These effects were found to be frequency-dependent: while 50 Hz CMS induced no change in neocortical epileptiform activity, CMS at 70 Hz, 100 Hz and 150 Hz led to periods of suppression of neocortical epileptiform activity. These periods were shown to have different durations depending on the stimulation protocol. We developed a neurophysiologically-plausible thalamocortical model to explain these observations. This model included glutamatergic subpopulations and GABAergic subpopulations in the neocortical and the thalamic compartments. Synaptic inhibition and short-term plasticity mechanisms were integrated into the latter compartment. We hypothesized that the enhanced activation of thalamic inhibitory subpopulations during high frequency CMS (>70Hz) would result in GABA spillover which activated synaptic GABAergic receptors on the thalamocortical relay cells. This decreased the thalamic driving-input to the neocortex, hence suppressing interictal discharges in the dysplastic neocortical tissue. While inhibition of thalamocortical relay cells was maximal for CMS at 70 Hz and 100 Hz, this was not the case for 150 Hz CMS, suggesting that presynaptic GABAergic receptors were activated and that the rate of GABA reuptake was increased. Thus, our model suggests that the transient suppression of the neocortical epileptic activity with CMS may be primarily due to extra-synaptic tonic inhibition in the thalamocortical relay cells. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of high-frequency CMS in epilepsy and pave the way for further research and optimization of this therapeutic approach.

                <p>by Xiaopeng Wei, Jingli Wu, Gaoshi Li, Jiafei Liu, Xi Wu, Chang He</p>

It is a significant step for single cell analysis to identify cell types through clustering single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. However, great challenges still remain due to the inherent high-dimensionality, noise, and sparsity of scRNA-seq data. In this study, scPEDSSC, a deep sparse subspace clustering method based on proximity enhancement, is put forward. The self-expression matrix (SEM), learned from the deep auto-encoder with two part generalized gamma (TPGG) distribution, are adopted to generate the similarity matrix along with its second power. Compared with eight state-of-the-art single-cell clustering methods on twelve real biological datasets, the proposed method scPEDSSC can achieve superior performance in most datasets, which has been verified through a number of experiments.

                <p>by Zhilin Su, Mona M. Garvert, Lei Zhang, Todd A. Vogel, Jo Cutler, Masud Husain, Sanjay G. Manohar, Patricia L. Lockwood</p>

The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has long been associated with economic and social decision-making in neuroimaging studies. Several debates question whether different ventral mPFC (vmPFC) and dorsal mPFC (dmPFC) regions have specific functions or whether there is a gradient supporting social and nonsocial cognition. Here, we tested an unusually large sample of rare participants with focal damage to the mPFC (<i>N</i> = 33), individuals with lesions elsewhere (<i>N</i> = 17), and healthy controls (<i>N</i> = 71) (total <i>N</i> = 121). Participants completed a temporal discounting task to estimate their baseline discounting preferences before learning the preferences of two other people, one who was more temporally impulsive and one more patient. We used Bayesian computational models to estimate baseline discounting and susceptibility to social influence after learning others’ economic preferences. mPFC damage increased susceptibility to impulsive social influence compared to healthy controls and increased overall susceptibility to social influence compared to those with lesions elsewhere. Importantly, voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) of computational parameters showed that this heightened susceptibility to social influence was attributed specifically to damage to the dmPFC (area 9; permutation-based threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) <i>p</i> < 0.025). In contrast, lesions in the vmPFC (areas 13 and 25) and ventral striatum were associated with a preference for seeking more immediate rewards (permutation-based TFCE <i>p</i> < 0.05). We show that the dmPFC is causally implicated in susceptibility to social influence, with distinct ventral portions of mPFC involved in temporal discounting. These findings provide causal evidence for sub-regions of the mPFC underpinning fundamental social and cognitive processes.

                <p>by Fabienne Brutscher, Federico Germani, George Hausmann, Lena Jutz, Konrad Basler</p>

Innate immunity in <i>Drosophila</i> acts as an organismal surveillance system for external stimuli or cellular fitness and triggers context-specific responses to fight infections and maintain tissue homeostasis. However, uncontrolled activation of innate immune pathways can be detrimental. In mammals, innate immune signaling is often overactivated in malignant cells and contributes to tumor progression. <i>Drosophila</i> tumor models have been instrumental in the discovery of interactions between pathways that promote tumorigenesis, but little is known about whether and how the Toll innate immune pathway interacts with oncogenes. Here we use a <i>Drosophila</i> epithelial in vivo model to investigate the interplay between Toll signaling and oncogenic Ras. In the absence of oncogenic Ras (Ras<sup>V12</sup>), Toll signaling suppresses differentiation and induces apoptosis. In contrast, in the context of Ras<sup>V12</sup>, cells are protected from cell death and Dorsal promotes cell survival and proliferation to drive hyperplasia. Taken together, we show that the tissue-protective functions of innate immune activity can be hijacked by pre-malignant cells to induce tumorous overgrowth.

Cancer-driving mutations synergize with inflammatory stress signaling pathways during carcinogenesis. <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> tumor models are increasingly recognized as models to inform conserved molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis with both local and systemic effects of cancer. Although initial discoveries of the Toll-NFκB signaling pathway in development and immunity were pioneered in <i>Drosophila</i>, limited information is available for its role in cancer progression. Using a well-studied cooperative Ras<sup>V12</sup>-driven epithelial-derived tumor model, we here describe functions of Toll-NF-κB signaling in malignant <i>Ras</i><sup>V12</sup><i>, scrib</i><sup>-</sup> tumors. The extracellular Toll pathway components ModSP and PGRP-SA and intracellular signaling Kinase, Pelle/IRAK, are rate-limiting for tumor growth. The Toll pathway NFκB protein Dorsal as well as <i>cactus/I</i>κΒ show elevated expression in tumors with highest expression in invasive cell populations. Oncogenic Ras<sup>V12</sup>, and not loss of <i>scribble,</i> confers increased expression and heterogenous distribution of two Dorsal isoforms, DorsalA and DorsalB, in different tumor cell populations. Mechanistic analyses demonstrates that Dorsal, in concert with the BTB-transcription factor Chinmo, drives growth and malignancy by suppressing differentiation, counteracting apoptosis, and promoting invasion of <i>Ras</i><sup>V12</sup><i>, scrib</i><sup>-</sup> tumors.

                Background Telemedicine has improved adherence to heart failure (HF) treatment, however it has not yet been tailored specifically to address HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Our objective is to undertake a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of existing research studies that focus on telemedicine in HFrEF. Methods We conducted an extensive literature review encompassing trials which included outpatients with HFrEF who underwent telemedicine compared with usual care. We exclude any studies without ejection fraction data. Three bibliographic databases from PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library were utilized in our search from January 1999 to May 2023. The endpoints of interest included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular-related mortality, all-cause hospitalization, and HF-related hospitalization. The Cochrane risk-of-bias (RoB) and the risk of bias in non-randomized studies – of interventions (ROBINS-I) were used for non-randomized or observational studies. To quantitatively analyze the collective findings, a pooled odds ratio (OR) was computed for each outcome. Results Out of the initial pool of 4,947 articles, we narrowed down our analysis to 27 studies, Results showed that telemedicine significantly reduced all-cause mortality (OR: 0.65; 95% CI 0.54 – 0.78; p<0.00001), cardiovascular-related mortality (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58 – 0.80, p < 0.00001), and HF-related hospitalization based on number of events (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64 – 0.94, p = 0.009) as well as number of patients (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 – 0.87, p < 0.0001). Conclusion Telemedicine was shown significantly beneficial in decreasing mortality and hospitalization in HFrEF patients. Future research should focus on standardizing effective telemedicine practices due to the existing variability in methods and clinical situation of the patients.

                Background In the fast-paced digital world, e-learning has become the most convenient medium for higher education institutions to provide scalable education. It is used to provide a flexible educational process through the employment of new technologies. Due to the impact of the war on education in Lebanon during fall 2024-2025 and the suspension of traditional learning, e-learning adoption was the answer to the ministry of education and higher education call for learning continuity. Despite extensive research on e-learning systems, limited empirical evidence exists on factors affecting its success during wartime. This study aims to assesses this success in achieving learning outcomes within the context of higher education under war risks based on the Delone and McLean IS model [1]. Methods A quantitative approach was employed using a structured questionnaire distributed to 429 students and academic staff within higher education institutions in Lebanon. Sampling and data analysis were conducted through structural equation modelling to test hypothesized relationships of the proposed model in SPSS 27.0 using the path analysis. Results The goodness-of-fit measurement of the model represent the desirability and good fit of the model (SRMR = 0. 048). The Cronbach’s α values varying between 0.765 and 0.944, and CR values varying between 0.753, and 0.954, were considered sufficiently error-free and demonstrated the model’s internal consistency and the constructs’ good reliability. The AVE values ranging from 0.509 to 0.808 were all valid, and their convergent validity was fulfilled. The HTMT and the confidence interval empirical criterions are met and constructs discriminant validity is certain. The R2, β, and Q2 measures showed which constructs have strong or weak relationships strength, and large or small predictive relevance. Conclusions According to empirical results, findings reveal that war-perceived risk directly and indirectly affects all model dimensions. Service quality does not significantly affect the intention to use/use, or user satisfaction. Moreover, intention to use/use had no significant impact on the success of e-learning in terms of satisfying its users and attaining their expected learning outcomes. Thus, the war risks imposes the e-learning usage to achieve its outcomes as the only available solution for learning in such circumstances.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-252/v2?src=rss">Optimizing treatment of lepromatous form of leprosy using ofloxacin on top of standard multi-drug therapy in National Referral Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Standard multi-drug therapy (MDT) with duration of 6-12 months is generally effective for treating leprosy. However, in cases of lepromatous (LL) and borderline lepromatous (BL) patients with high bacterial loads and complicated circumtances, prolonged duration treatment is more often observed. As prolonged duration may affect patient adherence negatively, adding ofloxacin to MDT is a promising approach to prevent prolonged treatment. Method This retrospective cohort study investigated the effects of adding ofloxacin to MDT in 21 patients diagnosed with LL or BL leprosy at Cipto Mangunkusumo National Referral Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. Bacterial load and viability were tracked using the Bacteriological Index (BI) and Morphological Index (MI), and were compared using non-parametric Friedman test before and after the patients were given ofloxacin. Findings Adding ofloxacin to MDT led to a significant reductions in both BI and MI. The median MI dropped to zero after six months of combined treatment (p<0.001), with significant differences between baseline and 6, 9, and 12-months. BI also significantly declined (p=0.007), with significant reductions between baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12-month assessments. The proportion of patients reaching an MI of zero also steadily increased. Interpretation Ofloxacin as an adjunctive therapy to MDT substantially improves treatment of leprosy with high bacterial and morphological index. Faster bacterial clearance prevent prolonged treatment duration, potentially improving adherence, outcomes and reducing relapse risk. Ofloxacin is the only second-line leprosy treatment covered by the national health insurance in Indonesia. Earlier initiation of this adjunctive therapy may offer greater benefits.

                Acute cellular rejection remains a significant challenge, affecting 10-40% of liver transplant recipients despite advancements in immunosuppressive therapies. While liver biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing rejection, it is invasive, costly, and associated with potential complications. Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) has emerged as a promising noninvasive biomarker, providing real-time insights into graft health through simple blood sampling. This randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of dd-cfDNA-modulated immunosuppression in reducing acute T-cell-mediated rejection. Participants undergoing live donor liver transplantation will be randomized into two groups. The intervention group will have dd-cfDNA levels monitored on postoperative days 3, 7, 14, 30, and 90, with elevated levels prompting adjustments in immunosuppressive therapy. The control group will follow standard liver function test (LFT)- based protocols. Both groups will undergo liver biopsy only if significant LFT abnormalities are observed. The primary outcome is the incidence of biopsy-proven rejection. Secondary outcomes include the effectiveness of dd-cfDNA for early rejection detection compared to LFTs and an assessment of graft integrity at one year. Additional analyses will explore correlations between dd-cfDNA levels, T-cell markers, and rejection subtypes. This trial hypothesizes that dd-cfDNA monitoring can reduce rejection rates and minimize the need for invasive biopsies, ultimately improving patient outcomes. With no added risk as only routine follow-up blood samples are required, this study offers a potential paradigm shift in noninvasive, personalized post-transplant rejection management.

                Abstract* Background Gingivitis is an inflammation of the gums caused by the buildup of bacterial plaque along the gum line. It can be reduced and prevented by regularly brushing your teeth with a good quality toothpaste. Recently, toothpaste made from natural ingredients has been developed which tends to be popular because it has minimal side effects and a pleasant odor. The aim of this study was to evaluate the herbal toothpaste mix in gingivitis model rats. Methods The product profile of toothpaste mix extracts (TPME) was carried out with organoleptic tests that pay attention to odor, color, taste and texture. in vivo testing was carried out on a sample of 30 Wistar rats modeling gingivitis with tooth brushing treatment twice a day for 7 days in the negative control group (base toothpaste), positive control (commercial toothpaste), toothpaste mix extract (TPME). Profiles of fibroblasts, collagen, angiogenesis counts, monocyte cell counts, polynuclear cell counts were observed by Haematoxylin-eosin staining (HE) and Masson Trichome (MT) staining, with immunohistochemical (IHC) markers CD163 and CD86. Proinflammatory gene expression was also observed in Interleukin-1 Beta (IL-1β) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) genes. Results TPME had a positive response to odor, color, taste and texture characters. Histological observations on days 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7 showed the most significant results on day 7 with an increase in the number of collagen, fibroblasts, angiogenesis, and M2 on CD163 which was in line with the decrease in the number of polynuclear cells, monocytes, M1 on CD86, expression of pro-inflammatory genes IL-1β, and IL-6 which were significantly different from other treatments (p<0.050). Conclusion TPME is able to become a toothpaste product that can treat gingivitis with twice daily application which has the potential to be a promising product to be applied in the future.

                Background Noninvasive conservative treatment of Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) strategies should be carried out before considering invasive treatment options that may lead to irreparable damage. Physical therapy is an effective noninvasive therapy for managing the signs and symptoms of TMDs. To date, the most effective therapeutic approach for managing TMDs pain remains controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the most effective physical therapy for pain management, symptom control, and quality of life improvement in patients with TMDs. Methods A systematic data search from three databases was performed (PubMed, SCOPUS, and Web of Sciences). The modified PICOS questions were used with selected criteria: Studies with randomized controlled trial and case series about adult patients diagnosed with TMDs with physical therapy and outcome of reduction of pain and improving function. Studies written in English were selected for this review. Discrepancies were resolved by other author. Results From 490 studies published between 1986 and 2022 with 79 duplicates, data screening was conducted on 414 studies, and 20 studies were included, comparing physical exercise, postural manipulation with splint therapy or accupuncture were analyze. Most interventions demonstrated statistically significant improvements as measured by the study outcomes. Conclusions Most types of physical therapy demonstrated positive effects on patients with TMDs. Furthermore, physical therapy for both cervical and regional TMJ manipulation can be an alternative long-term treatment for TMDs. Physical therapy is as effective or superior to splint therapy. However, many diverse interventions in these studies, the appropriate treatment must be selected carefully based on the patient’s needs.

                Background Spin-offs play a significant role in organizational development strategies, particularly in Islamic banking, by fostering entrepreneurship, innovation, and Shariah-compliant management practices. Indonesia stands as a pioneer in implementing the dual banking system and has established a spin-off policy to foster the growth of Islamic banking. This study investigates whether the spin-off decision has a significant impact on financing risk in Indonesian Islamic banks. Methods Financing risk is measured by the non-performing financing ratio, while the spin-off decision is represented by a dummy variable equal to 1 for the post-spin-off period and 0 for the pre-spin-off period. This study utilizes data from semi-annual reports of 35 Indonesian Islamic banks and analyzes it using a dynamic panel model with the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) to overcome potential endogeneity issues that might bias the results. Results The findings reveal that spin-offs significantly reduce financing risk, thereby enhancing the financial resilience and boosting investor appeal. Notably, this implies that Islamic banks operating as Islamic windows exhibit a higher level of financing risk compared to fully-fledged Islamic banks. Furthermore, a noteworthy pattern emerges that spin-off Islamic banks with substantial assets demonstrate greater risk in comparison to their counterparts with more modest assets. System GMM also confirmed the result. Conclusions Islamic banks can significantly reduce their financing risks by establishing independent Islamic banks, or spin-offs. Unlike Islamic windows, which are typically integrated within conventional banks and face higher risk levels, standalone Islamic banks offer greater flexibility and control over their operations. Therefore, spin-off policies for Islamic banks appear to be a viable strategy, as independence fosters enhanced risk sensitivity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99389">Follicular helper- and peripheral helper-like T cells drive autoimmune disease in human immune system mice</a></h4>

              
                Human immune system (HIS) mice constructed in various ways are widely used for investigations of human immune responses to pathogens, transplants, and immunotherapies. In HIS mice that generate T cells de novo from hematopoietic progenitors, T cell-dependent multisystem autoimmune disease occurs, most rapidly when the human T cells develop in the native NOD.Cg- <i>Prkdc</i>scid <i>Il2rg</i>tm1Wjl (NSG) mouse thymus, where negative selection is abnormal. Disease develops very late when human T cells develop in human fetal thymus grafts, where robust negative selection is observed. We demonstrate here that PD-1<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> peripheral (Tph) helper-like and follicular (Tfh) helper-like T cells developing in HIS mice can induce autoimmune disease. Tfh-like cells were more prominent in HIS mice with a mouse thymus, in which the highest levels of IgG were detected in plasma, compared to those with a human thymus. While circulating IgG and IgM antibodies were autoreactive to multiple mouse antigens, in vivo depletion of B cells and antibodies did not delay the development of autoimmune disease. Conversely, adoptive transfer of enriched Tfh- or Tph-like cells induced disease and autoimmunity-associated B cell phenotypes in recipient mice containing autologous human APCs without T cells. Tfh/Tph cells from mice with a human thymus expanded and induced disease more rapidly than those originating in a murine thymus, implicating HLA-restricted T cell-APC interactions in this process. Since Tfh, Tph, autoantibodies, and lymphopenia-induced proliferation (LIP) have all been implicated in various forms of human autoimmune disease, the observations here provide a platform for the further dissection of human autoimmune disease mechanisms and therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97105">The epididymis contributes to sperm DNA integrity and early embryo development through Cysteine-Rich Secretory Proteins</a></h4>

              
                Numerous reports showed that the epididymis plays key roles in the acquisition of sperm fertilizing ability but its contribution to embryo development remains less understood. Female mice mated with males with simultaneous mutations in <i>Crisp1</i> and <i>Crisp3</i> genes exhibited normal <i>in vivo</i> fertilization but impaired embryo development. In this work, we found that this phenotype was not due to delayed fertilization, and it was observed in eggs fertilized by epididymal sperm either <i>in vivo</i> or <i>in vitro</i>. Of note, eggs fertilized <i>in vitro</i> by mutant sperm displayed impaired meiotic resumption unrelated to Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations defects during egg activation, supporting potential sperm DNA defects. Interestingly, cauda but not caput epididymal mutant sperm exhibited increased DNA fragmentation, revealing that DNA integrity defects appear during epididymal transit. Moreover, exposing control sperm to mutant epididymal fluid or to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-supplemented control fluid significantly increased DNA fragmentation. This, together with the higher intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels detected in mutant sperm, supports a dysregulation in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis within the epididymis and sperm as the main factor responsible for embryo development failure. These findings highlight the contribution of the epididymis beyond fertilization and identify CRISP1 and CRISP3 as novel factors essential for sperm DNA integrity and early embryo development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102938">Rhythmic circuit function is more robust to changes in synaptic than intrinsic conductances</a></h4>

              
                Circuit function results from both intrinsic conductances of network neurons and the synaptic conductances that connect them. In models of neural circuits, different combinations of maximal conductances can give rise to similar activity. We compared the robustness of a neural circuit to changes in their intrinsic versus synaptic conductances. To address this, we performed a sensitivity analysis on a population of conductance-based models of the pyloric network from the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG). The model network consists of three neurons with nine currents: a sodium current (Na), three potassium currents (Kd, KCa, KA), two calcium currents (CaS and CaT), a hyperpolarization-activated current (H), a non-voltage-gated leak current (leak), and a neuromodulatory current (MI). The model cells are connected by seven synapses of two types, glutamatergic and cholinergic. We produced one hundred models of the pyloric network that displayed similar activities with values of maximal conductances distributed over wide ranges. We evaluated the robustness of each model to changes in their maximal conductances. We found that individual models have different sensitivities to changes in their maximal conductances, both in their intrinsic and synaptic conductances. As expected, the models become less robust as the extent of the changes increases. Despite quantitative differences in their robustness, we found that in all cases, the model networks are more sensitive to the perturbation of their intrinsic conductances than their synaptic conductances.

">Cortical interneurons require JNK signaling for migration regardlessof substrate and topographical environment</a></h4>

              
                During embryonic development, cortical interneurons travel tangentially in migratory streams to reach the cerebral cortex, then turn radially to exit their streams and invade the cortical plate. Migrating cortical interneurons remain in constant communication with both extracellular signals and intracellular machinery to maintain a directed migration into the cortical rudiment. In order to engage in directed migration, cortical interneurons undergo the cell biological process termed nucleokinesis in which interneurons translocate their cell bodies into a cytoplasmic swelling formed in the leading process. Many of the intracellular mechanisms governing the timing of migratory stream exit and cortical plate invasion are poorly understood yet are of fundamental importance to cortical development. We previously uncovered a requirement for the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway in cortical interneuron migration. Disruption of the JNK signaling pathway resulted in a delayed entry of cortical interneurons into the cortex, as well as a premature departure from migratory streams. We are interested in uncovering the mechanisms by which JNK activity coordinates the intracellular processes essential for the guided migration of cortical interneurons. Our data shows, through the use of multiple ex vivo and in vitro assays, that cortical interneurons treated with JNK inhibitor exhibit major deficiencies in nucleokinesis. Additionally, we developed a novel tool to explore cortical interneuron migration using a nanopattern topography. Interneurons grown on nanopatterns have significantly faster migratory speeds and translocate further distances than cells cultured on a flat substrate. Interneurons grown on nanopatterns also display a different subcellular distribution of doublecortin, a known target of JNK signaling involved in microtubule stability and the guided migration of cortical interneurons. Overall, our results highlight the importance of JNK signaling in the guided migration of cortical interneurons.

">The representational geometry of out-of-distribution generalization in primary visual cortex and artificial neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Humans and other animals display a remarkable ability to generalize learned knowledge to novel domains, a phenomenon known as out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. This capability is thought to depend on the format of neural population representations; however, the specific geometrical properties that support OOD generalization and the learning objectives that give rise to them remain poorly understood. Here, we examine the OOD generalization of neural population representations of static grating orientations in the mouse visual cortex. We show that a decoder trained on neural responses within a restricted orientation domain can generalize to held-out orientation domains. The quality of generalization correlates with both the dimensionality and the curvature of the underlying neural representation manifold. Notably, similar OOD-generalizable geometry emerges in a deep neural network trained to predict the next frame in natural video sequences. These findings reveal the representational geometric properties underlying OOD generalization, and suggest that predictive learning objectives offer a promising approach for acquiring generalizable representation geometry.

">Tanycyte Bmal1 sex-specifically regulates weight gain and hypothalamic neurogenesis in female mice</a></h4>

              
                The hypothalamic radial-glia-like tanycyte population plays important and intertwined roles in feeding and metabolism, reproduction, and seasonality. Although these processes are circadian-regulated and clock genes reportedly show robust cycling along the 3rd ventricle, the role of the clock in tanycytes has not yet been examined. We report here that clock genes cycle with much higher amplitude in ventral tanycytes compared to more dorsal ependymocytes of the 3rd ventricle, and that specific disruption of the tanycyte clock can be achieved by adult Bmal1 deletion using the RaxCreER driver. Adult tanycyte Bmal1 deletion did not affect circadian rhythms of wheel-running and sleep, but did inhibit weight gain on high-fat diet in female mice. Altered tanycyte-derived hypothalamic neurogenesis, which can regulate feeding and weight gain by contributing new neurons to nearby feeding-relevant nuclei, is one mechanism that likely contributes to this phenotype. Fate mapping studies showed that female mice have higher baseline tanycyte-derived neurogenesis than males, with many of the resulting neurons localizing to the feeding-relevant arcuate nucleus. Female but not male mice show reduced tanycyte-derived arcuate neurogenesis after adult tanycyte Bmal1 deletion and an increased percentage of newborn arcuate neurons take on a feeding-suppressing POMC neuropeptidergic fate. Thereby, skewing of feeding and satiety promoting fates link the weight homeostasis and neurogenesis effects. Together, our data establish tanycyte Bmal1 as a sexually dimorphic regulator of weight homeostasis, likely mediated at least in part by a female-specific neurogenesis effect in the feeding circuitry.

">Differential changes in the effective neural drive following new motor skill acquisition between vastus lateralis and medialis</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: To investigate whether short-term learning of a new motor task is mediated by changes in common synaptic inputs to motor neurons within and between synergistic muscles. Methods: Seventeen healthy individuals performed 15 repetitions of a complex force-matching task at 10% of a maximal voluntary contraction. Two trials were selected for analysis, the one with the highest force-target error (pre-learning) and the one with the lowest (post-learning). High-density surface electromyograms recorded from vastus medialis (VM) and vastus lateralis (VL) were decomposed into their constituent motor unit spike trains, with individual motor units being tracked between trials. Motor unit discharge behavior and common synaptic oscillations across the delta, alpha, and beta bands were calculated and compared between pre- and post-learning. Results: Force-target matching improved across trials, accompanied by a significant decrease in the coefficient of variation of the inter-spike interval (p < 0.01), while the mean discharge rate remained similar (p > 0.85). The area under the curve within delta (p < 0.003) and alpha (p < 0.004) bands decreased between trials, with no significant changes in the beta band (p > 0.05). Notably, reductions in the alpha band correlated significantly with performance improvements in VL (R = 0.81) but not in VM (R = 0.12). Conclusion: The acquisition of a new motor task is mediated by modulations in common synaptic inputs to motor units, leading to improved force control. Our findings further suggest that these changes in common synaptic inputs, particularly in the alpha band, differ between VM and VL.

">Pathogenic O-GlcNAc dyshomeostasis associated with cortical malformations and hyperactivity</a></h4>

              
                Missense variants in the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) gene have recently been shown to segregate with a syndromic form of intellectual disability (OGT-ID), underscoring the importance of protein O-GlcNAcylation in brain function. However, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms linking ID to potential OGT malfunction--whether developmental, neurophysiological, or both--remain unclear. Here, we present comprehensive analyses encompassing behaviour and brain architecture in a rodent model carrying the C921Y OGT-ID variant. These mice show a range of behavioural deficits, including hyperactivity, impulsivity, and associative learning phenotypes. Structural studies, using micro-computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, revealed reduced skull size, microcephaly, reduced cortical thickness and hypoplastic corpus callosum. These were associated with nodular cortical dysplasia affecting the superficial layers of the cingulate cortex. Mechanistically, quantitative proteomic analyses revealed O-GlcNAc dyshomeostasis associated with distinct perturbed molecular pathways involved in brain development. Taken together, these data reveal neurodevelopmental defects associated with O-GlcNAc dyshomeostasis and provide a platform for dissecting mechanism and treatments of OGT-ID.

<p>This study revealed the unprecedented complexity of dopaminergic peripheral neural systems in gastropod molluscs, with lineage-specific diversification of sensory and modulatory functions.

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In Euthyneuran molluscs, the distribution and plethora of dopamine (DA) functions are likely coupled to the feeding ecology with a broad spectrum of modifications both in the central and peripheral neural systems. However, studies of benthic grazers currently dominate the analysis of DA-mediated signaling, whereas adaptations to pelagic lifestyles and other feeding strategies are unknown. Here, we characterize the distribution of central and peripheral neurons in representatives of distinct ecological groups: the pelagic predatory pteropod <i>Clione limacina</i> (Pteropoda, Gymnosomata) and its prey — <i>Limacina helicina</i> (Pteropoda, Thecosomata), as well as the plankton eater <i>Melibe leonina</i> (Nudipleura, Nudibranchia). By using tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity as a reporter, we mapped their dopaminergic systems. Across all studied species, despite their differences in ecology, small numbers of dopaminergic neurons in the central ganglia contrast to an incredible density of these neurons in the peripheral nervous system, primarily representing sensory-like cells, which are predominantly concentrated in the chemotactic areas and project afferent axons to the central nervous system. Combined with tubulin immunoreactivity, this study illuminates the complexity of sensory signaling and peripheral neural systems in Euthyneuran molluscs with lineage-specific adaptations across different taxonomical and ecological groups.</p>

">Neuralace: Manufacture, Parylene-C Coating, and Mechanical Properties</a></h4>

              
                Subdural electrode arrays have traditionally been used for epilepsy monitoring and surgical planning. With the emergence of brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, these arrays are now being explored for chronic use, leveraging their ability to record subdural signals for neural decoding. Transitioning from short-term implantation in epilepsy monitoring to long-term use in BCIs requires advancements through consideration of the foreign body response to ensure long-term durability and functionality. Biocompatibility challenges, such as fibrotic encapsulation and reactive astrogliosis, highlight the need for conformal subdural implant designs that minimize mechanical stress on neural tissue. This study investigates the mechanical properties of the Neuralace, a novel ultra-thin, high-channel-count mesh-type surface grid. We characterized the stiffness of the silicon-based interposer electrode meshes and evaluated the effects of various geometric configurations and polymeric encapsulation layers on the mechanical performance. Using a full factorial design of experiments framework and a custom low-force four-point bending setup, we identified the design factors that impact the stiffness of Neuralace structures. The results showed highly consistent stiffness measurements. The stiffness values of Neuralace structures ranged from 2.99 N/m to 7.21 N/m, depending on the cell-wall thickness (CWT) of the lace, the orientation angle, and whether the structures were encapsulated with parylene-C (PPXC). Orientation and CWT had the largest impact on the stiffness of the structures, while the effects of PPXC encapsulation were statistically significant but more subtle. The stiffest Neuralace configuration is expected to exert forces approximately 10 to 100 times lower than commercially available subdural implants would when conforming to the radius of the smallest anatomical gyrus. This work demonstrates the feasibility of tailoring the mechanical properties of Neuralace to improve its suitability for chronic neural implantation, providing insights for future design iterations and conformable implant development.

">Deployment of endocytic machinery to periactive zones of nerve terminals is independent of active zone assembly and evoked release</a></h4>

              
                In presynaptic nerve terminals, the endocytic apparatus rapidly restores synaptic vesicles after neurotransmitter release. Many endocytic proteins localize to the periactive zone, a loosely defined area adjacent to active zones. A prevailing model posits that recruitment of these endocytic proteins to the periactive zone is activity-dependent. We here show that periactive zone targeting of endocytic proteins is largely independent of active zone machinery and synaptic activity. At periactive zones of mouse hippocampal synapses and Drosophila neuromuscular junctions, pharmacological or genetic silencing resulted in unchanged or increased levels of endocytic proteins including Dynamin, Amphiphysin, Nervous Wreck, PIPK1{gamma} and AP-180. Similarly, disruption of active zone assembly via genetic ablation of active zone scaffolds at each synapse did not impair the localization of endocytic proteins. Overall, our work indicates that endocytic proteins are constitutively deployed to the periactive zone and supports the existence of independent assembly pathways for active zones and periactive zones.

">The impact of nerve injury on the immune system across the lifespan is sexually dimorphic</a></h4>

              
                Although nerve injury-associated neuroinflammation contributes to neuropathic pain, the long-term impact of such injury on systemic homeostasis and its potential role in pain remains elusive. In this study, we aim to understand the systemic changes that are present alongside chronic pain in nerve-injured male and female mice across their lifespan. We monitored mechanical and cold sensitivity in male and female mice starting at the age of 3-4 months old when they received spared nerve injury (SNI), up to 20-month post-injury. Alongside, we collected blood samples to track changes in immune cells with flow cytometry, and to assess inflammation-related serum proteome using a 111-target Proteome Profiler. We also transferred serum from sham/SNI mice to naive mice to determine the potential of systemic contribution to pain. While nerve injury did not affect immune cell composition in the blood, it triggered a long-lasting disturbance of molecular profile in the serum of sham/SNI mice, in a sex-dependent manner. Compared to sham surgery, nerve injury amplified regulation of inflammatory proteins in males, but slightly reduced it in females. These changes in the serum occurred in parallel with long-lasting mechanical and cold hypersensitivity in the nerve-injured mice. Both male and female SNI serum induced hypersensitivity when transferred to naive mice, regardless of a sex-matched or sex-crossed transfer. Our results highlight that a local nerve injury can have persistent systemic impact. Injury-associated systemic inflammation could contribute to neuropathic pain, but the underlying mechanisms may be sexually dimorphic.

">Structure-Function Mapping of Olfactory Bulb Circuits with Synchrotron X-ray Nanotomography</a></h4>

              
                Information is routed between brain areas via parallel streams. Neurons may share common inputs yet convey distinct information to different downstream targets. Here, we leverage the anatomical organisation of the mouse olfactory bulb (OB), where dozens of projection neurons (mitral and tufted cells, M/TCs) affiliate with a single input unit, a glomerulus. To link functional properties of M/TCs to their anatomical glomerular association at scale, we combine in vivo two-photon (2P) imaging with synchrotron CT anatomical analysis and targeted X-ray nano-holotomography (XNH). Improving XNH resolution for mm3 volumes enables us to reliably identify subcellular features, automatically segment >80,000 cell nuclei in individual experiments, and delineate several hundred functionally imaged projection neurons and their detailed morphology, including up to 20 M/TCs per individual glomerulus ('sister' cells). In over 2400 sister cell pairs, we consistently find that odour response amplitudes to a panel of 47 monomolecular odours are conserved between sister cells, with, however, distinct responses to individual odours. Responses correlated with anatomical features such as cell body position and lateral dendritic arborisation. Thus, sister cells neither simply relay glomerular inputs nor are they dominated by network activity. Instead, they show a 'balanced diversity' in their responses, enabling efficient encoding of odour stimuli whilst retaining the overall structure of odour space. Thus, synchrotron X-ray tomography can reliably link subcellular anatomy to function in a non-destructive way across the mm3 scale. With recent advances in X-ray optics and the emergence of 4th generation synchrotrons, it becomes conceivable to extend this highly accessible approach to entire brain regions with increasing resolution.

">Slow Mechanical Filtering by Outer Hair Cells Enhances Rather than Limits Receptor Potential Kinetics</a></h4>

              
                Mammals achieve extraordinarily sensitive hearing through the active amplification of sound vibrations in the cochlea. Central to this process is the electromotility of outer hair cells (OHCs)-their somatic length changes powered by the membrane motor protein prestin, which converts receptor potentials into mechanical forces. Yet the intrinsic RC (resistance-capacitance) low-pass filtering of the OHC membrane poses a paradox: how can OHCs generate the rapid force changes necessary for effective amplification? One hypothesis suggests that hair bundle adaptation, operating on sub- to tens-of-millisecond timescales, might compensate for the comparatively slower somatic response. In this study, we resolve the paradox by simultaneously recording sound-evoked electrical and mechanical responses in the guinea pig cochlear apex during adaptation-inducing intense sound stimulation. High-speed confocal microscopy paired with AI-based segmentation enabled two-dimensional quantification of the OHC mechanical response-tracking changes in length, width, and area-while extracellular recordings captured receptor potentials. Under control conditions, the inherently slow kinetics of prestin-mediated mechanical changes serve to sharpen receptor potential kinetics. Notably, pharmacological blockade of prestin with salicylate reversed this relationship: the mechanical response kinetics became markedly sharper, while receptor potential kinetics shifted into a sluggish, low-pass regime. These findings demonstrate that the intrinsic low-pass filtering of electromotility is not a limitation but rather a critical feature that preserves rapid electrical transduction, thereby underpinning the exquisite sensitivity of the mammalian auditory system.

">Patient-derived Brain Organoids Reveal Divergent Neuronal Activity Across Subpopulations of Autism Spectrum Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Patient-derived brain organoids have emerged as a powerful model for investigating the mechanisms underlying neurological and psychiatric disorders. They provide novel insights into autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental condition whose underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recent advancements in generating electrophysiological functional 3D brain organoids enable the study of molecular and network-level neuronal activity. Here, we aimed to characterize the neurophysiological underpinnings of ASD by comparing electrophysiological properties of brain organoids derived from eleven individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder - 10 with monogenic syndromic ASD across five genetic subtypes, and 1 with idiopathic ASD - to organoids derived from 4 neurotypical control individuals. We identified distinct differences in baseline activity (resting state) and evoked responses (synaptic plasticity and network dynamics) across ASD subgroups. To comprehensively assess these differences, we applied dimensionality reduction and machine learning (principal component analysis, PCA) to integrate multiple electrophysiological features into a unified framework. Our findings reveal subtype-specific neurophysiological alterations in ASD brain organoids, offering mechanistic insights into ASD heterogeneity and potential applications for early diagnostics, drug screening, and therapeutic development.

Patients with PD and isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, a precursor to PD, had elevated concentrations compared with healthy controls. Sensitivity and specificity were 83% and 65% for PD versus controls and 89% and 62% for isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder versus controls.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of several muscle damage biomarkers.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data from Piemonte and Valle d'Aosta Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (PARALS) were considered for this study. Survival was defined as the time from diagnosis to death, tracheostomy, or the censoring date. Blood levels of potassium, creatinine, creatine kinase, phosphorus, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) diagnosis were evaluated as potential prognostic biomarkers. A Cox model was developed for each biomarker and adjusted for sex, onset age, onset site, and diagnostic delay. Significant findings from PARALS were evaluated in the Pooled Resource Open-Access Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Clinical Trials (PRO-ACT) database. Additionally, a joint model was constructed to evaluate the prognostic role of phosphatemia slope over time using longitudinal data from PRO-ACT.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 1,444 and 1,023 patients were included in the PARALS and PRO-ACT cohorts, respectively. Only creatinine (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.50–0.85) and phosphorus (HR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.04–1.24) showed a significant association with survival in the PARALS cohort. These findings were further validated in the PRO-ACT cohort (creatinine HR = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.13–0.35, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001; phosphorus HR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.13–4.88, <i>p</i> = 0.02). Longitudinal data from the PRO-ACT database showed that an increase of 0.1 mmol/l per month in phosphate levels was also associated with a HR of 8.26 (95% CI = 1.07–96.6, <i>p</i> = 0.044).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Creatininemia was confirmed as a prognostic marker in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Additionally, both phosphatemia levels at diagnosis and its rate of change over time were identified as a potential prognostic marker for ALS. As with other blood biomarkers, phosphate levels are cost-effective and minimally invasive to measure, supporting their potential use in clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Introduction Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease affecting quality of life and causing pruritus. The factors influencing itch and its impact on the quality of life in Thai psoriasis patients are unknown. We aimed to identify these factors and their effect on quality of life. Methods In this questionnaire-based cross-sectional study, we included patients with psoriasis who received treatment at Chulabhorn Hospital in Thailand from January 2019 to July 2021. Interviewer is the non-dermatologist practician. The patient’s information was collected, including demographic data, Itch Numeric Rating Scale (Itch NRS) score, factors affecting itch, and score on the Thai version of the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). We performed descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis. Results Of 100 participants, most (99%) experienced itching, with a moderate degree of pruritus (mean Itch NRS score 6.5 ± 2.6) and a moderate effect on quality of life (mean DLQI score 9.4 ± 6.2). Factors associated with itch aggravation were dry skin (p-value = 0.003) and heat and humidity (p-value = 0.042). The results of binary logistic regression revealed that factors associated with moderate-to-extremely large DLQI scores were itch intensity (no-to-mild vs. moderate-to-severe itch: odds ratio [OR] = 13.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.72–65.32, p < 0.001; and adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 31.17; 95% CI = 4.55–213.36; p < 0.001. Conclusions Our findings revealed that the quality of life among patients with psoriasis is their greatest concern. Eliminating the itch intensity that affects their quality of life is crucial but remains challenging in Thailand.

                <p>by Matthew T. Parker, Samija Amar, José A. Campoy, Kristin Krause, Sergio Tusso, Magdalena Marek, Bruno Huettel, Korbinian Schneeberger</p>

Phenotypic differences between individuals of a species are often caused by differences in gene expression, which are in turn caused by genetic variation. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis is a methodology by which we can identify such causal variants. Scaling eQTL analysis is costly due to the expense of generating mapping populations, and the collection of matched transcriptomic and genomic information. We developed a rapid eQTL analysis approach using single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing of gametes from a small number of heterozygous individuals. Patterns of inherited polymorphisms are used to infer the recombinant genomes of thousands of individual gametes and identify how different haplotypes correlate with variation in gene expression. Applied to Arabidopsis pollen nuclei, our approach uncovers both <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-eQTLs, ultimately mapping variation in a master regulator of sperm cell development that affects the expression of hundreds of genes. This establishes snRNA-sequencing as a powerful, cost-effective method for the mapping of meiotic recombination, addressing the scalability challenges of eQTL analysis and enabling eQTL mapping in specific cell-types.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Neuroimaging is routinely utilized to identify new inflammatory activity in multiple sclerosis (MS). A large language model to classify narrative magnetic resonance imaging reports in the electronic health record (EHR) as discrete data could provide significant benefits for MS research. The objectives of the current study were to develop such a prompt and to illustrate its research applications through a common clinical scenario: monitoring response to B-cell depleting therapy (BCDT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>An institutional ecosystem that securely connects healthcare data with ChatGPT4 was applied to clinical MS magnetic resonance imaging reports in a single institutional EHR (2000–2022). A prompt (msLesionprompt) was developed and iteratively refined to classify the presence or absence of new T2-weighted lesions (newT2w) and contrast-enhancing lesions (CEL). The multistep validation included evaluating efficiency (time and cost), comparison with manually annotated reports using standard confusion matrix, and application to identifying predictors of newT2w/CEL after BCDT start.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Accuracy of msLesionprompt was high for detection of newT2w (97%) and CEL (96.8%). All 14,888 available reports were categorized in 4.13 hours ($28); 79% showed no newT2w or CEL. Data extracted showed expected suppression of new activity by BCDT (&gt;97% monitoring magnetic resonance images after an initial “rebaseline” scan). Neighborhood poverty (Area Deprivation Index) was identified as a predictor of inflammatory activity (newT2w: OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.10–2.59, <i>p</i> = 0.017; CEL: OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.01–2.34, <i>p</i> = 0.046).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Extracting discrete information from narrative imaging reports using an large language model is feasible and efficient. This approach could augment many real-world analyses of MS disease evolution and treatment response. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Dhar et al. show that heterozygous loss of the frequently mutated epigenetic modifier KMT2D downregulates NCOR2 expression to promote medulloblastoma (MB) genesis and that KMT2D-deficient MB can be impeded by combinatory pharmacological inhibition of the enhancer-decommissioning lysine demethylase LSD1 and OXPHOS.

                Weissenrieder et al. show that mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) deletion reduces growth and metastasis of murine KPCY cells by reducing cell-autologous induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Induction of EMT with Snail expression or TGF-β treatment rescues growth and metastatic deficits. These findings have implications for therapeutic development in PDAC.

                The role of peroxisomes in tissue-resident macrophages remains unclear. Matsushita et al. reveal that peroxisomes are essential for alveolar macrophage (AM) development by preventing lipotoxicity and maintaining mitochondrial fitness. Our findings highlight a metabolic dependency of peroxisomes on homeostatic AM survival and bioenergetics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/77616">Deep sequencing of yeast and mouse tRNAs and tRNA fragments using OTTR</a></h4>

              
                Among the major classes of RNAs in the cell, tRNAs remain the most difficult to characterize via deep sequencing approaches, as tRNA structure and nucleotide modifications can each interfere with cDNA synthesis by commonly-used reverse transcriptases (RTs). Here, we benchmark a recently-developed RNA cloning protocol, termed Ordered Two-Template Relay (OTTR), to characterize intact tRNAs and tRNA fragments in budding yeast and in mouse tissues. We show that OTTR successfully captures both full-length tRNAs and tRNA fragments in budding yeast and in mouse reproductive tissues without any prior enzymatic treatment, and that tRNA cloning efficiency can be further enhanced via AlkB-mediated demethylation of modified nucleotides. As with other recent tRNA cloning protocols, we find that a subset of nucleotide modifications leave misincorporation signatures in OTTR datasets, enabling their detection without any additional protocol steps. Focusing on tRNA cleavage products, we compare OTTR with several standard small RNA-Seq protocols, finding that OTTR provides the most accurate picture of tRNA fragment levels by comparison to "ground truth" Northern blots. Applying this protocol to mature mouse spermatozoa, our data dramatically alter our understanding of the small RNA cargo of mature mammalian sperm, revealing a far more complex population of tRNA fragments - including both 5′ and 3′ tRNA halves derived from the majority of tRNAs – than previously appreciated. Taken together, our data confirm the superior performance of OTTR to commercial protocols in analysis of tRNA fragments, and force a reappraisal of potential epigenetic functions of the sperm small RNA payload.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99116">Major nuclear locales define nuclear genome organization and function beyond A and B compartments</a></h4>

              
                Models of nuclear genome organization often propose a binary division into active versus inactive compartments yet typically overlook nuclear bodies. Here, we integrated analysis of sequencing and image-based data to compare genome organization in four human cell types relative to three different nuclear locales: the nuclear lamina, nuclear speckles, and nucleoli. Although gene expression correlates mostly with nuclear speckle proximity, DNA replication timing correlates with proximity to multiple nuclear locales. Speckle attachment regions emerge as DNA replication initiation zones whose replication timing and gene composition vary with their attachment frequency. Most facultative LADs retain a partially repressed state as iLADs, despite their positioning in the nuclear interior. Knock out of two lamina proteins, Lamin A and LBR, causes a shift of H3K9me3-enriched LADs from lamina to nucleolus, and a reciprocal relocation of H3K27me3-enriched partially repressed iLADs from nucleolus to lamina. Thus, these partially repressed iLADs appear to compete with LADs for nuclear lamina attachment with consequences for replication timing. The nuclear organization in adherent cells is polarized with nuclear bodies and genomic regions segregating both radially and relative to the equatorial plane. Together, our results underscore the importance of considering genome organization relative to nuclear locales for a more complete understanding of the spatial and functional organization of the human genome.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95545">Changes in local mineral homeostasis facilitate the formation of benign and malignant testicular microcalcifications</a></h4>

              
                Testicular microcalcifications consist of hydroxyapatite and have been associated with an increased risk of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) but are also found in benign cases such as loss-of-function variants in the phosphate transporter <i>SLC34A2</i>. Here, we show that fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a regulator of phosphate homeostasis, is expressed in testicular germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS), embryonal carcinoma (EC), and human embryonic stem cells. FGF23 is not glycosylated in TGCTs and therefore cleaved into a C-terminal fragment which competitively antagonizes full-length FGF23. Here, <i>Fgf23</i> knockout mice presented with marked calcifications in the epididymis, spermatogenic arrest, and focally germ cells expressing the osteoblast marker Osteocalcin (gene name: <i>Bglap</i>, protein name). Moreover, the frequent testicular microcalcifications in mice with no functional androgen receptor and lack of circulating gonadotropins are associated with lower <i>Slc34a2</i> and higher <i>Bglap</i>/<i>Slc34a1</i> (protein name: NPT2a) expression compared with wild-type mice. In accordance, human testicular specimens with microcalcifications also have lower <i>SLC34A2</i> and a subpopulation of germ cells express phosphate transporter NPT2a, Osteocalcin, and RUNX2 highlighting aberrant local phosphate handling and expression of bone-specific proteins. Mineral disturbance in vitro using calcium or phosphate treatment induced deposition of calcium phosphate in a spermatogonial cell line and this effect was fully rescued by the mineralization inhibitor pyrophosphate. In conclusion, testicular microcalcifications arise secondary to local alterations in mineral homeostasis, which in combination with impaired Sertoli cell function and reduced levels of mineralization inhibitors due to high alkaline phosphatase activity in GCNIS and TGCTs facilitate osteogenic-like differentiation of testicular cells and deposition of hydroxyapatite.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88794">Barcode-free multiplex plasmid sequencing using Bayesian analysis and nanopore sequencing</a></h4>

              
                Plasmid construction is central to life science research, and sequence verification is arguably its costliest step. Long-read sequencing has emerged as a competitor to Sanger sequencing, with the principal benefit that whole plasmids can be sequenced in a single run. Nevertheless, the current cost of nanopore sequencing is still prohibitive for routine sequencing during plasmid construction. We develop a computational approach termed Simple Algorithm for Very Efficient Multiplexing of Oxford Nanopore Experiments for You (SAVEMONEY) that guides researchers to mix multiple plasmids and subsequently computationally de-mixes the resultant sequences. SAVEMONEY defines optimal mixtures in a pre-survey step, and following sequencing, executes a post-analysis workflow involving sequence classification, alignment, and consensus determination. By using Bayesian analysis with prior probability of expected plasmid construction error rate, high-confidence sequences can be obtained for each plasmid in the mixture. Plasmids differing by as little as two bases can be mixed as a single sample for nanopore sequencing, and routine multiplexing of even six plasmids per 180 reads can still maintain high accuracy of consensus sequencing. SAVEMONEY should further democratize whole-plasmid sequencing by nanopore and related technologies, driving down the effective cost of whole-plasmid sequencing to lower than that of a single Sanger sequencing run.

">Charting the nanotopography of inner hair cell synapses using MINFLUX nanoscopy</a></h4>

              
                For us to hear, the cochlea encodes sounds into neural signals at synapses of inner hair cells (IHCs) and the auditory nerve with remarkable fidelity. To achieve the high rates of temporally precise synaptic transmission over long periods of time, IHCs employ sophisticated ribbon-type active zones (AZ). In order for us to understand synaptic sound encoding, we need to decipher the underpinning molecular topography of these synapse which had remained challenging due to technological limitations. Here we applied 3-dimensional minimal flux optical nanoscopy to mouse IHC synapses to chart the position of key pre- and postsynaptic proteins with single digit nanometre resolution of imaging. We demonstrate that nanoclusters of channels and interacting proteins govern the topography of AZs and postsynaptic densities (PSDs). We count synaptic proteins, their nanoclusters and determine their spatial organization feeding into computational modelling of AZ function. In conclusion, this study reveals a nanocluster-based molecular AZ and PSD topography, likely serving as functional modules in synaptic sound encoding.

">Personalized Biomarkers of Multiscale Functional Alterations in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) presents with substantial inter-patient variability in clinical and neuroimaging manifestations. This multicenter study examined inter-individual differences in spatial patterns of intrinsic brain function in TLE using normative modeling at multiple spatial scales and evaluated the effectiveness of individual functional deviations for clinical diagnosis and postsurgical outcome prediction. We analyzed multimodal MRI data on 298 healthy controls, 282 TLE patients, and 45 disease controls with extratemporal epilepsy. Cortical function was profiled at local, regional, and global scales using brain signal variability, regional homogeneity, and node strength. We estimated patient-specific W-score maps to index deviations from normative metrics. Compared to healthy controls, patients with TLE showed considerable variations in patterns of functional alterations across the cortex, with the highest overlap in the ipsilateral mesiotemporal regions. Connectome-based simulation revealed the paralimbic and medial default mode regions as key disease epicenters. Functional changes were primarily underpinned by superficial white matter anomalies. Supervised pattern learning achieved classification AUCs of 0.76 for TLE versus disease controls, 0.74 for left versus right TLE, and 0.63 for seizure-free versus non-seizure-free TLE, with greater contralateral temporal functional deviations correlating with unfavorable postsurgical seizure outcome. Our findings reveal the heterogeneous impact of TLE on intrinsic cortical function. These biomarkers hold promise for clinical translation, guiding precision therapeutics and enhancing presurgical decision-making in TLE.

">The representation of mood in primate anterior insular cortex</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how the brain reflects and shapes mood requires resolving the disconnect between behavioral measures of mood that can only be made in humans (typically based on subjective reports of happiness) and detailed measures of brain activity only available in animals. To achieve this, we developed a universal mood model to predict behavioral fluctuations in human subjective happiness as individuals experienced wins and losses during a gambling task. Next, we investigated how this operationalization of mood was reflected in the brains of two monkeys engaged in the same gambling task. We found a remarkable alignment between human mood model signatures and the persistent responses of units in monkey anterior insular cortex, including a matched timescale of integration across events. In comparison, the same signatures were only weakly reflected in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, suggesting that insular mood representations do not trivially follow from a signal (like arousal) broadcast to all higher brain areas. These results are consistent with a model in which the brain transforms experiences into mood by integrating events through a recurrently connected network of excitatory and inhibitory pools of neurons. These are among the first detailed insights into the nature of putative mood representations in the primate brain.

Significance StatementHow does the brain shape mood? Answering this question is difficult because measures of mood require asking humans how they feel, but our best measures of brain activity are restricted to nonhuman animals. To overcome this challenge, we developed a model to link across these different types of data as human happiness fluctuated following wins and losses during a gambling game, and monkeys played the same game. We found a strong neural correlate of human happiness reflected in the persistent responses of neurons in monkey anterior insular cortex, a brain area implicated in the conscious experience of feelings. These results suggest that the brain may convert experiences into mood by integrating experiences through a network of recurrently connected neurons.

">Neural trajectories reveal orchestration of cortical coding underlying natural language composition</a></h4>

              
                Language is a hierarchically structured system that enables humans to communicate complex meanings. Despite recent advances, the neurocomputational mechanism underlying the composition of natural language remains unclear. Building on the neural population theory, we investigated how neural trajectories in latent spaces underpin natural language composition that integrates diverse lexical content and syntactic relations. We found that neural trajectories derived from human neocortical responses show an orchestration of distinct coding strategies during naturalistic story comprehension. Neural latent geometry is primarily associated with syntactic relations and exhibits more efficient compression relative to lexical content. We further demonstrate that these trajectories can be simulated by brain-inspired computing systems with near-critical dynamics and a preference for historical information. Overall, by positioning structure-based integration as a key computation of natural language comprehension, our findings provide a novel perspective on the mechanism underlying real-world language use and emphasize the importance of contextual information in the development of brain-inspired intelligent systems.

Our results show that female infants demonstrate more distinct modular structures between these 2 conditions, possibly implying relative quiet and restful sleep compared with male infants.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The human brain processes visual input across various spatial frequency (SF) ranges to extract emotional cues. Prior studies have extensively explored SF processing in facial expressions, yielding partly conflicting results. However, bodily expressions, which provide complementary emotional and survival-relevant cues, remain unexplored. We investigated the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of low (LSF), high (HSF), and broad spatial frequency (BSF) components in fearful versus neutral bodily postures. Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, we examined brain activity in 20 participants viewing SF-filtered images of bodily expressions in a semi-passive task. A multivariate “searchlight” analysis based on Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis was employed to decode the non-linear activation patterns associated with each SF band. Our findings reveal that SF processing engages distinct neural networks in response to fearful bodily expressions. BSF stimuli activated a widespread network, including the amygdala, pulvinar, frontal, and temporal cortices. These findings suggest a general threat-detection system integrating information across all SFs. HSF stimuli engaged cortical regions associated with detailed emotional evaluation and motor planning, such as the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and premotor areas, suggesting that processing fine-grained fear cues involves computationally demanding networks related to emotional resonance and action preparation. In contrast, LSF stimuli primarily activated motor-preparatory regions linked to rapid, action-oriented responses, highlighting the brain prioritization of quick readiness to low-detail threats. Notably, the amygdala showed no SF selectivity, supporting its role as a generalized “relevance detector” in emotional processing. The present study demonstrates that the brain flexibly adapts its SF processing strategy based on the visual details available in fearful bodily expressions, underscoring the complexity and adaptability of emotional processing from bodily signals.</span>

                <p>Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons are characterized by specific morphological and electrophysiological properties. First, in ~90% of the cases, their axon arises from an axon-bearing dendrite (ABD) at highly variable distances from the soma. Second, they display a highly regular pattern of spontaneous activity (aka pacemaking) and a broad action potential (AP) that faithfully back-propagates through the entire dendritic arbor. In previous studies (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B30">Moubarak et al., 2019</cross-ref>;   <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B31">Moubarak et al., 2022</cross-ref>), we demonstrated that the presence of a high density of sodium current in the ABD and the complexity of this dendrite played a critical role in the robustness of pacemaking and setting the half-width of the AP. In the current study, we investigated the postnatal development of both morphology and AP shape in SNc DA neurons in order to determine when and how the mature electrophysiological phenotype of these neurons was achieved. To do so, we performed electrophysiological recordings of SNc DA neurons at four postnatal ages (P3, P7, P14, P21) and fully reconstructed their dendritic and proximal axon morphology. Our results show that several morphological parameters, including the length of the ABD, display abrupt changes between P7 and P14, such that a mature morphology is reached by P14. We then showed that AP shape followed a similar timecourse. Using realistic multicompartment Hodgkin&ndash;Huxley modeling, we then demonstrated that the rapid morpho-electrical maturation of SNc DA neurons likely arises from synergistic increases in dendritic length and in somatodendritic sodium channel density.</p>

                <p>What the basal ganglia do is an oft-asked question; answers range from the selection of actions to the specification of movement to the estimation of time. Here, I argue that <I>how</I> the basal ganglia do what they do is a less-asked but equally important question. I show that the output regions of the basal ganglia create a stringent computational bottleneck, both structurally, because they have far fewer neurons than do their target regions, and dynamically, because of their tonic, inhibitory output. My proposed solution to this bottleneck is that the activity of an output neuron is setting the weight of a basis function, a function defined by that neuron&rsquo;s synaptic contacts. I illustrate how this may work in practice, allowing basal ganglia output to shift cortical dynamics and control eye movements via the superior colliculus. This solution can account for troubling issues in our understanding of the basal ganglia: why we see output neurons increasing their activity during behavior, rather than only decreasing as predicted by theories based on disinhibition, and why the output of the basal ganglia seems to have so many codes squashed into such a tiny region of the brain.</p>

                Heavy metal contamination has gradually become a highly significant global issue due to its continual existence in the environment and bioaccumulation in the ecosystems, posing deleterious risks to human health. This review aims to investigate the sources, pathways, and toxicological impacts of heavy metals such as cadmium, lead, mercury, and arsenic, elucidating their health consequences and plausible mitigation strategies. Furthermore, the review explores the dual origins of heavy metal contamination; natural geological processes and anthropogenic activities such as industrial emissions, mining, and agricultural practices. These heavy metals seep into soil, water, and food chains, leading to bioaccumulation, bio-magnification and causing significant health risks, including cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and reproductive toxicity. Additionally, the addition of indigenous case studies from Nigeria, such as lead poisoning in Zamfara State and contamination in the Great Kwa River of Cross Rivers State underscores the disproportionate impact of heavy metal pollution in developing nations. These case studies reveal the socio-economic and environmental dimensions of the issue, providing a contextual understanding of region-specific vulnerabilities and health outcomes. To address these problems, the review evaluates already existing mitigation strategies, including chelation therapy and phytoremediation, while proposing sustainable, cost-effective solutions for reducing exposure and mitigating impacts. It emphasizes the importance of integrative approaches involving policy, community engagement, and technological innovations to fight heavy metal contamination effectively. In conclusion, this seminar contributes to the understanding of heavy metal toxicity, giving and showcasing very much important insights into the sources and health implications of contamination. By integrating theoretical perspectives with practical solutions, this review provides a robust framework for informing policy makers and advancing sustainable environmental management practices.

                Background Natural products databases are well-structured data sources that offer new molecular development opportunities in drug discovery, agrochemistry, food, cosmetics, and several other research disciplines or chemical industries. The crescent world’s interest in the development of these databases is related to the exploration of chemical diversity in geographical regions with rich biodiversity. Methods In this work, we introduce and discuss Nat-UV DB, the first natural products database from a coastal zone of Mexico. We discuss its construction, curation, and chemoinformatic characterization of their content, and chemical space coverage compared with other compound databases, like approved drugs, and other Mexican (BIOFACQUIM and UNIIQUIM databases) and the Latin American natural products database (LaNAPDB). Results Nat-UV DB comprises 227 compounds that contain 112 scaffolds, of which 52 are not present in previous natural product databases. The compounds present in Nat-UV DB have a similar size, flexibility, and polarity to previously reported natural products and approved drug datasets. Conclusions Nat-UV DB compounds have a higher structural and scaffold diversity than the approved drugs, but they have low structural and scaffold diversity in contrast with other natural products in the reference datasets. This database serves as a valuable addition to the global natural products landscape, bridging gaps in exploring biodiversity-rich regions.

                Objectives In an increasingly interconnected world, the effectiveness of health security (HeS) is pivotal in shaping informed health policies and enhancing public health outcomes. This study aims to analyses HeS in 27 non-EU European countries, identifying key priorities and trends, benchmarking against African and Eastern Mediterranean regions (EMR), and ranking and clustering health security performance to inform targeted interventions. Methods Utilizing 2019, 2021, and aggregated 2017–2021 data from six Global Health Security Index indicators, this study applied an integrated Entropy-CoCoSo-K-means framework. The Entropy method was employed to identify health security (HeS) priorities and trends in Non-EU countries, enabling cross-regional comparisons with African and EMR regions to highlight priority shifts and disparities. The Entropy-CoCoSo (Combined Compromise Solution) model generated dynamic rankings, while K-means clustering categorized countries into five risk clusters (high to dangerous). This integration facilitated cross-national dynamic rankings and cluster analyses, informing targeted interventions across Non-EU countries. Results Entropy analysis reveals that detection and reporting emerged as the most critical indicator (weight: 0.388), reflecting disparities in surveillance. The risk environment remains minimally influential (0.067), highlighting consistent vulnerabilities to external threats. Compliance with norms shows a sharp rise (0.091 → 0.123), indicating emerging regulatory gaps or uneven adherence to health standards post-2019. Cross-regional comparisons highlighted a focus on detection and reporting in non-EU countries versus an emphasis on prevention in Africa and healthcare infrastructure prioritization in the EMR. Ranking and clustering revealed stark disparities: Armenia, Norway, and the UK consistently ranked “High,” In contrast, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Tajikistan (Cluster 5: “Dangerous”) exhibited systemic weaknesses. Conclusion This study underscores the need for tailored policies to address non-EU Europe’s evolving HeS challenges. Harmonizing surveillance systems, scaling preventive measures, and bridging compliance gaps are critical. Regional collaboration and resource reallocation to low-performing nations are essential to mitigate disparities.

                Background With rapid industrialization, urbanization, and population explosion in sub-Saharan Africa including Uganda, the population has experienced increased exposure to environmental lead subsequently causing extreme (>50μg/dL) and elevated (< 50μg/dL) blood lead levels. For example, means (Blood Lead levels) of 332μg/dL, 120μg/dL, 25μg/dL,11μg/dL, and 10μg/dL in children under 18 years of age in Nigeria, DR Congo, South Africa, Sudan, and Uganda respectively are reported. Susceptibility to lead toxicity correlates with one’s nutrition status, age, and genetics. This study expounded susceptibility to lead toxicity by relating blood lead levels, delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) enzyme activity, and genetic variations of proteins that code for ALAD in urban children of Uganda aged between 6 and 60 months. Methods A total of 198 blood samples from randomly selected participants, children residing in the Katanga slum of Kampala, Uganda, were analyzed in duplicates for blood lead levels (BLL) on an atomic absorption spectrophotometer, Hemoglobin (Hb) levels, and ALAD enzyme activity were analyzed on a spectrophotometer before DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction, and restriction fragment length digestion for ALAD polymorphism. The results are presented below. Results Geometric means of BLL (10.55μg/dL, SD = 7.4), Hb (7.85g/dL, SD = 1.3) and ALAD enzyme activity (37.15 units/L BLL, S. D = 9.7), corresponded to samples that coded for ALAD1 allele (99.5%) compared to the 0.5% that coded for ALAD2 with BLL (14.5μg/ dL, SD = 4.7), Hb (6.1 g/dL), ALAD enzyme activity (33.8 units/L, SD=1.45). There was a significant relationship with a negative linear correlation between BLL, Hb (status, and ALAD enzyme activity in the three isozymes (ALAD1-1, ALAD1-2, and ALAD2-2) in the strength of ALAD1-1 (r = 0.42, p-value = 0.02) ˂ ALAD1-2 (r = 0.62, effective size = 0.43, p-value = ˂ 0.001) ˂ ALAD2-2 (r = 0.67, effective size = 0.86, p-value = ˂ 0.001).

                Dental implants provide a reliable treatment option for completely or partially edentulous patients. In case of a membrane perforation, the gap can be closed using a piece of resorbable collagen membrane or by suturing the Schneiderian membrane using a resorbable suture. The present study shows a new development in this technique, which involves modifying the design of the absorbable membrane and using pins to fix the membrane. This study concluded that the novel design of the collagen membrane and its fixation with the pins led to greater stability of the bone graft and led to subsequent bone gain that enables dental implantation. Still, this technique requires a histological study to determine the nature of the bone formed.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Type 3c diabetes mellitus (T3cDM) is a subtype that develops following pancreatic diseases, such as pancreatitis, impairing both exocrine and endocrine functions. Its management is challenging owing to exocrine enzyme deficiencies. Although plants have long been used for diabetes treatment, research on their role in T3cDM, particularly in exocrine enzymes, remains limited. The exact mechanisms by which enzymes and hormones interact remain unclear. Thus, this study aims to explore the role of Orthosiphon stamineus (OS) in glucose regulation by exploring both pancreatic endocrine and exocrine functions in the T3cDM Wistar Bonn/Kobori (WBN/Kob) pancreatitis rat model. Methods This protocol describes a planned, single-blind, randomized, controlled study conducted on animals to determine the efficacy of OS in regulating exocrine and endocrine pancreatic functions in a pancreatitis-induced WBN/Kob rat model. The groups will consist of control and different treatment groups. The duration of treatment is one month. A glucose tolerance test will be conducted orally before and after OS treatment. Blood glucose and insulin levels will be collected at different time points. Exocrine enzymes (amylase, lipase, and trypsinogen) and endocrine hormones (insulin, glucagon, ghrelin, pancreatic polypeptide, and somatostatin) will be measured in the serum. Hemoglobin A1c and lipid-soluble vitamins will also be evaluated. Results This pre-clinical study aims to explore pancreatic endocrine hormones and exocrine functions in response to OS treatment in rats with T3cDM pancreatitis. Body weight, diarrhea, and any adverse effects will be assessed as the secondary outcomes. Statistical analysis will be conducted to determine the significance of differences between the two groups. Conclusion This study protocol examines the efficacy of OS in addressing both exocrine and endocrine pancreatic dysfunction, ultimately aiding in blood glucose regulation. The findings of this study may help improve the health strategies of T3cDM patients and enhance patient outcomes.

Symmetry principles play an important role in geometry, and physics, allowing for the reduction of complicated systems to simpler, more comprehensible models that preserve the system’s features of interest. Biological systems are often highly complex and may consist of a large number of interacting parts. Using symmetry fibrations, the relevant symmetries for biological “message-passing” networks, we introduce a scheme, called Complexity Reduction by Symmetry or CoReSym, to reduce the gene regulatory networks of <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> bacteria to core networks in a way that preserves the dynamics and uncovers the computational capabilities of the network. Gene nodes in the original network that share isomorphic input trees are collapsed by the fibration into equivalence classes called fibers, whereby nodes that receive signals with the same “history” belong to one fiber and synchronize. Then we reduce the networks to its minimal computational core via k-core decomposition. This computational core consists of a few strongly connected components or “signal vortices,” in which signals can cycle through. While between them, these “signal vortices” transmit signals in a feedforward manner. These connected components perform signal processing and decision making in the bacterial cell by employing a series of genetic toggle-switch circuits that store memory, plus oscillator circuits. These circuits act as the central computation device of the network, whose output signals then spread to the rest of the network. Our reduction method opens the door to narrow the vast complexity of biological systems to their minimal parts in a systematic way by using fundamental theoretical principles of symmetry.

                <p>by Basile Confavreux, Everton J. Agnes, Friedemann Zenke, Henning Sprekeler, Tim P. Vogels</p>

Synaptic plasticity is a key player in the brain’s life-long learning abilities. However, due to experimental limitations, the mechanistic link between synaptic plasticity rules and the network-level computations they enable remain opaque. Here we use evolutionary strategies (ES) to meta learn local co-active plasticity rules in large recurrent spiking networks with excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons, using parameterizations of increasing complexity. We discover rules that robustly stabilize network dynamics for all four synapse types acting in isolation (E-to-E, E-to-I, I-to-E and I-to-I). More complex functions such as familiarity detection can also be included in the search constraints. However, our meta learning strategy begins to fail for co-active rules of increasing complexity, as it is challenging to devise loss functions that effectively constrain network dynamics to plausible solutions <i>a priori</i>. Moreover, in line with previous work, we can find multiple degenerate solutions with identical network behaviour. As a local optimization strategy, ES provides one solution at a time and makes exploration of this degeneracy cumbersome. Regardless, we can glean the interdependecies of various plasticity parameters by considering the covariance matrix learned alongside the optimal rule with ES. Our work provides a proof of principle for the success of machine-learning-guided discovery of plasticity rules in large spiking networks, and points at the necessity of more elaborate search strategies going forward.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012391">Efficient discovery of frequently co-occurring mutations in a sequence database with matrix factorization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michael Robert Kolar, Debasis Mitra, Valerie Kobzarenko</p>

We have developed a robust method for efficiently tracking multiple co-occurring mutations in a sequence database. Evolution often hinges on the interaction of several mutations to produce significant phenotypic changes that lead to the proliferation of a variant. However, identifying numerous simultaneous mutations across a vast database of sequences poses a significant computational challenge. Our approach leverages a matrix factorization technique to automatically and efficiently pinpoint subsets of positions where co-mutations occur, appearing in a substantial number of sequences within the database. We validated our method using SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domains, comprising approximately seven hundred thousand sequences of the Spike protein, demonstrating superior performance compared to a reasonably exhaustive brute-force method. Furthermore, we explore the biological significance of the identified <i>co-mutational positions</i> (CMPs) and their potential impact on the virus’s evolution and functionality, identifying key mutations in Delta and Omicron variants. This analysis underscores the significant role of identified CMPs in understanding the evolutionary trajectory. By tracking the “birth" and “death" of CMPs, we can elucidate the persistence and impact of specific groups of mutations across different viral strains, providing valuable insights into the virus’ adaptability and thus, possibly aiding vaccine design strategies.

                <p>by Juliana Zimmermann, Clara Boudriot, Christiane Eipert, Gabriel Hoffmann, Rachel Nuttall, Viktor Neumaier, Moritz Bonhoeffer, Sebastian Schneider, Lena Schmitzer, Jan Kufer, Stephan Kaczmarz, Dennis M Hedderich, Andreas Ranft, Daniel Golkowski, Josef Priller, Claus Zimmer, Rüdiger Ilg, Gerhard Schneider, Christine Preibisch, Christian Sorg, Benedikt Zott</p>

In the mammalian brain, the directed motion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-flux) is instrumental in the distribution and removal of solutes. Changes in total cerebral blood volume (CBV) have been hypothesized to drive CSF-flux. We tested this hypothesis in two multimodal brain imaging experiments in healthy humans, in which we drove large changes in total CBV by neuronal burst-suppression under anesthesia or by transient global vasodilation in a hypercapnic challenge. We indirectly monitored CBV changes with a high temporal resolution based on associated changes in total brain volume by functional MRI (fMRI) and measured cerebral blood flow by arterial spin-labeling. Relating CBV-sensitive signals to fMRI-derived measures of macroscopic CSF flow across the basal cisternae, we demonstrate that increasing total CBV extrudes CSF from the skull and decreasing CBV allows its influx. Moreover, CSF largely stagnates when CBV is stable. Together, our results establish the direct coupling between total CBV changes and CSF-flux.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003137">Normal locomotion in zebrafish lacking the sodium channel NaV1.4 suggests that the need for muscle action potentials is not universal</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chifumi Akiyama, Souhei Sakata, Fumihito Ono</p>

Extensive studies over decades have firmly established the concept that action potentials (APs) in muscles are indispensable for muscle contraction. To re-examine the significance of APs, we generated zebrafish lacking APs by editing the <i>scn4aa</i> and <i>scn4ab</i> genes, which together encode NaV1.4 (NaVDKO), using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Surprisingly, the escape response of NaVDKOs to tactile stimuli, both in the embryonic and adult stages, was indistinguishable from that of wild-type (WT) fish. Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging using the calcium indicator protein GCaMP revealed that myofibers isolated from WT fish could be excited by the application of acetylcholine (ACh), even in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) indicating that NaVs are dispensable for skeletal muscle contraction in zebrafish. Mathematical simulations showed that the end-plate potential was able to elicit a change in membrane potential large enough to activate the dihydropyridine receptors of the entire muscle fiber owing to the small fiber size and the disseminated distribution of neuromuscular synapses in both adults and embryos. Our data demonstrate that NaVs are not essential for muscle contraction in zebrafish and that the physiological significance of NaV1.4 in muscle is not uniform across vertebrates.

                Background Since the building sector contributes significantly to carbon emissions, using sustainable materials is more crucial than ever. Mycelium is investigated in this study as a natural substitute for conventional insulation materials like rock wool and XPS. Its thermal performance has been evaluated in a residential building in New Cairo, Egypt, using Design-Builder simulations, paying particular attention to U-values, discomfort hours, PPD-PMV, and energy consumption. The results demonstrate that mycelium is environmentally safe, biodegradable, and provides insulation that is comparable to XPS. This demonstrates its promise as a sustainable option for building in the future. Methods This research uses Design-Builder software version 7.3.0.046 integrated with Energy-Plus to simulate the thermal conductivity of mycelium compared to two of the most frequently utilized traditional materials for insulation in Egypt, in Janna Compound, New Cairo. The analysis examines energy consumption, thermal comfort, Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), and Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfaction (PPD%). The study provides a comparative evaluation of mycelium insulation compared to traditional materials like XPS and Rockwool. Results According to the simulation results, mycelium insulation performs comparably to XPS regarding U-values, discomfort hours, PPD-PMV, and energy consumption. Specifically, mycelium achieved a 0.323 U-value, reduced discomfort hours percentage to 16.9%, and achieved a ratio of energy reduction of 15.8% compared to the base case. These results demonstrate how mycelium has the potential to compete with traditional insulation materials while offering significant sustainability advantages, such as biodegradability and a lower carbon footprint. Conclusion In Janna Compound, New Cairo, the research shows how mycelium insulation can improve thermal comfort and save energy usage. It performs similarly to XPS but has more positive environmental effects. These results support the integration of mycelium into Egypt’s sustainable housing practices, providing key insights for architects, developers, and policymakers focused on energy-efficient and sustainable urban development.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-458/v1?src=rss">Internal and external risk factors analysis on pilot precondition in Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Pilot errors accounted for 80% of accidents and 50% of serious incidents. The Human Factor Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) allows the identification of pilot preconditions as an imminent layer of error. This study aimed to analyze the correlation between internal and external risk factors and pilot preconditions in Indonesia. Methods A cross-sectional study design with purposive sampling, directed to male pilots who had flight duty in the past seven days, underwent medical examination at the Aviation Medical Center, Jakarta, August 12–16, 2024. The data were collected through a self-report questionnaire, Trail Making Test A and B, laboratory tests (plasma lipid, fasting blood glucose), and physical measurements (height, weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure). The independent variables included internal (Age, Burnout, Metabolic Syndrome parameters) and external (Flight Time, Duty Time, Unscheduled Flight Duty, Number of Sectors, Sleep Duration). The dependent variables were pilot preconditions based on the HFACS. Results A total of 122 participants participated in this study. Among them, 28.7% had an unscheduled flight duty in the last 30 d. Significant correlations were found between Adverse Mental State and HDL-cholesterol (95%CI=1.52 – 5.80), Adverse Physiological State and Burnout [personal (95%CI=0.005–0,04), work-related (95%CI=0.009–0.042)], Physical Mental Limitation and Fasting Blood Glucose (95%CI =(-0.479)–(-0.071)), and Number of Sectors (95%CI=0.022–3.001). For Personal Readiness (PR), a significant correlation was found between PR-psychological demand and Flight-Time One Year (95%CI=(0.000 – 0.001), Sleep Duration (95%CI =(-0.137)–(-0.013)), Waist Circumference (95%CI =(-0.014)–(-0.002)), PR-Social Support and Sleep Duration (95%IK=0.018–0.207), and Client-Related Burnout (95%IK =(-0.011)–(-0.002)). Conclusions The internal factors that correlated with pilot preconditions in Indonesia were waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, personal burnout, work, and client-related burnout. External factors that correlated with pilot preconditions were the number of sectors, Flight-Time One Year and Sleep duration. These findings emphasize the need to address both physical and mental health aspects of pilots to enhance aviation safety.

                Terminal myelocystocele (TMC) is a rare, skin-covered congenital spinal anomaly characterized by turbulent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage, an elongated caudal spinal cord, terminal cystic dilation, and an intact dura mater. TMC is frequently associated with other congenital abnormalities affecting the anorectal, genitourinary, and vertebral systems, which necessitates careful clinical and radiological differentiation from other skin-covered spinal dysraphisms. We report a case of a two-week-old male neonate, born to a 19-year old primigravida mother, who presented with a large swelling in the lower back. Prenatal anatomical ultrasound at 20 weeks’ gestation had revealed sacrococcygeal anomalies. Postnatal spinal MRI demonstrated a well-defined, multi-lobulated sacrococcygeal cystic lesion with internal septations originating from an anterior sacral defect. Based on the imaging findings, differential diagnoses included a pure cystic sacrococcygeal teratoma and TMC. Surgical excision of the lesion was undertaken through two inverted V-shaped incisions along the caudal region. Following 8-months outpatient follow up, the infant did not demonstrate any neurological impairments. The potential for cyst expansion in TMC represents a significant clinical consideration, as it may indicate rapid neurological decline. Caregivers should be informed of this risk and advised to seek immediate medical attention if cyst enlargement is observed.

                Substance use among college and university students is associated with significant health issues, academic struggles, and premature death. This scoping review explores the potential of digital health interventions, including internet-based and mobile platforms, to reduce substance use. A comprehensive search across databases such as PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Google Scholar identified 11 eligible studies conducted across seven countries between 2013 and 2025. These studies focused primarily on alcohol use and included digital health tools like instant messaging, Telegram applications, text messaging, and web-based interventions. The results suggest that digital health technologies can effectively motivate college students in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to reduce or abstain from psychoactive substance use. However, there is a notable research gap in evaluating the effectiveness and feasibility of these tools, especially mobile text messaging, which remains one of the most widely used methods in LMICs. The review highlights the need for further research, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses, to better understand the impact of digital health interventions on substance use reduction and to develop evidence-based programs for behavior change.
