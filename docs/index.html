              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Study protocol for the SeMaCo study: A longitudinal regional cohort study to assess COVID-19 seroprevalence in blood donors [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Serologic studies are crucial for clarifying the regional dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic as well as the success of a vaccination campaign against COVID-19. We describe a cohort study investigating the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in Magdeburg (Saxony-Anhalt, Germany). Protocol and study design: The SeMaCo study (Serologische Untersuchungen bei Blutspendern des Großraums Magdeburg auf Antikörper gegen SARS-CoV-2) is a longitudinal, regional cohort study to assess the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in blood donors from Magdeburg (Capital of Saxony-Anhalt) and surrounding areas. We consider blood donors as a surrogate for the healthy, working-age population of Saxony-Anhalt. The study primarily aims to measure the prevalence and kinetics of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in first time and repeat blood donors over a period of 21 months. The study explores four survey periods of three to four months each (January–April 21, July–October 21, February–April 22, July–October 22). At each visit, we will assess the attitude towards vaccination, the antibody response following vaccination, as well as undesired vaccination effects. Furthermore, we will collect data on occupational activities, housing conditions and the frequency of family and other social contacts. Discussion: The SeMaCo study extends the spectrum of seroepidemiological investigations in Germany. A longitudinal observation with repeated testing and serial interviews can provide a more accurate view on the dynamics of COVID-19 prevalence and spread than repeated cross-sectional studies. Based on interim results from similar studies, we expect a seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies below 5% in the first survey period. SeMaCo will influence policy decisions and preventative measures.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Running exercise protects spinophilin‐immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex of APP/PS1 transgenic mice</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is thought to be closely associated with emotional processes, decision making and memory. Previous studies have identified the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as one of the most vulnerable brain regions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Running exercise has widely been recognized as a simple and effective method of physical activity that enhances brain function and slows the progression of AD. However, the effect of exercise on the mPFC of AD is unclear. To address these issues, we investigated the effects of four months of exercise on the numbers of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of 12-month-old APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic AD model mice using stereological methods. The spatial learning and memory abilities of mice were tested using the Morris water maze. Four months of running exercise delayed declines in spatial learning and memory abilities. The stereological results showed significantly lower numbers of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of APP/PS1 mice than in the wild-type (WT) control group. The numbers of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of running APP/PS1 mice were significantly greater than those in the APP/PS1 control mice. In addition, running-induced improvements in spatial learning and memory were significantly associated with running-induced increases in spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons numbers in the mPFC. Running exercise could delay the loss of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of APP/PS1 mice. This finding might provide an important structural basis for exercise-induced improvements in the spatial learning and memory abilities of individuals with AD.</p>

	<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic and the related lockdowns, outpatient follow-up visits for patients with chronic neurological diseases have been suspended. Managing people affected by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has become highly complicated, leaving patients without the standard multidisciplinary follow-up. This study aimed to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on ALS disease progression. We compared the clinical data and progression in the first year following diagnosis for patients who received ALS diagnosis during 2020 (G20, N = 34), comparing it with a group of diagnosed in 2018 (G18, N = 31). Both groups received a comparable multidisciplinary model of care in our Tertiary Expert ALS Centre, Novara, Italy. The monthly rate of ALSFRS-R decline during the lockdown was significantly increased in G20 compared to G18 (1.52 ± 2.69 vs. 0.76 ± 0.56; p-value: 0.005). In G20, 47% required non-invasive ventilation (vs. 32% of G18). Similarly, in G20, 35% of patients died vs. 19% of patients in G18 (p-value: 0.01). All results were corrected for gender, age, site of onset, and diagnostic delay. Several factors can be implicated in making ALS more severe, with a faster progression, such as reduced medical evaluations and the possibility of therapeutic changes, social isolation, and rehabilitation therapy suspension.</p>

	<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic disease. No treatment stops its progression, and it presents symptoms in multiple areas. One way to understand the PD population is to investigate the clustering of patients by demographic and clinical similarities. Previous PD cluster studies included scores from clinical surveys, which provide a numerical but ordinal, non-linear value. In addition, these studies did not include categorical variables, as the clustering method utilized was not applicable to categorical variables. It was discovered that the numerical values of patient age and disease duration were similar among past cluster results, pointing to the need to exclude these values. This paper proposes a novel and automatic discovery method to cluster PD patients by incorporating categorical variables. No estimate of the number of clusters is required as input, whereas the previous cluster methods require a guess from the end user in order for the method to be initiated. Using a patient dataset from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) website to demonstrate the new clustering technique, our results showed that this method provided an accurate separation of the patients. In addition, this method provides an explainable process and an easy way to interpret clusters and describe patient subtypes.</p>

	<p>This review is extensively focused on the enhancement of cognitive functions while performing physical exercises categorized into cardiovascular exercises, resistance training, martial arts, racquet sports, dancing and mind-body exercises. Imaging modalities, viz. functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG), have been included in this review. This review indicates that differences are present in cognitive functioning while changing the type of physical activity performed. This study concludes that employing fNIRS helps overcome certain limitations of fMRI. Further, the effects of physical activity on a diverse variety of the population, from active children to the old people, are discussed.</p>

                Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterium, produces pyocyanin, a virulence factor associated with antibiotic tolerance. High concentrations of royal jelly have an antibacterial effect, which may potentially overcome antibacterial resistance. However, in some cases, antibiotic tolerance can occur due to prolonged stress of low-dose antibacterial agents. This study aimed to investigate the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of royal jelly on bacterial growth, pyocyanin production, and biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa. Methods: Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145 and clinical isolates were cultured in a royal jelly-containing medium to test the antibacterial activity. Pyocyanin production was observed by measuring the absorbance at 690 nm after 36 h culture and determined using extinction coefficient 4310 M-1 cm-1. Static microtiter plate biofilm assay performed to detect the biofilm formation, followed by scanning electron microscopy. Results: Royal jelly effectively inhibited the viability of both strains from a concentration of 25%. The highest production of pyocyanin was observed in the subinhibitory concentration group 6.25%, which gradually decreased along with the decrease of royal jelly concentration. Results of one-way ANOVA tests differed significantly in pyocyanin production of the two strains between the royal jelly groups. Tukey HSD test showed concentrations of 12.5%, 6.25%, and 3.125% significantly increased pyocyanin production of ATCC 10145, and the concentrations of 12.5% and 6.25% significantly increased production of the clinical isolates. Concentrations of 12.5% and 6.125% significantly induced biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa ATCC 10145, in line with the results of the SEM analysis. Conclusions: The royal jelly concentration of 25% or higher inhibits bacterial growth; however, the subinhibitory concentration increases pyocyanin production and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa. It is advisable to determine the appropriate concentration of royal jelly to obtain beneficial virulence inhibiting activity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Cooperating elephants mitigate competition until the stakes get too high</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Li-Li Li, Joshua M. Plotnik, Shang-Wen Xia, Estelle Meaux, Rui-Chang Quan</p>

Cooperation is ubiquitous in the animal kingdom as it aims to maximize benefits through joint action. Selection, however, may also favor competitive behaviors that could violate cooperation. How animals mitigate competition is hotly debated, with particular interest in primates and little attention paid thus far to nonprimates. Using a loose-string pulling apparatus, we explored cooperative and competitive behavior, as well as mitigation of the latter, in semi-wild Asian elephants (<i>Elephas maximus</i>). Our results showed that elephants first maintained a very high cooperation rate (average = 80.8% across 45 sessions). Elephants applied “block,” “fight back,” “leave,” “move side,” and “submission” as mitigation strategies and adjusted these strategies according to their affiliation and rank difference with competition initiators. They usually applied a “fight back” mitigation strategy as a sanction when competition initiators were low ranking or when they had a close affiliation, but were submissive if the initiators were high ranking or when they were not closely affiliated. However, when the food reward was limited, the costly competitive behaviors (“monopoly” and “fight”) increased significantly, leading to a rapid breakdown in cooperation. The instability of elephant cooperation as a result of benefit reduction mirrors that of human society, suggesting that similar fundamental principles may underlie the evolution of cooperation across species.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Identifying and prioritizing potential human-infecting viruses from their genome sequences</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nardus Mollentze, Simon A. Babayan, Daniel G. Streicker</p>

Determining which animal viruses may be capable of infecting humans is currently intractable at the time of their discovery, precluding prioritization of high-risk viruses for early investigation and outbreak preparedness. Given the increasing use of genomics in virus discovery and the otherwise sparse knowledge of the biology of newly discovered viruses, we developed machine learning models that identify candidate zoonoses solely using signatures of host range encoded in viral genomes. Within a dataset of 861 viral species with known zoonotic status, our approach outperformed models based on the phylogenetic relatedness of viruses to known human-infecting viruses (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.773), distinguishing high-risk viruses within families that contain a minority of human-infecting species and identifying putatively undetected or so far unrealized zoonoses. Analyses of the underpinnings of model predictions suggested the existence of generalizable features of viral genomes that are independent of virus taxonomic relationships and that may preadapt viruses to infect humans. Our model reduced a second set of 645 animal-associated viruses that were excluded from training to 272 high and 41 very high-risk candidate zoonoses and showed significantly elevated predicted zoonotic risk in viruses from nonhuman primates, but not other mammalian or avian host groups. A second application showed that our models could have identified Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a relatively high-risk coronavirus strain and that this prediction required no prior knowledge of zoonotic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses. Genome-based zoonotic risk assessment provides a rapid, low-cost approach to enable evidence-driven virus surveillance and increases the feasibility of downstream biological and ecological characterization of viruses.

                <p>by Mircea van der Plas, Verena Braun, Benjamin Johannes Stauch, Simon Hanslmayr</p>

Encoding of episodic memories relies on stimulus-specific information processing and involves the left prefrontal cortex. We here present an incidental finding from a simultaneous EEG-TMS experiment as well as a replication of this unexpected effect. Our results reveal that stimulating the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with slow repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) leads to enhanced word memory performance. A total of 40 healthy human participants engaged in a list learning paradigm. Half of the participants (<i>N =</i> 20) received 1 Hz rTMS to the left DLPFC, while the other half (<i>N</i> = 20) received 1 Hz rTMS to the vertex and served as a control group. Participants receiving left DLPFC stimulation demonstrated enhanced memory performance compared to the control group. This effect was replicated in a within-subjects experiment where 24 participants received 1 Hz rTMS to the left DLPFC and vertex. In this second experiment, DLPFC stimulation also induced better memory performance compared to vertex stimulation. In addition to these behavioural effects, we found that 1 Hz rTMS to DLPFC induced stronger beta power modulation in posterior areas, a state that is known to be beneficial for memory encoding. Further analysis indicated that beta modulations did not have an oscillatory origin. Instead, the observed beta modulations were a result of a spectral tilt, suggesting inhibition of these parietal regions. These results show that applying 1 Hz rTMS to DLPFC, an area involved in episodic memory formation, improves memory performance via modulating neural activity in parietal regions.

                Doublets are prevalent in single-cell sequencing data and can lead to artifactual findings. A number of strategies have therefore been proposed to detect them. Building on the strengths of existing approaches, we developed scDblFinder, a fast, flexible and accurate Bioconductor-based doublet detection method. Here we present the method, justify its design choices, demonstrate its performance on both single-cell RNA and accessibility sequencing data, and provide some observations on doublet formation, detection, and enrichment analysis. Even in complex datasets, scDblFinder can accurately identify most heterotypic doublets, and was already found by an independent benchmark to outcompete alternatives.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Deep entorhinal cortex: from circuit organization to spatial cognition and memory</a></h4>

              
                The deep layers of the entorhinal cortex are important for spatial cognition, as well as memory storage, consolidation and retrieval. A long-standing hypothesis is that deep-layer neurons relay spatial and memory-related signals between the hippocampus and telencephalon. We review the implications of recent circuit-level analyses that suggest more complex roles. The organization of deep entorhinal layers is consistent with multi-stage processing by specialized cell populations; in this framework, hippocampal, neocortical, and subcortical inputs are integrated to generate representations for use by targets in the telencephalon and for feedback to the superficial entorhinal cortex and hippocampus.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">PGFinder, a novel analysis pipeline for the consistent, reproducible, and high-resolution structural analysis of bacterial peptidoglycans</a></h4>

              
                Many software solutions are available for proteomics and glycomics studies, but none are ideal for the structural analysis of peptidoglycan (PG), the essential and major component of bacterial cell envelopes. It icomprises glycan chains and peptide stems, both containing unusual amino acids and sugars. This has forced the field to rely on manual analysis approaches, which are time-consuming, labour-intensive, and prone to error. The lack of automated tools has hampered the ability to perform high-throughput analyses and prevented the adoption of a standard methodology. Here, we describe a novel tool called PGFinder for the analysis of PG structure and demonstrate that it represents a powerful tool to quantify PG fragments and discover novel structural features. Our analysis workflow, which relies on open-access tools, is a breakthrough towards a consistent and reproducible analysis of bacterial PGs. It represents a significant advance towards peptidoglycomics as a full-fledged discipline.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Deep evolutionary origin of gamete-directed zygote activation by KNOX/BELL transcription factors in green plants</a></h4>

              
                KNOX and BELL transcription factors regulate distinct steps of diploid development in plants. In the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,</i> KNOX and BELL proteins are inherited by gametes of the opposite mating types and heterodimerize in zygotes to activate diploid development. By contrast, in land plants such as <i>Physcomitrium patens</i> and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, KNOX and BELL proteins function in meristem maintenance and organogenesis during the later stages of diploid development. However, whether the contrasting functions of KNOX and BELL were acquired independently in algae and land plants is currently unknown. Here, we show that in the basal land plant species <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>, gamete-expressed <i>KNOX</i> and <i>BELL</i> are required to initiate zygotic development by promoting nuclear fusion in a manner strikingly similar to that in <i>C. reinhardtii</i>. Our results indicate that zygote activation is the ancestral role of KNOX/BELL transcription factors, which shifted toward meristem maintenance as land plants evolved.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mechanically transduced immunosorbent assay to measure protein-protein interactions</a></h4>

              
                Measuring protein-protein interaction (PPI) affinities is fundamental to biochemistry. Yet, conventional methods rely upon the law of mass action and cannot measure many PPIs due to a scarcity of reagents and limitations in the measurable affinity ranges. Here, we present a novel technique that leverages the fundamental concept of friction to produce a mechanical signal that correlates to binding potential. The mechanically transduced immunosorbent (METRIS) assay utilizes rolling magnetic probes to measure PPI interaction affinities. METRIS measures the translational displacement of protein-coated particles on a protein-functionalized substrate. The translational displacement scales with the effective friction induced by a PPI, thus producing a mechanical signal when a binding event occurs. The METRIS assay uses as little as 20 pmols of reagents to measure a wide range of affinities while exhibiting a high resolution and sensitivity. We use METRIS to measure several PPIs that were previously inaccessible using traditional methods, providing new insights into epigenetic recognition.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Age-dependent changes in protein incorporation into collagen-rich tissues of mice by in vivo pulsed SILAC labelling</a></h4>

              
                Collagen-rich tissues have poor reparative capacity that predisposes to common age-related disorders such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. We used in vivo pulsed SILAC labelling to quantify new protein incorporation into cartilage, bone, and skin of mice across the healthy life course. We report dynamic turnover of the matrisome, the proteins of the extracellular matrix, in bone and cartilage during skeletal maturation, which was markedly reduced after skeletal maturity. Comparing young adult with older adult mice, new protein incorporation was reduced in all tissues. STRING clustering revealed changes in epigenetic modulators across all tissues, a decline in chondroprotective growth factors such as FGF2 and TGFβ in cartilage, and clusters indicating mitochondrial dysregulation and reduced collagen synthesis in bone. Several pathways were implicated in age-related disease. Fewer changes were observed for skin. This methodology provides dynamic protein data at a tissue level, uncovering age-related molecular changes that may predispose to disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dietary nitrate supplementation prevents radiotherapy-induced xerostomia</a></h4>

              
                Management of salivary gland hypofunction caused by irradiation (IR) therapy for head and neck cancer remains lack of effective treatments. Salivary glands, especially the parotid gland, actively uptake dietary nitrate and secrete it into saliva. Here, we investigated the effect of dietary nitrate on the prevention and treatment of IR-induced parotid gland hypofunction in miniature pigs, and elucidated the underlying mechanism in human parotid gland cells (hPGCs). We found that nitrate administration prevented IR-induced parotid gland damage in a dose-dependent manner, by maintaining the function of irradiated parotid gland tissue. Nitrate could increase sialin expression, a nitrate transporter expressed in the parotid gland, making the nitrate-sialin feedback loop that facilitates nitrate influx into cells for maintaining cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. Furthermore, nitrate enhanced cell proliferation via the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-protein kinase B (AKT)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway in irradiated parotid gland tissue. Collectively, nitrate effectively prevented IR-induced xerostomia via the EGFR–AKT-MAPK signaling pathway. Dietary nitrate supplementation may provide a novel, safe, and effective way to resolve IR-induce xerostomia.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tiled-ClickSeq for targeted sequencing of complete coronavirus genomes with simultaneous capture of RNA recombination and minority variants</a></h4>

              
                High-throughput genomics of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to characterize virus evolution and to identify adaptations that affect pathogenicity or transmission. While single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) are commonly considered as driving virus adaption, RNA recombination events that delete or insert nucleic acid sequences are also critical. Whole genome targeting sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 is typically achieved using pairs of primers to generate cDNA amplicons suitable for next-generation sequencing (NGS). However, paired-primer approaches impose constraints on where primers can be designed, how many amplicons are synthesized and requires multiple PCR reactions with non-overlapping primer pools. This imparts sensitivity to underlying SNVs and fails to resolve RNA recombination junctions that are not flanked by primer pairs. To address these limitations, we have designed an approach called <i>‘Tiled-ClickSeq’</i>, which uses hundreds of tiled-primers spaced evenly along the virus genome in a single reverse-transcription reaction. The other end of the cDNA amplicon is generated by azido-nucleotides that stochastically terminate cDNA synthesis, removing the need for a paired-primer. A sequencing adaptor containing a Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) is appended to the cDNA fragment using click-chemistry and a PCR reaction generates a final NGS library. Tiled-ClickSeq provides complete genome coverage, including the 5’UTR, at high depth and specificity to the virus on both Illumina and Nanopore NGS platforms. Here, we analyze multiple SARS-CoV-2 isolates and clinical samples to simultaneously characterize minority variants, sub-genomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs), structural variants (SVs) and D-RNAs. Tiled-ClickSeq therefore provides a convenient and robust platform for SARS-CoV-2 genomics that captures the full range of RNA species in a single, simple assay.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">History of winning and hierarchy landscape influence stress susceptibility in mice</a></h4>

              
                Social hierarchy formation is strongly evolutionarily conserved. Across species, rank within social hierarchy has large effects on health and behavior. To investigate the relationship between social rank and stress susceptibility, we exposed ranked male and female mice to social and non-social stressors and manipulated social hierarchy position. We found that rank predicts same sex social stress outcomes: dominance in males and females confers resilience while subordination confers susceptibility. Pre-existing rank does not predict non-social stress outcomes in females and weakly does so in males, but rank emerging under stress conditions reveals social interaction deficits in male and female subordinates. Both history of winning and rank of cage mates affect stress susceptibility in males: rising to the top rank through high mobility confers resilience and mice that lose dominance lose stress resilience, though gaining dominance over a subordinate animal does not confer resilience. Overall, we have demonstrated a relationship between social status and stress susceptibility, particularly when taking into account individual history of winning and the overall hierarchy landscape in male and female mice.

                Professional athletes exposed to repetitive head impacts are at increased risk for developing a progressive neurological syndrome known as traumatic encephalopathy syndrome and neuropathology seen on autopsy called chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The early identification of individuals at increased risk for CTE is important and the search for biomarkers is underway. In this study, we utilized data from a large cohort study to compare differences in regional brain volumes, cortical thickness, voxel-based morphometric (VBM)-derived measures, and graph-theoretical measures derived from large-scale topographical maps in active professional boxers. We compared the above morphometric measures between active professional boxers with low cognitive scores (impaired boxers) and active professional boxers with intact cognitive scores (nonimpaired boxers). The cognitive scores were evaluated through neuropsychological evaluation. As an exploratory analysis, we also examined the power of various machine-learning algorithms to identify impaired and nonimpaired boxers using both group-level regression-driven analysis and previously identified hypothesis-driven cortical thickness and volumetric measures. We found significant group-level differences between impaired and nonimpaired boxers in cortical thickness in a single brain region (right precuneus), differences in VBM-derived gray matter density encompassing the caudate, putamen, and thalamus; and white matter density encompassing the right paracentral lobule, but no differences in any graph-theoretical network properties. Additionally, we found that a priori hypothesis-driven T1-derived cortical thickness and volumetric analysis performed better than traditional regression-based analysis. Overall, this study suggests that neuroanatomical differences exist between impaired and nonimpaired active professional boxers, and that hypothesis-driven techniques are likely necessary to become reliable biomarkers.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Feature-reweighted RSA: A method for improving the fit between computational models, brains, and behavior</a></h4>

              
                Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) has emerged as a popular method for relating representational spaces from human brain activity, behavioral data, and computational models. RSA is based on the comparison of rep- resentational dissimilarity matrices (RDM), which characterize the pairwise dissimilarities of all conditions across all features (e.g. fMRI voxels or units of a model). However, classical RSA treats each feature as equally important. This 'equal weights' assumption contrasts with the flexibility of multivariate decoding, which reweights individual features for predicting a target variable. As a consequence, classical RSA may lead researchers to underestimate the correspondence between a model and a brain region and, for model comparison, it may lead to selecting the inferior model. While previous work has suggested that reweighting can improve model selection in RSA, it has remained unclear to what extent these results generalize across datasets and data modalities. To fill this gap, the aim of this work is twofold: First, utilizing a range of publicly available datasets and three popular deep neural networks (DNNs), we seek to broadly test feature-reweighted RSA (FR-RSA) applied to computational models and reveal the extent to which reweighting model features improves RDM correspondence and affects model selection. Second, we propose voxel-reweighted RSA, a novel use case of FR-RSA that reweights fMRI voxels, mirroring the rationale of multivariate decoding of optimally combining voxel activity patterns. We find that reweighting individual model units (1) markedly improves the fit between model RDMs and target RDMs derived from several fMRI and behavioral datasets and (2) affects model selection, highlighting the importance of considering FR-RSA. For voxel-reweighted RSA, improvements in RDM correspondence were even more pronounced, demonstrating the utility of this novel approach. We additionally demonstrate that classical noise ceilings can be exceeded when FR-RSA is applied and propose an updated approach for their computation. Taken together, our results broadly validate the use of FR-RSA for improving the fit between computational models, brain and behavioral data, possibly allowing us to better adjudicate between competing computational models. Further, our results suggest that FR-RSA applied to brain measurement channels could become an important new method to assess the match between representational spaces.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rapid Parameter Estimation for Selective Inversion Recovery Myelin Imaging using an Open-Source Julia Toolkit</a></h4>

              
                Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used extensively to quantify myelin content, however computational bottlenecks remain challenging for advanced imaging techniques in clinical settings. We present a fast, open-source toolkit for processing quantitative magnetization transfer derived from selective inversion recovery (SIR) acquisitions that allows parameter map estimation, including the myelin-sensitive macromolecular pool size ratio (PSR). Significant progress has been made in reducing SIR acquisition times to improve clinically feasibility. However, parameter map estimation from the resulting data remains computationally expensive. To overcome this computational limitation, we developed a computationally efficient, open-source toolkit implemented in the Julia language. Methods: To test the accuracy of this toolkit, we simulated SIR images with varying PSR and spin-lattice relaxation time of the free water pool (R1f) over a physiologically meaningful scale from 5 to 20% and 0.5 to 1.5 s-1, respectively. Rician noise was then added, and the parameter maps were estimated using our Julia toolkit. Probability density histogram plots and Lin's concordance correlation coefficients (LCCC) were used to assess accuracy and precision of the fits to our known simulation data. To further mimic biological tissue, we generated five cross-linked bovine serum albumin (BSA) phantoms with concentrations that ranged from 1.25 to 20%. The phantoms were imaged at 3T using SIR, and data were fit to estimate PSR and R1f. Similarly, a healthy volunteer was imaged at 3T, and SIR parameter maps were estimated to demonstrate the reduced computational time for a real-world clinical example. Results: Estimated SIR parameter maps from our Julia toolkit agreed with simulated values (LCCC> 0.98). This toolkit was further validated using BSA phantoms and a whole brain scan at 3T. In both cases, SIR parameter estimates were consistent with published values using MATLAB. However, compared to earlier work using MATLAB, our Julia toolkit provided an approximate 20-fold reduction in computational time. Conclusions: Presented here, we developed a fast, open-source, toolkit for rapid and accurate SIR MRI using Julia. The reduction in computational cost should allow SIR parameters to be accessible in clinical settings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct neural representations for prosocial and self-benefitting effort</a></h4>

              
                Prosocial behaviours - actions that benefit others - are central to individual and societal well-being. Most prosocial acts are effortful. Yet, how the brain encodes effort costs when actions benefit others is unknown. Here, using a combination of multivariate representational similarity analysis and model-based univariate analysis during fMRI, we reveal how the costs of prosocial efforts are processed. Strikingly, we identified a unique neural signature of effort in the anterior cingulate gyrus for prosocial acts both when choosing to help others and when exerting force for their benefit. This pattern was absent for similar self-benefitting behaviour and correlated with individual levels of empathy. In contrast, the ventral tegmental area and the ventral insula signalled subjective value preferentially when choosing whether to exert effort to benefit oneself. These findings demonstrate partially distinct brain areas guide the evaluation and exertion of effort costs when acts are prosocial or self-benefitting.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Compartment-specific tuning of hippocampal dendritic feature selectivity by intracellular Ca2+ release</a></h4>

              
                Dendritic Ca2+ signaling is central to neural plasticity mechanisms allowing animals to adapt to the environment. Intracellular Ca2+ release (ICR) from endoplasmic reticulum has long been thought to shape these mechanisms. However, ICR has not been investigated in mammalian neurons in vivo. We combined electroporation of single CA1 pyramidal neurons, simultaneous imaging of dendritic and somatic activity during spatial navigation, optogenetic place field induction, and acute genetic augmentation of ICR cytosolic impact to reveal that ICR supports the establishment of dendritic feature selectivity and shapes integrative properties determining output-level receptive fields. This role for ICR was more prominent in apical than in basal dendrites. Thus, ICR cooperates with circuit-level architecture in vivo to promote the emergence of behaviorally-relevant plasticity in a compartment-specific manner.

                Abnormal neuronal development in Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is poorly understood. Data on FXS patients remain scarce and FXS animal models have failed to yield successful therapies. In vitro models do not fully recapitulate the morphology and function of human neurons. Here, we co-injected neural precursor cells (NPCs) from FXS patient-derived and corrected isogenic control induced pluripotent stem cells into the brain of neonatal immune-deprived mice. The transplanted cells populated the brain and a proportion differentiated into neurons and glial cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing of transplanted cells revealed upregulated excitatory synaptic transmission and neuronal differentiation pathways in FXS neurons. Immunofluorescence analyses showed accelerated maturation of FXS neurons after an initial delay. Additionally, increased percentages of Arc- and Egr1-positive FXS neurons and wider dendritic protrusions of mature FXS striatal medium spiny neurons pointed to an increase in synaptic activity and synaptic strength as compared to control. This transplantation approach provides new insights into the alterations of neuronal development in FXS by facilitating physiological development of cells in a 3D context, and could be used to test new therapeutic compounds correcting neuronal development defects in FXS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The activities of LRRK2 and GCase are positively correlated in clinical biospecimens and experimental models of Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                LRRK2 is a kinase involved in different cellular functions, including autophagy, endolysosomal pathways and vesicle trafficking. Mutations in LRRK2 cause autosomal dominant forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Heterozygous mutations in GBA1, the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), are the most common genetic risk factors for PD. Moreover, GCase function is altered in idiopathic PD and in other genetic forms of the disease. Recent work suggests that LRRK2 kinase activity can regulate GCase function. However, both a positive and a negative correlation have been described. To gain insights into the impact of LRRK2 on GCase, we investigated GCase levels and activity in LRRK2 G2019S knockin mice, in clinical biospecimens from PD patients carrying this mutation and in patient-derived cellular models. In these models we found a positive correlation between the activities of LRRK2 and GCase, which was further confirmed in cell lines with genetic and pharmacological manipulation of LRRK2 kinase activity. Overall, our study indicates that LRRK2 kinase activity affects both the levels and the catalytic activity of GCase.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Towards optimization of oscillatory stimulation during sleep</a></h4>

              
                Background: Oscillatory rhythms during sleep such as slow oscillations (SO) and spindles, and most importantly their coupling, are thought to underlie processes of memory consolidation. External slow oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation (so-tDCS) with a frequency of 0.75 Hz has been shown to improve this coupling and memory consolidation, however, effects varied quite markedly between individuals, studies and species. Objective: Here, we aimed to determine how precisely the frequency of stimulation has to match the naturally occurring SO frequency in individuals to optimally improve SO-spindle coupling. Moreover, we systematically tested stimulation durations necessary to induce changes. Methods: We addressed these questions by comparing so-tDCS with individually adapted SO frequency to standardized frequency of 0.75Hz in a cross-over design with 28 healthy older participants during napping while systematically varying stimulation train durations between 30s, 2min and 5min. Results: Stimulation trains as short as 30s were sufficient to modulate the coupling between SOs and spindle activity. Contrary to our expectations, so-tDCS with standardized frequency indicated stronger aftereffects with regard to SO-spindle coupling in comparison to individualized frequency. Angle and variance of spindle maxima occurrence during the SO cycle were similarly modulated. Conclusion: Short stimulation trains were sufficient to induce significant changes in sleep physiology allowing for more trains of stimulation, which provides methodological advantages and possibly even larger effects in future studies. With regard to individualized stimulation frequency, further options of optimization need to be investigated, such as closed-loop stimulation to calibrate stimulation frequency to the SO frequency at time of stimulation onset.

                Genome editing and neuronal differentiation protocols have proliferated in the last decade. Mutations in genes that control pluripotency could lead to a potential obstacle with regards to the survival and differentiation potential of the genome-edited cell lines. Here we describe a protocol for the generation, and differentiation, of cell lines containing CRISPR/Cas9 induced mutations in the histone methyltransferase ASH1L. This chromatin modifier was previously implicated in hematopoietic stem cell pluripotency and is a major genetic risk factor for autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We find that haploinsufficiency of ASH1L leads to decreased NANOG gene expression leading to reduce cell survival and increased spontaneous differentiation. We report a method that provides improved single-cell survival with higher colony formation efficiency in ASH1L mutant stem cells. Additionally, we describe a modified dual-SMAD inhibition neuronal induction methodology that permits the successful generation of human neurons with mutations in ASH1L, in a smaller scale than previously reported methods. With our modified CRISPR-genome editing and neuronal differentiation protocols, it is possible to generate genome-edited stem cells containing mutations in genes that impact pluripotency and could affect subsequent cell lineage-specific differentiation. Our detailed technical report presents cost-effective strategies that will benefit researchers focusing on both translational and basic science using stem cell experimental systems.

	<p>The primary aim of this study was to reveal the effects of end-effector robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) on motor function, proprioception, balance, and gait ability in patients with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). The secondary aim was to determine the correlation between clinical outcomes. This study was a prospective and multi-center study. A total of 13 incomplete SCI patients who met inclusion criteria received 30 min of RAGT with Morning Walk® (Curexo, Seoul, South Korea), and 1 h of conventional physiotherapy 5 times per week for 4 weeks. Clinical outcome measures were 10 m walk test (10MWT), 6 min walk test (6mWT), lower extremity motor score (LEMS), proprioception, Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury (WISCI)-II. All participants were assessed within 48 h before and after the intervention.&amp;amp;nbsp;All clinical outcomes were statistically improved after RAGT. Subgroup analysis according to the initial proprioception, WISCI-II in the normal group showed a statistically significant improvement compared to the abnormal group. Initial BBS and WISCI-II had a positive correlation with most of the final clinical outcomes. The final BBS had a strong positive correlation with the final 10MWT, 6mWT, and WISCI-II. Initial proprioception had a positive correlation with the final WISCI-II. The final proprioception also had a moderate positive correlation with 6mWT and BBS. This study’s results suggest that the end-effector RAGT could promote proprioception, balance ability and walking ability. Postural control ability and proprioception also had a positive relationship with gait ability.</p>

	<p>The early months of the COVID-19 pandemic have been a challenging time for many psychotherapy patients. To understand why certain patients were more resilient, we examined the role of patients’ attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance, as well as collaborative therapy experiences (perceived working alliance and therapeutic agency) in their online sessions on their COVID-related traumatic distress over a three-month period. A total of 466 patients in online psychotherapy completed a survey during the first weeks of the pandemic, and 121 of those completed a follow-up survey three months later. Lower distress at follow-up was predicted by patients’ lower attachment anxiety and higher therapeutic agency in their online sessions after controlling for baseline distress and time of survey completion. Higher working alliance predicted less distress at follow-up only for patients with high attachment anxiety. For patients with low attachment avoidance (i.e., more securely attached), higher therapeutic agency predicted less distress. These findings suggest that patients’ attachment anxiety and therapeutic agency may play significant roles also in online therapy during COVID-19 in patient’s experienced traumatic distress, and that working alliance and therapeutic agency may be differentially important for patients with different levels of attachment anxiety and avoidance.</p>

	<p>Patients with severe COVID-19 experience high-stress levels and thus are at risk for developing acute stress disorder (ASD) and/or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The present study aims to search for correlations between psychiatric response to stress and coping strategies among individuals with acute vs. remitted COVID-19. Ninety subjects with COVID-19 were included in the study, divided into two samples by disease category. Our focus was analysing the perceived stress intensity according to NSESSS and PCL-C-17 scales, and coping strategies with COPE-60. High NSESSS scores were found in 40% of acute patients, and 15.6% of remitted patients had high PCL-C-17 scores fulfilling the criteria for PTSD. We found a negative correlation between stress level and disease category. Acute patients used significantly more engagement and emotion-focused coping methods, but less disengagement types of coping than patients in the remitted phase. Remitted patients under high stress levels are prone to use disengagement and emotion-focused coping strategies. In conclusion, remitted COVID-19 patients experience lower levels of stress and use less emotion-focused strategies, except among those who developed PTSD post-COVID-19 infection, presenting with high-stress levels and using more disengagement and emotion-focused types of coping strategies.</p>

	<p>Background: The neonatal behavioral assessment scale (NBAS) was primarily developed to aid in the assessment of full-term neonates. The aim of this study was to detect if the NBAS was also valuable in the assessment of preterm neonates. Materials and Methods: We assessed 112 infants at a neonatal unit using the NBAS, 4th edition. The inclusion criteria included an oxygen saturation level between 88–95% and a heartrate of 100–205 beats per minute. Infant neurobehavior was assessed using the NBAS. Results: For full-term and preterm neonates, we observed that the NBAS enabled us to assess both groups of infants and gave relevant information pertaining to them. We found a significant correlation between the average week of gestation and response to touch, sensory input, peak of excitement, cost of attention, hand-to-mouth, and quality of alertness. Conclusions: The NBAS is a valuable scale for evaluating the neurobehavior of preterm neonates. The week of gestation at birth affects certain aspects of neurobehavior, such as response to sensory input, putting hand to mouth, peak of excitement, and cost of attention. The NBAS as an individually structured assessment may help in planning for early rehabilitation and intervention for this vulnerable population.</p>

	<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system with a significant neurodegenerative component. Dysfunctional RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are causally linked to neuronal damage and are a feature of MS, including the mislocalization of the RBP heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (A1). Here, we show that primary neurons exposed to pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-A1 antibodies, both characteristic of an MS autoimmune response, displayed increased A1 mislocalization, stress granule formation, and decreased neurite length, a marker of neurodegeneration. These findings illustrate a significant relationship between secreted immune factors, A1 dysfunction, and neuronal damage in a disease-relevant model system.</p>

	<p>Human memory systems are imperfect recording devices that are affected by age and disease, but recent findings suggest that the performance of these systems may be modifiable through interventions using non-invasive brain stimulation such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). The translational potential of these rTMS interventions is clear: memory problems are the most common cognitive complaint associated with healthy aging, while pathological conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease are often associated with severe deficits in memory. Therapies to improve memory or treat memory loss could enhance independence while reducing costs for public health systems. Despite this promise, several important factors limit the generalizability and translational potential of rTMS interventions for memory. Heterogeneity of protocol design, rTMS parameters, and outcome measures present significant challenges to interpretation and reproducibility. However, recent advances in cognitive neuroscience, including rTMS approaches in addition to a new understanding of functional brain networks and related insights, may offer methodological tools necessary to design new interventional studies with enhanced experimental rigor, improved reproducibility, and greater likelihood of successful translation to clinical settings. In this review, we first discuss the current state of the literature on memory modulation with rTMS, then offer a commentary on developments in cognitive neuroscience that are relevant to rTMS interventions, and finally close by offering several recommendations for the design of future investigations using rTMS to modulate human memory performance.</p>

	<p>Background. Several brain regions are activated in response to mirror visual feedback (MVF). However, less is known about how these brain areas and their connectivity are modulated in stroke patients. This study aimed to explore the effects of MVF on brain functional connectivity in stroke patients. Materials and Methods. We enrolled 15 stroke patients who executed Bilateral-No mirror, Bilateral-Mirror, and Unilateral-Mirror conditions. The coherence values among five brain regions of interest in four different frequency bands were calculated from magnetoencephalographic signals. We examined the differences in functional connectivity of each two brain areas between the Bilateral-No mirror and Bilateral-Mirror conditions and between the Bilateral-Mirror and Unilateral-Mirror conditions. Results. The functional connectivity analyses revealed significantly stronger connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and primary motor cortex in the beta band (adjusted p = 0.04) and possibly stronger connectivity between the precuneus and primary visual cortex in the theta band (adjusted p = 0.08) in the Bilateral-Mirror condition than those in the Bilateral-No mirror condition. However, the comparisons between the Bilateral-Mirror and Unilateral-Mirror conditions revealed no significant differences in cortical coherence in all frequency bands. Conclusions. Providing MVF to stroke patients may modulate the lesioned primary motor cortex through visuospatial and attentional cortical networks.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to estimate the incidence of cerebral sinus and venous thrombosis (CVT) within 1 month from first dose administration and the frequency of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) as the underlying mechanism after vaccination with BNT162b2, ChAdOx1, and mRNA-1273, in Germany.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A web-based questionnaire was e-mailed to all departments of neurology. We requested a report of cases of CVT occurring within 1 month of a COVID-19 vaccination. Other cerebral events could also be reported. Incidence rates of CVT were calculated by using official statistics of 9 German states.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 45 CVT cases were reported. In addition, 9 primary ischemic strokes, 4 primary intracerebral hemorrhages, and 4 other neurological events were recorded. Of the CVT patients, 35 (77.8%) were female, and 36 (80.0%) were younger than 60 years. Fifty-three events were observed after vaccination with ChAdOx1 (85.5%), 9 after BNT162b2 (14.5%) vaccination, and none after mRNA-1273 vaccination. After 7,126,434 first vaccine doses, the incidence rate of CVT within 1 month from first dose administration was 0.55 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38–0.78) per 100,000 person-months (which corresponds to a risk of CVT within the first 31 days of 0.55 per 100,000 individuals) for all vaccines and 1.52 (95% CI = 1.00–2.21) for ChAdOx1 (after 2,320,535 ChAdOx1 first doses). The adjusted incidence rate ratio was 9.68 (95% CI = 3.46–34.98) for ChAdOx1 compared to mRNA-based vaccines and 3.14 (95% CI = 1.22–10.65) for females compared to non-females. In 26 of 45 patients with CVT (57.8%), VITT was graded highly probable.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Given an incidence of 0.02 to 0.15 per 100,000 person-months for CVT in the general population, these findings point toward a higher risk for CVT after ChAdOx1 vaccination, especially for women. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:627–639</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Autosomal recessive human thymidine kinase 2 (<i>TK2</i>) mutations cause TK2 deficiency, which typically manifests as a progressive and fatal mitochondrial myopathy in infants and children. Treatment with pyrimidine deoxynucleosides deoxycytidine and thymidine ameliorates mitochondrial defects and extends the lifespan of <i>Tk2</i> knock-in mouse (Tk2<sup>KI</sup>) and compassionate use deoxynucleoside therapy in TK2 deficient patients have shown promising indications of efficacy. To augment therapy for Tk2 deficiency, we assessed gene therapy alone and in combination with deoxynucleoside therapy in Tk2<sup>KI</sup> mice.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We generated pAAVsc CB6 PI vectors containing human TK2 cDNA (<i>TK2</i>). Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-<i>TK2</i> was administered to Tk2<sup>KI</sup>, which were serially assessed for weight, motor functions, and survival as well as biochemical functions in tissues. AAV-<i>TK2</i> treated mice were further treated with deoxynucleosides.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AAV9 delivery of human TK2 cDNA to Tk2<sup>KI</sup> mice efficiently rescued Tk2 activity in all the tissues tested except the kidneys, delayed disease onset, and increased lifespan. Sequential treatment of Tk2<sup>KI</sup> mice with AAV9 first followed by AAV2 at different ages allowed us to reduce the viral dose while further prolonging the lifespan. Furthermore, addition of deoxycytidine and deoxythymidine supplementation to AAV9 + AAV2 treated Tk2<sup>KI</sup> mice dramatically improved mtDNA copy numbers in the liver and kidneys, animal growth, and lifespan.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data indicate that AAV-<i>TK2</i> gene therapy as well as combination deoxynucleoside and gene therapies is more effective in Tk2<sup>KI</sup> mice than pharmacological alone. Thus, combination of gene therapy with substrate enhancement is a promising therapeutic approach for TK2 deficiency and potentially other metabolic disorders.

                <p>Pain is a under-recognized association of leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) and contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2) antibodies. Of 147 patients with these autoantibodies, pain was experienced by 17 of 33 (52%) with CASPR2- versus 20 of 108 (19%) with LGI1 antibodies (<i>p</i> = 0.0005), and identified as neuropathic in 89% versus 58% of these, respectively. Typically, in both cohorts, normal nerve conduction studies and reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber densities were observed in the sampled patient subsets. In LGI1 antibody patients, pain responded to immunotherapy (<i>p</i> = 0.008), often rapidly, with greater residual patient-rated impairment observed in CASPR2 antibody patients (<i>p</i> = 0.019). Serum CASPR2 antibodies, but not LGI1 antibodies, bound in vitro to unmyelinated human sensory neurons and rodent dorsal root ganglia, suggesting pathophysiological differences that may underlie our clinical observations.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To noninvasively assess myelin status in chronic white matter lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS), we developed and evaluated a simple classification scheme based on T1 relaxation time maps derived from 7-tesla postmortem and in vivo MRI.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using the MP2RAGE MRI sequence, we classified 36 lesions from 4 postmortem MS brains as “long-T1,” “short-T1,” and “mixed-T1” by visual comparison to neocortex. Within these groups, we compared T1 times to histologically derived measures of myelin and axons. We performed similar analysis of 235 chronic lesions with known date of onset in 25 MS cases in vivo and in a validation cohort of 222 lesions from 66 MS cases, investigating associations with clinical and radiological outcomes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Postmortem, lesions classified qualitatively as long-T1, short-T1, and mixed-T1 corresponded to fully demyelinated, fully remyelinated, and mixed demyelinated/remyelinated lesions, respectively (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.001). Demyelination (rather than axon loss) dominantly contributed to initial T1 prolongation. We observed lesions with similar characteristics in vivo, allowing manual classification with substantial interrater and excellent intrarater reliability. Short-T1 lesions were most common in the deep white matter, whereas long-T1 and mixed-T1 lesions were prevalent in the juxtacortical and periventricular white matter (<i>p</i> = 0.02) and were much more likely to have paramagnetic rims suggesting chronic inflammation (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Older age at the time of lesion formation portended less remyelination (<i>p</i> = 0.007).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>7-tesla T1 mapping with MP2RAGE, a clinically available MRI method, allows qualitative and quantitative classification of chronic MS lesions according to myelin content, rendering straightforward the tracking of lesional myelination changes over time.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Subthalamic and Pallidal Stimulations in Patients with Parkinson's Disease: Common and Dissociable Connections</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal globus pallidus (GPi) are the most effective targets in deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the common and specific effects on brain connectivity of stimulating the 2 nuclei remain unclear.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with PD receiving STN-DBS (n = 27, 6 women, mean age 64.8 years) or GPi-DBS (n = 28, 13 women, mean age 64.6 years) were recruited for resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the effects of STN-DBS and GPi-DBS on brain functional dynamics.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The functional connectivity both between the somatosensory-motor cortices and thalamus, and between the somatosensory-motor cortices and cerebellum decreased in the DBS-on state compared with the off state (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The changes in thalamocortical connectivity correlated with DBS-induced motor improvement (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and were negatively correlated with the normalized intersection volume of tissues activated at both DBS targets (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). STN-DBS modulated functional connectivity among a wider range of brain areas than GPi-DBS (<i>p</i> = 0.009). Notably, only STN-DBS affected connectivity between the postcentral gyrus and cerebellar vermis (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and between the somatomotor and visual networks (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings highlight common alterations in the motor pathway and its relationship with the motor improvement induced by both STN- and GPi-DBS. The effects on cortico-cerebellar and somatomotor-visual functional connectivity differed between groups, suggesting differentiated neural modulation of the 2 target sites. Our results provide mechanistic insight and yield the potential to refine target selection strategies for focal brain stimulation in PD. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:670–682</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p><i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis, a disease that, despite treatment with antibiotics, still is associated with high mortality and morbidity worldwide. Diffuse brain swelling is a leading cause of morbidity in <i>S pneumoniae</i> meningitis. We hypothesized that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) disrupt cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) transport by the glymphatic system and contribute to edema formation in <i>S pneumoniae</i> meningitis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used DNase I treatment to disrupt NETs and then assessed glymphatic function by cisterna magna injections of CSF tracers in a rat model of <i>S pneumoniae</i> meningitis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our analysis showed that CSF influx into the brain parenchyma, as well as CSF drainage to the cervical lymph nodes, was significantly reduced in the rat model of <i>S pneumoniae</i> meningitis. Degrading NETs by DNase treatment restored glymphatic transport and eliminated the increase in brain weight in the rats. In contrast, first-line antibiotic treatment had no such effect on restoring fluid dynamics.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study suggests that CSF accumulation is responsible for cerebral edema formation and identifies the glymphatic system and NETs as possible new treatment targets in <i>S pneumoniae</i> meningitis. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:653–669</p>

                <p>Central nervous system demyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS) and subsequent axonal degeneration represent a major cause of clinical morbidity. Learning, salient experiences, and stimulation of neuronal activity induce new myelin formation in rodents, and in animal models of demyelination, remyelination can be enhanced via experience- and activity-dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, preliminary studies in MS patients support the use of neuromodulation and rehabilitation exercises for symptomatic improvement, suggesting that these interventions may represent nonpharmacological strategies for promoting remyelination. Here, we review the literature on myelin plasticity processes and assess the potential to leverage these mechanisms to develop remyelinating therapies. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:558–567</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although plasmapheresis is a treatment option for patients with autoimmune neurological diseases, treatment response varies greatly among patients. The main objective of this study was to find out if biological/immune traits correlate with a beneficial response.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We thoroughly analyzed immune phenotypes in paired blood samples from a cohort of 31 patients with multiple sclerosis before and after plasmapheresis, in parallel with clinical evaluation of treatment response.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The frequency of IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells was persistently higher in those who obtained benefit from plasmapheresis (responders) than nonresponders. The Th1 cell frequency before plasmapheresis provided a high predictive value for beneficial response, achieving area under the curve (AUC) of 0.902. Plasmapheresis treatment decreased inflammation-related gene expressions in Th1 cells. Meanwhile, <i>IFNG</i> expression in Th1 cells positively correlated with the frequency of CD11c<sup>+</sup> B cells, of which a pathogenic role has been suggested in several autoimmune diseases. In line with this, in vitro experiments showed that CD11c<sup>+</sup> B cells would increase in response to exogenous IFN-γ compared to IL-4, and secrete high amounts of IgG. B cell receptor analysis indicated that clonal expansion of CD11c<sup>+</sup> B cells takes place in patients with multiple sclerosis. Interestingly, CD11c<sup>+</sup> B cells, which showed unique gene expression profile, decreased after plasmapheresis treatment along with all the immunoglobulin subsets in the circulation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Taken together, we postulate that Th1 cell - CD11c<sup>+</sup> B cell axis is involved in treatment response to plasmapheresis, giving us clues to better understanding of complicated pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, and getting closer to a personalized therapy.

                <p>On behalf of the German Neurological Society (DGN), a study was conducted into how far former chairmen, honorary chairmen, and honorary members could be regarded as incriminated from the National Socialist period. While an online supplement of this journal presents seven individual biographies (in six papers) by way of example, this paper offers an overview summarizing the project results and introducing the biographies. The first part and the methodological section discuss the difficulties of retrospectively identifying neurologists involved in the Nazi movement. Formal characteristics (eg, membership of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) or other Nazi organizations or participation in Nazi crimes) and content-related clues (eg, statements reflecting Nazi ideology, personal contacts with Nazi officials or active support of the system) can be helpful. The second part summarizes the principal results of a study of 28 German and Austrian neuroscientists with regard to their involvement and their post-war careers. Six of the seven “founding fathers” of the DGN were former NSDAP members; 10 of the 13 presidents in office until 1976 had belonged to Nazi organizations—the NSDAP, the SA (“Brownshirts”) or the SS (“Blackshirts”). Moreover, seven out of 10 honorary presidents had formal or substantive links to National Socialism. Of the German and Austrian honorary members appointed up to 1985, two-thirds had leanings to Nazi ideology or the National Socialist system. This paper concludes by outlining how the DGN and its members are currently addressing this historical legacy in order to establish a responsible culture of remembrance.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Interaction between Preterm White Matter Injury and Childhood Thalamic Growth</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine how preterm white matter injury (WMI) and long-term thalamic growth interact to predict 8-year neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A prospective cohort of 114 children born at 24 to 32 weeksʼ gestational age (GA) underwent structural and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging early in life (median 32 weeks), at term-equivalent age and at 8 years. Manual segmentation of neonatal WMI was performed on T1-weighted images and thalamic volumes were obtained using the MAGeT brain segmentation pipeline. Cognitive, motor, and visual-motor outcomes were evaluated at 8 years of age. Multivariable regression was used to examine the relationship among neonatal WMI volume, school-age thalamic volume, and neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>School-age thalamic volumes were predicted by neonatal thalamic growth rate, GA, sex, and neonatal WMI volume (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). After accounting for total cerebral volume, WMI volume remained associated with school-age thalamic volume (β = −0.31, <i>p</i> = 0.005). In thalamocortical tracts, fractional anisotropy (FA) at term-equivalent age interacted with early WMI volume to predict school-age thalamic volumes (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.02). School-age thalamic volumes and neonatal WMI interacted to predict full-scale IQ (<i>p</i> = 0.002) and adverse motor scores among those with significant WMI (<i>p</i> = 0.01). Visual-motor scores were predicted by thalamic volumes (<i>p</i> = 0.04).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In very preterm-born children, neonatal thalamic growth and WMI volume predict school-age thalamic volumes. The emergence at term of an interaction between FA and WMI to impact school-age thalamic volume indicates dysmaturation as a mechanism of thalamic growth failure. Cognition is predicted by the interaction of WMI and thalamic growth, highlighting the need to consider multiple dimensions of brain injury in these children.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Brain Structure and Degeneration Staging in Friedreich Ataxia: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Volumetrics from the ENIGMA‐Ataxia Working Group</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an inherited neurological disease defined by progressive movement incoordination. We undertook a comprehensive characterization of the spatial profile and progressive evolution of structural brain abnormalities in people with FRDA.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A coordinated international analysis of regional brain volume using magnetic resonance imaging data charted the whole-brain profile, interindividual variability, and temporal staging of structural brain differences in 248 individuals with FRDA and 262 healthy controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The brainstem, dentate nucleus region, and superior and inferior cerebellar peduncles showed the greatest reductions in volume relative to controls (Cohen <i>d</i> = 1.5–2.6). Cerebellar gray matter alterations were most pronounced in lobules I–VI (<i>d</i> = 0.8), whereas cerebral differences occurred most prominently in precentral gyri (<i>d</i> = 0.6) and corticospinal tracts (<i>d</i> = 1.4). Earlier onset age predicted less volume in the motor cerebellum (<i>r</i>
<sub>
   <i>max</i>
</sub> = 0.35) and peduncles (<i>r</i>
<sub>
   <i>max</i>
</sub> = 0.36). Disease duration and severity correlated with volume deficits in the dentate nucleus region, brainstem, and superior/inferior cerebellar peduncles (<i>r</i>
<sub>
   <i>max</i>
</sub> = −0.49); subgrouping showed these to be robust and early features of FRDA, and strong candidates for further biomarker validation. Cerebral white matter abnormalities, particularly in corticospinal pathways, emerge as intermediate disease features. Cerebellar and cerebral gray matter loss, principally targeting motor and sensory systems, preferentially manifests later in the disease course.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>FRDA is defined by an evolving spatial profile of neuroanatomical changes beyond primary pathology in the cerebellum and spinal cord, in line with its progressive clinical course. The design, interpretation, and generalization of research studies and clinical trials must consider neuroanatomical staging and associated interindividual variability in brain measures.

                <p>A pair of schematic illustrations showing how the glymphatic system is impaired by pneumococcal meningitis. In healthy brain (left), CSF enters the brain parenchyma via periarterial pathways (blue arrows), washes out metabolites and waste products (small gray star-like clusters), and exits the brain via perivenular paths. Neutrophils (green) are only intravascular. During pneumococcal meningitis, bacteria (red) proliferate in the subarachnoid and perivascular spaces, and neutrophils are recruited to form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs, dark green clusters attached to neutrophils), leading to glymphatic impairment and cerebral edema. See paper by Pavan and colleagues for more complete explanation (pp. 653–669, this issue).</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dynamic Electrode-to-Image (DETI) mapping reveals the human brain’s spatiotemporal code of visual information</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bruce C. Hansen, Michelle R. Greene, David J. Field</p>

A number of neuroimaging techniques have been employed to understand how visual information is transformed along the visual pathway. Although each technique has spatial and temporal limitations, they can each provide important insights into the visual code. While the BOLD signal of fMRI can be quite informative, the visual code is not static and this can be obscured by fMRI’s poor temporal resolution. In this study, we leveraged the high temporal resolution of EEG to develop an encoding technique based on the distribution of responses generated by a population of real-world scenes. This approach maps neural signals to each pixel within a given image and reveals location-specific transformations of the visual code, providing a spatiotemporal signature for the image at each electrode. Our analyses of the mapping results revealed that scenes undergo a series of nonuniform transformations that prioritize different spatial frequencies at different regions of scenes over time. This mapping technique offers a potential avenue for future studies to explore how dynamic feedforward and recurrent processes inform and refine high-level representations of our visual world.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Transcriptomic profiling in canines and humans reveals cancer specific gene modules and biological mechanisms common to both species</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gregory J. Tawa, John Braisted, David Gerhold, Gurmit Grewal, Christina Mazcko, Matthew Breen, Gurusingham Sittampalam, Amy K. LeBlanc</p>

Understanding relationships between spontaneous cancer in companion (pet) canines and humans can facilitate biomarker and drug development in both species. Towards this end we developed an experimental-bioinformatic protocol that analyzes canine transcriptomics data in the context of existing human data to evaluate comparative relevance of canine to human cancer. We used this protocol to characterize five canine cancers: melanoma, osteosarcoma, pulmonary carcinoma, B- and T-cell lymphoma, in 60 dogs. We applied an unsupervised, iterative clustering method that yielded five co-expression modules and found that each cancer exhibited a unique module expression profile. We constructed cancer models based on the co-expression modules and used the models to successfully classify the canine data. These canine-derived models also successfully classified human tumors representing the same cancers, indicating shared cancer biology between canines and humans. Annotation of the module genes identified cancer specific pathways relevant to cells-of-origin and tumor biology. For example, annotations associated with melanin production (<i>PMEL</i>, <i>GPNMB</i>, and <i>BACE2</i>), synthesis of bone material (<i>COL5A2</i>, <i>COL6A3</i>, and <i>COL12A1</i>), synthesis of pulmonary surfactant (<i>CTSH</i>, <i>LPCAT1</i>, and <i>NAPSA</i>), ribosomal proteins (<i>RPL8</i>, <i>RPS7</i>, and <i>RPLP0</i>), and epigenetic regulation (<i>EDEM1</i>, <i>PTK2B</i>, and <i>JAK1</i>) were unique to melanoma, osteosarcoma, pulmonary carcinoma, B- and T-cell lymphoma, respectively. In total, 152 biomarker candidates were selected from highly expressing modules for each cancer type. Many of these biomarker candidates are under-explored as drug discovery targets and warrant further study. The demonstrated transferability of classification models from canines to humans enforces the idea that tumor biology, biomarker targets, and associated therapeutics, discovered in canines, may translate to human medicine.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">dGPredictor: Automated fragmentation method for metabolic reaction free energy prediction and de novo pathway design</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lin Wang, Vikas Upadhyay, Costas D. Maranas</p>

Group contribution (GC) methods are conventionally used in thermodynamics analysis of metabolic pathways to estimate the standard Gibbs energy change (<i>Δ</i><sub>r</sub><i>G</i>′<sup>o</sup>) of enzymatic reactions from limited experimental measurements. However, these methods are limited by their dependence on manually curated groups and inability to capture stereochemical information, leading to low reaction coverage. Herein, we introduce an automated molecular fingerprint-based thermodynamic analysis tool called dGPredictor that enables the consideration of stereochemistry within metabolite structures and thus increases reaction coverage. dGPredictor has comparable prediction accuracy compared to existing GC methods and can capture Gibbs energy changes for isomerase and transferase reactions, which exhibit no overall group changes. We also demonstrate dGPredictor’s ability to predict the Gibbs energy change for novel reactions and seamless integration within <i>de novo</i> metabolic pathway design tools such as novoStoic for safeguarding against the inclusion of reaction steps with infeasible directionalities. To facilitate easy access to dGPredictor, we developed a graphical user interface to predict the standard Gibbs energy change for reactions at various pH and ionic strengths. The tool allows customized user input of known metabolites as KEGG IDs and novel metabolites as InChI strings (https://github.com/maranasgroup/dGPredictor).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">GRAFIMO: Variant and haplotype aware motif scanning on pangenome graphs</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Manuel Tognon, Vincenzo Bonnici, Erik Garrison, Rosalba Giugno, Luca Pinello</p>

Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that promote or reduce the expression of genes by binding short genomic DNA sequences known as transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). While several tools have been developed to scan for potential occurrences of TFBS in linear DNA sequences or reference genomes, no tool exists to find them in pangenome variation graphs (VGs). VGs are sequence-labelled graphs that can efficiently encode collections of genomes and their variants in a single, compact data structure. Because VGs can losslessly compress large pangenomes, TFBS scanning in VGs can efficiently capture how genomic variation affects the potential binding landscape of TFs in a population of individuals. Here we present GRAFIMO (GRAph-based Finding of Individual Motif Occurrences), a command-line tool for the scanning of known TF DNA motifs represented as Position Weight Matrices (PWMs) in VGs. GRAFIMO extends the standard PWM scanning procedure by considering variations and alternative haplotypes encoded in a VG. Using GRAFIMO on a VG based on individuals from the 1000 Genomes project we recover several potential binding sites that are enhanced, weakened or missed when scanning only the reference genome, and which could constitute individual-specific binding events. GRAFIMO is available as an open-source tool, under the MIT license, at https://github.com/pinellolab/GRAFIMO and https://github.com/InfOmics/GRAFIMO.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A model of head direction and landmark coding in complex environments</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yijia Yan, Neil Burgess, Andrej Bicanski</p>

Environmental information is required to stabilize estimates of head direction (HD) based on angular path integration. However, it is unclear how this happens in real-world (visually complex) environments. We present a computational model of how visual feedback can stabilize HD information in environments that contain multiple cues of varying stability and directional specificity. We show how combinations of feature-specific visual inputs can generate a stable unimodal landmark bearing signal, even in the presence of multiple cues and ambiguous directional specificity. This signal is associated with the retrosplenial HD signal (inherited from thalamic HD cells) and conveys feedback to the subcortical HD circuitry. The model predicts neurons with a unimodal encoding of the egocentric orientation of the array of landmarks, rather than any one particular landmark. The relationship between these abstract landmark bearing neurons and head direction cells is reminiscent of the relationship between place cells and grid cells. Their unimodal encoding is formed from visual inputs via a modified version of Oja’s Subspace Algorithm. The rule allows the landmark bearing signal to disconnect from directionally unstable or ephemeral cues, incorporate newly added stable cues, support orientation across many different environments (high memory capacity), and is consistent with recent empirical findings on bidirectional HD firing reported in the retrosplenial cortex. Our account of visual feedback for HD stabilization provides a novel perspective on neural mechanisms of spatial navigation within richer sensory environments, and makes experimentally testable predictions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Hybrid computational modeling demonstrates the utility of simulating complex cellular networks in type 1 diabetes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zhenzhen Shi, Yang Li, Majid Jaberi-Douraki</p>

Persistent destruction of pancreatic β-cells in type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from multifaceted pancreatic cellular interactions in various phase progressions. Owing to the inherent heterogeneity of coupled nonlinear systems, computational modeling based on T1D etiology help achieve a systematic understanding of biological processes and T1D health outcomes. The main challenge is to design such a reliable framework to analyze the highly orchestrated biology of T1D based on the knowledge of cellular networks and biological parameters. We constructed a novel hybrid in-silico computational model to unravel T1D onset, progression, and prevention in a non-obese-diabetic mouse model. The computational approach that integrates mathematical modeling, agent-based modeling, and advanced statistical methods allows for modeling key biological parameters and time-dependent spatial networks of cell behaviors. By integrating interactions between multiple cell types, model results captured the individual-specific dynamics of T1D progression and were validated against experimental data for the number of infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup>T-cells. Our simulation results uncovered the correlation between five auto-destructive mechanisms identifying a combination of potential therapeutic strategies: the average lifespan of cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup>T-cells in islets; the initial number of apoptotic β-cells; recruitment rate of dendritic-cells (DCs); binding sites on DCs for naïve CD8<sup>+</sup>T-cells; and time required for DCs movement. Results from therapy-directed simulations further suggest the efficacy of proposed therapeutic strategies depends upon the type and time of administering therapy interventions and the administered amount of therapeutic dose. Our findings show modeling immunogenicity that underlies autoimmune T1D and identifying autoantigens that serve as potential biomarkers are two pressing parameters to predict disease onset and progression.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">FunOrder: A robust and semi-automated method for the identification of essential biosynthetic genes through computational molecular co-evolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gabriel A. Vignolle, Denise Schaffer, Leopold Zehetner, Robert L. Mach, Astrid R. Mach-Aigner, Christian Derntl</p>

Secondary metabolites (SMs) are a vast group of compounds with different structures and properties that have been utilized as drugs, food additives, dyes, and as monomers for novel plastics. In many cases, the biosynthesis of SMs is catalysed by enzymes whose corresponding genes are co-localized in the genome in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Notably, BGCs may contain so-called gap genes, that are not involved in the biosynthesis of the SM. Current genome mining tools can identify BGCs, but they have problems with distinguishing essential genes from gap genes. This can and must be done by expensive, laborious, and time-consuming comparative genomic approaches or transcriptome analyses. In this study, we developed a method that allows semi-automated identification of essential genes in a BGC based on co-evolution analysis. To this end, the protein sequences of a BGC are blasted against a suitable proteome database. For each protein, a phylogenetic tree is created. The trees are compared by treeKO to detect co-evolution. The results of this comparison are visualized in different output formats, which are compared visually. Our results suggest that co-evolution is commonly occurring within BGCs, albeit not all, and that especially those genes that encode for enzymes of the biosynthetic pathway are co-evolutionary linked and can be identified with FunOrder. In light of the growing number of genomic data available, this will contribute to the studies of BGCs in native hosts and facilitate heterologous expression in other organisms with the aim of the discovery of novel SMs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Meta-analysis of transcriptomic data reveals clusters of consistently deregulated gene and disease ontologies in Down syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ilario De Toma, Cesar Sierra, Mara Dierssen</p>

Trisomy of human chromosome 21 (HSA21) causes Down syndrome (DS). The trisomy does not simply result in the upregulation of HSA21--encoded genes but also leads to a genome-wide transcriptomic deregulation, which may differently affect each tissue and cell type as results of epigenetic mechanisms and protein-protein interactions.
We performed a meta-analysis integrating the differential expression (DE) analyses of all publicly available transcriptomic datasets, both in human and mouse, comparing trisomic and euploid transcriptomes from different sources. We integrated all these data in a “DS network”.
We found that genome wide deregulation as a consequence of trisomy 21 is not arbitrary, but involves deregulation of specific molecular cascades in which both HSA21 genes and HSA21 interactors are more consistently deregulated compared to other genes. In fact, gene deregulation happens in “clusters”, so that groups from 2 to 13 genes are found consistently deregulated. Most of these events of “co-deregulation” involve genes belonging to the same GO category, and genes associated with the same disease class. The most consistent changes are enriched in interferon related categories and neutrophil activation, reinforcing the concept that DS is an inflammatory disease. Our results also suggest that the impact of the trisomy might diverge in each tissue due to the different gene set deregulation, even though the triplicated genes are the same.
Our original method to integrate transcriptomic data confirmed not only the importance of known genes, such as SOD1, but also detected new ones that could be extremely useful for generating or confirming hypotheses and supporting new putative therapeutic candidates. We created “metaDEA” an R package that uses our method to integrate every kind of transcriptomic data and therefore could be used with other complex disorders, such as cancer. We also created a user-friendly web application to query Ensembl gene IDs and retrieve all the information of their differential expression across the datasets.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optima TB: A tool to help optimally allocate tuberculosis spending</a></h4>

Approximately 85% of tuberculosis (TB) related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries where health resources are scarce. Effective priority setting is required to maximise the impact of limited budgets. The Optima TB tool has been developed to support analytical capacity and inform evidence-based priority setting processes for TB health benefits package design. This paper outlines the Optima TB framework and how it was applied in Belarus, an upper-middle income country in Eastern Europe with a relatively high burden of TB. Optima TB is a population-based disease transmission model, with programmatic cost functions and an optimisation algorithm. Modelled populations include age-differentiated general populations and higher-risk populations such as people living with HIV. Populations and prospective interventions are defined in consultation with local stakeholders. In partnership with the latter, demographic, epidemiological, programmatic, as well as cost and spending data for these populations and interventions are then collated. An optimisation analysis of TB spending was conducted in Belarus, using program objectives and constraints defined in collaboration with local stakeholders, which included experts, decision makers, funders and organisations involved in service delivery, support and technical assistance. These analyses show that it is possible to improve health impact by redistributing current TB spending in Belarus. Specifically, shifting funding from inpatient- to outpatient-focused care models, and from mass screening to active case finding strategies, could reduce TB prevalence and mortality by up to 45% and 50%, respectively, by 2035. In addition, an optimised allocation of TB spending could lead to a reduction in drug-resistant TB infections by 40% over this period. This would support progress towards national TB targets without additional financial resources. The case study in Belarus demonstrates how reallocations of spending across existing and new interventions could have a substantial impact on TB outcomes. This highlights the potential for Optima TB and similar modelling tools to support evidence-based priority setting.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">XENet: Using a new graph convolution to accelerate the timeline for protein design on quantum computers</a></h4>

Graph representations are traditionally used to represent protein structures in sequence design protocols in which the protein backbone conformation is known. This infrequently extends to machine learning projects: existing graph convolution algorithms have shortcomings when representing protein environments. One reason for this is the lack of emphasis on edge attributes during massage-passing operations. Another reason is the traditionally shallow nature of graph neural network architectures. Here we introduce an improved message-passing operation that is better equipped to model local kinematics problems such as protein design. Our approach, XENet, pays special attention to both incoming and outgoing edge attributes. We compare XENet against existing graph convolutions in an attempt to decrease rotamer sample counts in Rosetta’s rotamer substitution protocol, used for protein side-chain optimization and sequence design. This use case is motivating because it both reduces the size of the search space for classical side-chain optimization algorithms, and allows larger protein design problems to be solved with quantum algorithms on near-term quantum computers with limited qubit counts. XENet outperformed competing models while also displaying a greater tolerance for deeper architectures. We found that XENet was able to decrease rotamer counts by 40% without loss in quality. This decreased the memory consumption for classical pre-computation of rotamer energies in our use case by more than a factor of 3, the qubit consumption for an existing sequence design quantum algorithm by 40%, and the size of the solution space by a factor of 165. Additionally, XENet displayed an ability to handle deeper architectures than competing convolutions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Memes: A motif analysis environment in R using tools from the MEME Suite</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Spencer L. Nystrom, Daniel J. McKay</p>

Identification of biopolymer motifs represents a key step in the analysis of biological sequences. The MEME Suite is a widely used toolkit for comprehensive analysis of biopolymer motifs; however, these tools are poorly integrated within popular analysis frameworks like the R/Bioconductor project, creating barriers to their use. Here we present memes, an R package that provides a seamless R interface to a selection of popular MEME Suite tools. memes provides a novel “data aware” interface to these tools, enabling rapid and complex discriminative motif analysis workflows. In addition to interfacing with popular MEME Suite tools, memes leverages existing R/Bioconductor data structures to store the multidimensional data returned by MEME Suite tools for rapid data access and manipulation. Finally, memes provides data visualization capabilities to facilitate communication of results. memes is available as a Bioconductor package at https://bioconductor.org/packages/memes, and the source code can be found at github.com/snystrom/memes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational analysis of GAL pathway pinpoints mechanisms underlying natural variation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jiayin Hong, Julius Palme, Bo Hua, Michael Springer</p>

Quantitative traits are measurable phenotypes that show continuous variation over a wide phenotypic range. Enormous effort has recently been put into determining the genetic influences on a variety of quantitative traits with mixed success. We identified a quantitative trait in a tractable model system, the GAL pathway in yeast, which controls the uptake and metabolism of the sugar galactose. GAL pathway activation depends both on galactose concentration and on the concentrations of competing, preferred sugars such as glucose. Natural yeast isolates show substantial variation in the behavior of the pathway. All studied yeast strains exhibit bimodal responses relative to external galactose concentration, i.e. a set of galactose concentrations existed at which both GAL-induced and GAL-repressed subpopulations were observed. However, these concentrations differed in different strains. We built a mechanistic model of the GAL pathway and identified parameters that are plausible candidates for capturing the phenotypic features of a set of strains including standard lab strains, natural variants, and mutants. <i>In silico</i> perturbation of these parameters identified variation in the intracellular galactose sensor, Gal3p, the negative feedback node within the GAL regulatory network, Gal80p, and the hexose transporters, HXT, as the main sources of the bimodal range variation. We were able to switch the phenotype of individual yeast strains <i>in silico</i> by tuning parameters related to these three elements. Determining the basis for these behavioral differences may give insight into how the GAL pathway processes information, and into the evolution of nutrient metabolism preferences in different strains. More generally, our method of identifying the key parameters that explain phenotypic variation in this system should be generally applicable to other quantitative traits.

                Background - One of the problems encountered by all universities in realizing a sustainable Green Campus is solid waste management due to its complex and dynamic nature, which is known to have the potential risks of failure.  Aim – Application of a dynamic modeling approach with the FMEA and AHP methods to eliminate the risk associated with the inability of universities to process solid waste.   Methods– Data on risk factors and alternative evaluation methods were collected from five experts from various fields.  Results – The results of the risk assessment by experts show some of the highest risk values are associated with Technological Infrastructure, with a risk value of around 900, and the lowest risk is associated with Regulation collisions with a risk value of around 378. The results provided adequate information on the increased risk of each factor from 2019 to 2030 with verified moderate and optimistic conditions models comprising significant values of approximately 0.009 and 0.0273, respectively. This study assists higher education management in decreasing risk failure in the region by creating simulation models that will likely be utilized for scenario analysis in the future. The System Dynamic model's entire approach proved helpful in accomplishing long-term solid waste management in universities. Other dynamic insights that assisted universities improve their knowledge of solid waste management systems.  Research limitations– Further study needs to be conducted in the dynamic model to obtain a more comprehensive and detailed result. This is because the developed model provided an overview that needs further improvement, especially concerning several quantitative data, towards obtaining the adequate method for sustainable solid waste management.  Originality/value – This research used the hybrid method and AHP techniques to analyze solid waste in universities which were developed into a dynamic system model. However, further research is needed to enhance this hybrid method.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence and characteristics of cancer patients with COVID-19: a meta-analysis study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cancer patients are considered susceptible to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) due to an immunosuppressive state. This study determined the prevalence of cancer in COVID-19 patients, severe events, case fatality rate, history of anticancer therapy associated with severe events, and type of cancer in cancer patients with COVID-19 in the world. Methods: This study used a meta-analysis study approach, sourcing studies from various countries related to cancer and COVID-19. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were established to select studies. A PRISMA flowchart was presented to assess the selection process. Data from inclusion studies were analyzed using Review Manager 5.4. Results: The prevalence of cancer in COVID-19 patients was 4.63% (95% CI, 3.78-5.49%) worldwide. The lowest prevalence was the Asian study group with 2.36% (95% CI, 1.86-2.87%) and the highest prevalence was the European study group with 10.93% (95% CI, 6.62-15.24%). About 43.26% (95% CI, 34.71-51.80%) of cancer patients with COVID-19 experienced severe events of COVID-19. In total, 58.13% (95% CI, 42.79-73.48%) of cancer patients with COVID-19 who in the last month had a history of anticancer therapy experienced severe events. The prevalence of lung cancer in cancer patients with COVID-19 was 20.23% (95% CI, 7.67-32.78%). Forest plots are also presented related to the results of meta-analysis research. Conclusions: High prevalence of cancer among COVID-19 patients indicates the susceptibility of cancer patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cancer in COVID-19 patients and use of anticancer therapy increase severe events of COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparison of the EQ-5D-5L and the EQ-5D-3L using individual patient data from the REFORM trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This study compares the 5-level version of the EQ-5D (5L) with the 3-level version EQ-5D (3L) in older adults using individual patient data from the REFORM (REducing Falls with Orthoses and a Multifaceted podiatry intervention) trial. Methods: EQ-5D-5L and EQ-5D-3L were administered to men and women (n=151) over the age of 65 years alongside the REFORM trial. The two versions of the EQ-5D were assessed in terms of feasibility, level of consistency, ceiling effect and discriminatory power. We also undertook a comparison of the performance of different EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L value sets. Results: The proportion of participants that returned a complete questionnaire was higher for the 5L (96.7%) than for the 3L (92.7%). Missing values among dimensions were on average 1.59% (5L) and 1.45% (3L). The ceiling effect was reduced from 18.2% (3L) to 6% (5L). On average the proportion of inconsistent responses between both descriptive systems was 3.25%. Redistribution from 3L to 5L showed valid results for the majority of consistent level combinations, with slight inconsistency in the case of Anxiety/Depression. For the 5L, 67 unique health states were observed for the 5L compared to 27 for the 3L. The absolute informatively improved with the new classification system (5.48 for 5L versus 3.91 for 3L) and relative discriminatory power improved slightly on average (0.90 for 5L versus 0.84 for 3L). The mean difference between the EQ-5D-5L and EQ-5D-3L values was 0.091 (range -0.345 to 0.505); whilst the mean difference between the EQ-5D-5L and the crosswalk values was 0.082 (range -0.035 to 0.293). Conclusion: In the REFORM clinical trial involving an elderly population, our study supported the feasibility and convergent validity of both EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L. Results suggest that the 5L improves the ceiling effect and discriminatory power. The EQ-5D-5L scores were significantly higher than both EQ-5D-3L and crosswalk.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A study protocol for the cardiac effects of a single dose of either oxytocin 2.5 IU or carbetocin 100 µg after caesarean delivery: a prospective randomized controlled multi-centre trial in Norway [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Both oxytocin and carbetocin are used to prevent uterine atony and post-partum haemorrhage after caesarean delivery in many countries, including Norway. Oxytocin causes dose-dependent ST-depression, troponin release, prolongation of QT-time and arrythmia, but little is known about myocardial effects of carbetocin. We have previously demonstrated comparable vasodilatory effects of oxytocin and carbetocin and are now undertaking a Phase 4 trial to investigate whether carbetocin causes similar changes to myocardial markers compared with oxytocin. Methods: Our randomized controlled trial will be conducted at three obstetrics units at Oslo University Hospital and Akershus University Hospital, Norway. Planned enrolment will be of 240 healthy, singleton pregnant women aged 18 to 50 years undergoing planned caesarean delivery. Based on pilot study data, each participant will receive a one-minute intravenous injection of either oxytocin 2.5 IU or carbetocin 100 µg during caesarean delivery. The prespecified primary outcome is the change from baseline in high-sensitive troponin I plasma concentrations at 6–10 hours after study drug administration. Secondary outcomes include uterine tone grade at 2.5 and five minutes after study drug administration, adverse events for up to 48 hours after study drug administration, estimated blood loss within eight hours of delivery, need for rescue treatment and direct/indirect costs. Enrolment and primary analysis are expected to be completed by the end of 2021. Discussion: Women undergoing caesarean delivery should be assessed for cardiovascular risk particularly as women with an obstetric history of pregnancy induced hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm birth, placental abruption, and stillbirth are at increased risk of future cardiovascular disease. Any additional ischaemic myocardial risk from uterotonic agents will need to be balanced with the benefit of reducing the risk of postpartum haemorrhage. Any potential cardiotoxicity difference between oxytocin and carbetocin will help inform treatment decisions for pregnant women. Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03899961 (02/04/2019).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Online food delivery services: cross-sectional study of consumers’ attitude in Malaysia during and after the COVID-19 pandemic [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, Malaysian consumers were more likely to purchase food online and have it delivered to their doorstep. To stay afloat, many restaurants were pushed to provide online food delivery services (OFDS), and this sector has grown tremendously. However, will the trend persist after the pandemic? This study aims to look into how consumers’ perceptions of OFDS affect their attitude towards them. It investigates the relationship between convenience motivation, perceived ease of use, time-saving orientation and price-saving orientation in terms of future intent to use OFDS. Method: Primary data was collected from 307 respondents in Malaysia using convenience sampling method through an online survey. Respondents’ demographic background was presented statistically in cross tabulation tables to study the ratio comparison implicitly. Consistent Partial Least Square approach and bootstrapping techniques with 5,000 subsamples was employed, with the aid of SmartPLS.V3 software, to identify the significant factors influencing consumers’ continuance intention after the pandemic. Result: Perceived ease of use does not contribute significantly to continuance intention as most consumers have prior online purchase experience.  Nevertheless, time-saving orientation has a positive correlation with perceived ease of use due to the simplicity of placing an order with just a click.  It is also found that price-saving orientation is related to convenience motivation, particularly when prices can be compared on the websites or online ordering platforms. Consumers’ intention to continue using OFDS even after the COVID-19 pandemic is positively influenced by all the parameters studied, except for perceived ease of use. Conclusion: Limited work has been done on the continuance intention to use OFDS beyond the pandemic. This study provides insight for food retailers on how to enhance their business and retain their customers with the support of technology, even after the COVID-19 pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Protocol for a cross-sectional study on factors affecting health-related quality of life among Afghan refugees in Pakistan [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pakistan served as a host for more than 1.4 million Afghan refugees for more than 40 years. Access to health care is the most important issue faced by refugees, because they might be at a higher risk for certain diseases. This risk can be attributed to a lack of awareness of health care facilities, health beliefs, inadequate hygiene, cultural differences, and malnutrition. Health of individuals is closely associated with their quality of life. Quality of life over the whole lifespan is pivotal to overall life satisfaction. It includes physical wellbeing, mental health, education, occupation, income, personal safety, as well as (religious) freedom. Until now, the health status of Afghan refugees has never been comprehensively investigated in Pakistan. Therefore, an assessment in this regard is needed to explore their health-related quality of life, for securing their human right to health. Methods: A cross-sectional study has been designed to describe and explain the health-related quality of life of Afghan refugees in Pakistan. Multistage cluster sampling was applied for selection of study participants. The number of respondents from two regions in Pakistan was drawn through a proportionate sampling technique. A quantitative research method using pre-validated questionnaires was used for data collection. The questionnaire included items to assess well-being, mental health, health literacy, and factors affecting health and health care. Descriptive analysis was used, whereas inferential statistical tests (binary logistic regression model) was also performed. The study received ethically permission by the Advanced Studies and Research Board of the University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan. Discussion: The assessment of Afghan refugee’s quality of life in Pakistan should lead to recommendations disseminated to public and health care officials. This evidence is needed for policymaking related to adequate measures for improving health conditions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Stakeholder perceptions of strategies to reduce fast food consumption in Cambodian adults [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Fast food consumption is one of the major contributing factors effecting overweightness and obesity, leading to many non-communicable diseases. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine strategies for reducing the fast-food consumption of Cambodian adults.  Methods: This qualitative study was conducted among adults in Phnom Penh city, Cambodia, in 2018. 10 stakeholders were included from different institutions in Cambodia, mostly health institutions. The tools used in this study were a multidisciplinary meeting with stakeholders and the completion of observation forms. Using a semi-structured questionnaire, data were collected, and a thematic analysis was used. Results: Stakeholders’ viewpoints followed three identifiable themes with regard to approaches to reduce fast-food consumption among Cambodian adults. These comprised: (1) health education and health promotion (focusing on educational institutions), (2) reducing the availability and marketing impact of fast-food, and (3) implementing government policy. Conclusions: Knowing the important contributors to reduce the consumption of the fast food among Cambodia adults was the first priorities for all policy makers and other stakeholders to take action. This study provided essential findings for improving the decision-making abilities of those preparing strategy and policy for reducing fast-food consumption.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of oral manifestations in patients with lupus erythematosus in a sample of the Egyptian population: a hospital based cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Several systemic diseases manifest themselves in the oral cavity. Oral manifestations of lupus erythematosus (LE) are associated with a significantly increased risk of cancer. Dentists who are unaware of these lesions will possibly miss them. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the prevalence of oral manifestations in patients with LE in a sample of the Egyptian population. Methods: A descriptive study was performed on 189 patients attending the Internal Medicine Department, Rheumatology Clinic in EL Qasr EL Ainy Hospital, Cairo University. Every patient was examined clinically after completing a questionnaire. Moreover, patients’ medical records were also evaluated.  The oral manifestations were recorded according to the WHO guide to physical examination of the oral cavity and classified according to their morphologic aspects and localization. Results: Out of 189 patients, there were 182 females (96.3%) and seven males (3.7%). The prevalence of oral lesions in LE patients was 55.6%. The most affected site was the tongue 25.7%. The most common clinical aspect was patches, 53%. About 77.1% of the lesions were asymptomatic. 74.3% of the patients had oral candidiasis. The prevalence of skin lesions in LE patients was 37.6%. The most common finding was malar rash 79%. Conclusions: The present study emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis of oral lesions to recognize patients with LE as the WHO considers oral manifestations of LE a widespread state associated with an increased risk of cancer. Also, implementation of oral hygiene measures and treatment to improve patients’ nutritional state and health-related quality of life are recommended.

                <p>Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-antibody (Ab)–associated diseases (MOGAD) account for a substantial proportion of pediatric and adult patients who present with acquired demyelinating disorders. Its pathogenesis and optimal therapy are incompletely understood. We profiled systemic complement activation in adult and pediatric patients with MOGAD compared to patients with relapse-onset multiple sclerosis, patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, pediatric control and adult healthy donors. Proteins indicative of systemic classical and alternative complement activation were substantially increased in patients with MOGAD compared to control groups. Elevated levels were detected in both adult and pediatric cases and in across all clinical syndromes. Complement inhibition should be explored for its therapeutic merit in patients with MOGAD.</p>

                The B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant challenges efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Arora et al. provide evidence that B.1.617.2 may enter human lung cells and fuse neighboring cells more efficiently than the initially circulating virus. Further, the study suggests that B.1.617.2 may evade neutralization by antibodies elicited upon infection and vaccination.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Linking spatial self-organization to community assembly and biodiversity</a></h4>

              
                Temporal shifts to drier climates impose environmental stresses on plant communities that may result in community reassembly and threatened ecosystem services, but also may trigger self-organization in spatial patterns of biota and resources, which act to relax these stresses. The complex relationships between these counteracting processes - community reassembly and spatial self-organization - have hardly been studied. Using a spatio-temporal model of dryland plant communities and a trait-based approach, we study the response of such communities to increasing water-deficit stress. We first show that spatial patterning acts to reverse shifts from fast-growing species to stress-tolerant species, as well as to reverse functional-diversity loss. We then show that spatial self-organization buffers the impact of further stress on community structure. Finally, we identify multistability ranges of uniform and patterned community states and use them to propose forms of non-uniform ecosystem management that integrate the need for provisioning ecosystem services with the need to preserve community structure.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A state space modeling approach to real-time phase estimation</a></h4>

              
                Brain rhythms have been proposed to facilitate brain function, with an especially important role attributed to the phase of low frequency rhythms. Understanding the role of phase in neural function requires interventions that perturb neural activity at a target phase, necessitating estimation of phase in real-time. Current methods for real-time phase estimation rely on bandpass filtering, which assumes narrowband signals and couples the signal and noise in the phase estimate, adding noise to the phase and impairing detections of relationships between phase and behavior. To address this, we propose a state space phase estimator for real-time tracking of phase. By tracking the analytic signal as a latent state, this framework avoids the requirement of bandpass filtering, separately models the signal and the noise, accounts for rhythmic confounds, and provides credible intervals for the phase estimate. We demonstrate in simulations that the state space phase estimator outperforms current state-of-the-art real-time methods in the contexts of common confounds such as broadband rhythms, phase resets and co-occurring rhythms. Finally, we show applications of this approach to in vivo data. The method is available as a ready-to-use plug-in for the OpenEphys acquisition system, making it widely available for use in experiments.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">TRPM7 is critical for short-term synaptic depression by regulating synaptic vesicle endocytosis</a></h4>

              
                TRPM7 contributes to a variety of physiological and pathological processes in many tissues and cells. With a widespread distribution in the nervous system, TRPM7 is involved in animal behaviors and neuronal death induced by ischemia. However, the physiological role of TRPM7 in CNS neuron remains unclear. Here, we identify endocytic defects in neuroendocrine cells and neurons from TRPM7 knockout (KO) mice, indicating a role of TRPM7 in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Our experiments further pinpoint the importance of TRPM7 as an ion channel in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging detects a defect in presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in TRPM7 KO neuron, suggesting an importance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via TRPM7 in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Moreover, the short-term depression is enhanced in both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission from TRPM7 KO mice. Taken together, our data suggests that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via TRPM7 may be critical for short-term plasticity of synaptic strength by regulating synaptic vesicle endocytosis in neurons.

                CNS neurons have no sensory function, protected by the skull. For this reason, brain neuromodulation by ultrasound were either done at a high intensity or through auditory nerves. We demonstrate in this study CNS neurons react to ultrasound stimulation at an intensity (5 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) far lower than typical therapeutic ultrasound (&gt;30 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>). Using micropipette ultrasound in calcium imaging, we show ASIC1a channels play a role in the reactions of CNS neurons to ultrasound, pointing to the molecular basis for direct ultrasound neuromodulation at low intensity. Furthermore, we also show evidence of neurogenesis with the same ultrasound stimulation, suggesting potential therapeutic translation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Human embryo polarization requires PLC signaling to mediate trophectoderm specification</a></h4>

              
                Apico-basal polarization of cells within the embryo is critical for the segregation of distinct lineages during mammalian development. Polarized cells become the trophectoderm (TE), which forms the placenta, and apolar cells become the inner cell mass (ICM), the founding population of the fetus. The cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to polarization of the human embryo and its timing during embryogenesis have remained unknown. Here, we show that human embryo polarization occurs in two steps: it begins with the apical enrichment of F-actin and is followed by the apical accumulation of the PAR complex. This two-step polarization process leads to the formation of an apical domain at the 8-16 cell stage. Using RNA interference, we show that apical domain formation requires Phospholipase C (PLC) signaling, specifically the enzymes PLCB1 and PLCE1, from the 8-cell stage onwards. Finally, we show that although expression of the critical TE differentiation marker GATA3 can be initiated independently of embryo polarization, downregulation of PLCB1 and PLCE1 decreases GATA3 expression through a reduction in the number of polarized cells. Therefore, apical domain formation reinforces a TE fate. The results we present here demonstrate how polarization is triggered to regulate the first lineage segregation in human embryos.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hippocampal replay of experience at real-world speeds</a></h4>

              
                Representations related to past experiences play a critical role in memory and decision-making processes. The rat hippocampus expresses these types of representations during sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events, and previous work identified a minority of SWRs that contain ‘replay’ of spatial trajectories at ∼20x the movement speed of the animal. Efforts to understand replay typically make multiple assumptions about which events to examine and what sorts of representations constitute replay. We therefore lack a clear understanding of both the prevalence and the range of representational dynamics associated with replay. Here, we develop a state space model that uses a combination of movement dynamics of different speeds to capture the spatial content and time evolution of replay during SWRs. Using this model, we find that the large majority of replay events contain spatially coherent, interpretable content. Furthermore, many events progress at real-world, rather than accelerated, movement speeds, consistent with actual experiences.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Convergent and divergent brain structural and functional abnormalities associated with developmental dyslexia</a></h4>

              
                Brain abnormalities in the reading network have been repeatedly reported in individuals with developmental dyslexia (DD); however, it is still not totally understood where the structural and functional abnormalities are consistent/inconsistent across languages. In the current multimodal meta-analysis, we found convergent structural and functional alterations in the left superior temporal gyrus across languages, suggesting a neural signature of DD. We found greater reduction in grey matter volume and brain activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus in morpho-syllabic languages (e.g. Chinese) than in alphabetic languages, and greater reduction in brain activation in the left middle temporal gyrus and fusiform gyrus in alphabetic languages than in morpho-syllabic languages. These language differences are explained as consequences of being DD while learning a specific language. In addition, we also found brain regions that showed increased grey matter volume and brain activation, presumably suggesting compensations and brain regions that showed inconsistent alterations in brain structure and function. Our study provides important insights about the etiology of DD from a cross-linguistic perspective with considerations of consistency/inconsistency between structural and functional alterations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single-molecule imaging reveals the concerted release of myosin from regulated thin filaments</a></h4>

              
                Regulated thin filaments (RTFs) tightly control striated muscle contraction through calcium binding to troponin, which enables tropomyosin to expose myosin-binding sites on actin. Myosin binding holds tropomyosin in an open position, exposing more myosin-binding sites on actin, leading to cooperative activation. At lower calcium levels, troponin and tropomyosin turn off the thin filament; however, this is antagonised by the high local concentration of myosin, questioning how the thin filament relaxes. To provide molecular details of deactivation, we used single-molecule imaging of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged myosin-S1 (S1-GFP) to follow the activation of RTF tightropes. In sub-maximal activation conditions, RTFs are not fully active, enabling direct observation of deactivation in real time. We observed that myosin binding occurs in a stochastic step-wise fashion; however, an unexpectedly large probability of multiple contemporaneous detachments is observed. This suggests that deactivation of the thin filament is a coordinated active process.
