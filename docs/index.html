                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults is understudied, especially regarding neural mechanisms such as oscillatory control of attention sampling. We report an electroencephalography (EEG) study of such cortical mechanisms, in ADHD-diagnosed adults during administration of Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA), a gold-standard continuous performance test for ADHD that measures the ability to sustain attention and inhibit impulsivity. We recorded 53 adults (28 female, 25 male, aged 18&ndash;60), and 18 matched healthy controls, using 128-channel EEG. We analyzed sensor-space features established as neural correlates of attention: timing-sensitivity and phase-synchrony of response activations, and event-related (de)synchronization (ERS/D) of &alpha; and  frequency band activity; in frontal and parietal scalp regions. TOVA test performance significantly distinguished ADHD adults from neurotypical controls, in commission errors, response time variability (RTV) and d' (response sensitivity). The ADHD group showed significantly weaker target-locked and response-locked amplitudes, that were strongly right-lateralized at the N2 wave, and weaker phase synchrony (longer reset poststimulus). They also manifested significantly less parietal prestimulus 8-Hz  ERS, less frontal and parietal poststimulus 4-Hz  ERS, and more frontal and parietal prestimulus &alpha; ERS during correct trials. These differences may reflect excessive modulation of endogenous activity by strong entrainment to stimulus (&alpha;), combined with deficient modulation by neural entrainment to task (), which in TOVA involves monitoring stimulus spatial location (not predicted occurrence onset which is regular and task-irrelevant). Building on the hypotheses of  coding for relational structure and rhythmic attention sampling, our results suggest that ADHD adults have impaired attention sampling in relational categorization tasks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Sex Differences in BNST and Amygdala Activation by Contextual, Cued, and Unpredictable Threats</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Fear and anxiety can be described as emotional and physical responses to predictable and unpredictable threats. While the amygdala is necessary for context and cued fear conditioning, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is important for anxiety-like behavior and conditioned responses to diffuse and/or unpredictable threats. However, we still lack knowledge about how the BNST and amygdala nuclei act in coordination. Moreover, the incidence of anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is substantially higher in women than in men, but most studies of fear conditioning are conducted in male rodents. Here, we asked whether the BNST and the lateral, basal, and central nuclei of the amygdala are active during the expression of fear conditioning in male and female rats using FOS immunohistochemistry. We first show that the BNST is indeed involved in context fear expression in males, but not in females. The lateral amygdala was active in both sexes during context fear expression. We next trained animals using tone cues paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US), or tone cues which were unpaired with the US, and thus nonpredictive. Females displayed greater fear expression to these unpaired tones than males. FOS was upregulated in both the BNST and the basal amygdala during fear expression to unpaired tones in both sexes. The differential processing of fear responses by males and females highlights the need to acknowledge sex differences in conditioned fear memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Knowledge, attitudes and perceptions about HIV self-testing amongst college students in Namibia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In 2019, the Namibian Ministry of Health introduced HIV self-testing (HIVST) as an additional strategy to increase uptake of HIV self-testing in traditionally hard-to-reach subpopulations, such as young adults and males. It is unclear how the utilisation of HIV self-testing iw optimised in young adults. The study objective is understanding knowledge, attitudes, and perception levels amongst college-going young adults in Namibia. Methods: This quantitative study utilised a sample of 97 young college students who received a pre-test structured questionnaire. One sample t-test was used to analyse the average score from the Likert scale. A cut-off p-value of 0.05 to determine statistical significance of variables was used. Logistic regression computation was used to identify independent variables significantly associated with the dependent variable. A univariate analysis was done on awareness and acceptability with statistical significance of p<0.05 to obtain preliminary insights into the association between independent and dependent variables. The net effect variables are assessed using multivariate analysis using STATA 13.1, taking into account confounding factors. Results: Out of the 97 participants, only 23.7% knew about HIV self-testing. The logistic regression had a significant association with awareness of HIV self-testing (p≤0.05): on condom use during a first sexual encounter; being with a single sexual partner in the last 12 months; not having a sexually transmitted infection. The univariate analysis revealed an association with the acceptability of HIV self-testing from females; those who live in urban settlements; having not had sexually transmitted infection in the last twelve months. Moreover, findings reveal there are low levels of awareness, yet participants had positive attitudes and levels of acceptability to HIV self-testing. Conclusion: This study shows promise if awareness through health education and promotion about HIV self-testing can be increased. This can form part of scaling up HIV testing in Namibia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Assessment of risk perception and risk communication regarding COVID-19 among healthcare providers: An explanatory sequential mixed-method study in Bangladesh [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Any public health emergency demands adequate risk communication with the vulnerable population along with their optimized perception about the impending risk to ensure proper risk management and crisis control. Hence, we conducted this study to explore healthcare providers’ perceptions regarding risks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as how they are being communicated to about the risk, and how they practice risk reduction measures. Methods: We conducted a two-phased explanatory sequential mixed-method study among physicians and nurses from randomly selected tertiary healthcare facilities in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. In the first phase, we assessed the general pattern and quantifiable measures of risk perception, risk communication, and infection prevention practices quantitatively. We performed multiple linear regression analyses to explore how much variability of risk perception was predicted by risk communication methods and contents. In the second phase, we collected qualitative data for in-depth understanding and exploration of participants’ experiences and insights regarding COVID-19 risk through interviews and document reviews. We manually performed thematic content analysis of the qualitative data. Finally, we triangulated findings from both phases to illustrate the research objectives. Discussion: Based on the psychometric dimensions of risk perception and psycho-social theory of the health belief model, perceptions of COVID-19 risk among healthcare providers were evaluated in this study. The relationship between risk perception and infection prevention and control practices among healthcare providers were also investigated. The explanatory sequential design of this study is expected to generate hypotheses on how risk perception is being shaped in a time of uncertainty and, thus, will help to build a proper risk communication strategy for the healthcare providers

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The characteristics of early-stage research into human genes are substantially different from subsequent research</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thomas Stoeger, Luís A. Nunes Amaral</p>

Throughout the last 2 decades, several scholars observed that present day research into human genes rarely turns toward genes that had not already been extensively investigated in the past. Guided by hypotheses derived from studies of science and innovation, we present here a literature-wide data-driven meta-analysis to identify the specific scientific and organizational contexts that coincided with early-stage research into human genes throughout the past half century. We demonstrate that early-stage research into human genes differs in team size, citation impact, funding mechanisms, and publication outlet, but that generalized insights derived from studies of science and innovation only partially apply to early-stage research into human genes. Further, we demonstrate that, presently, genome biology accounts for most of the initial early-stage research, while subsequent early-stage research can engage other life sciences fields. We therefore anticipate that the specificity of our findings will enable scientists and policymakers to better promote early-stage research into human genes and increase overall innovation within the life sciences.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Fos regulates macrophage infiltration against surrounding tissue resistance by a cortical actin-based mechanism in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vera Belyaeva, Stephanie Wachner, Attila Gyoergy, Shamsi Emtenani, Igor Gridchyn, Maria Akhmanova, Markus Linder, Marko Roblek, Maria Sibilia, Daria Siekhaus</p>

The infiltration of immune cells into tissues underlies the establishment of tissue-resident macrophages and responses to infections and tumors. Yet the mechanisms immune cells utilize to negotiate tissue barriers in living organisms are not well understood, and a role for cortical actin has not been examined. Here, we find that the tissue invasion of <i>Drosophila</i> macrophages, also known as plasmatocytes or hemocytes, utilizes enhanced cortical F-actin levels stimulated by the <i>Drosophila</i> member of the fos proto oncogene transcription factor family (Dfos, Kayak). RNA sequencing analysis and live imaging show that Dfos enhances F-actin levels around the entire macrophage surface by increasing mRNA levels of the membrane spanning molecular scaffold tetraspanin TM4SF, and the actin cross-linking filamin Cheerio, which are themselves required for invasion. Both the filamin and the tetraspanin enhance the cortical activity of Rho1 and the formin Diaphanous and thus the assembly of cortical actin, which is a critical function since expressing a dominant active form of Diaphanous can rescue the <i>Dfos</i> macrophage invasion defect. In vivo imaging shows that Dfos enhances the efficiency of the initial phases of macrophage tissue entry. Genetic evidence argues that this Dfos-induced program in macrophages counteracts the constraint produced by the tension of surrounding tissues and buffers the properties of the macrophage nucleus from affecting tissue entry. We thus identify strengthening the cortical actin cytoskeleton through Dfos as a key process allowing efficient forward movement of an immune cell into surrounding tissues.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comorbidities and laboratory parameters associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection severity in patients from the southeast of Mexico: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Among the risk factors associated with the severity of this disease is the presence of several metabolic disorders. For this reason, the aim of this research was to identify the comorbidities and laboratory parameters among COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), comparing the patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) with those who did not require IMV, in order to determine the clinical characteristics associated with the COVID-19 severity. Methods. We carried out a cross-sectional study among 152 patients who were admitted to the ICU from April 1st to July 31st, 2021, in whom the comorbidities and laboratory parameters associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection severity were identified. The data of these patients was grouped into two main groups: “patients who required IMV” and “patients who did not require IMV”. The nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test for continuous data and the χ2 test for categorical data were used to compare the variables between both groups. Results. Of the 152 COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the ICU, 66 required IMV and 86 did not require IMV. Regarding the comorbidities found in these patients, a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension and obesity was observed among patients who required IMV vs. those who did not require IMV (p<0.05). Concerning laboratory parameters, only glucose, Interleukin 6 (IL-6), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly higher among patients who required IMV than in those who did not require IMV (p<0.05). Conclusion. This study performed in a Mexican population indicates that comorbidities such as: T2DM, hypertension and obesity, as well as elevated levels of glucose, IL-6, LDH and CRP are associated with the COVID-19 severity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Male genital injuries treated at a tertiary hospital in the western region of Nepal: A two-year snapshot. [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Male genital injuries are urological emergencies which if not promptly treated with correct therapeutic intervention may lead to loss of fertility due to infections and anatomical disruption of normalcy. This study highlights the clinical scenarios, etiology and outcome of male genital injury cases that were managed at a tertiary care center in Nepal. Such injuries are not frequently encountered as patients are hesitant to report such injuries. The present study is the first from Nepal which depicts a comprehensive report on male genital injuries.   Methods: A retrospective analysis of discharge summaries of the cases of male genital injuries was reviewed during June 2020. All the treated cases during the two-year period from April 2018 to April 2020 at Lumbini Medical College, Nepal were included in the study.  Results: There were eight cases of genital trauma admitted and treated during the study period. All the patients were males and age ranged from six to 71 years with a mean age of 33 ± 21.45 years. Fall injury and road traffic accidents (RTA) were observed to be the primary cause in the majority of cases.  Conclusion: Superficial injuries to the penis and scrotum do not require surgical exploration and could be managed conservatively. However, deeper and complicated injuries, testicular preservation, the functionality of the part and cosmetic issues are taken into consideration which might require a multi-disciplinary approach. Apart from the medical issues pertaining to genital injuries, there are legal and psychological aspects of such events too which should not be ignored.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prediction of the Effects of Nonsynonymous Variants on SARS-CoV-2 Proteins [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: SARS-CoV-2 virus is a highly transmissible pathogen that causes COVID-19. The outbreak originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019. A number of nonsynonymous mutations located at different SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been reported by multiple studies. However, there are limited computational studies on the biological impacts of these mutations on the structure and function of the proteins.   Methods: In our study nonsynonymous mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and their frequencies were identified from 30,229 sequences. Subsequently, the effects of the top 10 nonsynonymous mutations of different SARS-CoV-2 proteins were analyzed using bioinformatics tools including co-mutation analysis, prediction of the protein structure stability and flexibility analysis, and prediction of the protein functions.   Results: A total of 231 nonsynonymous mutations were identified from 30,229 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. The top 10 nonsynonymous mutations affecting nine amino acid residues were ORF1a nsp5 P108S, ORF1b nsp12 P323L and A423V, S protein N501Y and D614G, ORF3a Q57H, N protein P151L, R203K and G204R. Many nonsynonymous mutations showed a high concurrence ratio, suggesting these mutations may evolve together and interact functionally. Our result showed that ORF1a nsp5 P108S, ORF3a Q57H and N protein P151L mutations may be deleterious to the function of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. In addition, ORF1a nsp5 P108S and S protein D614G may destabilize the protein structures while S protein D614G may have a more open conformation compared to the wild type.   Conclusion: The biological consequences of these nonsynonymous mutations of SARS-CoV-2 proteins should be further validated by in vivo and in vitro experimental studies in the future.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Soluble TAM receptors sAXL and sTyro3 predict structural and functional protection in Alzheimer’s disease</a></h4>

              
                In the DELCODE and F.ACE cohorts, Brosseron, Maass, Kleineidam, et al. find that inflammatory CSF biomarkers rise in pre-dementia stages alongside tau and neurodegeneration markers. Within this pattern, soluble TAM receptors sTyro3 and sAXL positively relate to MRI structure and cognition, potentially as proxies of immune regulatory protective mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Synaptic mechanisms of top-down control in the non-lemniscal inferior colliculus</a></h4>

              
                Corticofugal projections to evolutionarily ancient, subcortical structures are ubiquitous across mammalian sensory systems. These ‘descending’ pathways enable the neocortex to control ascending sensory representations in a predictive or feedback manner, but the underlying cellular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we combine optogenetic approaches with in vivo and in vitro patch-clamp electrophysiology to study the projection from mouse auditory cortex to the inferior colliculus (IC), a major descending auditory pathway that controls IC neuron feature selectivity, plasticity, and auditory perceptual learning. Although individual auditory cortico-collicular synapses were generally weak, IC neurons often integrated inputs from multiple corticofugal axons that generated reliable, tonic depolarizations even during prolonged presynaptic activity. Latency measurements in vivo showed that descending signals reach the IC within 30 ms of sound onset, which in IC neurons corresponded to the peak of synaptic depolarizations evoked by short sounds. Activating ascending and descending pathways at latencies expected in vivo caused a NMDA receptor-dependent, supralinear excitatory postsynaptic potential summation, indicating that descending signals can nonlinearly amplify IC neurons’ moment-to-moment acoustic responses. Our results shed light upon the synaptic bases of descending sensory control and imply that heterosynaptic cooperativity contributes to the auditory cortico-collicular pathway’s role in plasticity and perceptual learning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Unique structure and positive selection promote the rapid divergence of Drosophila Y chromosomes</a></h4>

              
                Y chromosomes across diverse species convergently evolve a gene-poor, heterochromatic organization enriched for duplicated genes, LTR retrotransposons, and satellite DNA. Sexual antagonism and a loss of recombination play major roles in the degeneration of young Y chromosomes. However, the processes shaping the evolution of mature, already degenerated Y chromosomes are less well-understood. Because Y chromosomes evolve rapidly, comparisons between closely related species are particularly useful. We generated de novo long read assemblies complemented with cytological validation to reveal Y chromosome organization in three closely related species of the <i>Drosophila simulans </i>complex, which diverged only 250,000 years ago and share &gt;98% sequence identity. We find these Y chromosomes are divergent in their organization and repetitive DNA composition and discover new Y-linked gene families whose evolution is driven by both positive selection and gene conversion. These Y chromosomes are also enriched for large deletions, suggesting that the repair of double-strand breaks on Y chromosomes may be biased toward microhomology-mediated end joining over canonical non-homologous end-joining. We propose that this repair mechanism contributes to the convergent evolution of Y chromosome organization across organisms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Regulation of immune receptor kinase plasma membrane nanoscale organization by a plant peptide hormone and its receptors</a></h4>

              
                Spatial partitioning is a propensity of biological systems orchestrating cell activities in space and time. The dynamic regulation of plasma membrane nano-environments has recently emerged as a key fundamental aspect of plant signaling, but the molecular components governing it are still mostly unclear. The receptor kinase FERONIA (FER) controls ligand-induced complex formation of the immune receptor kinase FLAGELLIN SENSING 2 (FLS2) with its co-receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1-ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 (BAK1), and perception of the endogenous peptide hormone RAPID ALKALANIZATION FACTOR 23 (RALF23) by FER inhibits immunity. Here, we show that FER regulates the plasma membrane nanoscale organization of FLS2 and BAK1. Our study demonstrates that akin to FER, leucine-rich repeat (LRR) extensin proteins (LRXs) contribute to RALF23 responsiveness, regulate BAK1 nanoscale organization and immune signaling. Furthermore, RALF23 perception leads to rapid modulation of FLS2 and BAK1 nanoscale organization, and its inhibitory activity on immune signaling relies on FER kinase activity. Our results suggest that perception of RALF peptides by FER and LRXs actively modulates plasma membrane nanoscale organization to regulate cell surface signaling by other ligand-binding receptor kinases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Plant trans-golgi network/early endosome pH regulation requires cation chloride cotransporter (CCC1)</a></h4>

              
                Plant cells maintain a low luminal pH in the Trans-Golgi-Network/Early Endosome (TGN/EE), the organelle in which the secretory and endocytic pathways intersect. Impaired TGN/EE pH regulation translates into severe plant growth defects. The identity of the proton pump and proton/ion antiporters that regulate TGN/EE pH have been determined, but an essential component required to complete the TGN/EE membrane transport circuit remains unidentified - a pathway for cation and anion efflux. Here, we have used complementation, genetically encoded fluorescent sensors, and pharmacological treatments to demonstrate that Arabidopsis Cation Chloride Cotransporter (CCC1) is this missing component necessary for regulating TGN/EE pH and function. Loss of CCC1 function leads to alterations in TGN/EE-mediated processes including endocytic trafficking, exocytosis and response to abiotic stress, consistent with the multitude of phenotypic defects observed in <i>ccc1</i> knockout plants. This discovery places CCC1 as a central component of plant cellular function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tracking cell lineages in 3D by incremental deep learning</a></h4>

              
                Deep learning is emerging as a powerful approach for bioimage analysis. Its use in cell tracking is limited by the scarcity of annotated data for the training of deep-learning models. Moreover, annotation, training, prediction, and proofreading currently lack a unified user interface. We present ELEPHANT, an interactive platform for 3D cell tracking that addresses these challenges by taking an incremental approach to deep learning. ELEPHANT provides an interface that seamlessly integrates cell track annotation, deep learning, prediction, and proofreading. This enables users to implement cycles of incremental learning starting from a few annotated nuclei. Successive prediction-validation cycles enrich the training data, leading to rapid improvements in tracking performance. We test the software’s performance against state-of-the-art methods and track lineages spanning the entire course of leg regeneration in a crustacean over 1 week (504 timepoints). ELEPHANT yields accurate, fully-validated cell lineages with a modest investment in time and effort.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Increasing stimulus similarity drives nonmonotonic representational change in hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Studies of hippocampal learning have obtained seemingly contradictory results, with manipulations that increase coactivation of memories sometimes leading to differentiation of these memories, but sometimes not. These results could potentially be reconciled using the nonmonotonic plasticity hypothesis, which posits that representational change (memories moving apart or together) is a U-shaped function of the coactivation of these memories during learning. Testing this hypothesis requires manipulating coactivation over a wide enough range to reveal the full U-shape. To accomplish this, we used a novel neural network image synthesis procedure to create pairs of stimuli that varied parametrically in their similarity in high-level visual regions that provide input to the hippocampus. Sequences of these pairs were shown to human participants during high-resolution fMRI. As predicted, learning changed the representations of paired images in the dentate gyrus as a U-shaped function of image similarity, with neural differentiation occurring only for moderately similar images.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Human monoclonal antibodies against Staphylococcus aureus surface antigens recognize in vitro and in vivo biofilm</a></h4>

              
                Implant-associated <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> infections are difficult to treat because of biofilm formation. Bacteria in a biofilm are often insensitive to antibiotics and host immunity. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) could provide an alternative approach to improve the diagnosis and potential treatment of biofilm-related infections. Here, we show that mAbs targeting common surface components of <i>S. aureus</i> can recognize clinically relevant biofilm types. The mAbs were also shown to bind a collection of clinical isolates derived from different biofilm-associated infections (endocarditis, prosthetic joint, catheter). We identify two groups of antibodies: one group that uniquely binds <i>S. aureus</i> in biofilm state and one that recognizes <i>S. aureus</i> in both biofilm and planktonic state. Furthermore, we show that a mAb recognizing wall teichoic acid (clone 4497) specifically localizes to a subcutaneously implanted pre-colonized catheter in mice. In conclusion, we demonstrate the capacity of several human mAbs to detect <i>S. aureus</i> biofilms in vitro and in vivo.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Concurrent fMRI demonstrates propagation of TMS effects across task-related networks</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has become an important technique in both scientific and clinical practices, and yet our understanding of how the brain responds to TMS is still limited. Concurrent neuroimaging during TMS may bridge this gap, and emerging evidence suggests widespread that modulatory effects of TMS may be best captured through changes in functional connectivity between distributed networks, rather than local changes in cortical activity. However, the relationship between TMS stimulation parameters and evoked changes in functional connectivity is unknown. In this study, 24 healthy volunteers received concurrent TMS-fMRI while performing a dot-motion direction discrimination task. An MR-compatible coil was used to apply trains of three pulses at 10 Hz rTMS over the primary visual cortex (V1) at the onset of the dot stimuli with four levels of stimulation intensity (20%, 40%, 80%, and 120% of resting motor threshold, RMT). Behavioral results demonstrated impairment of motion discrimination at 80% RMT. FMRI results yielded three findings. First, functional connectivity between visual and non-visual areas increased as a function of rTMS intensity. Second, connectivity within the visual network was positively associated with motion accuracy, while the connectivity between visual and non-visual regions was negatively associated with motion accuracy. Lastly, we found that reductions in the similarity between functional and structural connectivity associated with increasing TMS intensity were constrained to the visual network. These findings demonstrate spatially dependent nonlinear effects of TMS intensity on brain functional connectivity that proceed beyond the site of stimulation and influence associated behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Exploring Functional Brain Network Modularity in Educational Contexts</a></h4>

              
                The brain's modular functional organization facilitates adaptability. Modularity has been linked with a wide range of cognitive abilities such as intelligence, memory, and learning. However, much of this work has (1) considered modularity while a participant is at rest rather than during tasks conditions and/or (2) relied primarily on lab-based cognitive assessments. Thus, the extent to which modularity can provide information about real-word behavior remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated whether functional modularity during resting-state and task-based fMRI was associated with academic learning (measured by GPA) and ability (measured by PSAT) in a large sample of high school students. Additional questions concerned the extent to which modularity differs between rest and task conditions, and across spatial scales. Results indicated that whole-brain modularity during task conditions was significantly associated with academic learning. In contrast to prior work, no such associations were observed for resting-state modularity. We further showed that differences in modularity between task conditions and resting-state varied across spatial scales. Taken together, the present findings inform how functional brain network modularity - during task conditions and while at rest - relate to a range of cognitive abilities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ramp-shaped neural tuning supports graded population-level representation of the object-to-scene continuum</a></h4>

              
                We can easily perceive the spatial scale depicted in a picture, regardless of whether it is a small space (e.g., a close-up view of a chair) or a much larger space (e.g., an entire class room). How does the human visual system encode this continuous dimension? Here, we investigated the underlying neural coding of depicted spatial scale, by examining the voxel tuning and topographic organization of brain responses. We created naturalistic yet carefully-controlled stimuli by constructing virtual indoor environments, and rendered a series of snapshots to smoothly sample between a close-up view of the central object and far-scale view of the full environment (object-to-scene continuum). Human brain responses were measured to each position using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We did not find evidence for a smooth topographic mapping for the object-to-scene continuum on the cortex. Instead, we observed large swaths of cortex with opposing ramp-shaped profiles, with highest responses to one end of the object-to-scene continuum or the other, and a small region showing a weak tuning to intermediate scale views. Importantly, when we considered the multi-voxel patterns of the entire ventral occipito-temporal cortex, we found smooth and linear representation of the object-to-scene continuum. Thus, our results together suggest that depicted spatial scale is coded parametrically in large-scale population codes across the entire ventral occipito-temporal cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Examining the Neural Correlates of Error Awareness in a Large fMRI Study</a></h4>

              
                Goal-directed behaviour is dependent upon the ability to detect errors and implement appropriate post-error adjustments. Accordingly, several studies have explored the neural activity underlying error-monitoring processes, identifying the insula cortex as crucial for error awareness and reporting mixed findings with respect to the anterior cingulate cortex. Variable patterns of activation have previously been attributed to insufficient statistical power. We therefore sought to clarify the neural correlates of error awareness in a large event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. Four hundred and two healthy participants undertook the Error Awareness Task, a motor Go/No-Go response inhibition paradigm in which participants were required to indicate their awareness of commission errors. Compared to unaware errors, aware errors were accompanied by significantly greater activity in a network of regions including the insula cortex, supramarginal gyrus, and midline structures such as the anterior cingulate cortex and supplementary motor area. Error awareness activity was related to indices of task performance and dimensional measures of psychopathology in select regions including the insula, supramarginal gyrus and supplementary motor area. Taken together, we identified a robust and reliable neural network associated with error awareness.

                Imaging technologies are increasingly used to generate high-resolution reference maps of brain structure and function. Modern scientific discovery relies on making comparisons between new maps (e.g. task activations, group structural differences) and these reference maps. Although recent data sharing initiatives have increased the accessibility of such brain maps, data are often shared in disparate coordinate systems (or ``spaces''), precluding systematic and accurate comparisons among them. Here we introduce the neuromaps toolbox, an open-access software package for accessing, transforming, and analyzing structural and functional brain annotations. We implement two registration frameworks to generate high-quality transformations between four standard coordinate systems commonly used in neuroimaging research. The initial release of the toolbox features >40 curated reference maps and biological ontologies of the human brain, including maps of gene expression, neurotransmitter receptors, metabolism, neurophysiological oscillations, developmental and evolutionary expansion, functional hierarchy, individual functional variability, and cognitive specialization. Robust quantitative assessment of map-to-map similarity is enabled via a suite of spatial autocorrelation-preserving null models. By combining open-access data with transparent functionality for standardizing and comparing brain maps, the neuromaps software package provides a systematic workflow for comprehensive structural and functional annotation enrichment analysis of the human brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Individual coactivation patterns improve the subject identification and their behavior association</a></h4>

              
                Brain states can be characterized by recurring coactivation patterns (CAPs). Traditional CAP analysis is performed at the group-level, while the human brain is individualized and the functional connectome has shown the uniqueness as fingerprint. Whether stable individual CAPs could be obtained from a single fMRI scan and could individual CAPs improve the identification is unclear. An open dataset, the midnight scan club was used in this study to answer these questions. Four CAP states were identified at three distinct levels (group-, subject- and scan-level) separately, and the CAPs were then reconstructed for each scan. Identification rate and differential identifiability were used to evaluate the identification performance. Our results demonstrated that the individual CAPs were unstable when using a single scan. By maintaining high intra-subject similarity and inter-subject differences, subject-level CAPs achieved the best identification performance. Brain regions that contributed to the identifiability were mainly located in higher-order networks (e.g., frontal-parietal network). Besides, head motion reduced the intra-subject similarity, while its impact on identification rate was non-significant. Finally, a pipeline was developed to depict brain-behavior associations in dataset with few samples but dense sampling, and individualized CAP dynamics showed an above-chance level correlation with IQ.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural correlate of reduced respiratory chemosensitivity during chronic epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                While central autonomic cardiorespiratory dysfunction underlies sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), the specific neural mechanisms that lead to SUDEP remain to be determined. Here we took an advantage of single cell neuronal Ca2+ imaging and intrahippocampal kainic acid (KA)-induced chronic epilepsy in mice to investigate progressive changes in key cardiorespiratory brainstem circuits during chronic epilepsy. Following induction of status epilepticus (SE), we observed that the adaptive ventilatory responses to hypercapnia were reduced in mice with chronic epilepsy for 5 weeks post-SE. These changes were paralleled by reduced chemosensitivity of neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), an important centre for respiratory chemosensitivity. Over the same period, chemosensory responses of the presympathetic RVLM neurons showed a slower decrease. Mice with chronic epilepsy were more sensitive to chemoconvulsants and exhibited a greatly reduced latency to seizure induction compared to naive mice. This enhanced sensitivity to seizures, which invade the RTN, puts the chemosensory circuits at further risk and increases the chances of terminal apnoea. Our findings establish a dysfunctional breathing phenotype with its RTN neuronal correlate in mice with chronic epilepsy and suggests a functional non-invasive biomarker test, based on respiratory chemosensitivity, to identify people with epilepsy at risk of SUDEP.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Concomitant AD and DLB pathologies shape subfield microglia responses in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal alteration is at the centre of memory decline in the most common age-related neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). However, the subregional deterioration of the hippocampus differs between both diseases with more severe atrophy in the CA1 subfield of the AD patients. How AD and DLB-typical pathologies compose the various local microenvironment of the hippocampus across AD and DLB needs to be further explored to understand this process. Additionally, microglia responses could further impact the atrophy rate. Some studies suggest that microglia react differently according to the underlying neurodegenerative disorder. How microglia are transformed across hippocampal subfields in AD and DLB, and how their changes are associated with disease-typical pathologies remains to be determined. To these purposes, we performed a volumetric analysis of phospho-Tau (P-Tau), Amyloid-beta (Abeta), and phospho-alpha-Synuclein (P-Syn) loads, quantified and classified microglia according to distinct morphological phenotypes using high-resolution confocal 3D microscopy of hippocampal CA1, CA3 and DG/CA4 subfields of late-onset AD (n=10) and DLB (n=8) as well as age-matched control samples (n=11). We found that each of the Tau, Abeta and Synuclein pathologies followed a specific subregional distribution, relatively preserved across AD and DLB. P-Tau, Abeta and P-Syn burdens were significantly exacerbated in AD, with Tau pathology being particularly severe in the AD CA1. P-Tau and P-Syn burdens were highly correlated across subfields and conditions (R2Spear = 0.79; P < 0.001) and result from a local co-distribution of P-Tau and P-Syn inclusions in neighbouring neurons, with only a low proportion of double-positive cells. In parallel, we assessed the changes of the microglia responses by measuring 16 morphological features of more than 35,000 individual microglial cells and classifying them into seven-distinct morphological clusters. We found microglia features- and clusters-variations subfield- and condition-dependent. Two of the seven morphological clusters, with more amoeboid and less branched forms, were identified as disease-enriched and found to be further increased in AD. Interestingly, some microglial features or clusters were associated with one but more often with a combination of two pathologies in a subfield-dependent manner. In conclusion, our study shows a multimodal association of the hippocampal microglia responses with the co-occurrence, distribution and severity of AD and DLB pathologies. In DLB hippocampi, pathological imprint and microglia responses follow AD trends but with lesser severity. Our study suggests that the increased pathological burdens of P-Tau and P-Syn and associated microglia alterations are involved in a more severe deterioration of the CA1 in AD as compared to DLB.

                A rich repertoire of oscillatory signals is detected from human brains with electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG). However, the principles underwriting coherent oscillations and their link with neural activity remain unclear. Here, we hypothesise that the emergence of transient brain rhythms is a signature of weakly stable synchronization between spatially distributed brain areas, occurring at network-specific collective frequencies due to non-negligible conduction times. We test this hypothesis using a phenomenological network model to simulate interactions between neural mass potentials (resonating at 40Hz) in the structural connectome. Crucially, we identify a critical regime where metastable oscillatory modes emerge spontaneously in the delta (0.5-4Hz), theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8-13Hz) and beta (13-30Hz) frequency bands from weak synchronization of subsystems, closely approximating the MEG power spectra from 89 healthy individuals. Grounded in the physics of delay-coupled oscillators, these numerical analyses demonstrate the role of the spatiotemporal connectome in structuring brain activity in the frequency domain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An emergent temporal basis set robustly supports cerebellar time-series learning</a></h4>

              
                Learning plays a key role in the function of many neural circuits. The cerebellum is considered a learning machine essential for time interval estimation underlying motor coordination and other behaviors. Theoretical work has proposed that the cerebellar input recipient structure, the granule cell layer (GCL), performs pattern separation of inputs that facilitates learning in Purkinje cells (P-cells). However, the relationship between input reformatting and learning outcomes has remained debated, with roles emphasized for pattern separation features from sparsification to decorrelation. We took a novel approach by training a minimalist model of the cerebellar cortex to learn complex time-series data from naturalistic inputs, in contrast to traditional classification tasks. The model robustly produced temporal basis sets from naturalistic inputs, and the resultant GCL output supported learning of temporally complex target functions. Learning favored surprisingly dense granule cell activity, yet the key statistical features in GCL population activity that drove learning differed from those seen previously for classification tasks. Moreover, different cerebellar tasks were supported by diverse pattern separation features that matched the demands of the tasks. These findings advance testable hypotheses for mechanisms of temporal basis set formation and predict that population statistics of granule cell activity may differ across cerebellar regions to support distinct behaviors.

                The majority of fMRI studies investigating somatotopic body representations in the human cortex have used either block or phase-encoding stimulation designs. Event-related (ER) designs allow for more natural and flexible stimulation sequences, while enabling the independent estimation of responses to different body parts in the same cortical location. Here we compared an efficiency-optimized fast ER design (2s inter stimulus interval, ISI) to a slow ER design (8s ISI) for mapping fingertip voxelwise tuning properties in the sensorimotor cortex of 6 participants at 7 Tesla. The fast ER design resulted in similar, but more robust, estimates compared to the slow ER design. Concatenating the fast and slow ER data, we demonstrate in each individual brain the existence of two separate somatotopically-organized representations of the fingertips, one in S1 on the post-central gyrus and the other at the border of the motor and pre-motor cortices on the pre-central gyrus. In both post-central and pre-central representations, fingertip tuning width increases progressively, from narrowly-tuned Brodmann areas 3b and 4a respectively, towards parietal and frontal regions responding equally to all fingertips.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Random Compressed Coding with Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Classical models of efficient coding in neurons assume simple mean responses--'tuning curves'--such as bell shaped or monotonic functions of a stimulus feature. Real neurons, however, can be more complex: grid cells, for example, exhibit periodic responses which impart the neural population code with high accuracy. But do highly accurate codes require fine tuning of the response properties? We address this question with the use of a benchmark model: a neural network with random synaptic weights which result in output cells with irregular tuning curves. Irregularity enhances the local resolution of the code but gives rise to catastrophic, global errors. For optimal smoothness of the tuning curves, when local and global errors balance out, the neural network compresses information from a high-dimensional representation to a low-dimensional one, and the resulting distributed code achieves exponential accuracy. An analysis of recordings from monkey motor cortex points to such 'compressed efficient coding'. Efficient codes do not require a finely tuned design--they emerge robustly from irregularity or randomness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Resolution and b value dependent Structural Connectome in ex vivo Mouse Brain</a></h4>

              
                Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging has been widely used in both clinical and preclinical studies to characterize tissue microstructure and structural connectivity. The diffusion MRI protocol for the Human Connectome Project (HCP) has been developed and optimized to obtain high-quality, high-resolution diffusion MRI (dMRI) datasets. However, such efforts have not been fully explored in preclinical studies, especially for rodents. In this study, high quality dMRI datasets of mouse brains were acquired at 9.4T system from two vendors. In particular, we acquired a high-spatial resolution dMRI dataset (25 um isotropic with 126 diffusion encoding directions), which we believe to be the highest spatial resolution yet obtained; and a high-angular resolution dMRI dataset (50 um isotropic with 384 diffusion encoding directions), which we believe to be the highest angular resolution compared to the dMRI datasets at the microscopic resolution. We systematically investigated the effects of three important parameters that affect the final outcome of the connectome: b value (1000 s/mm2 to 8000 s/mm2), angular resolution (10 to 126), and spatial resolution (25 um to 200 um). The stability of tractography and connectome increase with the angular resolution, where more than 50 angles are necessary to achieve consistent results. The connectome and quantitative parameters derived from graph theory exhibit a linear relationship to the b value (R2 > 0.99); a single-shell acquisition with b value of 3000 s/mm2 shows comparable results to the multi-shell high angular resolution dataset. The dice coefficient decreases and both false positive rate and false negative rate gradually increase with coarser spatial resolution. Our study provides guidelines and foundations for exploration of tradeoffs among acquisition parameters for the structural connectome in ex vivo mouse brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chronic Cognitive and Cerebrovascular Function Following Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in Rats</a></h4>

              
                Severe traumatic brain injury results in cognitive dysfunction in part due to vascular perturbations. In contrast, the long-term vasculo-cognitive pathophysiology of mild TBI (mTBI) remains unknown. We evaluated mTBI effects on chronic cognitive and cerebrovascular function and assessed their interrelationships. Sprague-Dawley rats received midline fluid percussion injury (N=20) or sham (N=21). Cognitive function was assessed (3- and 6-month novel object recognition (NOR), novel object location (NOL) and temporal order object recognition (TOR)). 6-month cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood volume (CBV) using contrast MRI and ex vivo pial artery endothelial and smooth muscle-dependent function were measured. mTBI rats showed impaired NOR, with similar (non-significant) trends in NOL/TOR. Regional CBF and CBV were similar in sham and mTBI. NOR correlated with CBF in lateral hippocampus, medial hippocampus and primary somatosensory barrel cortex while inversely correlating with arterial smooth muscle-dependent dilation. 6-month baseline endothelial and smooth muscle-dependent arterial function were similar among mTBI and sham, but post-angiotensin II stimulation, mTBI showed no change in smooth muscle-dependent dilation from baseline response, unlike the reduction in sham. mTBI led to chronic cognitive dysfunction and altered angiotensin II-stimulated smooth muscle-dependent vasoreactivity, a paradigm that could advance understanding of the long-term sequelae of human mild TBI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">scRNA-sequencing reveals subtype-specific transcriptomic perturbations in DRG neurons of Pirt-EGFPf mice in neuropathic pain condition</a></h4>

              
                Functionally distinct subtypes/clusters of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, which differ in soma size and neurochemical properties, may play different roles in nerve regeneration and pain. However, details about transcriptomic changes in different neuronal subtypes under maladaptive neuropathic pain conditions remain unclear. Chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve represents a well-established model of neuropathic pain that mimics the etiology of clinical conditions. Therefore, we conducted single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize subtype-specific perturbations of transcriptomes in lumbar DRG neurons 7 days after sciatic CCI. By using Pirt-EGFPf mice that selectively express enhanced green fluorescent protein in DRG neurons, we established a highly efficient purification process to enrich neurons for scRNA-seq. We observed a loss of marker genes in injured neurons of 12 standard neuronal clusters, and the emergence of four prominent CCI-induced clusters at this peak-maintenance phase of neuropathic pain. Importantly, a portion of injured neurons from a subset of the 12 standard clusters (NP1, PEP5, NF1, and NF2) were spared from injury-induced identity loss, suggesting subtype-specific transcriptomic changes in injured neurons. Moreover, uninjured neurons, which are necessary for mediating the evoked pain, also demonstrated subtype-specific transcriptomic perturbations in these clusters, but not others. Notably, male and female mice showed differential transcriptomic changes in multiple neuronal clusters after CCI, suggesting transcriptomic sexual dimorphism in primary sensory neurons after nerve injury. Collectively, these findings may contribute to the identification of new target genes and development of DRG neuron subtype-specific therapies for optimizing neuropathic pain treatment and nerve regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel method for multi-scale recording of intracranial EEG through dynamic alteration of electrode surface area</a></h4>

              
                Intracranial EEG (iEEG) plays a critical role in the treatment of neurological diseases, such as epilepsy and Parkinson's disease, as well as the development of neural prostheses and brain computer interfaces. While electrode geometries vary widely across these applications, the impact of electrode size on iEEG features and morphology is not well understood. Some insight has been gained from computer simulation studies and experiments in which signals are recorded using electrodes of different sizes concurrently in different brain regions. Here, we introduce a novel method to record from electrodes of different sizes in the exact same location by changing the size of iEEG electrodes after implantation in the brain. We first present a theoretical model and an in vitro validation of the method. We then report the results of an in vivo implementation in three human subjects with refractory epilepsy. We recorded iEEG data from three different electrode sizes and compared the amplitudes, power spectra, interchannel correlations, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of interictal epileptiform discharges, i.e., epileptic spikes. We found that iEEG amplitude and power decreased as electrode size increased, while inter-channel correlation increased with electrode size. The SNR of epileptic spikes was generally highest in the smallest electrodes, but 39% of spikes had maximal SNR in medium or large electrodes. This likely depends on the precise location and spatial spread of each spike. Overall, this new method enables multi-scale measurements of electrical activity in the human brain that facilitate our understanding of neurophysiology, treatment of neurological disease, and development of novel technologies.

                The fundamental principles driving spontaneous long-range correlations between distant brain areas - known as intrinsic functional connectivity - remain unclear. To investigate this, we develop an ultrafast functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) approach with unprecedented temporal resolution (38 milliseconds) in the rat brain. We detect a repertoire of principal components exhibiting standing wave properties, i.e., with phase relationships varying gradually across space and oscillating in time, driving in- and anti-phase synchronization across distinct cortical and subcortical structures. The spatial configuration, stability and peak frequency of these standing waves is found to depend on the sedation/anaesthesia state, with medetomidine sedation revealing the most stable (i.e., less damped) standing waves, resonating at frequencies extending up to 0.25 Hz. Our findings show that the complex activity patterns observed in resting-state fMRI signals result from the superposition of standing waves, supporting the hypothesis that intrinsic functional connectivity is inherently associated to resonance phenomena.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal apoptosis drives remodeling states of microglia and shifts in survival pathway dependence</a></h4>

              
                Microglia serve critical remodeling roles that shape the developing nervous system, responding to the changing neural environment with phagocytosis or soluble factor secretion. Recent single-cell sequencing (scRNAseq) studies have revealed the context-dependent diversity in microglial properties and gene expression, but the cues promoting this diversity are not well defined. Here, we ask how interactions with apoptotic neurons shape microglial state, including lysosomal and lipid metabolism gene expression and independence from Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) for survival. Using early postnatal mouse retina, a CNS region undergoing significant developmental remodeling, we performed scRNAseq on microglia from mice that are wild-type, lack neuronal apoptosis (Bax KO), or are treated with CSF1R inhibitor (PLX3397). We find that interactions with apoptotic neurons drives multiple microglial remodeling states, subsets of which are resistant to CSF1R inhibition. We find that TAM receptor Mer and complement receptor 3 are required for clearance of apoptotic neurons, but that Mer does not drive expression of remodeling genes. We show TAM receptor Axl is negligible for phagocytosis or remodeling gene expression but is consequential for microglial survival in the absence of CSF1R signaling. Thus, interactions with apoptotic neurons shift microglia towards distinct remodeling states and through Axl, alters microglial dependence on survival pathway, CSF1R.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptic plasticity of inhibitory synapses onto medial olivocochlear efferent neurons</a></h4>

              
                The descending auditory system modulates the ascending system at every level. The final descending, or efferent stage, is comprised of lateral olivocochlear (LOC) and medial olivocochlear (MOC) neurons. MOC somata in the ventral brainstem project axons to the cochlea to synapse onto outer hair cells (OHC), inhibiting OHC-mediated cochlear amplification. MOC suppression of OHC function is implicated in cochlear gain control with changing sound intensity, detection of salient stimuli, attention, and protection against acoustic trauma. Thus, sound excites MOC neurons to provide negative feedback of the cochlea. Sound also inhibits MOC neurons via medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) neurons. However, MNTB-MOC synapses exhibit short-term depression, suggesting reduced MNTB-MOC inhibition during sustained stimuli. Further, due to high rates of both baseline and sound-evoked activity in MNTB neurons in vivo, MNTB-MOC synapses may be tonically depressed. To probe this, we characterized short-term plasticity of MNTB-MOC synapses in mouse brain slices. We mimicked in vivo-like temperature and extracellular calcium conditions, and in vivo-like activity patterns of fast synaptic activation rates, sustained activation, and prior tonic activity. Synaptic depression was sensitive to extracellular calcium concentration and temperature. During rapid MNTB axon stimulation, post-synaptic currents (PSCs) in MOC neurons summated but with concurrent depression, resulting in smaller, sustained currents, suggesting tonic inhibition of MOC neurons during rapid circuit activity. Low levels of baseline MNTB activity did not significantly reduce responses to subsequent rapid activity that mimics sound stimulation, indicating that, in vivo, MNTB inhibition of MOC neurons persists despite tonic synaptic depression.

                Already before the onset of a saccadic eye movement, we preferentially process visual information at the upcoming eye fixation. This 'presaccadic shift of attention' is typically assessed via localized test items, which potentially bias the attention measurement. Here we show how presaccadic attention shapes perception from saccade origin to target when no scene-structuring items are presented. Participants made saccades into a 1/f ('pink') noise field, in which we embedded a brief orientation signal at various locations shortly before saccade onset. Local orientation discrimination performance served as a proxy for the allocation of attention. Results demonstrate that (1) saccades are preceded by shifts of attention to their goal location even if they are directed into an unstructured visual field, but the spread of attention, compared to target-directed saccades, is broad; (2) the presaccadic attention shift is accompanied by considerable attentional costs at the presaccadic eye fixation; (3) objects markedly shape the distribution of presaccadic attention, demonstrating the relevance of an item-free approach for measuring attentional dynamics across the visual field.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Serine 1283 in extracellular matrix glycoprotein Reelin is crucial for Reelin's function in brain development</a></h4>

              
                Deficiency in the extracellular matrix glycoprotein Reelin severely affects migration of neurons during development. The function of serine at position 1283 in Reelin has remained uncertain. To explore its relevance we generated rlnA/A mice that carry alanine instead of serine at position 1283, thereby disrupting the putative casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylation site S1283DGD. Mutated mice displayed reeler-like locomotor behavior, abnormal brain anatomy and decrease of Reelin RNA and protein levels during development and in adulthood. Since serine 1283 was previously proposed to mediate proteolysis of adhesion molecules, we investigated proteolysis of cell adhesion molecule L1 and found it normal in rlnA/A mice. Neuronal migration in the embryonic rlnA/A cerebral cortex was impaired, but rescued by in utero electroporation of the Reelin fragment N-R6 containing the putative CK2 phosphorylation site. In rlnA/A mice migration of cerebellar granule cells in vitro was promoted by application of wild-type but not by mutated Reelin. In cerebellar neuron cultures, Reelin expression was decreased upon inhibition of ecto-phosphorylation by CK2. Biochemically purified wild-type, but not mutated Reelin was found phosphorylated. Altogether, the results indicate that ecto-phosphorylation at serine 1283 rather than proteolytic processing of adhesion molecules by Reelin plays an important role in Reelin functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential serotonergic modulation of principal neurons and interneurons in the anterior piriform cortex</a></h4>

              
                Originating from the brainstem raphe nuclei, serotonin is an important neuromodulator involved in a variety of physiological and pathological functions. Specific optogenetic stimulation of serotonergic neurons results in the divisive suppression of spontaneous, but not sensory evoked activity in the majority of neurons in the primary olfactory cortex and an increase in firing in a minority of neurons. To reveal the mechanisms involved in this dual serotonergic control of cortical activity we used a combination of in vitro electrophysiological recordings from identified neurons in the primary olfactory cortex, optogenetics and pharmacology and found that serotonin suppressed the activity of principal neurons, but excited local interneurons. The results have important implications in sensory information processing and other functions of the olfactory cortex and related brain areas.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An efficient multi-scale CNN model with intrinsic feature integration for motor imagery EEG subject classification in brain-machine interfaces</a></h4>

              
                Electroencephalogram (EEG) based motor imagery (MI) classification is an important aspect in brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) which bridges between neural system and computer devices decoding brain signals into recognizable machine commands. However, the MI classification task is challenging due to inherent complex properties, inter-subject variability, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG signals. To overcome the above-mentioned issues, the current work proposes an efficient multi-scale convolutional neural network (MS-CNN) which can extract the distinguishable features of several non-overlapping canonical frequency bands of EEG signals from multiple scales for MI-BCI classification. In the framework, discriminant user-specific features have been extracted and integrated to improve the accuracy and performance of the CNN classifier. Additionally, different data augmentation methods have been implemented to further improve the accuracy and robustness of the model. The model achieves an average classification accuracy of 93.74% and Cohen's kappa-coefficient of 0.92 on the BCI competition IV2b dataset outperforming several baseline and current state-of-the-art EEG-based MI classification models. The proposed algorithm effectively addresses the shortcoming of existing CNN-based EEG-MI classification models and significantly improves the classification accuracy. The current framework can provide a stimulus for designing efficient and robust real-time human-robot interaction.

                <p>Ankyrin scaffolding proteins are critical for membrane domain organization and protein stabilization in many different cell types including neurons. In the cerebellum, Ankyrin-R (AnkR) is highly enriched in Purkinje neurons, granule cells, and in the cerebellar nuclei (CN). Using male and female mice with a floxed allele for <I>Ank1</I> in combination with <I>Nestin-Cre</I> and <I>Pcp2-Cre</I> mice, we found that ablation of AnkR from Purkinje neurons caused ataxia, regional and progressive neurodegeneration, and altered cerebellar output. We show that AnkR interacts with the cytoskeletal protein &beta;3 spectrin and the potassium channel Kv3.3. Loss of AnkR reduced somatic membrane levels of &beta;3 spectrin and Kv3.3 in Purkinje neurons. Thus, AnkR links Kv3.3 channels to the &beta;3 spectrin-based cytoskeleton. Our results may help explain why mutations in &beta;3 spectrin and Kv3.3 both cause spinocerebellar ataxia.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Ankyrin scaffolding proteins localize and stabilize ion channels in the membrane by linking them to the spectrin-based cytoskeleton. Here, we show that Ankyrin-R (AnkR) links Kv3.3 K<sup>+</sup> channels to the &beta;3 spectrin-based cytoskeleton in Purkinje neurons. Loss of AnkR causes Purkinje neuron degeneration, altered cerebellar physiology, and ataxia, which is consistent with mutations in Kv3.3 and &beta;3 spectrin causing spinocerebellar ataxia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">MMP2 and MMP9 Activity Is Crucial for Adult Visual Cortex Plasticity in Healthy and Stroke-Affected Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>A fundamental regulator of neuronal network development and plasticity is the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the brain. The ECM provides a scaffold stabilizing synaptic circuits, while the proteolytic cleavage of its components and cell surface proteins are thought to have permissive roles in the regulation of plasticity. The enzymatic proteolysis is thought to be crucial for homeostasis between stability and reorganizational plasticity and facilitated largely by a family of proteinases named matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Here, we investigated whether MMP2 and MMP9 play a role in mediating adult primary visual cortex (V1) plasticity as well as stroke-induced impairments of visual cortex plasticity in mice. In healthy adult mice, selective inhibition of MMP2/9 for 7 d suppressed ocular dominance plasticity. In contrast, brief inhibition of MMP2/9 after a cortical stroke rescued compromised plasticity. Our data indicate that the proteolytic activity of MMP2 and MMP9 is critical and required to be within a narrow range to allow adult visual plasticity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Learning and recovery from injuries depend on the plasticity of neuronal connections. The brain's extracellular matrix (ECM) provides a scaffold for stabilizing synaptic circuits, while its enzymatic proteolysis is hypothesized to regulate homeostasis between stability and reorganizational plasticity. ECM digestion is facilitated by a family of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Here, we show that treatments that inhibit MMP2/9 can either inhibit or rescue cortical plasticity depending on cortical state: in the visual cortex of healthy adult mice, inhibition of MMP2/9 suppressed cortical plasticity. In contrast, brief inhibition of MMP2/9 after a stroke rescued compromised plasticity. Our data provide strong evidence that an optimal level of MMP2/9 proteolytic activity is crucial for adult visual plasticity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Economic Choices under Simultaneous or Sequential Offers Rely on the Same Neural Circuit</a></h4>

              
                <p>A series of studies in which monkeys chose between two juices offered in variable amounts identified in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) different groups of neurons encoding the value of individual options (offer value), the binary choice outcome (chosen juice), and the chosen value. These variables capture both the input and the output of the choice process, suggesting that the cell groups identified in OFC constitute the building blocks of a decision circuit. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis. However, in previous experiments offers were presented simultaneously, raising the question of whether current notions generalize to when goods are presented or are examined in sequence. Recently, <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B2">Ballesta and Padoa-Schioppa (2019)</cross-ref> examined OFC activity under sequential offers. An analysis of neuronal responses across time windows revealed that a small number of cell groups encoded specific sequences of variables. These sequences appeared analogous to the variables identified under simultaneous offers, but the correspondence remained tentative. Thus, in the present study, we examined the relation between cell groups found under sequential versus simultaneous offers. We recorded from the OFC while monkeys chose between different juices. Trials with simultaneous and sequential offers were randomly interleaved in each session. We classified cells in each choice modality, and we examined the relation between the two classifications. We found a strong correspondence; in other words, the cell groups measured under simultaneous offers and under sequential offers were one and the same. This result indicates that economic choices under simultaneous or sequential offers rely on the same neural circuit.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Research in the past 20 years has shed light on the neuronal underpinnings of economic choices. A large number of results indicates that decisions between goods are formed in a neural circuit within the orbitofrontal cortex. In most previous studies, subjects chose between two goods offered simultaneously. Yet, in daily situations, goods available for choice are often presented or examined in sequence. Here we recorded neuronal activity in the primate orbitofrontal cortex alternating trials under simultaneous and under sequential offers. Our analyses demonstrate that the same neural circuit supports choices in the two modalities. Hence, current notions on the neuronal mechanisms underlying economic decisions generalize to choices under sequential offers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Cortico-Cortical Pathway Targets Inhibitory Interneurons and Modulates Paw Movement during Locomotion in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>The primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is important for the control of movement as it encodes sensory input from the body periphery and external environment during ongoing movement. Mouse S1 consists of several distinct sensorimotor subnetworks that receive topographically organized corticocortical inputs from distant sensorimotor areas, including the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and primary motor cortex (M1). The role of the vibrissal S1 area and associated cortical connections during active sensing is well documented, but whether (and if so, how) non-whisker S1 areas are involved in movement control remains relatively unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that unilateral silencing of the non-whisker S1 area in both male and female mice disrupts hind paw movement during locomotion on a rotarod and a runway. S2 and M1 provide major long-range inputs to this S1 area. Silencing S2-&gt;non-whisker S1 projections alters the hind paw orientation during locomotion, whereas manipulation of the M1 projection has little effect. Using patch-clamp recordings in brain slices from male and female mice, we show that S2 projection preferentially innervates inhibitory interneuron subtypes. We conclude that interneuron-mediated S2&ndash;S1 corticocortical interactions are critical for efficient locomotion.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Somatosensory cortex participates in controlling rhythmic movements, such as whisking and walking, but the neural circuitry underlying movement control by somatosensory cortex remains relatively unexplored. We uncover a corticocortical circuit in primary somatosensory cortex that regulates paw orientation during locomotion in mice. We identify neuronal elements that comprise these cortical pathways using pharmacology, behavioral assays, and circuit-mapping methods.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Mapping the Microstructure and Striae of the Human Olfactory Tract with Diffusion MRI</a></h4>

              
                <p>The human sense of smell plays an important role in appetite and food intake, detecting environmental threats, social interactions, and memory processing. However, little is known about the neural circuity supporting its function. The olfactory tracts project from the olfactory bulb along the base of the frontal cortex, branching into several striae to meet diverse cortical regions. Historically, using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to reconstruct the human olfactory tracts has been prevented by susceptibility and motion artifacts. Here, we used a dMRI method with readout segmentation of long variable echo-trains (RESOLVE) to minimize image distortions and characterize the human olfactory tracts <I>in vivo</I>. We collected high-resolution dMRI data from 25 healthy human participants (12 male and 13 female) and performed probabilistic tractography using constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD). At the individual subject level, we identified the lateral, medial, and intermediate striae with their respective cortical connections to the piriform cortex and amygdala (AMY), olfactory tubercle (OT), and anterior olfactory nucleus (AON). We combined individual results across subjects to create a normalized, probabilistic atlas of the olfactory tracts. We then investigated the relationship between olfactory perceptual scores and measures of white matter integrity, including mean diffusivity (MD). Importantly, we found that olfactory tract MD negatively correlated with odor discrimination performance. In summary, our results provide a detailed characterization of the connectivity of the human olfactory tracts and demonstrate an association between their structural integrity and olfactory perceptual function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study provides the first detailed <I>in vivo</I> description of the cortical connectivity of the three olfactory tract striae in the human brain, using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI). Additionally, we show that tract microstructure correlates with performance on an odor discrimination task, suggesting a link between the structural integrity of the olfactory tracts and odor perception. Lastly, we generated a normalized probabilistic atlas of the olfactory tracts that may be used in future research to study its integrity in health and disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Maturation of Temporal Saccade Prediction from Childhood to Adulthood: Predictive Saccades, Reduced Pupil Size, and Blink Synchronization</a></h4>

              
                <p>When presented with a periodic stimulus, humans spontaneously adjust their movements from reacting to predicting the timing of its arrival, but little is known about how this sensorimotor adaptation changes across development. To investigate this, we analyzed saccade behavior in 114 healthy humans (ages 6&ndash;24 years) performing the visual metronome task, who were instructed to move their eyes in time with a visual target that alternated between two known locations at a fixed rate, and we compared their behavior to performance in a random task, where target onsets were randomized across five interstimulus intervals (ISIs) and thus the timing of appearance was unknown. Saccades initiated before registration of the visual target, thus in anticipation of its appearance, were labeled predictive [saccade reaction time (SRT) &lt; 90 ms] and saccades that were made in reaction to its appearance were labeled reactive (SRT &gt; 90 ms). Eye-tracking behavior including saccadic metrics (e.g., peak velocity, amplitude), pupil size following saccade to target, and blink behavior all varied as a function of predicting or reacting to periodic targets. Compared with reactive saccades, predictive saccades had a lower peak velocity, a hypometric amplitude, smaller pupil size, and a reduced probability of blink occurrence before target appearance. The percentage of predictive and reactive saccades changed inversely from ages 8&ndash;16, at which they reached adult-levels of behavior. Differences in predictive saccades for fast and slow target rates are interpreted by differential maturation of cerebellar-thalamic-striatal pathways.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> From the first moments of life, humans are exposed to rhythm (i.e., mother's heartbeat <I>in utero</I>), but the timeline of brain development to promote the identification and anticipation of a rhythmic stimulus, known as temporal prediction, remains unknown. Here, we used saccade reaction time (SRT) in the visual metronome task to differentiate between temporally predictive and reactive responses to a target that alternated at a fixed rate in humans aged 6&ndash;24. Periods of age-related change varied little by target rate, with matured predictive performance evident by mid-adolescence for fast and slow rates. A strong correlation among saccade, pupil, and blink responses during target prediction provides evidence of oculomotor coordination and dampened noradrenergic neuronal activity when generating rhythmic motor responses.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Prediction of Learned Resistance or Helplessness by Hippocampal-Prefrontal Cortical Network Activity during Stress</a></h4>

              
                <p>The perception of control over a stressful experience may determine its impacts and generate resistance against future stressors. Although the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HPC) are implicated in the encoding of stressor controllability, the neural dynamics underlying this process are unknown. Here, we recorded HPC and PFC neural activities in male rats during the exposure to controllable, uncontrollable, or no shocks and investigated electrophysiological predictors of escape performance upon exposure to subsequent uncontrollable shocks. We were able to accurately discriminate stressed from nonstressed animals and predict resistant (R) or helpless (H) individuals based on hippocampal-cortical oscillatory dynamics. Remarkably, R animals exhibited an increase in theta power during CS, while H exhibited a decrease. Furthermore, R exhibited higher HPC to PFC  synchronization during stress. Notably, HPC-PFC  connectivity in the initial stress exposure showed strong correlations with escape performance evaluated days later. R rats also showed stronger  coupling to both  oscillations and neuronal firing in the PFC. Finally, we found that these distinct features of network dynamics collectively formed a pattern that accurately predicted learned resistance and was lacking in H individuals. Our findings suggest that hippocampal-prefrontal network  activity supports cognitive mechanisms of stress coping, whose impairment may underlie vulnerability to stress-related disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The appraisal of adversities as controllable or uncontrollable is key in determining resilience or risk for stress-related disorders. Here, we performed the first electrophysiological investigation during controllable or uncontrollable stress. Pharmacological studies showed that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HPC) encode stressor controllability, and here we identified the neural activity underlying this process. This "neural signature of stressor controllability" accurately predicted resistance to future stressors and was characterized by increased HPC-PFC oscillatory activity in the  frequency (4&ndash;10 Hz). Our findings suggest a new role of frontal  oscillations in adaptive stress coping, integrating its emotional and cognitive functions. We also endorse the potential of this biomarker to guide neurophysiologically-informed and rhythm-based stimulation therapies for depression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Rapid Extraction of the Spatial Distribution of Physical Saliency and Semantic Informativeness from Natural Scenes in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Physically salient objects are thought to attract attention in natural scenes. However, research has shown that meaning maps, which capture the spatial distribution of semantically informative scene features, trump physical saliency in predicting the pattern of eye moments in natural scene viewing. Meaning maps even predict the fastest eye movements, suggesting that the brain extracts the spatial distribution of potentially meaningful scene regions very rapidly. To test this hypothesis, we applied representational similarity analysis to ERP data. The ERPs were obtained from human participants (<I>N</I> = 32, male and female) who viewed a series of 50 different natural scenes while performing a modified 1-back task. For each scene, we obtained a physical saliency map from a computational model and a meaning map from crowd-sourced ratings. We then used representational similarity analysis to assess the extent to which the representational geometry of physical saliency maps and meaning maps can predict the representational geometry of the neural response (the ERP scalp distribution) at each moment in time following scene onset. We found that a link between physical saliency and the ERPs emerged first (~78 ms after stimulus onset), with a link to semantic informativeness emerging soon afterward (~87 ms after stimulus onset). These findings are in line with previous evidence indicating that saliency is computed rapidly, while also indicating that information related to the spatial distribution of semantically informative scene elements is computed shortly thereafter, early enough to potentially exert an influence on eye movements.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Attention may be attracted by physically salient objects, such as flashing lights, but humans must also be able to direct their attention to meaningful parts of scenes. Understanding how we direct attention to meaningful scene regions will be important for developing treatments for disorders of attention and for designing roadways, cockpits, and computer user interfaces. Information about saliency appears to be extracted rapidly by the brain, but little is known about the mechanisms that determine the locations of meaningful information. To address this gap, we showed people photographs of real-world scenes and measured brain activity. We found that information related to the locations of meaningful scene elements was extracted rapidly, shortly after the emergence of saliency-related information.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Representations of Food-Related Attributes in the Human Orbitofrontal Cortex during Choice Deliberation in Anorexia Nervosa</a></h4>

              
                <p>Decisions about what to eat recruit the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and involve the evaluation of food-related attributes such as taste and health. These attributes are used differently by healthy individuals and patients with disordered eating behavior, but it is unclear whether these attributes are decodable from activity in the OFC in both groups and whether neural representations of these attributes are differentially related to decisions about food. We used fMRI combined with behavioral tasks to investigate the representation of taste and health attributes in the human OFC and the role of these representations in food choices in healthy women and women with anorexia nervosa (AN). We found that subjective ratings of tastiness and healthiness could be decoded from patterns of activity in the OFC in both groups. However, health-related patterns of activity in the OFC were more related to the magnitude of choice preferences among patients with AN than healthy individuals. These findings suggest that maladaptive decision-making in AN is associated with more consideration of health information represented by the OFC during deliberation about what to eat.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> An open question about the OFC is whether it supports the evaluation of food-related attributes during deliberation about what to eat. We found that healthiness and tastiness information was decodable from patterns of neural activity in the OFC in both patients with AN and healthy controls. Critically, neural representations of health were more strongly related to choices in patients with AN, suggesting that maladaptive overconsideration of healthiness during deliberation about what to eat is related to activity in the OFC. More broadly, these results show that activity in the human OFC is associated with the evaluation of relevant attributes during value-based decision-making. These findings may also guide future research into the development of treatments for AN.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Visual Motion and Decision-Making in Dyslexia: Reduced Accumulation of Sensory Evidence and Related Neural Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>Children with and without dyslexia differ in their behavioral responses to visual information, particularly when required to pool dynamic signals over space and time. Importantly, multiple processes contribute to behavioral responses. Here we investigated which processing stages are affected in children with dyslexia when performing visual motion processing tasks, by combining two methods that are sensitive to the dynamic processes leading to responses. We used a diffusion model which decomposes response time and accuracy into distinct cognitive constructs, and high-density EEG. Fifty children with dyslexia (24 male) and 50 typically developing children (28 male) 6-14 years of age judged the direction of motion as quickly and accurately as possible in two global motion tasks (motion coherence and direction integration), which varied in their requirements for noise exclusion. Following our preregistered analyses, we fitted hierarchical Bayesian diffusion models to the data, blinded to group membership. Unblinding revealed reduced evidence accumulation in children with dyslexia compared with typical children for both tasks. Additionally, we identified a response-locked EEG component which was maximal over centro-parietal electrodes which indicated a neural correlate of reduced drift rate in dyslexia in the motion coherence task, thereby linking brain and behavior. We suggest that children with dyslexia tend to be slower to extract sensory evidence from global motion displays, regardless of whether noise exclusion is required, thus furthering our understanding of atypical perceptual decision-making processes in dyslexia.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Reduced sensitivity to visual information has been reported in dyslexia, with a lively debate about whether these differences causally contribute to reading difficulties. In this large preregistered study with a blind modeling approach, we combine state-of-the art methods in both computational modeling and EEG analysis to pinpoint the stages of processing that are atypical in children with dyslexia in two visual motion tasks that vary in their requirement for noise exclusion. We find reduced evidence accumulation in children with dyslexia across both tasks, and identify a neural marker, allowing us to link brain and behavior. We show that children with dyslexia exhibit general difficulties with extracting sensory evidence from global motion displays, not just in tasks that require noise exclusion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Representations of Chinese Characters: Evidence from Sublexical Components</a></h4>

              
                <p>Little research has been done about the neural substrate of the sublexical level of Chinese word recognition. In particular, it is unclear how radicals participate in Chinese word processing. We compared two measures of radical combinability, position-general radical combinability (GRC) and position-specific radical combinability (SRC) depending on whether the position of the radical is taken into account. We selected characters with embedded target radicals that had different GRC and SRC measures. These measures were used as predictors in a parametric modulation analysis and a multivariate representational similarity analysis. Human participants with native Mandarin speakers (17 males and 24 females) were asked to read words in search of animal words. Results showed that SRC is a better predictor than GRC in decoding the neural patterns. Whole-brain analysis indicated that SRC is encoded bilaterally in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, pars opercularis, and pars triangularis), the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and a region on the border of the superior parietal lobule and the inferior parietal lobule (SPL/IPL). Region-of-interest-based RSA confirmed the results of the whole-brain analysis. Furthermore, we observed a correlation of another sublexical variable, logographeme composition, with bilateral activity in SPL. Logographemes refer to the basic stroke combinations that form radicals and characters. Finally, we observed involvement of bilateral cerebellum activity in Chinese word recognition. Our findings confirm the importance of sublexical components (SRC and logographeme composition) in Chinese word recognition and also confirm that Chinese word recognition involves more bilateral processing than word recognition in alphabetical languages.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chinese is a logographic language. However, characters contain informative subword components (radicals, logographemes, and strokes). We investigated whether the position of the radical is important. We presented carefully selected words and looked where brain activity correlated with subword information. Results indicate that position-dependent radicals predict brain encoding in a network of regions associated with Chinese word recognition, including higher order regions such as bilateral IFG, MFG, and SPL/IPL. Logographeme composition had an effect as well. Our findings provide strong evidence (1) for the importance of position-specific radical information and logographemes in Chinese word recognition, (2) that current brain imaging techniques are best suited to study these, and (3) that confirms the interactive nature of Chinese character recognition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Presenilin/{gamma}-Secretase Activity Is Located in Acidic Compartments of Live Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Presenilin (PSEN)/-secretase is a protease complex responsible for the proteolytic processing of numerous substrates. These substrates include the amyloid precursor protein (APP), the cleavage of which by -secretase results in the production of &beta;-amyloid (A&beta;) peptides. However, exactly where within the neuron -secretase processes APP C99 to generate A&beta; and APP intracellular domain (AICD) is still not fully understood. Here, we employ novel Fo&#x0308;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based multiplexed imaging assays to directly "visualize" the subcellular compartment(s) in which -secretase primarily cleaves C99 in mouse cortex primary neurons (from both male and female embryos). Our results demonstrate that -secretase processes C99 mainly in LysoTracker-positive low-pH compartments. Using a new immunostaining protocol which distinguishes A&beta; from C99, we also show that intracellular A&beta; is significantly accumulated in the same subcellular loci. Furthermore, we found functional correlation between the endo-lysosomal pH and cellular -secretase activity. Taken together, our findings are consistent with A&beta; being produced from C99 by -secretase within acidic compartments such as lysosomes and late endosomes in living neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetics and histopathology highlight the importance of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing by -secretase in pathogenesis. For the first time, this study has enabled us to directly "visualize" that -secretase processes C99 mainly in acidic compartments such as late endosomes and lysosomes in live neurons. Furthermore, we uncovered that intracellular &beta;-amyloid (A&beta;) is significantly accumulated in the same subcellular loci. Emerging evidence proposes the great importance of the endo-lysosomal pathway in mechanisms of misfolded proteins propagation (e.g., Tau, &alpha;-Syn). Therefore, the predominant processing of C99 and enrichment of A&beta; in late endosomes and lysosomes may be critical events in the molecular cascade leading to AD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Characteristics and long-term outcomes of childhood glaucoma: a retrospective-cohort study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: To evaluate the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with childhood glaucoma. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients with childhood glaucoma who visited the glaucoma clinics at the Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health and the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital between January 2008 and January 2018. The diagnosis was based on the Childhood Glaucoma Research Network classification. We recorded their clinical characteristics and requirement of any glaucoma interventions. Results: A total of 691 eyes from 423 patients were included in this study. The patients predominantly comprised boys. The average follow-up duration was 71.3±63.8 months. The mean age at presentation was 3.9±4.4 years. Most patients presented with a high initial intraocular pressure (IOP). The average intial IOP of all patients was 28.5±11.2 mmHg. Glaucoma associated with non-acquired ocular anomalies (22.9%) was the most common subtype, followed by primary congenital glaucoma (20.8%). We recorded a family history of glaucoma in 6.4% of patients of the 234 patients with an available family history. Most patients had bilateral glaucoma (63.4%) and required at least one intervention (51.5%). The average IOP at the latest follow-up visit was 19.1±10.8 mmHg. All glaucoma types had significantly lower IOP, compared to that at their baselines (all p<0.001). Moreover, most patients had an unfavourable visual acuity (49.5%) at their latest visit. Conclusions: Secondary glaucoma associated with non-acquired ocular anomalies is the most common subtype of glaucoma. The majority of patients had unfavourable visual outcomes. These real-world findings are fundamental to acquire a better understanding of childhood glaucoma.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of physical activity and dietary supplement on fat free mass and bone mass density during weight loss – a systematic review and meta-analysis. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: After a diet- or surgery induced weight loss almost 1/3 of lost weight consists of fat free mass (FFM) if carried out without additional therapy. Exercise training and a sufficient supply of protein, calcium and vitamin D is recommended to reduce the loss of FFM. Objective: To investigate the effect of exercise training, protein, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation on the preservation of FFM during non-surgical and surgical weight loss and of the combination of all interventions together in adults with obesity. Methods: A systematic review was performed with a pairwise meta-analysis and an exploratory network meta-analysis according to the PRISMA statement. Results: Thirty studies were included in the quantitative analysis. The pairwise meta-analysis showed for Exercise Training + High Protein vs. High Protein a moderate and statistically significant effect size (SMD 0.45; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.86), for Exercise Training + High Protein vs. Exercise Training a high but statistically not significant effect size (SMD 0.91; 95% CI -0.59 to 2.41) and for Exercise Training alone vs. Control a moderate but statistically not significant effect size (SMD 0.67; 95% CI -0.25 to 1.60). In the exploratory network meta-analysis three interventions showed statistically significant effect sizes compared to Control and all of them included the treatment Exercise Training. Conclusions: Results underline the importance of exercise training and a sufficient protein intake to preserve FFM during weight loss in adults with obesity. The effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation remains controversial and further research are needed.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">OperonSEQer: A set of machine-learning algorithms with threshold voting for detection of operon pairs using short-read RNA-sequencing data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Raga Krishnakumar, Anne M. Ruffing</p>

Operon prediction in prokaryotes is critical not only for understanding the regulation of endogenous gene expression, but also for exogenous targeting of genes using newly developed tools such as CRISPR-based gene modulation. A number of methods have used transcriptomics data to predict operons, based on the premise that contiguous genes in an operon will be expressed at similar levels. While promising results have been observed using these methods, most of them do not address uncertainty caused by technical variability between experiments, which is especially relevant when the amount of data available is small. In addition, many existing methods do not provide the flexibility to determine the stringency with which genes should be evaluated for being in an operon pair. We present OperonSEQer, a set of machine learning algorithms that uses the statistic and p-value from a non-parametric analysis of variance test (Kruskal-Wallis) to determine the likelihood that two adjacent genes are expressed from the same RNA molecule. We implement a voting system to allow users to choose the stringency of operon calls depending on whether your priority is high recall or high specificity. In addition, we provide the code so that users can retrain the algorithm and re-establish hyperparameters based on any data they choose, allowing for this method to be expanded as additional data is generated. We show that our approach detects operon pairs that are missed by current methods by comparing our predictions to publicly available long-read sequencing data. OperonSEQer therefore improves on existing methods in terms of accuracy, flexibility, and adaptability.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational investigation of blood cell transport in retinal microaneurysms</a></h4>

              
                <p>by He Li, Yixiang Deng, Konstantina Sampani, Shengze Cai, Zhen Li, Jennifer K. Sun, George E. Karniadakis</p>

Microaneurysms (MAs) are one of the earliest clinically visible signs of diabetic retinopathy (DR). MA leakage or rupture may precipitate local pathology in the surrounding neural retina that impacts visual function. Thrombosis in MAs may affect their turnover time, an indicator associated with visual and anatomic outcomes in the diabetic eyes. In this work, we perform computational modeling of blood flow in microchannels containing various MAs to investigate the pathologies of MAs in DR. The particle-based model employed in this study can explicitly represent red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets as well as their interaction in the blood flow, a process that is very difficult to observe <i>in vivo</i>. Our simulations illustrate that while the main blood flow from the parent vessels can perfuse the entire lumen of MAs with small body-to-neck ratio (BNR), it can only perfuse part of the lumen in MAs with large BNR, particularly at a low hematocrit level, leading to possible hypoxic conditions inside MAs. We also quantify the impacts of the size of MAs, blood flow velocity, hematocrit and RBC stiffness and adhesion on the likelihood of platelets entering MAs as well as their residence time inside, two factors that are thought to be associated with thrombus formation in MAs. Our results show that enlarged MA size, increased blood velocity and hematocrit in the parent vessel of MAs as well as the RBC-RBC adhesion promote the migration of platelets into MAs and also prolong their residence time, thereby increasing the propensity of thrombosis within MAs. Overall, our work suggests that computational simulations using particle-based models can help to understand the microvascular pathology pertaining to MAs in DR and provide insights to stimulate and steer new experimental and computational studies in this area.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Modelling how cleaner fish approach an ephemeral reward task demonstrates a role for ecologically tuned chunking in the evolution of advanced cognition</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yosef Prat, Redouan Bshary, Arnon Lotem</p>

What makes cognition “advanced” is an open and not precisely defined question. One perspective involves increasing the complexity of associative learning, from conditioning to learning sequences of events (“chaining”) to representing various cue combinations as “chunks.” Here we develop a weighted graph model to study the mechanism enabling chunking ability and the conditions for its evolution and success, based on the ecology of the cleaner fish <i>Labroides dimidiatus</i>. In some environments, cleaners must learn to serve visitor clients before resident clients, because a visitor leaves if not attended while a resident waits for service. This challenge has been captured in various versions of the ephemeral reward task, which has been proven difficult for a range of cognitively capable species. We show that chaining is the minimal requirement for solving this task in its common simplified laboratory format that involves repeated simultaneous exposure to an ephemeral and permanent food source. Adding ephemeral–ephemeral and permanent–permanent combinations, as cleaners face in the wild, requires individuals to have chunking abilities to solve the task. Importantly, chunking parameters need to be calibrated to ecological conditions in order to produce adaptive decisions. Thus, it is the fine-tuning of this ability, which may be the major target of selection during the evolution of advanced associative learning.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Smell-induced gamma oscillations in human olfactory cortex are required for accurate perception of odor identity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Qiaohan Yang, Guangyu Zhou, Torben Noto, Jessica W. Templer, Stephan U. Schuele, Joshua M. Rosenow, Gregory Lane, Christina Zelano</p>

Studies of neuronal oscillations have contributed substantial insight into the mechanisms of visual, auditory, and somatosensory perception. However, progress in such research in the human olfactory system has lagged behind. As a result, the electrophysiological properties of the human olfactory system are poorly understood, and, in particular, whether stimulus-driven high-frequency oscillations play a role in odor processing is unknown. Here, we used direct intracranial recordings from human piriform cortex during an odor identification task to show that 3 key oscillatory rhythms are an integral part of the human olfactory cortical response to smell: Odor induces theta, beta, and gamma rhythms in human piriform cortex. We further show that these rhythms have distinct relationships with perceptual behavior. Odor-elicited gamma oscillations occur only during trials in which the odor is accurately perceived, and features of gamma oscillations predict odor identification accuracy, suggesting that they are critical for odor identity perception in humans. We also found that the amplitude of high-frequency oscillations is organized by the phase of low-frequency signals shortly following sniff onset, only when odor is present. Our findings reinforce previous work on theta oscillations, suggest that gamma oscillations in human piriform cortex are important for perception of odor identity, and constitute a robust identification of the characteristic electrophysiological response to smell in the human brain. Future work will determine whether the distinct oscillations we identified reflect distinct perceptual features of odor stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Comparative genomics reveals electron transfer and syntrophic mechanisms differentiating methanotrophic and methanogenic archaea</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Grayson L. Chadwick, Connor T. Skennerton, Rafael Laso-Pérez, Andy O. Leu, Daan R. Speth, Hang Yu, Connor Morgan-Lang, Roland Hatzenpichler, Danielle Goudeau, Rex Malmstrom, William J. Brazelton, Tanja Woyke, Steven J. Hallam, Gene W. Tyson, Gunter Wegener, Antje Boetius, Victoria J. Orphan</p>

The anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to sulfate reduction is a microbially mediated process requiring a syntrophic partnership between anaerobic methanotrophic (ANME) archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). Based on genome taxonomy, ANME lineages are polyphyletic within the phylum <i>Halobacterota</i>, none of which have been isolated in pure culture. Here, we reconstruct 28 ANME genomes from environmental metagenomes and flow sorted syntrophic consortia. Together with a reanalysis of previously published datasets, these genomes enable a comparative analysis of all marine ANME clades. We review the genomic features that separate ANME from their methanogenic relatives and identify what differentiates ANME clades. Large multiheme cytochromes and bioenergetic complexes predicted to be involved in novel electron bifurcation reactions are well distributed and conserved in the ANME archaea, while significant variations in the anabolic C1 pathways exists between clades. Our analysis raises the possibility that methylotrophic methanogenesis may have evolved from a methanotrophic ancestor.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Evolutionary plasticity and functional versatility of CRISPR systems</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eugene V. Koonin, Kira S. Makarova</p>

The principal biological function of bacterial and archaeal CRISPR systems is RNA-guided adaptive immunity against viruses and other mobile genetic elements (MGEs). These systems show remarkable evolutionary plasticity and functional versatility at multiple levels, including both the defense mechanisms that lead to direct, specific elimination of the target DNA or RNA and those that cause programmed cell death (PCD) or induction of dormancy. This flexibility is also evident in the recruitment of CRISPR systems for nondefense functions. Defective CRISPR systems or individual CRISPR components have been recruited by transposons for RNA-guided transposition, by plasmids for interplasmid competition, and by viruses for antidefense and interviral conflicts. Additionally, multiple highly derived CRISPR variants of yet unknown functions have been discovered. A major route of innovation in CRISPR evolution is the repurposing of diverged repeat variants encoded outside CRISPR arrays for various structural and regulatory functions. The evolutionary plasticity and functional versatility of CRISPR systems are striking manifestations of the ubiquitous interplay between defense and “normal” cellular functions.

                <p>by Peter Dayan</p>

Psychological and neural distinctions between the technical concepts of “liking” and “wanting” pose important problems for motivated choice for goods. Why could we “want” something that we do not “like,” or “like” something but be unwilling to exert effort to acquire it? Here, we suggest a framework for answering these questions through the medium of reinforcement learning. We consider “liking” to provide immediate, but preliminary and ultimately cancellable, information about the true, long-run worth of a good. Such initial estimates, viewed through the lens of what is known as potential-based shaping, help solve the temporally complex learning problems faced by animals.

                Classic late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN2 disease) is caused by a deficiency of tripeptidyl-peptidase-1. In 2017, the first CLN2 enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) cerliponase alfa (Brineura) was approved by the FDA and EMA. The CLN2 disease clinical rating scale (CLN2 CRS) was developed to monitor loss of motor function, language and vision as well as frequency of generalised tonic clonic seizures. Using CLN2 CRS in an open label clinical trial it was shown that Brineura slowed down the progression of CLN2 symptoms. Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a protein highly expressed in myelinated axons. An increase of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood NfL is found in a variety of neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative, traumatic, and cerebrovascular diseases. We analysed CSF NfL in CLN2 patients treated with Brineura to establish whether it can be used as a possible biomarker of response to therapy. Newly diagnosed patients had CSF samples collected and analysed at first treatment dose and up to 12 weeks post-treatment to look at acute changes. Patients on a compassionate use programme who were already receiving ERT for approximately 1yr had CSF samples collected and NfL analysed over the following 1.3 years (2.3 years post-initiation of ERT) to look at long-term changes. All newly diagnosed patients we investigated with classical late infantile phenotype had high NfL levels >2000 pg/ml at start of treatment. No significant change was observed in NfL up to 12 weeks post-treatment. After one year of ERT, two out of six patients still had high NfL levels, but all patients showed a continued decrease, and all had low NfL levels after two years on ERT. NfL levels appear to correspond and predict improved clinical status of patients on ERT and could be useful as a biomarker to monitor neurodegeneration and verify disease modification in CLN2 patients on ERT.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Neural organization of the third optic neuropil, the lobula, in the highly visual semiterrestrial crab Neohelice granulata</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The visual neuropils (lamina, medulla and lobula complex), of malacostracan crustaceans and hexapods have many organizational principles, cell types and functional properties in common. Information about the cellular elements that compose the crustacean lobula is scarce especially when focusing on small columnar cells. Semiterrestrial crabs possess a highly developed visual system and display conspicuous visually guided behaviors. In particular, <i>Neohelice granulata</i> has been previously used to describe the cellular components of the first two optic neuropils using Golgi impregnation technique. Here, we present a comprehensive description of individual elements composing the third optic neuropil, the lobula, of that same species. We characterized a wide variety of elements (140 types) including input terminals and lobula columnar, centrifugal and input columnar elements. Results reveal a very dense and complex neuropil. We found a frequently impregnated input element (suggesting a supernumerary cartridge representation) that arborizes in the third layer of the lobula and that presents four variants each with ramifications organized following one of the four cardinal axes suggesting a role in directional processing. We also describe input elements with two neurites branching in the third layer, probably connecting with the medulla and lobula plate. These facts suggest that this layer is involved in the directional motion detection pathway in crabs. We analyze and discuss our findings considering the similarities and differences found between the layered organization and components of this crustacean lobula and the lobula of insects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Low power, less occupying area, and improved speed of a 4-bit router/rerouter circuit for low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoders [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are more error-resistant than other forward error-correcting codes. Existing circuits give high power dissipation, less speed, and more occupying area. This work aimed to propose a better design and performance circuit, even in the presence of noise in the channel. Methods: In this research, the design of the multiplexer and demultiplexer were achieved using pass transistor logic. The target parameters were low power dissipation, improved throughput, and more negligible delay with a minimum area. One of the essential connecting circuits in a decoShder architecture is a multiplexer (MUX) and a demultiplexer (DEMUX) circuit. The design of the MUX and DEMUX contributes significantly to the performance of the decoder. The aim of this paper was the design of a 4 × 1 MUX to route the data bits received from the bit update blocks to the parallel adder circuits and a 1 × 4 DEMUX to receive the input bits from the parallel adder and distribute the output to the bit update blocks in a layered architecture LDPC decoder. The design uses pass transistor logic and achieves the reduction of the number of transistors used. The proposed circuit was designed using the Mentor Graphics CAD tool for 180 nm technology. Results: The parameters of power dissipation, area, and delay were considered crucial parameters for a low power decoder. The circuits were simulated using computer-aided design (CAD) tools, and the results depicted a significantly low power dissipation of 7.06 nW and 5.16 nW for the multiplexer and demultiplexer, respectively. The delay was found to be 100.5 ns (MUX) and 80 ns (DEMUX). Conclusion: This decoder’s potential use may be in low-power communication circuits such as handheld devices and Internet of Things (IoT) circuits.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Space-log: a novel approach to inferring gene-gene net-works using SPACE model with log penalty [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Gene expression data have been used to infer gene-gene networks (GGN) where an edge between two genes implies the conditional dependence of these two genes given all the other genes. Such gene-gene networks are of-ten referred to as gene regulatory networks since it may reveal expression regulation. Most of existing methods for identifying GGN employ penalized regression with L1 (lasso), L2 (ridge), or elastic net penalty, which spans the range of L1 to L2 penalty. However, for high dimensional gene expression data, a penalty that spans the range of L0 and L1 penalty, such as the log penalty, is often needed for variable selection consistency. Thus, we develop a novel method that em-ploys log penalty within the framework of an earlier network identification method space (Sparse PArtial Correlation Estimation), and implement it into a R package space-log. We show that the space-log is computationally efficient (source code implemented in C), and has good performance comparing with other methods, particularly for networks with hubs.Space-log is open source and available at GitHub, https://github.com/wuqian77/SpaceLog

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A multi-parameter grading system for optimal fitting of scleral contact lenses [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: While scleral lens practise has improved over the years due to factors such as availability of lenses with better materials and designs as well as experience of practitioners, a lack of objectivity appears to remain in terms of assessment of scleral lens fitting. This prospective observational work aimed to achieve standardization on this front through proposing a grading system for scleral lens fitting. Methods: After application of prosthetic replacement of ocular surface ecosystem (PROSE) devices on the participants’ eyes, four fundamental components for understanding scleral lens fitting such as central and limbal corneal clearance, mid-haptic compression, and alignment of lens edge over anterior sclera were assessed through a series of slit-lamp biomicroscopy imaging as well as with anterior segment optical coherence tomography. FitConnect® was used to modify the device parameters to simulate different grading patterns on the proposed scale. Serial imaging was done for all the different lenses to compose the grading scale. Results: A clinically relevant grading scale was constructed that pictorially demonstrated grades for the different aspect of scleral lens fitting. The grades were conveniently scaled within three categories: “optimal”, “acceptable” and “not acceptable”. Conclusion: The gradation of scleral lens fitting parameters would take a step towards objectifying the assessment patterns in practise. This will also help reducing the gap between a novice and an experienced practitioner in terms of understanding of scleral lens fitting.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Temporal trends of sex differences for COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation, severe disease, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death: a meta-analysis of 229 studies covering over 10M patients [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This review aims to investigate the association of sex with the risk of multiple COVID-19 health outcomes, ranging from infection to death. Methods: Pubmed and Embase were searched through September 2020. We considered studies reporting sex and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. Qualitative and quantitative data were extracted using standardised electronic data extraction forms with the assessment of Newcastle Ottawa Scale for risk of bias. Pooled trends in infection, hospitalization, severity, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death rate were calculated separately for men and women and subsequently random-effects meta-analyses on relative risks (RR) for sex was performed. Results: Of 10,160 titles, 229 studies comprising 10,417,452 patients were included in the analyses. Methodological quality of the included studies was high (6.9 out of 9). Men had a higher risk for infection with COVID-19 than women (RR = 1.14, 95%CI: 1.07 to 1.21). When infected, they also had a higher risk for hospitalization (RR = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.27 to 1.41), higher risk for severe COVID-19 (RR = 1.22, 95%CI: 1.17 to 1.27), higher need for Intensive Care (RR = 1.41, 95%CI: 1.28 to 1.55), and higher risk of death (RR = 1.35, 95%CI: 1.28 to 1.43). Within the period studied, the RR for infection and severity increased for men compared to women, while the RR for mortality decreased for men compared to women. Conclusions: Meta-analyses on 229 studies comprising over 10 million patients showed that men have a higher risk for COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, disease severity, ICU admission and death. The relative risks of infection, disease severity and death for men versus women showed temporal trends with lower relative risks for infection and severity of disease and higher relative risk for death at the beginning of the pandemic compared to the end of our inclusion period.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Reduction in cognitive processing speed surrounding multiple sclerosis relapse</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore the longitudinal relationship between multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses and information processing efficiency among persons with relapsing-remitting MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Swedish nationwide cohort study of persons with incident relapsing-remitting MS (2001-2019). Relapse information and symbol digit modalities test (SDMT) scores were obtained from the Swedish MS Registry. Follow-up was categorized into two periods based on relapse status: “relapse” (90 days pre-relapse to 730 days post-relapse, subdivided into 10 periods) and “remission”. Linear mixed models compared SDMT scores during the relapse periods to SDMT scores recorded during remission (reference) with results reported as β-coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for age, sex, SDMT type (written vs oral), time-varying disease-modifying therapy exposure and sequence of SDMT.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Over a mean (SD) follow-up of 10.7 (4.3) years, 31,529 distinct SDMTs were recorded among 3877 persons with MS. There was a significant decline in information processing efficiency that lasted from 30 days pre-relapse up to 550 days post-relapse, with the largest decline occurring 0-30 days post-relapse (β-coefficient:-4.00 (95%CI: -4.61 to -3.39), relative to the period of remission.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We found evidence of cognitive change up to one month prior to relapse onset. The reduction in SDMT lasted 1.5 years and was clinically significant up to three months post-relapse. These results suggest that the effects of a relapse on cognition are longer than previously thought and highlight the importance of reducing relapse rates as a potential means of preserving cognitive function.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To compare the rate of change in cognition between <i>glucocerebrosidase</i> (<i>GBA)</i> mutation carriers and non-carriers with and without subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) in Parkinson’s disease (PD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical and genetic data from 12 datasets were examined. Global cognition was assessed using the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS). Subjects were examined for mutations in <i>GBA</i> and categorized as <i>GBA</i> carriers with or without DBS (<i>GBA</i>+DBS+, <i>GBA</i>+DBS-), and non-carriers with or without DBS (<i>GBA</i>-DBS+, <i>GBA</i>-DBS-). <i>GBA</i> mutation carriers were subcategorized according to mutation severity (risk variant, mild, severe). Linear mixed modeling was used to compare rate of change in MDRS scores over time among the groups according to <i>GBA</i> and DBS status and then according to <i>GBA</i> severity and DBS status.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Data were available for 367 subjects: 58 <i>GBA</i>+DBS+, 82 <i>GBA</i>+DBS-, 98 <i>GBA</i>-DBS+, and 128 <i>GBA</i>-DBS- subjects who were longitudinal followed (range 36 to 60 months after surgery). Using the MDRS, <i>GBA</i>+DBS+ subjects declined on average 2.02 points/year more than <i>GBA</i>-DBS- subjects (95% CI = -2.35, -1.69), 1.71 points/year more than <i>GBA</i>+DBS- subjects (95% CI = -2.14, -1.28), and 1.49 points/year more than <i>GBA</i>-DBS+ subjects (95% CI = -1.80, -1.18).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although non-randomized, this composite analysis suggests that the combined effects of <i>GBA</i> mutations and STN-DBS negatively impact cognition. We advise that DBS candidates be screened for <i>GBA</i> mutations as part of the pre-surgical decision-making process. We advise that <i>GBA</i> mutation carriers be counseled regarding potential risks associated with STN-DBS and alternative options may be considered.</p>

                Advances in genetic technologies have facilitated the development of new animal models of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), enabling cross-species validation of disease-related phenotypes and exploration of species-specific behaviours. In a recent study, Berg et al. used a rat model of Angelman Syndrome (AS) to identify Ube3a-dependent social behaviours, highlighting potential cross-species convergence and divergence between rodent models.

                Neurodegenerative disorders can alter neural circuitry long before symptoms appear, but the path from early changes to later pathologies is obscure. In this issue of Neuron, Capizzi et al. (2021) show how early axonal growth defects in Huntington’s disease create vulnerability to later degeneration.

                In this issue of Neuron, Zhao et al. (2022) describe the effects of plateau potentials, discharges common in hippocampus but rare in cortex.

                In this issue of Neuron, Natraj et al.

The movements are encoded in a distributed network that is preserved across various hand actions. The neural dynamics are specific to particular hand movements, leading to movement-specific submanifolds in the network.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The pioneer factor hypothesis is not necessary to explain ectopic liver gene activation</a></h4>

              
                The Pioneer Factor Hypothesis (PFH) states that pioneer factors (PFs) are a subclass of transcription factors (TFs) that bind to and open inaccessible sites and then recruit non-pioneer factors (nonPFs) that activate batteries of silent genes. The PFH predicts that ectopic gene activation requires the sequential activity of qualitatively different TFs. We tested the PFH by expressing the endodermal PF FOXA1 and nonPF HNF4A in K562 lymphoblast cells. While co-expression of FOXA1 and HNF4A activated a burst of endoderm-specific gene expression, we found no evidence for a functional distinction between these two TFs. When expressed independently, both TFs bound and opened inaccessible sites, activated endodermal genes, and 'pioneered' for each other, although FOXA1 required fewer copies of its motif for binding. A subset of targets required both TFs, but the predominant mode of action at these targets did not conform to the sequential activity predicted by the PFH. From these results we hypothesize an alternative to the PFH where 'pioneer activity' depends not on categorically different TFs but rather on the affinity of interaction between TF and DNA.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Type I and II PRMTs inversely regulate post-transcriptional intron detention through Sm and CHTOP methylation</a></h4>

              
                Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) are required for the regulation of RNA processing factors. Type I PRMT enzymes catalyze mono- and asymmetric dimethylation; Type II enzymes catalyze mono- and symmetric dimethylation. To understand the specific mechanisms of PRMT activity in splicing regulation, we inhibited Type I and II PRMTs and probed their transcriptomic consequences. Using the newly developed Splicing Kinetics and Transcript Elongation Rates by Sequencing (SKaTER-seq) method, analysis of co-transcriptional splicing demonstrated that PRMT inhibition resulted in altered splicing rates. Surprisingly, co-transcriptional splicing kinetics did not correlate with final changes in splicing of polyadenylated RNA. This was particularly true for retained introns (RI). By using actinomycin D to inhibit ongoing transcription, we determined that PRMTs post-transcriptionally regulate RI. Subsequent proteomic analysis of both PRMT-inhibited chromatin and chromatin-associated polyadenylated RNA identified altered binding of many proteins, including the Type I substrate, CHTOP, and the Type II substrate, SmB. Targeted mutagenesis of all methylarginine sites in SmD3, SmB, and SmD1 recapitulated splicing changes seen with Type II PRMT inhibition, without disrupting snRNP assembly. Similarly, mutagenesis of all methylarginine sites in CHTOP recapitulated the splicing changes seen with Type I PRMT inhibition. Examination of subcellular fractions further revealed that RI were enriched in the nucleoplasm and chromatin. Together, these data demonstrate that, through Sm and CHTOP arginine methylation, PRMTs regulate the post-transcriptional processing of nuclear, detained introns.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cavefish cope with environmental hypoxia by developing more erythrocytes and overexpression of hypoxia inducible genes</a></h4>

              
                Dark caves lacking primary productivity can expose subterranean animals to hypoxia. We used the surface-dwelling (surface fish) and cave-dwelling (cavefish) morphs of <i>Astyanax mexicanus</i> as a model for understanding the mechanisms of hypoxia tolerance in the cave environment. Primitive hematopoiesis, which is restricted to the posterior lateral mesoderm in other teleosts, also occurs in the anterior lateral mesoderm in <i>Astyanax</i>, potentially pre-adapting surface fish for hypoxic cave colonization. Cavefish have enlarged both hematopoietic domains and develop more erythrocytes than surface fish, which are required for normal development in both morphs. Laboratory induced hypoxia suppresses growth in surface fish but not in cavefish. Both morphs respond to hypoxia by overexpressing <i>hypoxia-inducible factor 1</i> (<i>hif1</i>) pathway genes, and some <i>hif1</i> genes are constitutively upregulated in normoxic cavefish to similar levels as in hypoxic surface fish. We conclude that cavefish cope with hypoxia by increasing erythrocyte development and constitutive <i>hif1</i> gene overexpression.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The anterior cingulate cortex and its role in controlling contextual fear memory to predatory threats</a></h4>

              
                Predator exposure is a life-threatening experience and elicits learned fear responses to the context in which the predator was encountered. The anterior cingulate area (ACA) occupies a pivotal position in a cortical network responsive to predatory threats, and it exerts a critical role in processing fear memory. The experiments were made in mice and revealed that the ACA is involved in both the acquisition and expression of contextual fear to predatory threat. Overall, the ACA can provide predictive relationships between the context and the predator threat and influences fear memory acquisition through projections to the basolateral amygdala and perirhinal region and the expression of contextual fear through projections to the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray. Our results expand previous studies based on classical fear conditioning and open interesting perspectives for understanding how the ACA is involved in processing contextual fear memory to ethologic threatening conditions that entrain specific medial hypothalamic fear circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Risk factors relate to the variability of health outcomes as well as                    the mean: a GAMLSS tutorial</a></h4>

              
                <b>Background:</b> Risk factors or interventions may affect the variability                    as well as the mean of health outcomes. Understanding this can aid aetiological                    understanding and public health translation, in that interventions which shift                    the outcome mean and reduce variability are typically preferable to those which                    affect only the mean. However, most commonly used statistical tools do not test                    for differences in variability.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Activation by cleavage of the epithelial Na+ channel α and γ subunits independently coevolved with the vertebrate terrestrial migration</a></h4>

              
                Vertebrates evolved mechanisms for sodium conservation and gas exchange in conjunction with migration from aquatic to terrestrial habitats. Epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channel (ENaC) function is critical to systems responsible for extracellular fluid homeostasis and gas exchange. ENaC is activated by cleavage at multiple specific extracellular polybasic sites, releasing inhibitory tracts from the channel’s α and γ subunits. We found that proximal and distal polybasic tracts in ENaC subunits coevolved, consistent with the dual cleavage requirement for activation observed in mammals. Polybasic tract pairs evolved with the terrestrial migration and the appearance of lungs, coincident with the ENaC activator aldosterone, and appeared independently in the a and g subunits. In summary, sites within ENaC for protease activation developed in vertebrates when renal Na<sup>+</sup> conservation and alveolar gas exchange was required for terrestrial survival.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Allosteric modulation of the adenosine A2A receptor by cholesterol</a></h4>

              
                Cholesterol is a major component of the cell membrane and commonly regulates membrane protein function. Here, we investigate how cholesterol modulates the conformational equilibria and signaling of the adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor (A<sub>2A</sub>R) in reconstituted phospholipid nanodiscs. This model system conveniently excludes possible effects arising from cholesterol-induced phase separation or receptor oligomerization and focuses on the question of allostery. GTP hydrolysis assays show that cholesterol weakly enhances the basal signaling of A<sub>2A</sub>R while decreasing the agonist EC<sub>50</sub>. Fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>19</sup>F NMR) spectroscopy shows that this enhancement arises from an increase in the receptor’s active state population and a G-protein-bound precoupled state. <sup>19</sup>F NMR of fluorinated cholesterol analogs reveals transient interactions with A<sub>2A</sub>R, indicating a lack of high-affinity binding or direct allosteric modulation. The combined results suggest that the observed allosteric effects are largely indirect and originate from cholesterol-mediated changes in membrane properties, as shown by membrane fluidity measurements and high-pressure NMR.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The role of action potential changes in depolarization-induced failure of excitation contraction coupling in mouse skeletal muscle</a></h4>

              
                Excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) is the process by which electrical excitation of muscle is converted into force generation. Depolarization of skeletal muscle resting potential contributes to failure of ECC in diseases such as periodic paralysis, intensive care unit acquired weakness and possibly fatigue of muscle during vigorous exercise. When extracellular K<sup>+</sup> is raised to depolarize the resting potential, failure of ECC occurs suddenly, over a narrow range of resting potentials. Simultaneous imaging of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and recording of action potentials (APs) demonstrated failure to generate Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients when APs peaked at potentials more negative than –30mV. An AP property that closely correlated with failure of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient was the integral of AP voltage with respect to time. Simultaneous recording of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and APs with electrodes separated by 1.6mm revealed AP conduction fails when APs peak below –21mV. We hypothesize propagation of APs and generation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are governed by distinct AP properties: AP conduction is governed by AP peak, whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is governed by AP integral. The reason distinct AP properties may govern distinct steps of ECC is the kinetics of the ion channels involved. Na channels, which govern propagation, have rapid kinetics and are insensitive to AP width (and thus AP integral) whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is governed by gating charge movement of Cav1.1 channels, which have slower kinetics such that Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is sensitive to AP integral. The quantitative relationships established between resting potential, AP properties, AP conduction and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients provide the foundation for future studies of failure of ECC induced by depolarization of the resting potential.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Functional profiling of long intergenic non-coding RNAs in fission yeast</a></h4>

              
                Eukaryotic genomes express numerous long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) that do not overlap any coding genes. Some lincRNAs function in various aspects of gene regulation, but it is not clear in general to what extent lincRNAs contribute to the information flow from genotype to phenotype. To explore this question, we systematically analysed cellular roles of lincRNAs in <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>. Using seamless CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing, we deleted 141 lincRNA genes to broadly phenotype these mutants, together with 238 diverse coding-gene mutants for functional context. We applied high-throughput colony-based assays to determine mutant growth and viability in benign conditions and in response to 145 different nutrient, drug, and stress conditions. These analyses uncovered phenotypes for 47.5% of the lincRNAs and 96% of the protein-coding genes. For 110 lincRNA mutants, we also performed high-throughput microscopy and flow cytometry assays, linking 37% of these lincRNAs with cell-size and/or cell-cycle control. With all assays combined, we detected phenotypes for 84 (59.6%) of all lincRNA deletion mutants tested. For complementary functional inference, we analysed colony growth of strains ectopically overexpressing 113 lincRNA genes under 47 different conditions. Of these overexpression strains, 102 (90.3%) showed altered growth under certain conditions. Clustering analyses provided further functional clues and relationships for some of the lincRNAs. These rich phenomics datasets associate lincRNA mutants with hundreds of phenotypes, indicating that most of the lincRNAs analysed exert cellular functions in specific environmental or physiological contexts. This study provides groundwork to further dissect the roles of these lincRNAs in the relevant conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Development, validation and application of a machine learning model to estimate salt consumption in 54 countries</a></h4>

              
                Global targets to reduce salt intake have been proposed but their monitoring is challenged by the lack of population-based data on salt consumption. We developed a machine learning (ML) model to predict salt consumption at the population level based on simple predictors and applied this model to national surveys in 54 countries. We used 21 surveys with spot urine samples for the ML model derivation and validation; we developed a supervised ML regression model based on: sex, age, weight, height, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. We applied the ML model to 54 new surveys to quantify the mean salt consumption in the population. The pooled dataset in which we developed the ML model included 49,776 people. Overall, there were no substantial differences between the observed and ML-predicted mean salt intake (p&lt;0.001). The pooled dataset where we applied the ML model included 166,677 people; the predicted mean salt consumption ranged from 6.8 g/day (95% CI: 6.8-6.8 g/day) in Eritrea to 10.0 g/day (95% CI: 9.9-10.0 g/day) in American Samoa. The countries with the highest predicted mean salt intake were in Western Pacific. The lowest predicted intake was found in Africa. The country-specific predicted mean salt intake was within reasonable difference from the best available evidence. A ML model based on readily available predictors estimated daily salt consumption with good accuracy. This model could be used to predict mean salt consumption in the general population where urine samples are not available.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptional and cell type profiles of cortical brain regions showing ultradian cortisol rhythm dependent responses to emotional face stimulation</a></h4>

              
                The characteristic endogenous circadian rhythm of plasma glucocorticoid concentrations is made up from an underlying ultradian pulsatile secretory pattern. Recent evidence has indicated that this ultradian cortisol pulsatility is crucial for normal emotional response in man. In this study, we investigate the anatomical transcriptional and cell type signature of brain regions sensitive to a loss of ultradian rhythmicity in the context of emotional processing. We combine human cell type and transcriptomic atlas data of high spatial resolution with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We show that the loss of cortisol ultradian rhythm alters emotional processing response in cortical brain areas that are characterized by transcriptional and cellular profiles of GABAergic function. We find that two previously identified key components of rapid non-genomic GC signaling - the ANXA1 gene and retrograde endocannabinoid signaling - show top differential expression and the most significant enrichment. Our results further indicate that specific cell types, including a specific NPY-expressing GABAergic neuronal cell type, and specific G protein signaling cascades underly the cerebral effects of a loss of ultradian cortisol rhythm. Our results provide a biological mechanistic underpinning of our fMRI findings, indicating specific cell types and cascades as a target for manipulation in future experimental studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The neural dynamics associated with computational complexity</a></h4>

              
                Many everyday tasks require people to solve computationally complex problems. However, little is known about the effects of computational hardness on the neural processes associated with solving such problems. Here, we draw on computational complexity theory to address this issue. We performed an experiment in which participants solved several instances of the 0-1 knapsack problem, a combinatorial optimization problem, while undergoing ultra-high field (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Instances varied in two task-independent measures of intrinsic computational hardness: complexity and proof hardness. We characterise a network of brain regions whose activation was correlated with both measures but in distinct ways, including the anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the intra-parietal sulcus/angular gyrus. Activation and connectivity changed dynamically as a function of complexity and proof hardness, in line with theoretical computational requirements. Overall, our results suggest that computational complexity theory provides a suitable framework to study the effects of computational hardness on the neural processes associated with solving complex cognitive tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep slow-wave oscillations trigger seizures in a genetic epilepsy model of Dravet syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is the brain state when cortical activity decreases and memory consolidates. However, in human epileptic patients, including genetic epileptic seizures such as Dravet syndrome, sleep is the preferential period when epileptic spike-wave discharges (SWDs) appear, with more severe epileptic symptoms in female patients than male patients, which influencing patient sleep quality and memory. Currently, seizure onset mechanisms during sleep period still remain unknown. Our previous work has shown that the sleep-like state-dependent synaptic potentiation mechanism can trigger epileptic SWDs (Zhang et al., 2021). In this study, using one heterozygous (het) knock-in (KI) transgenic mice (GABAA receptor {gamma}2 subunit Gabrg2Q390X mutation) and an optogenetic method, we hypothesized that slow-wave oscillations (SWOs) themselves in vivo could trigger epileptic seizures. We found that epileptic SWDs in het Gabrg2+/Q390X KI mice exhibited preferential incidence during NREM sleep period, accompanied by motor immobility/ facial myoclonus/vibrissal twitching, with more frequent incidence in female het KI mice than male het KI mice. Optogenetic induced SWOs in vivo significantly increased epileptic seizure incidence in het Gabrg2+/Q390X KI mice with increased duration of NREM sleep or quiet-wakeful states. Furthermore, suppression of SWO-related homeostatic synaptic potentiation by 4-(diethylamino)-benzaldehyde (DEAB) injection (i.p.) greatly decreased seizure incidence in het KI mice, suggesting that SWOs did trigger seizure activity in het KI mice. In addition, EEG delta-frequency (0.1-4 Hz) power spectral density during NREM sleep was significantly larger in female het Gabrg2+/Q390X KI mice than male het Gabrg2+/Q390X KI mice, which likely contributes to the gender difference in seizure incidence during NREM sleep/quiet-wake as that in human patients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Resting-State Network Analysis of Suicide Attempt History in the UK Biobank</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prior research has identified altered brain structure and function in individuals at risk for self-directed violence thoughts and behaviors. However, these studies have largely utilized healthy controls and findings have been inconsistent. Thus, this study examined differences in resting-state functional network connectivity among individuals with lifetime suicide attempt(s) versus lifetime self-directed violence thoughts alone. Methods: Using data from the UK Biobank, this study utilized a series of linear regressions to compare individuals with lifetime suicide attempt(s) (n = 566) versus lifetime self-directed violence thoughts alone (n = 3,447) on within- and between- network resting-state functional connectivity subnetworks. Results: There were no significant between-group differences for between-network, within-network, or whole-brain functional connectivity after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, and body mass index and performing statistical corrections for multiple comparisons. Conclusions: Resting-state network measures may not differentiate between individuals with lifetime suicide attempt(s) and lifetime self-directed violence thoughts alone. Null findings diverge from results reported in smaller neuroimaging studies of suicide risk, but are consistent with null findings in other large-scale studies and meta-analyses. Strengths of the study include its large sample size and stringent control group. Future research on a wider array of imaging, genetic, and psychosocial risk factors can clarify relative contributions of individual and combined variables to suicide risk and inform scientific understanding of ideation-to-action framework.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Drosophila Mechanical Nociceptors Preferentially Sense Localized Poking</a></h4>

              
                Mechanical nociception is an evolutionarily conserved sensory process required for the survival of living organisms. Previous studies have revealed much about the neural circuits and key sensory molecules in mechanical nociception, but the cellular mechanisms adopted by nociceptors in force detection remain elusive. To address this issue, we study the mechanosensation of a fly larval nociceptor (class IV da neurons, c4da) using a customized mechanical device. We find that c4da are sensitive to mN-scale forces and make uniform responses to the forces applied at different dendritic regions. Moreover, c4da showed a greater sensitivity to more localized forces, consistent with them being able to sense the poking of sharp objects, such as wasp ovipositor. Further analysis reveals that high morphological complexity, mechanosensitivity to lateral tension and active signal propagation in the dendrites altogether facilitate the mechanosensitivity and sensory features of c4da. In particular, we discover that Piezo and Ppk1/Ppk26, two key mechanosensory molecules, make differential but additive contributions to the mechanosensation of c4da. In all, our results provide updates into understanding how c4da process mechanical signals at the cellular level and reveal the contributions of key molecules.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Texture-like representation of objects in human visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                The human visual ability to recognize objects and scenes is widely thought to rely on representations in category-selective regions of visual cortex. These representations could support object vision by specifically representing objects, or, more simply, by representing complex visual features regardless of the particular spatial arrangement needed to constitute real world objects. That is, by representing visual textures. To discriminate between these hypotheses, we leveraged an image synthesis approach that, unlike previous methods, provides independent control over the complexity and spatial arrangement of visual features. We found that human observers could easily detect a natural object among synthetic images with similar complex features that were spatially scrambled. However, observer models built from BOLD responses from category-selective regions, as well as a model of macaque inferotemporal cortex and Imagenet-trained deep convolutional neural networks, were all unable to identify the real object. This inability was not due to a lack of signal-to-noise, as all of these observer models could predict human performance in image categorization tasks. How then might these texture-like representations in category-selective regions support object perception? An image-specific readout from category-selective cortex yielded a representation that was more selective for natural feature arrangement, showing that the information necessary for object discrimination is available. Thus, our results suggest that the role of human category-selective visual cortex is not to explicitly encode objects but rather to provide a basis set of texture-like features that can be infinitely reconfigured to flexibly learn and identify new object categories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential mosquito attraction to humans is associated with skin-derived carboxylic acid levels</a></h4>

              
                Female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes feed on human blood, which they use to develop their eggs. It has been widely noted that some people are more attractive to mosquitoes than others, but the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon is poorly understood. Here we tested mosquito attraction to skin odor collected from human subjects and identified people who are exceptionally attractive or unattractive to mosquitoes. Notably, these preferences were stable over several years, indicating consistent longitudinal differences in skin odor between subjects. We carried out gas chromatography/quadrupole time of flight-mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical composition of human skin odor in these subjects and discovered that highly attractive people produce significantly increased levels of carboxylic acids. Consistent with the hypothesis that odor concentration is a major driver of differential attraction, mosquitoes could reliably distinguish a highly attractive human from their weakly attractive counterparts unless we substantially diluted the odor of the most attractive subject. Our work suggests that an increased abundance of mosquito attractants on the preferred subject explains differential attraction, rather than the non-preferred skin odor blend being repellent. Mosquitoes detect carboxylic acids with a large family of odor-gated ion channels encoded by the Ionotropic Receptor gene superfamily. Mutant mosquitoes lacking any of the Ionotropic Receptor (IR) co-receptors Ir8a, Ir25a, and Ir76b, were severely impaired in attraction to human scent but retained the ability to differentiate highly and weakly attractive people. The link between elevated carboxylic acids in mosquito-magnet human skin odor and phenotypes of genetic mutations in carboxylic acid receptors suggests that such compounds contribute to differential mosquito attraction. Understanding why some humans are more attractive than others will provide insights into what skin odorants are most important to the mosquito and could inform the development of more effective repellents.
