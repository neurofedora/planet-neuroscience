                Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an auto-immune inflammatory disorder affecting the central nervous system. The cause of the disease is unknown but both genetic and environmental factors are implicated in the pathogenesis. We derived cerebral organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) of healthy control subjects as well as from primary progressive MS (PPMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) patients to better understand the pathologic basis of the varied clinical phenotypic expressions of MS. In MS organoids, most notably in PPMS, we observed a decrease of proliferation marker Ki67 and a reduction of the SOX2+ stem cell pool associated with an increased expression of neuronal markers CTIP2 and TBR1. This dysregulation of the stem cell pool is associated with a decreased expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21. Our findings show that the genetic background of a patient can directly alter stem cell function. This study also provides new insights on the innate cellular dysregulation in MS and identifies p21 pathway as a new potential target for therapeutic strategies in MS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early exposure to high-fat diet impairs central and peripheral metabolic function: Impacts on cognition and mitochondrial function</a></h4>

              
                The impact of overnutrition early in life is not restricted to the onset of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, but also affects critical brain functions related to cognition. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between peripheral metabolic and bioenergetic changes induced by high-fat diet (HFD) and their impact on hippocampal cognitive functions in juvenile mice. To this purpose, three-week-old male C57BL/6 mice received a HFD or control diet for seven weeks, associated with two low doses of streptozotocin (STZ) or vehicle, to accelerate the metabolic dysfunction. HFD induced metabolic changes in mice, particularly related to glucose metabolism, in spite of the absence of obesity and changes in lipid profile. HFD exposure starting from weaning impaired recognition and spatial memories in mice, without inducing a depressive-like behavior. Increased immunoreactivity for GFAP and a trend towards a decrease in NeuN staining were verified in the hippocampus of HFD-fed mice. HFD caused a bioenergetic impairment in the hippocampus, characterized by a decrease in both O2 consumption related to ATP production and in the maximum respiratory capacity. The thermogenic capacity of brown adipose tissue was impaired by HFD, here verified through the absence of a decrease in O2 consumption after UCP-1 inhibition and increase in the reserve respiratory capacity. Impaired mitochondria function was also observed in the liver of HFD mice, while no changes were verified in O2 consumption in the heart of juvenile mice. These results indicate that the introduction of a HFD early in life has a detrimental impact on bioenergetic and mitochondrial function of tissues with metabolic and thermogenic activities, which is likely related to hippocampal metabolic changes and cognitive impairment.

	<p>Maternal and passionate love are both crucial for reproduction and involve attachment behaviors with high rewards. Neurobiological studies of attachment in animal and human neuroimaging studies have suggested that the coordination of oxytocinergic and vasopressinergic pathways, coupled with the dopaminergic reward system, contribute to the formation and maintenance of maternal and passionate love. In the present study, we carried out a quantitative meta-analysis of human neuroimaging to identify common and dissociable neural substrates associated with maternal and passionate love, using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach. The ALE results showed significant activation of the brain regions in the left ventral tegmental area (VTA), right thalamus, left substantia nigra, and the left putamen for maternal love, but in the bilateral VTA for passionate love. The meta-analytic neuroimaging evidence suggests the greater involvement of cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;affective regulation in maternal attachment and the greater desire to combine liking and wanting in romantic love behaviors. The conjunction analysis highlights the functional convergence of the VTA across the two types of human love, indicating a shared neurobiological mechanism of maternal and passionate love with evolutionary roots. Our findings suggest that the processing of both maternal and passionate love involve the affective and motivational regulation associated with dopaminergic systems; our neuroimaging evidence supports the notion that maternal and passionate love share a common evolutionary origin and neurobiological basis in the human brain.</p>

	<p>Tic disorders (TDs) are a series of childhood neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by involuntary motor and/or vocal tics and commonly comorbid with several other psychopathological and/or behavioral disorders (e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder), which indeed aggravate clinical symptoms and complicate diagnosis and treatment. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) derived from small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) have been recognized as novel circulating biomarkers of disease. To identify specific miRNAs derived from plasma sEVs for TDs&amp;amp;rsquo; diagnosis and prognosis, we used official EV isolation and purification methods to characterize the plasma-derived EV miRNAs from children with different types of TDs. Nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and immunoblot analysis of EV surface markers were applied to confirm the features and quality of sEVs. The RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approach was adapted to identify novel circulating sEVs-derived miRNAs with altered expression levels in paired comparisons of TDs versus healthy controls (HCs), transient tic disorder (TTD) versus chronic motor or vocal tic disorder (CTD), and TTD versus Tourette Syndrome (TS). GO term and KEGG pathway were performed for functional analysis and the receiver operator curve analysis was followed to test the diagnosis efficacy of differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) derived from plasma sEVs among paired groups, namely, TDs versus HCs, TTD versus CTD, and TTD versus TS. As a result, 10 miRNAs (hsa-let-7a, hsa-let-7b, hsa-let-7c, hsa-let-7e, hsa-let-7f, hsa-miR-25-3p, hsa-miR-29a-3p, hsa-miR-30b-5p, hsa-miR-125b-5p, and hsa-miR-1469) have demonstrated a significantly different expression signature in the TDs group compared to HCs with excellent area under curve (AUC) values of 0.99, 0.973, 0.997, 1, 0.99, 0.997, 0.987, 0.993, 0.977, and 0.997, respectively, and the diagnostic efficacy of miRNAs was also estimated for discriminating TTD from CTD or TS. In our research, we finally obtained several potential sEVs-derived miRNA biomarkers to assess the diagnosis and prognosis of TDs.</p>

                Pathogenic a-synuclein and tau are critical drivers of neurodegeneration and their mutations cause neuronal loss in patients. Whether the underlying preferential neuronal vulnerability is a cell-type intrinsic property or a consequence of increased expression levels is an open question. Here, we explore cell-type specific a-synuclein and tau expression in human brain datasets and use deep phenotyping as well as brain-wide single-cell RNA sequencing of >200 live neuron types in fruit flies to ask which cellular environments react most to a-synuclein or tau toxicity. We detect phenotypic and transcriptomic evidence of differential neuronal vulnerability independent of a-synuclein or tau expression levels. Comparing vulnerable with resilient neurons enabled us to identify molecular signatures associated with these differential responses. We used these to verify, and then predict resilient and vulnerable neuron subtypes in human brains. This confirms substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons to be sensitive to a-synuclein, and we predict pathogenic tau vulnerable and protected cortical neuron subtypes. Our work indicates that cellular determinants confer selective vulnerability to specific types of amyloid toxicity, thus paving the way to leverage neuronal identity to uncover modifiers of neurodegeneration-associated toxic proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electrophysiological characterization of medial preoptic neurons in lactating rats and its modulation by hypocretin-1</a></h4>

              
                The medial preoptic area (mPOA) undergoes through neuroanatomical changes across the postpartum period, during which its neurons play a critical role in the regulation of maternal behavior. In addition, this area is also crucial for sleep-wake regulation. We have previously shown that hypocretins (HCRT) within the mPOA facilitate active maternal behaviors in postpartum rats, while the blockade of endogenous HCRT in this area promotes nursing and sleep. To explore the mechanisms behind these HCRT actions, we aimed to evaluate the effects of juxta-cellular HCRT-1 administration on mPOA neurons in urethane-anesthetized postpartum and virgin female rats. We recorded mPOA single units and the electroencephalogram (EEG) and applied HCRT-1 juxta-cellular by pressure pulses. Our main results show that the electrophysiological characteristics of the mPOA neurons and their relationship with the EEG of postpartum rats did not differ from virgin rats. Additionally, neurons that respond to HCRT-1 had a slower firing rate than those that did not. In addition, administration of HCRT increased the activity in one group of neurons while decreasing it in another, both in postpartum and virgin rats. The mechanisms by which HCRT modulate functions controlled by the mPOA involve different cell populations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gender and comorbidity moderate the relationship between mood disorder symptoms and effortful avoidance performance</a></h4>

              
                We must often decide how much effort to exert or withhold to avoid undesirable outcomes or obtain rewards. In depression and anxiety, levels of avoidance tend to be excessive and reward-seeking is reduced. Yet outstanding questions remain about the links between motivated action/inhibition and anxiety and depression symptoms, and whether they differ between men and women. Here we examined the relationship between anxiety and depression symptoms and performance on effortful active and inhibitory avoidance (Study 1) and reward seeking (Study 2) in humans. Undergraduates and paid online workers (NAvoid = 545, NReward = 310; NFemale = 368, NMale = 450, MAge = 22.58, RangeAge = 17-62) were assessed on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and performed an instructed online avoidance or reward-seeking task. Participants had to make multiple presses on active trials and withhold presses on inhibitory trials to avoid an unpleasant sound (Study 1) or obtain points towards a monetary reward (Study 2). Overall, men deployed more effort than women in both avoidance and reward-seeking, and anxiety symptoms were negatively associated with active reward-seeking accuracy. Gender moderated the relationship between anxiety symptoms and inhibitory avoidance, such that women with higher anxiety showed reduced inhibitory avoidance accuracy. Anxiety symptoms predicted poorer active avoidance performance for those high in depression symptoms only. Our results illuminate effects of gender and symptom comorbidity in the relationship between mood disorder symptoms and the motivation to actively and effortfully respond to obtain positive and avoid negative outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tilt Aftereffect Spreads Across the Visual Field</a></h4>

              
                The tilt aftereffect (TAE) is observed when adaptation to a tilted contour alters the perceived tilt of a subsequently presented contour. Thus far, the TAE has been treated as a local aftereffect observed only at the location of the adapter. Whether and how TAE spreads to other locations in the visual field has not been systematically studied. Here we sought an answer to this question by measuring TAE magnitudes at locations including but not limited to the adapter location. The adapter was a tilted grating presented at the same peripheral location throughout an experimental session. In a single trial, participants indicated the perceived tilt of a test grating presented after the adapter at one of fifteen locations in the same hemifield as the adapter. We found non-zero TAE magnitudes in all locations tested, showing that the effect spreads across the tested visual hemifield. Next, to establish a link between neuronal activity and the behavioral results, and to predict possible origins of the spread, we built a model based on known characteristics of neuronal responses in the visual cortex. Simulation results showed that the model can successfully capture the pattern of the behavioral results. Furthermore, the pattern of the optimized receptive field sizes suggests that mid-level visual areas, for example V4, could be critically involved in TAE and its spread across the visual field.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Non-redundant odorant detection in a locust</a></h4>

              
                Olfactory coding, from insects to humans, is canonically considered to involve considerable across-fiber coding already at the peripheral level, thereby allowing recognition of very large numbers of odor compounds. Here we show that the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria, has evolved an alternative strategy built on highly specific odorant receptors feeding into a complex primary processing center in the brain. By collecting odors from food and different life stages of the locust, we identified 208 ecologically relevant odorants, which we used to deorphanize 48 locust olfactory receptors via ectopic expression in Drosophila. Contrary to the often broadly tuned olfactory receptors of other insects, almost all locust receptors were found to be narrowly tuned to one ligand and most of these best ligands exclusively excited only one receptor. Knocking out a single receptor using CRISPR-Cas9 resulted in an abolished physiological and behavioral response to the corresponding ligand. We conclude that the locust olfactory system, with an apparent lack of redundancy among most olfactory receptors, differs from so-far described olfactory systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Blocking D2/D3 dopamine receptors increases volatility of beliefs when we learn to trust others</a></h4>

              
                The ability to flexibly adjust beliefs about other people is crucial for human social functioning. Dopamine has been proposed to regulate the precision of beliefs, but direct behavioural evidence of this is lacking. We investigated how a relatively high dose of the selective D2/D3 dopamine receptor antagonist sulpiride impacts learning about other people's prosocial attitudes in a repeated trust game. Using a Bayesian model of belief updating, we show that sulpiride increased the volatility of beliefs, which led to higher precision-weights on prediction errors. This effect was entirely driven by participants with genetically conferring higher dopamine availability (Taq1a polymorphism). Higher precision weights were reflected in higher reciprocal behaviour in the repeated trust game but not in single-round trust games. This finding suggests that antipsychotic medication might acutely reduce rigidity of pathological beliefs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">White matter and literacy: a dynamic system in flux</a></h4>

              
                Past studies have linked differences in white matter tissue properties to reading skills. However, these studies have reported a range of, sometimes conflicting, results. Some studies suggest that white matter properties act as individual-level traits predictive of reading skill, whereas others suggest that reading skill and white matter develop as a function of an individual's educational context. In the present study, we tested two hypotheses: a) that diffusion properties of the white matter reflect stable brain characteristics that relate to reading skills over development or b) that white matter plays a part in a dynamic system, linked with learning over time. To answer these questions, we examined the relationship between white matter and reading in a series of large-scale, single-observation datasets and a four-year longitudinal dataset. We find that gains in reading skill correspond to longitudinal changes in the white matter. However, in the single-observation datasets, we find no evidence for the hypothesis that individual differences in white matter predict reading skill. These findings highlight the link between dynamic processes in the white matter and learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Combining Backpropagation with Equilibrium Propagation to improve an Actor-Critic RL framework</a></h4>

              
                Backpropagation has been used to train neural networks for many years, allowing them to solve a wide variety of tasks like image classification, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning tasks. But the biological plausibility of backpropagation as a mechanism of neural learning has been questioned. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) has been proposed as a more biologically plausible alternative and achieves comparable accuracy on the CIFAR-10 image classification task. This study proposes the first EP-based reinforcement learning architecture: an actor-critic architecture with the actor network trained by EP. We show that this model can solve the basic control tasks often used as benchmarks for BP-based models. Interestingly, our trained model demonstrates more consistent high-reward behavior than a comparable model trained exclusively by backpropagation.

	<p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and sleep bruxism (SB) may appear concomitantly. Data on the relationship between OSA and SB are limited. It was shown that in a population with an increased risk of OSA, OSA was dependently correlated with SB on the degree of OSA severity only in mild and moderate cases of OSA. We aimed to confirm this relationship and affecting factors in a group of dental office patients in a prospective, observational study. Adult patients (n = 119) were evaluated using respiratory polygraphy. The risk of OSA was assessed using a STOP-Bang questionnaire (SBQ). The episodes of bruxism and respiratory events were scored according to the standards of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The prevalence of OSA and SB was found to be 63.02% and 41.17%, respectively. The bruxism episode index (BEI) was increased in the group with a higher risk of OSA (SBQ &amp;amp;ge; 3) compared to the group with a lower risk of OSA (3.49 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.63 vs. 2.27 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.50, p = 0.03). The sensitivity and specificity of the SBQ were not sufficient to predict SB. A positive linear correlation between AHI and BEI in the group with AHI &amp;amp;lt; 23/h was found. The study confirmed that OSA was associated with SB in the group of patients with OSA and/or SB risk. The relationship between OSA and SB depended on the degree of severity of OSA and occurred in mild and moderate cases of OSA.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">14-3-3{theta} Does Not Protect against Behavioral or Pathological Deficits in Alzheimers Disease Mouse Models</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive impairment associated with synaptic dysfunction and dendritic spine loss and the pathologic hallmarks of &beta;-amyloid (A&beta;) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau tangles. 14-3-3 proteins are a highly conserved family of proteins whose functions include regulation of protein folding, neuronal architecture, and synaptic function. Additionally, 14-3-3s interact with both A&beta; and tau, and reduced levels of 14-3-3s have been shown in the brains of AD patients and in AD mouse models. Here, we examine the neuroprotective potential of the 14-3-3 isoform in AD models. We demonstrate that 14-3-3 overexpression is protective and 14-3-3 inhibition is detrimental against oligomeric A&beta;-induced neuronal death in primary cortical cultures. Overexpression of 14-3-3 using an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector failed to improve performance on behavioral tests, improve A&beta; pathology, or affect synaptic density in the J20 AD mouse model. Similarly, crossing a second AD mouse model, the <I>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></I> knock-in (APP KI) mouse, with 14-3-3 transgenic mice failed to rescue behavioral deficits, reduce A&beta; pathology, or impact synaptic density in the APP KI mouse model. 14-3-3 is likely partially insolubilized in the APP models, as demonstrated by proteinase K digestion. These findings do not support increasing 14-3-3 expression as a therapeutic approach for AD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Knowledge and attitudes regarding HIV/AIDS and its prevention among Ghanaian women [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: HIV/AIDS is still a major public health issue around the world, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where this has resulted in unquantifiable human suffering, social and cultural disruption, and enormous economic losses. Methods: This study aims to assess women’s knowledge and attitude toward HIV/AIDS and its prevention in Ghana. To perform an analytic cross-sectional study, this study used data (the women in reproductive age 15-49 years dataset) from the Ghana Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2017/18. Bivariate analysis was done using chi-square and predictor variables were identified using binary logistics regression. Results: This study recorded good HIV knowledge and attitude levels of 81.9% and 10.5%. Factors that predicted only good HIV knowledge levels were ethnicity, and disability status. Also, predictors of only good attitude level were type of residence and marital status. Factors implicated in the prediction of both good knowledge and attitude levels were age, educational status, region of orientation, health insurance status, economic status, and media exposure. Conclusions: This study recorded a good HIV knowledge level among the majority of the women, but recorded most respondents having a poor attitude toward HIV.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effect of non-pharmacologic strategies on prevention or management of intensive care unit delirium: a systematic review [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Post-operative delirium is a common complication among adult patients in the intensive care unit. Current literature does not support the use of pharmacologic measures to manage this condition, and several studies explore the potential for the use of non-pharmacologic methods such as early mobility plans or environmental modifications. The aim of this systematic review is to examine and report on recently available literature evaluating the relationship between non-pharmacologic management strategies and the reduction of delirium in the intensive care unit. Methods: Six major research databases were systematically searched for articles analyzing the efficacy of non-pharmacologic delirium interventions in the past five years. Search results were restricted to adult human patients aged 18 years or older in the intensive care unit setting, excluding terminally ill subjects and withdrawal-related delirium. Following title, abstract, and full text review, 27 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria and are included in this report. Results: The 27 reviewed articles consist of 12 interventions with a single-component investigational approach, and 15 with multi-component bundled protocols. Delirium incidence was the most commonly assessed outcome followed by duration. Family visitation was the most effective individual intervention while mobility interventions were the least effective. Two of the three family studies significantly reduced delirium incidence, while one in five mobility studies did the same. Multi-component bundle approaches were the most effective of all; of the reviewed studies, eight of 11 bundles significantly improved delirium incidence and seven of eight bundles decreased the duration of delirium. Conclusions: Multi-component, bundled interventions were more effective at managing intensive care unit delirium than those utilizing an approach with a single interventional element. Although better management of this condition suggests a decrease in resource burden and improvement in patient outcomes, comparative research should be performed to identify the importance of specific bundle elements.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The level of community behaviour towards hearing loss in Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hearing loss is the most common disability in the world, with a prevalence of 5% of the world's population of 466 million people. Knowledge about noise exposure and hearing protection equipment is related to hearing loss. Health is associated with a person's healthy lifestyle behaviour. This study aimed to determine the level of community behaviour towards hearing loss. Methods: This study used a descriptive analytical approach with a cross-sectional study design. The population in this study was Indonesian people who were not healthcare workers aged 17 years and over. The sample inclusion criteria included individuals who were not healthcare workers (such as doctors, nurses and midwives etc.), aged 17 years and over, and willing to participate in the study. The sampling method in this study was consecutive sampling. Results: Based on the distribution of patients, there were more female participants (1484, 61.6%) than male participants. Diploma-3 (D3) was the most common education type, with as many as 1095 people (45.4%), while the least common education type was not in school (eight, 0.3%). Most participants were in the ‘employee’ profession, namely 509 people (21.1%), while the lowest number of participants was in the Police profession (20, 0.8%). There were significant relationships between the respondent's knowledge and action about hearing loss, and the respondent’s knowledge and attitudes regarding hearing loss (p=0.000). Conclusions: There were significant relationships between the respondent's knowledge and actions about hearing loss and the respondent's knowledge and attitude, while there was no significant relationship between the respondent's attitude and actions regarding hearing loss.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">MaxHiC: A robust background correction model to identify biologically relevant chromatin interactions in Hi-C and capture Hi-C experiments</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hamid Alinejad-Rokny, Rassa Ghavami Modegh, Hamid R. Rabiee, Ehsan Ramezani Sarbandi, Narges Rezaie, Kin Tung Tam, Alistair R. R. Forrest</p>

Hi-C is a genome-wide chromosome conformation capture technology that detects interactions between pairs of genomic regions and exploits higher order chromatin structures. Conceptually Hi-C data counts interaction frequencies between every position in the genome and every other position. Biologically functional interactions are expected to occur more frequently than transient background and artefactual interactions. To identify biologically relevant interactions, several background models that take biases such as distance, GC content and mappability into account have been proposed. Here we introduce MaxHiC, a background correction tool that deals with these complex biases and robustly identifies statistically significant interactions in both Hi-C and capture Hi-C experiments. MaxHiC uses a negative binomial distribution model and a maximum likelihood technique to correct biases in both Hi-C and capture Hi-C libraries. We systematically benchmark MaxHiC against major Hi-C background correction tools including Hi-C significant interaction callers (SIC) and Hi-C loop callers using published Hi-C, capture Hi-C, and Micro-C datasets. Our results demonstrate that 1) Interacting regions identified by MaxHiC have significantly greater levels of overlap with known regulatory features (e.g. active chromatin histone marks, CTCF binding sites, DNase sensitivity) and also disease-associated genome-wide association SNPs than those identified by currently existing models, 2) the pairs of interacting regions are more likely to be linked by eQTL pairs and 3) more likely to link known regulatory features including known functional enhancer-promoter pairs validated by CRISPRi than any of the existing methods. We also demonstrate that interactions between different genomic region types have distinct distance distributions only revealed by MaxHiC. MaxHiC is publicly available as a python package for the analysis of Hi-C, capture Hi-C and Micro-C data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Evidence for influenza and RSV interaction from 10 years of enhanced surveillance in Nha Trang, Vietnam, a modelling study</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Naomi R. Waterlow, Michiko Toizumi, Edwin van Leeuwen, Hien-Anh Thi Nguyen, Lay Myint-Yoshida, Rosalind M. Eggo, Stefan Flasche</p>

Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) interact within their host posing the concern for impacts on heterologous viruses following vaccination. We aimed to estimate the population level impact of their interaction. We developed a dynamic age-stratified two-pathogen mathematical model that includes pathogen interaction through competition for infection and enhanced severity of dual infections. We used parallel tempering to fit its parameters to 11 years of enhanced hospital-based surveillance for acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) in children under 5 years old in Nha Trang, Vietnam. The data supported either a 41% (95%CrI: 36–54) reduction in susceptibility following infection and for 10.0 days (95%CrI 7.1–12.8) thereafter, or no change in susceptibility following infection. We estimate that co-infection increased the probability for an infection in <2y old children to be reported 7.2 fold (95%CrI 5.0–11.4); or 16.6 fold (95%CrI 14.5–18.4) in the moderate or low interaction scenarios. Absence of either pathogen was not to the detriment of the other. We find stronger evidence for severity enhancing than for acquisition limiting interaction. In this setting vaccination against either pathogen is unlikely to have a major detrimental effect on the burden of disease caused by the other.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A pipeline for the reconstruction and evaluation of context-specific human metabolic models at a large-scale</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vítor Vieira, Jorge Ferreira, Miguel Rocha</p>

Constraint-based (CB) metabolic models provide a mathematical framework and scaffold for <i>in silico</i> cell metabolism analysis and manipulation. In the past decade, significant efforts have been done to model human metabolism, enabled by the increased availability of multi-omics datasets and curated genome-scale reconstructions, as well as the development of several algorithms for context-specific model (CSM) reconstruction. Although CSM reconstruction has revealed insights on the deregulated metabolism of several pathologies, the process of reconstructing representative models of human tissues still lacks benchmarks and appropriate integrated software frameworks, since many tools required for this process are still disperse across various software platforms, some of which are proprietary. In this work, we address this challenge by assembling a scalable CSM reconstruction pipeline capable of integrating transcriptomics data in CB models. We combined omics preprocessing methods inspired by previous efforts with in-house implementations of existing CSM algorithms and new model refinement and validation routines, all implemented in the <i>Troppo</i> Python-based open-source framework. The pipeline was validated with multi-omics datasets from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), also including reference fluxomics measurements for the MCF7 cell line. We reconstructed over 6000 models based on the Human-GEM template model for 733 cell lines featured in the CCLE, using MCF7 models as reference to find the best parameter combinations. These reference models outperform earlier studies using the same template by comparing gene essentiality and fluxomics experiments. We also analysed the heterogeneity of breast cancer cell lines, identifying key changes in metabolism related to cancer aggressiveness. Despite the many challenges in CB modelling, we demonstrate using our pipeline that combining transcriptomics data in metabolic models can be used to investigate key metabolic shifts. Significant limitations were found on these models ability for reliable quantitative flux prediction, thus motivating further work in genome-wide phenotype prediction.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Unmet contraceptive needs and unintended pregnancies among adolescent girls amid COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa and the importance of accurate, reliable and real-time data [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has had a significant negative impact on issues such as the reproductive health of young girls. One of the consequences of the pandemic is a shortage of contraceptives and devices due to supply chain disruptions. The concern is that due to a lack of data, it is unclear how much these restrictions have impacted contraceptive use among youth from sub-Saharan Africa during COVID-19. Thousands of Kenyan schoolgirls have become pregnant due to the lockdown. It was recently reported from Gauteng, one of the South African provinces, that between April 2020 and March 2021 there were over 23,000 teenage pregnancies, with 934 girls aged 10 to 14 giving birth. This opinion piece aims to stimulate discussion on these issues while also addressing the issue of the importance of data for studying contraceptive use and teenage pregnancy in the face of hard-hit pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic in SSA.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">“Ependymal‐in” gradient of thalamic damage in progressive multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Leptomeningeal and perivenular infiltrates are important contributors to cortical grey matter damage and disease progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). While perivenular inflammation induces vasculocentric lesions, leptomeningeal involvement follows a subpial ‘surface-in’ gradient. To determine whether similar gradient of damage occurs in deep grey matter nuclei, we examined the dorsomedial thalamic nuclei and CSF samples from 41 post-mortem secondary progressive MS cases compared to 5 non-neurological controls and 12 controls with other neurological diseases. CSF/ependyma-oriented gradient of reduction in NeuN+ neuron density was present in MS thalamic lesions compared to controls, greatest (26%) in subventricular locations at the ependyma/CSF boundary and least with increasing distance (12% at 10mm). Concomitant graded reduction in SMI31+ axon density was observed, greatest (38%) at 2mm from the ependyma/CSF boundary and least at 10mm (13%). Conversely, gradient of MHC-II+ microglia density increased by over 50% at 2 mm at the ependyma/CSF boundary and only by 15% at 10mm and this gradient inversely correlated with the neuronal (R=-0.91,p&lt;0.0001) and axonal (R=-0.79,p&lt;0.0001) thalamic changes. Observed gradients were also detected in normal-appearing thalamus and were associated with: rapid/severe disease progression; presence of leptomeningeal tertiary lymphoid-like structures; large subependymal infiltrates, enriched in CD20+ B cells and occasionally containing CXCL13+CD35+ follicular dendritic cells; and high CSF protein expression of a complex pattern of soluble inflammatory/neurodegeneration factors, including chitinase-3-like-1, TNFR-1, parvalbumin, neurofilament-light-chains and TNF. Substantial “ependymal-in” gradient of pathological cell alterations, accompanied by presence of intrathecal inflammation, compartmentalized either in sub-ependymal lymphoid perivascular infiltrates or in CSF, may play a key role in MS progression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Polygenic Resilience Modulates the Penetrance of Parkinson Disease Genetic Risk Factors</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim of the current study is to understand why some individuals avoid developing Parkinson disease (PD) despite being at relatively high genetic risk, using the largest datasets of individual-level genetic data available.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We calculated polygenic risk score to identify controls and matched PD cases with the highest burden of genetic risk for PD in the discovery cohort (International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium, 7,204 PD cases and 9,412 controls) and validation cohorts (Comprehensive Unbiased Risk Factor Assessment for Genetics and Environment in Parkinson's Disease, 8,968 cases and 7,598 controls; UK Biobank, 2,639 PD cases and 14,301 controls; Accelerating Medicines Partnership–Parkinson's Disease Initiative, 2,248 cases and 2,817 controls). A genome-wide association study meta-analysis was performed on these individuals to understand genetic variation associated with resistance to disease. We further constructed a polygenic resilience score, and performed multimarker analysis of genomic annotation (MAGMA) gene-based analyses and functional enrichment analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A higher polygenic resilience score was associated with a lower risk for PD (β = −0.054, standard error [SE] = 0.022, <i>p</i> = 0.013). Although no single locus reached genome-wide significance, MAGMA gene-based analyses nominated <i>TBCA</i> as a putative gene. Furthermore, we estimated the narrow-sense heritability associated with resilience to PD (<i>h</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.081, SE = 0.035, <i>p</i> = 0.0003). Subsequent functional enrichment analysis highlighted histone methylation as a potential pathway harboring resilience alleles that could mitigate the effects of PD risk loci.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The present study represents a novel and comprehensive assessment of heritable genetic variation contributing to PD resistance. We show that a genetic resilience score can modify the penetrance of PD genetic risk factors and therefore protect individuals carrying a high-risk genetic burden from developing PD.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Metformin abrogates pathological TNF-α-producing B cells through mTOR-dependent metabolic reprogramming in polycystic ovary syndrome</a></h4>

              
                B cells contribute to the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Clinically, metformin is used to treat PCOS, but it is unclear whether metformin exerts its therapeutic effect by regulating B cells. Here, we showed that the expression level of TNF-α in peripheral blood B cells from PCOS patient was increased. Metformin used <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> was able to reduce the production of TNF-α in B cells from PCOS patient. Administration of metformin improved mouse PCOS phenotypes induced by dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and also inhibited TNF-α expression in splenic B cells. Further, metformin induced metabolic reprogramming of B cells in PCOS patients, including the alteration in mitochondrial morphology, the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS production and glucose uptake. In DHEA-induced mouse PCOS model, metformin altered metabolic intermediates in splenic B cells. Moreover, the inhibition of TNF-α expression and metabolic reprogramming in B cells of PCOS patients and mouse model by metformin were associated with decreased mTOR phosphorylation. Together, TNF-α-producing B cells are involved in the pathogenesis of PCOS, and metformin inhibits mTOR phosphorylation and affects metabolic reprogramming, thereby inhibiting TNF-α expression in B cells, which may be a new mechanism of metformin in the treatment of PCOS.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The molecular mechanism of load adaptation by branched actin networks</a></h4>

              
                Branched actin networks are self-assembling molecular motors that move biological membranes and drive many important cellular processes, including phagocytosis, endocytosis, and pseudopod protrusion. When confronted with opposing forces, the growth rate of these networks slows and their density increases, but the stoichiometry of key components does not change. The molecular mechanisms governing this force response are not well understood, so we used single-molecule imaging and AFM cantilever deflection to measure how applied forces affect each step in branched actin network assembly. Although load forces are observed to increase the density of growing filaments, we find that they actually decrease the rate of filament nucleation due to inhibitory interactions between actin filament ends and nucleation promoting factors. The force-induced increase in network density turns out to result from an exponential drop in the rate constant that governs filament capping. The force dependence of filament capping matches that of filament elongation and can be explained by expanding Brownian Ratchet theory to cover both processes. We tested a key prediction of this expanded theory by measuring the force-dependent activity of engineered capping protein variants and found that increasing the size of the capping protein increases its sensitivity to applied forces. In summary, we find that Brownian Ratchets underlie not only the ability of growing actin filaments to generate force but also the ability of branched actin networks to adapt their architecture to changing loads.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cd59 and inflammation regulate Schwann cell development</a></h4>

              
                Efficient neurotransmission is essential for organism survival and is enhanced by myelination. However, the genes that regulate myelin and myelinating glial cell development have not been fully characterized. Data from our lab and others demonstrates that <i>cd59</i>, which encodes for a small GPI-anchored glycoprotein, is highly expressed in developing zebrafish, rodent, and human oligodendrocytes (OLs) and Schwann cells (SCs), and that patients with CD59 dysfunction develop neurological dysfunction during early childhood. Yet, the function of Cd59 in the developing nervous system is currently undefined. In this study, we demonstrate that <i>cd59</i> is expressed in a subset of developing SCs. Using <i>cd59</i> mutant zebrafish, we show that developing SCs proliferate excessively and nerves may have reduced myelin volume, altered myelin ultrastructure, and perturbed node of Ranvier assembly. Finally, we demonstrate that complement activity is elevated in <i>cd59</i> mutants and that inhibiting inflammation restores SC proliferation, myelin volume, and nodes of Ranvier to wildtype levels. Together, this work identifies Cd59 and developmental inflammation as key players in myelinating glial cell development, highlighting the collaboration between glia and the innate immune system to ensure normal neural development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure-based electron-confurcation mechanism of the Ldh-EtfAB complex</a></h4>

              
                Lactate oxidation with NAD<sup>+</sup> as electron acceptor is a highly endergonic reaction. Some anaerobic bacteria overcome the energetic hurdle by flavin-based electron bifurcation/confurcation (FBEB/FBEC) using a lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh) in concert with the electron-transferring proteins EtfA and EtfB. The electron cryo-microscopically characterized (Ldh-EtfAB)<sub>2</sub> complex of <i>Acetobacterium woodii</i> at 2.43 Å resolution consists of a mobile EtfAB shuttle domain located between the rigid central Ldh and the peripheral EtfAB base units. The FADs of Ldh and the EtfAB shuttle domain contact each other thereby forming the D (dehydrogenation-connected) state. The intermediary Glu37 and Glu139 may harmonize the redox potentials between the FADs and the pyruvate/lactate pair crucial for FBEC. By integrating Alphafold2 calculations a plausible novel B (bifurcation-connected) state was obtained allowing electron transfer between the EtfAB base and shuttle FADs. Kinetic analysis of enzyme variants suggests a correlation between NAD<sup>+</sup> binding site and D-to-B-state transition implicating a 75° rotation of the EtfAB shuttle domain. The FBEC inactivity when truncating the ferredoxin domain of EtfA substantiates its role as redox relay. Lactate oxidation in Ldh is assisted by the catalytic base His423 and a metal center. On this basis, a comprehensive catalytic mechanism of the FBEC process was proposed.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Amoxicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae can be resensitized by targeting the mevalonate pathway as indicated by sCRilecs-seq</a></h4>

              
                Antibiotic resistance in the important opportunistic human pathogen <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> is on the rise. This is particularly problematic in the case of the β-lactam antibiotic amoxicillin, which is the first-line therapy. It is therefore crucial to uncover targets that would kill or resensitize amoxicillin-resistant pneumococci. To do so, we developed a genome-wide, single-cell based, gene silencing screen using CRISPR interference called sCRilecs-seq (subsets of CRISPR interference libraries extracted by fluorescence activated cell sorting coupled to next generation sequencing). Since amoxicillin affects growth and division, sCRilecs-seq was used to identify targets that are responsible for maintaining proper cell size. Our screen revealed that downregulation of the mevalonate pathway leads to extensive cell elongation. Further investigation into this phenotype indicates that it is caused by a reduced availability of cell wall precursors at the site of cell wall synthesis due to a limitation in the production of undecaprenyl phosphate (Und-P), the lipid carrier that is responsible for transporting these precursors across the cell membrane. The data suggest that, whereas peptidoglycan synthesis continues even with reduced Und-P levels, cell constriction is specifically halted. We successfully exploited this knowledge to create a combination treatment strategy where the FDA-approved drug clomiphene, an inhibitor of Und-P synthesis, is paired up with amoxicillin. Our results show that clomiphene potentiates the antimicrobial activity of amoxicillin and that combination therapy resensitizes amoxicillin-resistant <i>S. pneumoniae</i>. These findings could provide a starting point to develop a solution for the increasing amount of hard-to-treat amoxicillin-resistant pneumococcal infections.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tongue immune compartment analysis reveals spatial macrophage heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                The tongue is a unique muscular organ situated in the oral cavity where it is involved in taste sensation, mastication, and articulation. As a barrier organ, which is constantly exposed to environmental pathogens, the tongue is expected to host an immune cell network ensuring local immune defence. However, the composition and the transcriptional landscape of the tongue immune system are currently not completely defined. Here, we characterised the tissue-resident immune compartment of the murine tongue during development, health and disease, combining single-cell RNA-sequencing with in situ immunophenotyping. We identified distinct local immune cell populations and described two specific subsets of tongue-resident macrophages occupying discrete anatomical niches. <i>Cx3cr1</i><sup>+</sup> macrophages were located specifically in the highly innervated lamina propria beneath the tongue epidermis and at times in close proximity to fungiform papillae. <i>Folr2</i><sup>+</sup> macrophages were detected in deeper muscular tissue. In silico analysis indicated that the two macrophage subsets originate from a common proliferative precursor during early postnatal development and responded differently to systemic LPS in vivo. Our description of the under-investigated tongue immune system sets a starting point to facilitate research on tongue immune-physiology and pathology including cancer and taste disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Oscillatory movement of a dynein-microtubule complex crosslinked with DNA origami</a></h4>

              
                Bending of cilia and flagella occurs when axonemal dynein molecules on one side of the axoneme produce force and move toward the microtubule (MT) minus end. These dyneins are then pulled back when the axoneme bends in the other direction, meaning oscillatory back and forth movement of dynein during repetitive bending of cilia/flagella. There are various factors that may regulate the dynein activity, e.g. the nexin-dynein regulatory complex, radial spokes, and central apparatus. In order to understand the basic mechanism of dynein’s oscillatory movement, we constructed a simple model system composed of MTs, outer-arm dyneins, and crosslinks between the MTs made of DNA origami. Electron microscopy (EM) showed pairs of parallel MTs crossbridged by patches of regularly arranged dynein molecules bound in two different orientations, depending on which of the MTs their tails bind to. The oppositely oriented dyneins are expected to produce opposing forces when the pair of MTs have the same polarity. Optical trapping experiments showed that the dynein-MT-DNA-origami complex actually oscillates back and forth after photolysis of caged ATP. Intriguingly, the complex, when held at one end, showed repetitive bending motions. The results show that a simple system composed of ensembles of oppositely oriented dyneins, MTs, and inter-MT crosslinkers, without any additional regulatory structures, has an intrinsic ability to cause oscillation and repetitive bending motions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Zebrafish fin regeneration involves generic and regeneration-specific osteoblast injury responses</a></h4>

              
                Successful regeneration requires the coordinated execution of multiple cellular responses to injury. In amputated zebrafish fins, mature osteoblasts dedifferentiate, migrate towards the injury and form proliferative osteogenic blastema cells. We show that osteoblast migration is preceded by cell elongation and alignment along the proximodistal axis, which require actomyosin, but not microtubule turnover. Surprisingly, osteoblast dedifferentiation and migration can be uncoupled. Using pharmacological and genetic interventions, we found that NF-ĸB and retinoic acid signalling regulate dedifferentiation without affecting migration, while the complement system and actomyosin dynamics affect migration but not dedifferentiation. Furthermore, by removing bone at two locations within a fin ray, we established an injury model containing two injury sites. We found that osteoblasts dedifferentiate at and migrate towards both sites, while accumulation of osteogenic progenitor cells and regenerative bone formation only occur at the distal-facing injury. Together, these data indicate that osteoblast dedifferentiation and migration represent generic injury responses that are differentially regulated and can occur independently of each other and of regenerative growth. We conclude that successful fin bone regeneration appears to involve the coordinated execution of generic and regeneration-specific responses of osteoblasts to injury.

                We introduce dynamic predictive coding, a new hierarchical model of spatiotemporal prediction and sequence learning in the cortex. The model assumes that higher cortical levels modulate the temporal dynamics of lower levels, correcting their predictions of dynamics using precision-weighted prediction errors. We tested this model using a two-level neural network, where the top-down modulation is implemented as a low-dimensional mixture of possible temporal dynamics. When trained on natural videos, the first-level neurons developed space-time receptive fields similar to those found in simple cells of the primary visual cortex. The second-level responses spanned longer timescales and showed more stability than those at the first level, mimicking temporal response hierarchies in the cortex. After adapting to a repeated visual sequence, the model displayed full recall of the sequence given only the beginning of the sequence, similar to sequence recall in the visual cortex. Our results suggest that sequence learning and temporal prediction in the cortex can be interpreted as dynamic predictive coding based on a hierarchical generative model of input sequences.

                Learning, memory and cognition are thought to require forms of synaptic plasticity such as hippocampal long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD), and such plasticity can be modulated by {beta}-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol or norepinephrine. For instance, LTP versus LTD is induced by high-versus low-frequency stimulation (HFS versus LFS) but, stimulating {beta}-adrenergic receptors ({beta}ARs) enables LTP induction also by LFS. In contrast to HFS-LTP, such {beta}AR-LTP requires signaling by L-type voltage-gated Ca2+-channels, not NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs). Surprisingly, we found that {beta}AR-LTP still required a non-ionotropic NMDAR function: the stimulus-induced binding of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) that mediates CaMKII movement to excitatory synapses. In hippocampal neurons, {beta}-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol transformed LTD-type CaMKII movement to LTP-type movement, resulting in CaMKII movement to excitatory instead of inhibitory synapses. Additionally, isoproterenol enabled induction of a major cell-biological feature of LTP in response to LTD stimuli: increased SEP-GluA1 surface expression. Like for the {beta}AR-LTP in hippocampal slices, the effects of isoproterenol on CaMKII movement and SEP-GluA1 surface expression involved L-type Ca2+-channels. Taken together, these results indicate that isoproterenol transforms LTD stimuli to LTP signals by switching CaMKII movement and GluN2B binding to LTP mode.

One Sentence SummaryBuonarati et al. show that {beta}-adrenergic stimulation enables LTP induction in response to LTD stimuli by switching synaptic CaMKII movement to LTP mode.

                Regenerating functional new neurons in adult mammalian brains has been proven a difficult task for decades. Recent advancement in direct glia-to-neuron conversion in vivo opens a new field for neural regeneration and repair. However, this emerging new field is facing serious challenges from misuse of viral vectors to misinterpretation of conversion data. Here, we employ a variety of AAV vectors with different promoters and enhancers to demonstrate that astrocytes can be converted into neurons in a NeuroD1 dose-dependent manner in both wildtype (WT) and transgenic mice. Notably, astrocytes in WT mice were relatively easy to convert with higher conversion efficiency, whereas lineage-traced astrocytes in Aldh1l1-CreERT2 mice showed high resistance to reprogramming but were still converted into neurons after enhancing NeuroD1 expression with CMV enhancer. Furthermore, under two-photon microscope, we observed direct astrocyte-to-neuron conversion within 3 weeks of serial live imaging in the mouse cortex. We also demonstrated that high titre AAV reaching 1013 GC/ml caused severe neuronal leakage using a variety of AAV GFAP::GFP vectors, highlighting the necessity to inject low titre AAV into healthy brains to avoid artifactual results. Together, our studies suggest that lineage-traced astrocytes can be converted into neurons but require stronger conversion force such as enhanced NeuroD1 expression. Failure to recognize the difference between WT astrocytes and lineage-traced astrocytes in terms of conversion barrier will lead to misinterpretation of data.

                Germinal zone (GZ) exit is at the top of a cascade of events promoting the maturation of neurons and their assembly into neuronal circuits.

How newborn neurons integrate multiple cell-extrinsic niche cues with their cell-intrinsic machinery in exiting a GZ is unknown. We establish cooperation between cell polarity-regulated adhesion and Netrin-1 signaling comprises a coincidence detection circuit repelling maturing neurons from their GZ.

                Regeneration of myelin in the CNS is being pursued as a potential therapeutic approach for multiple sclerosis. Several labs have reported small molecules that promote oligodendrocyte formation and remyelination in vivo. Recently, we reported that many such molecules function by inhibiting a narrow window of enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Here we describe a new high-throughput screen of 1,836 bioactive molecules and a thorough re-analysis of more than 60 molecules previously-identified as promoting oligodendrocyte formation from human, rat, or mouse oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). These studies highlight that an overwhelming fraction of validated screening hits, including several molecules being evaluated clinically for remyelination, inhibit cholesterol pathway enzymes like EBP. To rationalize these findings, we suggest a model that relies on the high druggability of sterol-metabolizing enzymes and the ability of cationic amphiphiles to mimic the transition state of EBP. These studies further establish cholesterol pathway inhibition as a dominant mechanism among screening hits that enhance human, rat, or mouse oligodendrocyte formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Targeted cortical stimulation reveals principles of cortical contextual interactions</a></h4>

              
                Cross-orientation suppression is a classic form of contextual normalization in visual cortex, yet the degree to which cortical circuits participate in the normalization computation is unclear. We visualized orientation maps of individual ferrets, and provided patterned optogenetic stimulation to both excitatory and inhibitory cells in orientation columns that either matched or were orthogonal to the preferred visual orientation of neurons recorded with electrodes. When visual or optogenetic stimulation of columns preferring one orientation was combined with optogenetic stimulation of columns preferring the orthogonal orientation, we observed less suppression than when orthogonal stimulation was provided visually, suggesting that cortical circuits do not provide a large fraction of visual cross-orientation suppression. Integration of visual and optogenetic signals was linear when neurons exhibited low firing rates and became sublinear when neurons exhibited higher firing rates. We probed the nature of sublinearities in cortex by examining the influence of optogenetic stimulation of cortical interneurons. We observed a range of responses, including evidence for paradoxical responses in which interneuron stimulation caused a decrease in inhibitory firing rate, presumably due to the withdrawal of recurrent excitation. These results are compatible with cortical circuits that exhibit strong recurrent excitation with stabilizing inhibition that provides normalization, albeit normalization that is too weak across columns to account for cross-orientation suppression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High-resolution cross-species transcriptomic atlas of dorsal root ganglia reveals species-specific programs for sensory function</a></h4>

              
                Sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) play a crucial role in maintaining tissue homeostasis by sensing and initiating responses to stimuli. While most preclinical studies of DRGs are conducted in rodents, much less is known about the mechanisms of sensory perception in primates. We generated a transcriptome atlas of mouse, guinea pig, cynomolgus monkey, and human DRGs using a framework that implements a common laboratory workflow and multiple data-integration approaches to generate high-resolution cross-species mappings of sensory neuron subtypes. Using our atlas, we identified conserved core modules highlighting subtype-specific biological processes related to inflammatory response. We also identified divergent expression of key genes involved in DRG function, suggesting species-specific adaptations. Among these, we validated that Tafa4, a member of the druggable genome, was expressed in distinct populations of DRG neurons across species, highlighting species-specific programs that are critical for therapeutic development.

	<p>Background: With the guidance of multi-mode imaging, the time window for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) has been expanded to 24 h. However, poor clinical outcomes are still not uncommon. We aimed to develop a multi-mode imaging scale for endovascular therapy in patients with acute ischemic stroke (META) to predict the neurological outcome in patients receiving endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). Methods: We included consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients with occlusion of middle cerebral artery and/or internal carotid artery who underwent EVT. Poor outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 3&amp;amp;ndash;6 at 3 months. A five-point META score was constructed based on clot burden score, multi-segment clot, the Alberta Stroke Program early computed tomography score of cerebral blood volume (CBV-ASPECTS), and collateral status. We evaluated the META score performance using area under the curve (AUC) calculations. Results: A total of 259 patients were included. A higher META score was independently correlated with poor outcomes at 3 months (odds ratio, 1.690, 95% CI, 1.340 to 2.132, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) after adjusting for age, hypertension, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, and baseline blood glucose. Patients with a META score &amp;amp;ge; 2 were less likely to benefit from EVT (mRS 3&amp;amp;ndash;6: 60.8% vs. 29.2%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). The META score predicted poor outcomes with an AUC of 0.714, higher than the Pittsburgh Response to Endovascular therapy (PRE) score, the totaled health risks in vascular events (THRIVE) score (AUC: 0.566, 0.706), and the single imaging marker in the scale. Conclusions: The novel META score could refine the predictive accuracy of prognosis after EVT, which might provide a promising avenue for future automatic imaging analysis to help decision making.</p>

	<p>Background. Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease which affects more than 50 million patients and represents 60&amp;amp;ndash;80% of all cases of dementia. Mutations in the APP gene, mostly affecting the &amp;amp;gamma;-secretase site of cleavage and presenilin mutations, have been identified in inherited forms of AD. Methods. In the present study, we performed a meta-analysis of the transcriptional signatures that characterize two familial AD mutations (APPV7171F and PSEN1M146V) in order to characterize the common altered biomolecular pathways affected by these mutations. Next, an anti-signature perturbation analysis was performed using the AD meta-signature and the drug meta-signatures obtained from the L1000 database, using cosine similarity as distance metrics. Results. Overall, the meta-analysis identified 1479 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 684 downregulated genes, and 795 upregulated genes. Additionally, we found 14 drugs with a significant anti-similarity to the AD signature, with the top five drugs being naftifine, moricizine, ketoconazole, perindopril, and fexofenadine. Conclusions. This study aimed to integrate the transcriptional profiles associated with common familial AD mutations in neurons in order to characterize the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in AD and to find more effective drugs for AD.</p>

	<p>Early and recent studies show that dopamine through its neuronal systems and receptor subtypes plays different roles in the control of male sexual behavior. These studies show that (i) the mesolimbic/mesocortical dopaminergic system plays a key role in the preparatory phase of sexual behavior, e.g., in sexual arousal, motivation and reward, whereas the nigrostriatal system controls the sensory-motor coordination necessary for copulation, (ii) the incertohypothalamic system is involved in the consummatory aspects of sexual behavior (penile erection and copulation), but evidence for its role in sexual motivation is also available, (iii) the pro-sexual effects of dopamine occur in concert with neural systems interconnecting the hypothalamus and preoptic area with the spinal cord, ventral tegmental area and other limbic brain areas and (iv) D2 and D4 receptors play a major role in the pro-sexual effects of dopamine. Despite some controversy, increases or decreases, respectively, of brain dopamine activity induced by drugs or that occur physiologically, usually improves or worsens, respectively, sexual activity. These findings suggest that an altered central dopaminergic tone plays a role in mental pathologies characterized by aberrant sexual behavior, and that pro-erectile D4 receptor agonists may be considered a new strategy for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in men.</p>

	<p>Sleep deprivation leads to the deterioration in the physiological functioning of the brain, cognitive decline, and many neurodegenerative diseases, all of which progress with advancing age. Sleep insufficiency and impairments in cognitive function are characterized by progressive neuronal losses in the cerebral cortex. In this study, we analyze gene expression profiles following sleep-deprived murine models and circadian matched controls to identify genes that might underlie cortical homeostasis in response to sleep deprivation. Screening of the literature resulted in three murine (Mus musculus) gene expression datasets (GSE6514, GSE78215, and GSE33491) that included cortical tissue biopsies from mice that are sleep deprived for 6 h (n = 15) and from circadian controls that are left undisturbed (n = 15). Cortical differentially expressed genes are used to construct a network of encoded proteins that are ranked based on their interactome according to 11 topological algorithms. The analysis revealed three genes&amp;amp;mdash;NFKBIA, EZR, and SGK1&amp;amp;mdash;which exhibited the highest multi-algorithmic topological significance. These genes are strong markers of increased brain inflammation, cytoskeletal aberrations, and glucocorticoid resistance, changes that imply aging-like transcriptional responses during sleep deprivation in the murine cortex. Their potential role as candidate markers of local homeostatic response to sleep loss in the murine cortex warrants further experimental validation.</p>

	<p>It has been consistently demonstrated that females report greater numbers of concussions in sex-comparable sports and take longer to recover from concussive symptoms than males. However, it is unknown if the neurophysiological consequences of concussion may contribute to these sex differences in concussion symptoms and recovery. The purpose of this study was to examine potential sex-related differences in neurophysiology in healthy and concussed individuals. Twenty-one (nine F) concussed individuals (20.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.1 years; CONC) and twenty-one age-, sex-, height-, weight-, and activity-matched controls (21.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.2 years; CONT) participated in the study. The CONC group reported to the lab within 72 h, 1-week, and 2-weeks post-injury and the CONT group followed a similar measurement schedule. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and cortical silent period (CSP) duration were measured from the first dorsal interosseous muscle to assess corticospinal excitability and inhibition, respectively. There were no significant differences across time (p &amp;amp;ge; 0.13) or between the CONC and CONT group in MEP amplitude (p = 0.72) or CSP duration (p = 0.54). Overall, males (119.08 &amp;amp;plusmn; 29.91 ms) had significantly longer CSP durations compared with females (101.24 &amp;amp;plusmn; 33.43 ms), indicating greater corticospinal inhibition in males, regardless of injury status (p = 0.04). An important and novel finding of this study was the lack of differences in these neurophysiological measures between males and females following concussion. To our knowledge, this is the first study to document greater corticospinal inhibition in males compared with females.</p>

	<p>Previous research on the relationship between attention and emotion processing have focused essentially on consciously-viewed, supraliminal stimuli, while the attention-emotion interplay remains unexplored in situations where visual awareness is restricted. Here, we presented participants with face pairs in a backward masking paradigm and examined the electrophysiological activity in response to fearful and neutral expressions under different conditions of attention (spatially attended vs. unattended) and stimulus visibility (subliminal vs. supraliminal). We found an enhanced N2 (visual awareness negativity -VAN-) and an enhanced P3 for supraliminal compared to subliminal faces. The VAN, indexing the early perceptual awareness, was enhanced when the faces were spatially attended compared to when they were unattended, showing that the VAN does not require spatial attention focus but can be enhanced by it. Fearful relative to neutral expressions enhanced the early neural activity (N2) regardless of spatial attention but only in the supraliminal viewing condition. However, fear-related enhancements on later neural activity (P3) were found when stimuli were both attended and presented supraliminally. These findings suggest that visual awareness is needed for emotion processing during both early and late stages. Spatial attention is required for emotion processing at the later stage but not at the early stage.</p>

	<p>Introduction: The rise in armed conflicts has contributed to an increase in the number of asylum seekers. Prolonged asylum processes may negatively affect asylum seekers&amp;amp;rsquo; health and lead to inactivity. Studies show that physical activity interventions are associated with improvements in health outcomes. However, there are a limited number of studies investigating the associations of physical activity on asylum seekers&amp;amp;rsquo; health. Methods: Participants (263 males and 204 females), mostly from Syria, were assessed before and after a 10-week intervention for VO2 max, body mass index (BMI), skeletal muscle mass (SMM), body fat, and visceral fat. Linear mixed models were used to test differences within groups, and a linear regression model analysis was performed to test whether physiological variables predicted adherence. Results: Participants&amp;amp;rsquo; VO2 max increased: males by 2.96 mL/min/kg and females 2.57 mL/min/kg. Increased SMM percentages were seen in both genders: females by 0.38% and males 0.23%. Visceral fat area decreased: males by 0.73 cm2 and females 5.44 cm2. Conclusions: Participants showed significant increases in VO2 max and SMM and decreased visceral fat. This study provides an insight into asylum seekers&amp;amp;rsquo; health and serves as a starting point to new interventions in which physical activity is used as a tool to promote and improve vulnerable populations&amp;amp;rsquo; health.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Dendritic Compartmentalization of Learning-Related Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                <p>The dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons receive synaptic inputs from different pathways that are organized according to their laminar target. This architectural scheme provides cortical neurons with a spatial mechanism to separate information, which may support neural flexibility required during learning. Here, we investigated layer-specific plasticity of sensory encoding following learning by recording from two different dendritic compartments, tuft and basal dendrites, of layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons in the auditory cortex of mice. Following auditory fear conditioning, auditory-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were enhanced in tuft, but not basal, dendrites leading to increased somatic action potential output. This is in direct contrast to the long held (and debated) hypothesis that, despite extensive dendritic arbors, neurons function as a simple one-compartment model. Two computational models of varying complexity based on the experimental data illustrated that this learning-related increase of auditory responses in tuft dendrites can account for the changes in somatic output. Taken together, we illustrate that neurons do not function as a single compartment, and dendritic compartmentalization of learning-related plasticity may act to increase the computational power of pyramidal neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Fortuitous discovery of primary peritoneal psammocarcinoma [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Psammocarcinoma is an uncommon subtype of low-grade serous carcinoma. It is characterized by the presence of extensive psammoma bodies and can have either an ovarian or peritoneal origin. To our knowledge fewer than 30 cases of primary peritoneal psammocarcinoma (PPP) have been reported in the English literature. We report a rare case of  PPP in a 74-year-old female, discovered fortuitously within a laparotomy for gallbladder lithiasis. At laparotomy, multiple nodular implants involving the omentum, the peritoneum and a magma of intestinal loops in the right iliac fossa were noted. A biopsy from nodules was performed. Gross examination showed multiple nodules of different sizes in the fat tissue. Pathologic examination showed massive psammoma bodies representing more than 75% of the tumor. The final diagnosis was psammocarcinoma. Our patient was referred to the gynecologic department for further investigation and to ascertain whether the tumor arose from the ovaries or peritoneum. Hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy and omentectomy were performed. Macroscopic examination showed that both ovaries were intact having a normal size. No invasion of ovarian stroma was shown in microscopic examination. The patient died of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) six days after the surgery. PPP is a rare type of  low-grade serous carcinoma. The behavior of this tumor is unclear, and the treatment is not standardized because of its rarity and lack of long-term follow-up. More cases need to be studied for better understanding and improvement of the management protocols.

                Choroid plexus papilloma (CPP) is a benign but rare central nervous system (CNS) neoplasm of the choroid plexus. The onset of symptoms is usually in the first decade and may occur at birth (i.e., congenital). It accounts for 0.4–0.6% of all brain tumors. Usually seen in patients who are young children. The object of this clinical case to highlight early surgical intervention, intensive and multidisciplinary care, and pharmaceutical prescriptions can enhance the patient's condition and quality of life. We herein report a rare presentation of CPP in a 6-year-old Sudanese female child with seizures. Who suffered from obstructive hydrocephalus with lateral ventricular choroid plexus papilloma. The patient underwent resection at the age of 6 months in our center's neurosurgery department. Intensive and multidisciplinary follow-up managed to maintain positive outcome and better quality of life in a relatively benign neoplasm. In spite of a wide range of therapeutic options for the management of CPP described in the literature, studies demonstrated that patients with CPP alone and underwent a surgical procedure can live independently as adults and work full-time with uncommon recurrences.

                Genome biology shows substantial progress in its analytical and computational part in the last decades. Differential gene expression is one of many computationally intense areas; it is largely developed under R programming language. Here we explain possible reasons for such dominance of R in gene expression data. Next, we discuss the prospects for Python to become competitive in this area of research in coming years. We indicate that Python can be used already in a field of a single cell differential gene expression. We pinpoint still missing parts in Python and possibilities for improvement.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Identifying control ensembles for information processing within the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuit</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Catalina Vich, Matthew Clapp, Jonathan E. Rubin, Timothy Verstynen</p>

In situations featuring uncertainty about action-reward contingencies, mammals can flexibly adopt strategies for decision-making that are tuned in response to environmental changes. Although the cortico-basal ganglia thalamic (CBGT) network has been identified as contributing to the decision-making process, it features a complex synaptic architecture, comprised of multiple feed-forward, reciprocal, and feedback pathways, that complicate efforts to elucidate the roles of specific CBGT populations in the process by which evidence is accumulated and influences behavior. In this paper we apply a strategic sampling approach, based on Latin hypercube sampling, to explore how variations in CBGT network properties, including subpopulation firing rates and synaptic weights, map to variability of parameters in a normative drift diffusion model (DDM), representing algorithmic aspects of information processing during decision-making. Through the application of canonical correlation analysis, we find that this relationship can be characterized in terms of three low-dimensional control ensembles within the CBGT network that impact specific qualities of the emergent decision policy: responsiveness (a measure of how quickly evidence evaluation gets underway, associated with overall activity in corticothalamic and direct pathways), pliancy (a measure of the standard of evidence needed to commit to a decision, associated largely with overall activity in components of the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia), and choice (a measure of commitment toward one available option, associated with differences in direct and indirect pathways across action channels). These analyses provide mechanistic predictions about the roles of specific CBGT network elements in tuning the way that information is accumulated and translated into decision-related behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Interpretable pairwise distillations for generative protein sequence models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christoph Feinauer, Barthelemy Meynard-Piganeau, Carlo Lucibello</p>

Many different types of generative models for protein sequences have been proposed in literature. Their uses include the prediction of mutational effects, protein design and the prediction of structural properties. Neural network (NN) architectures have shown great performances, commonly attributed to the capacity to extract non-trivial higher-order interactions from the data. In this work, we analyze two different NN models and assess how close they are to simple pairwise distributions, which have been used in the past for similar problems. We present an approach for extracting pairwise models from more complex ones using an energy-based modeling framework. We show that for the tested models the extracted pairwise models can replicate the energies of the original models and are also close in performance in tasks like mutational effect prediction. In addition, we show that even simpler, factorized models often come close in performance to the original models.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Image-based parameter inference for epithelial mechanics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Goshi Ogita, Takefumi Kondo, Keisuke Ikawa, Tadashi Uemura, Shuji Ishihara, Kaoru Sugimura</p>

Measuring mechanical parameters in tissues, such as the elastic modulus of cell-cell junctions, is essential to decipher the mechanical control of morphogenesis. However, their <i>in vivo</i> measurement is technically challenging. Here, we formulated an image-based statistical approach to estimate the mechanical parameters of epithelial cells. Candidate mechanical models are constructed based on force-cell shape correlations obtained from image data. Substitution of the model functions into force-balance equations at the cell vertex leads to an equation with respect to the parameters of the model, by which one can estimate the parameter values using a least-squares method. A test using synthetic data confirmed the accuracy of parameter estimation and model selection. By applying this method to <i>Drosophila</i> epithelial tissues, we found that the magnitude and orientation of feedback between the junction tension and shrinkage, which are determined by the spring constant of the junction, were correlated with the elevation of tension and myosin-II on shrinking junctions during cell rearrangement. Further, this method clarified how alterations in tissue polarity and stretching affect the anisotropy in tension parameters. Thus, our method provides a novel approach to uncovering the mechanisms governing epithelial morphogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Epidemic management and control through risk-dependent individual contact interventions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tapio Schneider, Oliver R. A. Dunbar, Jinlong Wu, Lucas Böttcher, Dmitry Burov, Alfredo Garbuno-Inigo, Gregory L. Wagner, Sen Pei, Chiara Daraio, Raffaele Ferrari, Jeffrey Shaman</p>

Testing, contact tracing, and isolation (TTI) is an epidemic management and control approach that is difficult to implement at scale because it relies on manual tracing of contacts. Exposure notification apps have been developed to digitally scale up TTI by harnessing contact data obtained from mobile devices; however, exposure notification apps provide users only with limited binary information when they have been directly exposed to a known infection source. Here we demonstrate a scalable improvement to TTI and exposure notification apps that uses data assimilation (DA) on a contact network. Network DA exploits diverse sources of health data together with the proximity data from mobile devices that exposure notification apps rely upon. It provides users with continuously assessed individual risks of exposure and infection, which can form the basis for targeting individual contact interventions. Simulations of the early COVID-19 epidemic in New York City are used to establish proof-of-concept. In the simulations, network DA identifies up to a factor 2 more infections than contact tracing when both harness the same contact data and diagnostic test data. This remains true even when only a relatively small fraction of the population uses network DA. When a sufficiently large fraction of the population (≳ 75%) uses network DA and complies with individual contact interventions, targeting contact interventions with network DA reduces deaths by up to a factor 4 relative to TTI. Network DA can be implemented by expanding the computational backend of existing exposure notification apps, thus greatly enhancing their capabilities. Implemented at scale, it has the potential to precisely and effectively control future epidemics while minimizing economic disruption.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">LaDIVA: A neurocomputational model providing laryngeal motor control for speech acquisition and production</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hasini R. Weerathunge, Gabriel A. Alzamendi, Gabriel J. Cler, Frank H. Guenther, Cara E. Stepp, Matías Zañartu</p>

Many voice disorders are the result of intricate neural and/or biomechanical impairments that are poorly understood. The limited knowledge of their etiological and pathophysiological mechanisms hampers effective clinical management. Behavioral studies have been used concurrently with computational models to better understand typical and pathological laryngeal motor control. Thus far, however, a unified computational framework that quantitatively integrates physiologically relevant models of phonation with the neural control of speech has not been developed. Here, we introduce <i>LaDIVA</i>, a novel neurocomputational model with physiologically based laryngeal motor control. We combined the DIVA model (an established neural network model of speech motor control) with the extended body-cover model (a physics-based vocal fold model). The resulting integrated model, LaDIVA, was validated by comparing its model simulations with behavioral responses to perturbations of auditory vocal fundamental frequency (<i>f</i><sub>o</sub>) feedback in adults with typical speech. LaDIVA demonstrated capability to simulate different modes of laryngeal motor control, ranging from short-term (i.e., <i>reflexive</i>) and long-term (i.e., <i>adaptive</i>) auditory feedback paradigms, to generating prosodic contours in speech. Simulations showed that LaDIVA’s laryngeal motor control displays properties of motor equivalence, i.e., LaDIVA could robustly generate compensatory responses to reflexive vocal <i>f</i><sub>o</sub> perturbations with varying initial laryngeal muscle activation levels leading to the same output. The model can also generate prosodic contours for studying laryngeal motor control in running speech. LaDIVA can expand the understanding of the physiology of human phonation to enable, for the first time, the investigation of causal effects of neural motor control in the fine structure of the vocal signal.

Communication is a fundamental part of scientific development and methodology. With the advancement of the internet and social networks, communication has become rapid and sometimes overwhelming, especially in science. It is important to provide scientists with useful, effective, and dynamic tools to establish and build a fluid communication framework that allows for scientific advancement. Therefore, in this article, we present advice and recommendations that can help promote and improve science communication while respecting an adequate balance in the degree of commitment toward collaborative work. We have developed 10 rules shown in increasing order of commitment that are grouped into 3 key categories: (1) speak (based on active participation); (2) join (based on joining scientific groups); and (3) assess (based on the analysis and retrospective consideration of the weaknesses and strengths). We include examples and resources that provide actionable strategies for involvement and engagement with science communication, from basic steps to more advanced, introspective, and long-term commitments. Overall, we aim to help spread science from within and encourage and engage scientists to become involved in science communication effectively and dynamically.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modeling cortical synaptic effects of anesthesia and their cholinergic reversal</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bolaji P. Eniwaye, Victoria Booth, Anthony G. Hudetz, Michal Zochowski</p>

General anesthetics work through a variety of molecular mechanisms while resulting in the common end point of sedation and loss of consciousness. Generally, the administration of common anesthetics induces reduction in synaptic excitation while promoting synaptic inhibition. Exogenous modulation of the anesthetics’ synaptic effects can help determine the neuronal pathways involved in anesthesia. For example, both animal and human studies have shown that exogenously induced increases in acetylcholine in the brain can elicit wakeful-like behavior despite the continued presence of the anesthetic. However, the underlying mechanisms of anesthesia reversal at the cellular level have not been investigated. Here we apply a computational model of a network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons to simulate the network-wide effects of anesthesia, due to changes in synaptic inhibition and excitation, and their reversal by cholinergic activation through muscarinic receptors. We use a differential evolution algorithm to fit model parameters to match measures of spiking activity, neuronal connectivity, and network dynamics recorded in the visual cortex of rodents during anesthesia with desflurane <i>in vivo</i>. We find that facilitating muscarinic receptor effects of acetylcholine on top of anesthetic-induced synaptic changes predicts the reversal of anesthetic suppression of neurons’ spiking activity, functional connectivity, as well as pairwise and population interactions. Thus, our model predicts a specific neuronal mechanism for the cholinergic reversal of anesthesia consistent with experimental behavioral observations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The population genetics of the causative agent of snake fungal disease indicate recent introductions to the USA</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jason T. Ladner, Jonathan M. Palmer, Cassandra L. Ettinger, Jason E. Stajich, Terence M. Farrell, Brad M. Glorioso, Becki Lawson, Steven J. Price, Anne G. Stengle, Daniel A. Grear, Jeffrey M. Lorch</p>

Snake fungal disease (SFD; ophidiomycosis), caused by the pathogen <i>Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola</i> (<i>Oo</i>), has been documented in wild snakes in North America and Eurasia, and is considered an emerging disease in the eastern United States of America. However, a lack of historical disease data has made it challenging to determine whether <i>Oo</i> is a recent arrival to the USA or whether SFD emergence is due to other factors. Here, we examined the genomes of 82 <i>Oo</i> strains to determine the pathogen’s history in the eastern USA. <i>Oo</i> strains from the USA formed a clade (Clade II) distinct from European strains (Clade I), and molecular dating indicated that these clades diverged too recently (approximately 2,000 years ago) for transcontinental dispersal of <i>Oo</i> to have occurred via natural snake movements across Beringia. A lack of nonrecombinant intermediates between clonal lineages in Clade II indicates that <i>Oo</i> has actually been introduced multiple times to North America from an unsampled source population, and molecular dating indicates that several of these introductions occurred within the last few hundred years. Molecular dating also indicated that the most common Clade II clonal lineages have expanded recently in the USA, with time of most recent common ancestor mean estimates ranging from 1985 to 2007 CE. The presence of Clade II in captive snakes worldwide demonstrates a potential mechanism of introduction and highlights that additional incursions are likely unless action is taken to reduce the risk of pathogen translocation and spillover into wild snake populations.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Debate continues regarding the possible role of the hippocampus across short-term and working memory tasks. The current study examined the possibility of a hippocampal contribution to precise, high-resolution cognition and conjunctive memory. We administered visual working memory tasks featuring a continuous response component to a well-established developmental amnesic patient with relatively selective bilateral hippocampal damage (Jon) and healthy controls. The patient was able to produce highly accurate response judgments regarding conjunctions of color and orientation or color and location, using simultaneous or sequential presentation of stimuli, with no evidence of any impairment in working memory binding, categorical accuracy, or continuous precision. These findings indicate that hippocampal damage does not necessarily lead to deficits in high-resolution cognitive performance, even when the damage is severe and bilateral.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Current views of community and hospital pharmacists on pharmaceutical care services in the United Arab Emirates: A mixed methodological study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The profession of pharmacy has evolved significantly in recent years in terms of professional service delivery. The aim of this study was to explore the current views of pharmacists in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on pharmaceutical care services and the nature of barriers encountered in practice using qualitative and quantitative assessment methods. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among hospital and community pharmacists (n = 305) between March and May 2021, using qualitative and quantitative assessment methods. In the qualitative phase, 15 interviews were conducted to explore five main criteria: patient information, inadequate patient counseling, prescribing errors prevention and identifying drug-related problems, lack of participation in health awareness programs, and barriers to pharmaceutical care implementation. In the quantitative phase, 305 consenting pharmacists completed a questionnaire on seven criteria: demographic profile, pharmacist-physician interaction, patient counseling assessment, patient reports of adverse drug events, pharmacist participation in health awareness programs, perceptions of reducing prescribing errors and identifying drug-related problems, and barriers to appropriate pharmaceutical care implementation. Results: The results of both the qualitative and quantitative phases of the study revealed that pharmacists' influence on practice in the UAE is limited due to many factors, mainly lack of time and patients' ignorance of the pharmacist's role in the medical field. The mean responses regarding pharmacists' approach to patient counseling and patients' knowledge of pharmacists' role in managing adverse drug reactions were 77.1% and 59.7%, respectively. Active participation in health awareness programs was 64.8%. The mean positive response of participants in reducing prescribing errors and recognizing drug-related problems was 9.2%. Pharmacists' age and number of years in practice were the most important factors influencing the pharmaceutical care services implementation. Conclusion: The study has shown the need to shed light on the proper implementation of pharmaceutical care while maintaining a trusting relationship with physicians.

                The position weight matrix, also called the position-specific scoring matrix, is the commonly accepted model to quantify the specificity of transcription factor binding to DNA. Position weight matrices are used in thousands of projects and software tools in regulatory genomics, including computational prediction of the regulatory impact of single-nucleotide variants. Yet, recently Yan et al. reported that "the position weight matrices of most transcription factors lack sufficient predictive power" if applied to the analysis of regulatory variants studied with a newly developed experimental method, SNP-SELEX. Here, we re-analyze the rich experimental dataset obtained by Yan et al. and show that appropriately selected position weight matrices in fact can adequately quantify transcription factor binding to alternative alleles.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Associations of vascular risk and amyloid burden with subsequent dementia</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Midlife vascular risk factors (MVRF) are associated with incident dementia, as are amyloid β(Aβ) deposition and neurodegeneration. Whether vascular and Alzheimer Disease (AD)-associated factors contribute to dementia independently or interact synergistically to reduce cognition is poorly understood.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC)-PET study were followed from 1987-89(45-64 yo) through 2016-17(74-94 yo), with repeat cognitive assessment and dementia adjudication. In 2011-13, dementia-free participants underwent brain MRI (with white matter hyperintensity (WMH) and brain volume measurement) and florbetapir (Aβ) PET. The relative contributions of vascular risk and injury (MVRF, WMH volume), elevated Aβ standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), and neurodegeneration (smaller temporo-parietal brain regions) to incident dementia were evaluated with adjusted Cox models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In 298 individuals, 36 developed dementia (median follow-up 4.9 years). Midlife hypertension and Aβ each independently predicted dementia risk (hypertension:HR 2.57 (95% CI 1.16-5.67); Aβ SUVR(per SD):HR 2.57 (1.72-3.84)), but didn’t interact significantly, whereas <i>late-life</i> diabetes (HR 2.50 (1.18 to 5.28)) and Aβ independently predicted dementia risk. WMH(per SD):HR 1.51 (1.03-2.20) and Aβ SUVR (HR 2.52 (1.83-3.47)) independently contributed to incident dementia but WMH lost significance when MVRF were included. Smaller temporo-parietal brain regions were associated with incident dementia, independent of Aβ and MVRF (HR 2.18 (1.18-4.01)).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Midlife hypertension and late-life Aβ are independently associated with dementia risk, without evidence for synergy on a multiplicative scale. Given the independent contributions of vascular and amyloid mechanisms, multiple pathways should be considered when evaluating interventions to reduce the burden of dementia.</p>

                <p>Nature Neuroscience, Published online: 23 June 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01112-7">doi:10.1038/s41593-022-01112-7</a></p>Epilepsy is the most common childhood neurological disease, and nearly 20% of affected children develop drug-resistant childhood epilepsy (DRCE). Using single-cell analysis methods, Kumar et al. have identified pro-inflammatory interactions between microglia and T cells in brain tissue from individuals with DRCE. This work may help to identify therapeutic targets for DRCE.

These microbial rhodopsin channels, named kalium channelrhodopsins, enable robust inhibition of mouse cortical neurons with millisecond precision. In addition, kalium channelrhodopsins reveal a previously unknown potassium selectivity mechanism.

                Homeostatic and circadian processes collaborate to appropriately time and consolidate sleep and wake. To understand how these processes are integrated, we scheduled brief sleep deprivation at different times of day in <i>Drosophila</i> and find elevated morning rebound compared to evening. These effects depend on discrete morning and evening clock neurons, independent of their roles in circadian locomotor activity. In the R5 ellipsoid body sleep homeostat, we identified elevated morning expression of activity dependent and presynaptic gene expression as well as the presynaptic protein BRUCHPILOT consistent with regulation by clock circuits. These neurons also display elevated calcium levels in response to sleep loss in the morning, but not the evening consistent with the observed time-dependent sleep rebound. These studies reveal the circuit and molecular mechanisms by which discrete circadian clock neurons program a homeostatic sleep center.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Integrating multi-omics data reveals function and therapeutic potential of deubiquitinating enzymes</a></h4>

              
                Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), ~100 of which are found in human cells, are proteases that remove ubiquitin conjugates from proteins, thereby regulating protein turnover. They are involved in a wide range of cellular activities and are emerging therapeutic targets for cancer and other diseases. Drugs targeting USP1 and USP30 are in clinical development for cancer and kidney disease respectively. However, the majority of substrates and pathways regulated by DUBs remain unknown, impeding efforts to prioritize specific enzymes for research and drug development. To assemble a knowledgebase of DUB activities, co-dependent genes, and substrates, we combined targeted experiments using CRISPR libraries and inhibitors with systematic mining of functional genomic databases. Analysis of the Dependency Map, Connectivity Map, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, and multiple protein-protein interaction databases yielded specific hypotheses about DUB function, a subset of which were confirmed in follow-on experiments. The data in this paper are browsable online in a newly developed <a href="https://labsyspharm.github.io/dubportal/">DUB Portal</a> and promise to improve understanding of DUBs as a family as well as the activities of incompletely characterized DUBs (e.g. USPL1 and USP32) and those already targeted with investigational cancer therapeutics (e.g. USP14, UCHL5, and USP7).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Recurrent neural networks enable design of multifunctional synthetic human gut microbiome dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Predicting the dynamics and functions of microbiomes constructed from the bottom-up is a key challenge in exploiting them to our benefit. Current models based on ecological theory fail to capture complex community behaviors due to higher order interactions, do not scale well with increasing complexity and in considering multiple functions. We develop and apply a long short-term memory (LSTM) framework to advance our understanding of community assembly and health-relevant metabolite production using a synthetic human gut community. A mainstay of recurrent neural networks, the LSTM learns a high dimensional data-driven non-linear dynamical system model. We show that the LSTM model can outperform the widely used generalized Lotka-Volterra model based on ecological theory. We build methods to decipher microbe-microbe and microbe-metabolite interactions from an otherwise black-box model. These methods highlight that Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria are significant drivers of metabolite production whereas <i>Bacteroides</i> shape community dynamics. We use the LSTM model to navigate a large multidimensional functional landscape to design communities with unique health-relevant metabolite profiles and temporal behaviors. In sum, the accuracy of the LSTM model can be exploited for experimental planning and to guide the design of synthetic microbiomes with target dynamic functions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Filamentation modulates allosteric regulation of PRPS</a></h4>

              
                Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, histidine, tryptophan, and cofactors NAD and NADP. Abnormal regulation of PRPP synthase (PRPS) is associated with human disorders, including Arts syndrome, retinal dystrophy, and gouty arthritis. Recent studies have demonstrated that PRPS can form filamentous cytoophidia in eukaryotes. Here, we show that PRPS forms cytoophidia in prokaryotes both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we solve two distinct filament structures of <i>E. coli</i> PRPS at near-atomic resolution using Cryo-EM. The formation of the two types of filaments is controlled by the binding of different ligands. One filament type is resistant to allosteric inhibition. The structural comparison reveals conformational changes of a regulatory flexible loop, which may regulate the binding of the allosteric inhibitor and the substrate ATP. A noncanonical allosteric AMP/ADP binding site is identified to stabilize the conformation of the regulatory flexible loop. Our findings not only explore a new mechanism of PRPS regulation with structural basis, but also propose an additional layer of cell metabolism through PRPS filamentation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Host Chitinase 3-like-1 is a universal therapeutic target for SARS-CoV-2 viral variants in COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                COVID-19 is the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2; SC2) which has caused a world-wide pandemic with striking morbidity and mortality. Evaluation of SC2 strains demonstrated impressive genetic variability and many of these viral variants are now defined as variants of concern (VOC) that cause enhanced transmissibility, decreased susceptibility to antibody neutralization or therapeutics and or the ability to induce severe disease. Currently, the delta (d) and omicron (o) variants are particularly problematic based on their impressive and unprecedented transmissibility and ability to cause break through infections. The delta variant also accumulates at high concentrations in host tissues and has caused waves of lethal disease. Because studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that chitinase 3-like-1 (CHI3L1) stimulates ACE2 and Spike (S) priming proteases that mediate SC2 infection, studies were undertaken to determine if interventions that target CHI3L1 are effective inhibitors of SC2 viral variant infection. Here we demonstrate that CHI3L1 augments epithelial cell infection by pseudoviruses that express the alpha, beta, gamma, delta or omicron S proteins and that the CHI3L1 inhibitors anti-CHI3L1 and kasugamycin inhibit epithelial cell infection by these VOC pseudovirus moieties. Thus, CHI3L1 is a universal, VOC-independent therapeutic target in COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The orphan ligand, activin C, signals through activin receptor-like kinase 7</a></h4>

              
                Activin ligands are formed from two disulfide-linked inhibin β (Inhβ) subunit chains. They exist as homodimeric proteins, as in the case of activin A (ActA; InhβA/InhβA) or activin C (ActC; InhβC/InhβC), or as heterodimers, as with activin AC (ActAC; InhβA:InhβC). While the biological functions of ActA and activin B (ActB) have been well characterized, little is known about the biological functions of ActC or ActAC. One thought is that the InhβC chain functions to interfere with ActA production by forming less active ActAC heterodimers. Here, we assessed and characterized the signaling capacity of ligands containing the InhβC chain. ActC and ActAC activated SMAD2/3-dependent signaling via the type I receptor, activin receptor-like kinase 7 (ALK7). Relative to ActA and ActB, ActC exhibited lower affinity for the cognate activin type II receptors and was resistant to neutralization by the extracellular antagonist, follistatin. In mature murine adipocytes, which exhibit high ALK7 expression, ActC elicited a SMAD2/3 response similar to ActB, which can also signal via ALK7. Collectively, these results establish that ActC and ActAC are active ligands that exhibit a distinct signaling receptor and antagonist profile compared to other activins.

                Auxin-inducible degrons are a chemical genetic tool for targeted protein degradation and are widely used to study protein function in cultured mammalian cells. Here we develop CRISPR-engineered mouse lines that enable rapid and highly specific degradation of tagged endogenous proteins <i>in vivo</i>. Most but not all cell types are competent for degradation. By combining ligand titrations with genetic crosses to generate animals with different allelic combinations, we show that degradation kinetics depend upon the dose of the tagged protein, ligand, and the E3 ligase substrate receptor TIR1. Rapid degradation of condensin I and condensin II - two essential regulators of mitotic chromosome structure - revealed that both complexes are individually required for cell division in precursor lymphocytes, but not in their differentiated peripheral lymphocyte derivatives. This generalisable approach provides unprecedented temporal control over the dose of endogenous proteins in mouse models, with implications for studying essential biological pathways and modelling drug activity in mammalian tissues.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cognitive experience alters cortical involvement in goal-directed navigation</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity in the mammalian cortex has been studied extensively during decision tasks, and recent work aims to identify under what conditions cortex is actually necessary for these tasks. We discovered that mice with distinct cognitive experiences, beyond sensory and motor learning, use different cortical areas and neural activity patterns to solve the same navigation decision task, revealing past learning as a critical determinant of whether cortex is necessary for goal-directed navigation. We used optogenetics and calcium imaging to study the necessity and neural activity of multiple cortical areas in mice with different training histories. Posterior parietal cortex and retrosplenial cortex were mostly dispensable for accurate performance of a simple navigation task. In contrast, these areas were essential for the same simple task when mice were previously trained on complex tasks with delay periods or association switches. Multi-area calcium imaging showed that, in mice with complex-task experience, single-neuron activity had higher selectivity and neuron-neuron correlations were weaker, leading to codes with higher task information. Therefore, past experience is a key factor in determining whether cortical areas have a causal role in goal-directed navigation.

                The distribution of brain aerobic glycolysis (AG) in normal young adults correlates spatially with amyloid-beta (A{beta}) deposition in individuals with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and asymptomatic individuals with brain amyloid deposition. Brain AG decreases with age but the functional significance of this decrease with regard to the development of DAT symptomatology is poorly understood. Using PET measurements of regional blood flow, oxygen consumption and glucose utilization--from which we derive AG--we find that cognitive impairment is strongly associated with loss of the typical youthful pattern of AG. In contrast, amyloid positivity without cognitive impairment was associated with preservation of youthful brain AG, which was even higher than that seen in typical, cognitively unimpaired, amyloid negative adults. Similar findings were not seen for blood flow nor oxygen consumption. Finally, in cognitively unimpaired adults, white matter hyperintensity burden was found to be specifically associated with decreased youthful brain AG. Our results implicate preserved AG as a factor in brain resilience to amyloid pathology and suggest that white matter disease may be a cause and/or consequence of this impaired resilience.

                Maintaining balance typically occurs sub-consciously. Occasionally, however, individuals will direct conscious attention towards balance, e.g., in response to a postural threat. Such conscious movement processing (CMP) increases the reliance on attentional resources and may disrupt control of balance, but the underlying changes in neuromuscular control remain poorly understood. We investigated the effects of CMP (manipulated using verbal instructions) on neural control of posture in twenty-five adults (11 females, mean age = 23.9, range = 18-33). Participants performed 90-second, narrow-stance balance trials in high-and low-CMP conditions, and in stable (solid surface) and unstable (foam) task conditions. Postural sway amplitude, frequency and complexity were used to assess postural control. Surface EMG was recorded bilaterally from lower leg muscles (Soleus, Tibialis Anterior, Gastrocnemius Medialis, Peroneus Longus) and intermuscular coherence (IMC) was assessed for 12 muscle pairs across four frequency bands. We found significantly increased sway amplitude, and decreased sway frequency and complexity in the high-compared to the low-CMP condition. All sway variables (frequency, amplitude and complexity) increased in the unstable compared to the stable condition. Results suggested reduced beta band IMC between several muscles pairs during high-compared to low-CMP, but these findings did not remain significant after controlling for multiple comparisons. Finally, IMC significantly increased in the unstable conditions for most muscle combinations and frequency bands. In all, results tentatively suggest that CMP-induced changes in sway outcomes may be underpinned by reduced beta-band IMC, but these findings need to be replicated before they can be interpreted more conclusively.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Why is human vision so poor in early development? The impact of initial sensitivity to low spatial frequencies on visual category learning</a></h4>

              
                Humans are born with very low contrast sensitivity, meaning that developing infants experience the world "in a blur". Is this solely a byproduct of maturational processes or is there some functional advantage for beginning life with poor vision? We explore whether reduced visual acuity as a consequence of low contrast sensitivity facilitates the acquisition of basic-level visual categories and, if so, whether this advantage also enhances subordinate-level category learning as visual acuity improves. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the ecoset dataset to simulate basic-level category learning, we manipulated model training curricula along three dimensions: presence of blurred inputs early in training, rate of blur removal over time, and grayscale versus color inputs. We found that a training regimen where blur starts high and is gradually reduced over time - as in human development - improves basic-level categorization performance relative to a regimen in which non-blurred inputs are used throughout. However, this pattern was observed only when grayscale images were used (analogous to the low sensitivity to color infants experience during early development). Importantly, the observed improvements in basic-level performance generalized to subordinate-level categorization as well: when models were fine-tuned on a dataset including subordinate-level categories (ImageNet), we found that models initially trained with blurred inputs showed a greater performance benefit than models trained solely on non-blurred inputs. Consistent with several other recent studies, we conclude that poor visual acuity in human newborns confers multiple advantages, including, as demonstrated here, more rapid and accurate acquisition of visual object categories at multiple hierarchical levels.

Author SummaryWhy do humans start life with extremely poor vision? The common evolutionary story is that head size is small to accommodate the development of human-level intelligence. However, there is growing evidence that beginning life in a premature state confers short-term advantages. The "starting small" principle states that learning can be facilitated by restricted or impoverished inputs that reduce the learning complexity. We suggest that blurred vision during early development biases learning toward shape features, which organize objects naturally into "basic-level" categories that are the foundation of human cognition (e.g., birds, cars, etc.). Such categories are defined by their visual similarity in global object shape. Since blurring restricts visual inputs to emphasize shape information, it should enhance the learning of basic-level categories. We trained artificial neural-network models on basic-level categorization using either blurred or non-blurred color or grayscale images and found that models trained with blurred images outperformed models trained with non-blurred images, but only for grayscale. These same models performed better in subsequent "subordinate-level" tasks that required discriminating between objects within a basic-level category. Our simulations provide evidence that initially poor vision in infants has an important functional role in organizing knowledge about complex environments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Navigation task and action space drive the emergence of egocentric and allocentric spatial representations</a></h4>

              
                In general, strategies for spatial navigation could employ one of two spatial reference frames: egocentric or allocentric. Notwithstanding intuitive explanations, it remains unclear however under what circumstances one strategy is chosen over another, and how neural representations should be related to the chosen strategy. Here, we first use a deep reinforcement learning model to investigate whether a particular type of navigation strategy arises spontaneously during spatial learning without imposing a bias onto the model. We then examine the spatial representations that emerge in the network to support navigation. To this end, we study two tasks that are ethologically valid for mammals - guidance, where the agent has to navigate to a goal location fixed in allocentric space, and aiming, where the agent navigates to a visible cue. We find that when both navigation strategies are available to the agent, the solutions it develops for guidance and aiming are heavily biased towards the allocentric or the egocentric strategy, respectively, as one might expect. Nevertheless, the agent can learn both tasks using either type of strategy. Furthermore, we find that place-cell-like allocentric representations emerge preferentially in guidance when using an allocentric strategy, whereas egocentric vector representations emerge when using an egocentric strategy in aiming. We thus find that alongside the type of navigational strategy, the nature of the task plays a pivotal role in the type of spatial representations that emerge.

	<p>&amp;amp;Delta;9-Tetrahydrocannabinol is the main psychoactive component of cannabis and cannabidiol is purportedly responsible for many of the medicinal benefits. The effects of &amp;amp;Delta;9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol in younger populations have been well studied; however, motor function, cognitive function, and cerebral glucose metabolism in older adults have not been extensively researched. The purpose of this study was to assess differences in cognitive function, motor function, and cerebral glucose metabolism (assessed via [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) in older adults chronically using &amp;amp;Delta;9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, and non-using controls. Eight &amp;amp;Delta;9-tetrahydrocannabinol users (59.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.7 years), five cannabidiol users (54.6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.1 years), and 16 non-users (58.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 16.9 years) participated. Subjects underwent resting scans and performed cognitive testing (reaction time, Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test), motor testing (hand/arm function, gait), and balance testing. &amp;amp;Delta;9-tetrahydrocannabinol users performed worse than both cannabidiol users and non-users on the Flanker Test but were similar on all other cognitive and motor tasks. &amp;amp;Delta;9-tetrahydrocannabinol users also had lower global metabolism and relative hypermetabolism in the bilateral amygdala, cerebellum, and brainstem. Chronic use of &amp;amp;Delta;9-tetrahydrocannabinol in older adults might negatively influence inhibitory control and alter brain activity. Future longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes investigating multiple &amp;amp;Delta;9-tetrahydrocannabinol:cannabidiol ratios on functional outcomes and cerebral glucose metabolism in older adults are necessary.</p>

	<p>Silent speech decoding (SSD), based on articulatory neuromuscular activities, has become a prevalent task of brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interfaces (BCIs) in recent years. Many works have been devoted to decoding surface electromyography (sEMG) from articulatory neuromuscular activities. However, restoring silent speech in tonal languages such as Mandarin Chinese is still difficult. This paper proposes an optimized sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) approach to synthesize voice from the sEMG-based silent speech. We extract duration information to regulate the sEMG-based silent speech using the audio length. Then, we provide a deep-learning model with an encoder&amp;amp;ndash;decoder structure and a state-of-the-art vocoder to generate the audio waveform. Experiments based on six Mandarin Chinese speakers demonstrate that the proposed model can successfully decode silent speech in Mandarin Chinese and achieve a character error rate (CER) of 6.41% on average with human evaluation.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>As Huntington&rsquo;s disease (HD) progresses, there is a significant loss of neurons in the striatum in addition to a distinct thinning of the cerebral cortex. Despite an early presence of sensorimotor deficits in patients with HD, electrophysiological studies designed to assess the integrity of thalamocortical circuits are sparse. Using the R6/2 mouse model of HD, we provide evidence of reduced connectivity between thalamic cells and their targeted cortical regions. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings from ventral anterolateral nucleus (VAL; motor) and ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM; somatosensory) thalamic neurons in <I>ex vivo</I> brain slices of R6/2 and wild-type (WT) mice revealed that cells in both thalamic nuclei of R6/2 mice exhibited significant differences in passive and active cell membrane properties (smaller cell membrane capacitances, faster decay time constants and increased input resistances) compared with WT cells. Although only cells in the VPM of symptomatic R6/2 mice had more depolarized resting membrane potentials compared with WTs, cells in both nuclei displayed increased excitability in symptomatic, but not presymptomatic, R6/2 mice. Optical activation of VAL and VPM terminals elicited smaller magnitude current responses in cortical pyramidal neurons (CPNs) in both motor cortex (M1CTX) and somatosensory barrel cortex (BCTX) of symptomatic R6/2 mice compared with CPNs in WT mice. Furthermore, we observed a decrease in the frequency of thalamocortical excitatory quantal events in R6/2 BCTX CPNs, with no genotype-dependent differences in AMPA:NMDA response amplitude ratios. These data suggest there is a decrease in the transmission of thalamocortical information that is likely because of impaired neurotransmitter release.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Attention Cueing in Rivalry: Insights from Pupillometry</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>We used pupillometry to evaluate the effects of attention cueing on perceptual bi-stability, as reported by adult human observers. Perceptual alternations and pupil diameter were measured during two forms of rivalry, generated by presenting a white and a black disk to the two eyes (binocular rivalry) or splitting the disks between eyes (interocular grouping rivalry). In line with previous studies, we found that subtle pupil size modulations (~0.05 mm) tracked alternations between exclusive dominance phases of the black or white disk. These pupil responses were larger for perceptually stronger stimuli: presented to the dominant eye or with physically higher luminance contrast. However, cueing of endogenous attention to one of the rivaling percepts did not affect pupil modulations during exclusive dominance phases. This was observed despite the reliable effects of endogenous attention on perceptual dominance, which shifted in favor of the cued percept by ~10%. The results were comparable for binocular and interocular grouping rivalry. Cueing only had a marginal modulatory effect on pupil size during mixed percepts in binocular rivalry. This may suggest that, rather than acting by modulating perceptual strength, endogenous attention primarily acts during periods of unresolved competition, which is compatible with attention being automatically directed to the rivaling stimuli during periods of exclusive dominance and thereby sustaining perceptual alternations.</p>

                <p>Synaptic abnormality is an important pathologic feature of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and responsible for various behavioral defects in these neurodevelopmental disorders. Microglia are the major immune cells in the brain and also play an important role in synapse refinement. Although dysregulated synaptic pruning by microglia during the brain development has been associated with ASDs, the underlying mechanism has yet to be fully elucidated. Herein, we observed that expression of Transmembrane protein 59 (TMEM59), a protein recently shown to regulate microglial function, was decreased in autistic patients. Furthermore, we found that both male and female mice with either complete or microglia-specific loss of <I>Tmem59</I> developed ASD-like behaviors. Microglial TMEM59-deficient mice also exhibited enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission, increased dendritic spine density, and elevated levels of excitatory synaptic proteins in synaptosomes. TMEM59-deficient microglia had impaired capacity for synapse engulfment both <I>in vivo</I> and <I>in vitro.</I> Moreover, we demonstrated that TMEM59 interacted with the C1q receptor CD93 and TMEM59 deficiency promoted CD93 protein degradation in microglia. Downregulation of CD93 in microglia also impaired synapse engulfment. These findings identify a crucial role of TMEM59 in modulating microglial function on synapse refinement during brain development and suggest that TMEM59 deficiency may contribute to ASDs through disrupting phagocytosis of excitatory synapse and thus distorting the excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) neuronal activity balance.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Microglia play an important role in synapse refinement. Dysregulated synaptic pruning by microglia during brain development has been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). However, the underlying mechanism has yet to be fully elucidated. Herein, we observe that the expression of Transmembrane protein 59 (TMEM59), an autophagy-related protein, is decreased in autistic patients. Moreover, we find ASD-like behaviors in mice with complete loss and with microglia-specific loss of <I>Tmem59</I>. Mechanistic studies reveal that TMEM59 deficiency in microglia impairs their synapse engulfment ability likely through destabilizing the C1q receptor CD93, thereby leading to enhanced excitatory neurotransmission and increased dendritic spine density. Our findings demonstrate a crucial role of microglial TMEM59 in early neuronal development and provide new insight into the etiology of ASDs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Role of Voltage-Gated K+ Channels and K2P Channels in Intrinsic Electrophysiological Properties and Saltatory Conduction at Nodes of Ranvier of Rat Lumbar Spinal Ventral Nerves</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ion channels at the nodes of Ranvier (NRs) are believed to play essential roles in intrinsic electrophysiological properties and saltatory conduction of action potentials (AP) at the NRs of myelinated nerves. While we have recently shown that two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channels play a key role at the NRs of A&beta;-afferent nerves, K<sup>+</sup> channels and their functions at the NRs of mammalian motor nerves remain elusive. Here we addressed this issue by using <I>ex vivo</I> preparations of lumbar spinal ventral nerves from both male and female rats and the pressure-patch-clamp recordings at their NRs. We found that depolarizing voltages evoked large noninactivating outward currents at NRs. The outward currents could be partially inhibited by voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel blockers, largely inhibited by K2P blockers and cooling temperatures. Inhibition of the outward currents by voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel blockers, K2P blockers, or cooling temperatures significantly altered electrophysiological properties measured at the NRs, including resting membrane potential, input resistance, AP width, AP amplitude, AP threshold, and AP rheobase. Furthermore, K2P blockers and cooling temperatures significantly reduced saltatory conduction velocity and success rates of APs in response to high-frequency stimulation. Voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel blockers reduced AP success rates at high-frequency stimulation without significantly affecting saltatory conduction velocity. Collectively, both K2P and voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels play significant roles in intrinsic electrophysiological properties and saltatory conduction at NRs of motor nerve fibers of rats. The effects of cooling temperatures on saltatory conduction are at least partially mediated by K2P channels at the NRs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Ion channels localized at the NRs are believed to be key determinants of saltatory conduction on myelinated nerves. However, ion channels and their functions at the NRs have not been fully studied in different types of mammalian myelinated nerves. Here we use the pressure-patch-clamp recordings to show that both K2P and voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels play significant roles in intrinsic electrophysiological properties and saltatory conduction at NRs of lumbar spinal ventral nerves of rats. Furthermore, cooling temperatures exert effects on saltatory conduction via inhibition of ion channels at the NRs. Our results provide new insights into saltatory conduction on myelinated nerves and may have physiological as well as pathologic implications.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Understanding the Influence of Target Acquisition on Survival, Integration, and Phenotypic Maturation of Dopamine Neurons within Stem Cell-Derived Neural Grafts in a Parkinson's Disease Model</a></h4>

              
                <p>Midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons include many subtypes characterized by their location, connectivity and function. Surprisingly, mechanisms underpinning the specification of A9 neurons [responsible for motor function, including within ventral midbrain (VM) grafts for treating Parkinson's disease (PD)] over adjacent A10, remains largely speculated. We assessed the impact of synaptic targeting on survival, integration, and phenotype acquisition of dopaminergic neurons within VM grafts generated from fetal tissue or human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). VM progenitors were grafted into female mice with 6OHDA-lesions of host midbrain dopamine neurons, with some animals also receiving intrastriatal quinolinic acid (QA) injections to ablate medium spiny neurons (MSN), the A9 neuron primary target. While loss of MSNs variably affected graft survival, it significantly reduced striatal yet increased cortical innervation. Consequently, grafts showed reduced A9 and increased A10 specification, with more DA neurons failing to mature into either subtype. These findings highlight the importance of target acquisition on DA subtype specification during development and repair.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Parish and colleagues highlight, in a rodent model of Parkinson's disease (PD), the importance of synaptic target acquisition in the survival, integration and phenotypic specification of grafted dopamine neurons derived from fetal tissue and human stem cells. Ablation of host striatal neurons resulted in reduced dopamine neuron survival within grafts, re-routing of dopamine fibers from striatal to alternate cortical targets and a consequential reduced specification of A9 dopamine neurons (the subpopulation critical for restoration of motor function) and increase in A10 DA neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Learned Motor Patterns Are Replayed in Human Motor Cortex during Sleep</a></h4>

              
                <p>Consolidation of memory is believed to involve offline replay of neural activity. While amply demonstrated in rodents, evidence for replay in humans, particularly regarding motor memory, is less compelling. To determine whether replay occurs after motor learning, we sought to record from motor cortex during a novel motor task and subsequent overnight sleep. A 36-year-old man with tetraplegia secondary to cervical spinal cord injury enrolled in the ongoing BrainGate brain&ndash;computer interface pilot clinical trial had two 96-channel intracortical microelectrode arrays placed chronically into left precentral gyrus. Single- and multi-unit activity was recorded while he played a color/sound sequence matching memory game. Intended movements were decoded from motor cortical neuronal activity by a real-time steady-state Kalman filter that allowed the participant to control a neurally driven cursor on the screen. Intracortical neural activity from precentral gyrus and 2-lead scalp EEG were recorded overnight as he slept. When decoded using the same steady-state Kalman filter parameters, intracortical neural signals recorded overnight replayed the target sequence from the memory game at intervals throughout at a frequency significantly greater than expected by chance. Replay events occurred at speeds ranging from 1 to 4 times as fast as initial task execution and were most frequently observed during slow-wave sleep. These results demonstrate that recent visuomotor skill acquisition in humans may be accompanied by replay of the corresponding motor cortex neural activity during sleep.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Within cortex, the acquisition of information is often followed by the offline recapitulation of specific sequences of neural firing. Replay of recent activity is enriched during sleep and may support the consolidation of learning and memory. Using an intracortical brain&ndash;computer interface, we recorded and decoded activity from motor cortex as a human research participant performed a novel motor task. By decoding neural activity throughout subsequent sleep, we find that neural sequences underlying the recently practiced motor task are repeated throughout the night, providing direct evidence of replay in human motor cortex during sleep. This approach, using an optimized brain&ndash;computer interface decoder to characterize neural activity during sleep, provides a framework for future studies exploring replay, learning, and memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Whole-Brain Wiring Diagram of Oxytocin System in Adult Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Oxytocin (Oxt) neurons regulate diverse physiological responses via direct connections with different neural circuits. However, the lack of comprehensive input-output wiring diagrams of Oxt neurons and their quantitative relationship with Oxt receptor (Oxtr) expression presents challenges to understanding circuit-specific Oxt functions. Here, we establish a whole-brain distribution and anatomic connectivity map of Oxt neurons, and their relationship with Oxtr expression using high-resolution 3D mapping methods in adult male and female mice. We use a flatmap to describe Oxt neuronal expression in four hypothalamic domains including under-characterized Oxt neurons in the tuberal nucleus (TU). Oxt neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) broadly project to nine functional circuits that control cognition, brain state, and somatic visceral response. In contrast, Oxt neurons in the supraoptic (SO) and accessory (AN) nuclei have limited central projection to a small subset of the nine circuits. Surprisingly, quantitative comparison between Oxt output and Oxtr expression showed no significant correlation across the whole brain, suggesting abundant indirect Oxt signaling in Oxtr-expressing areas. Unlike output, Oxt neurons in both the PVH and SO receive similar monosynaptic inputs from a subset of the nine circuits mainly in the thalamic, hypothalamic, and cerebral nuclei areas. Our results suggest that PVH-Oxt neurons serve as a central modulator to integrate external and internal information via largely reciprocal connection with the nine circuits while the SO-Oxt neurons act mainly as unidirectional Oxt hormonal output. In summary, our Oxt wiring diagram provides anatomic insights about distinct behavioral functions of Oxt signaling in the brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Oxytocin (Oxt) neurons regulate diverse physiological functions from prosocial behavior to pain sensation via central projection in the brain. Thus, understanding detailed anatomic connectivity of Oxt neurons can provide insight on circuit-specific roles of Oxt signaling in regulating different physiological functions. Here, we use high-resolution mapping methods to describe the 3D distribution, monosynaptic input and long-range output of Oxt neurons, and their relationship with Oxt receptor (Oxtr) expression across the entire mouse brain. We found Oxt connections with nine functional circuits controlling cognition, brain state, and somatic visceral response. Furthermore, we identified a quantitatively unmatched Oxt-Oxtr relationship, suggesting broad indirect Oxt signaling. Together, our comprehensive Oxt wiring diagram advances our understanding of circuit-specific roles of Oxt neurons.</p>
