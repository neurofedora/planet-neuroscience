              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00116">Meta-learning ecological priors from large language models explains human learning and decision making</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.00116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human cognition is profoundly shaped by the environments in which it unfolds. Yet, it remains an open question whether learning and decision making can be explained as a principled adaptation to the statistical structure of real-world tasks. We introduce ecologically rational analysis, a computational framework that unifies the normative foundations of rational analysis with ecological grounding. Leveraging large language models to generate ecologically valid cognitive tasks at scale, and using meta-learning to derive rational models optimized for these environments, we develop a new class of learning algorithms: Ecologically Rational Meta-learned Inference (ERMI). ERMI internalizes the statistical regularities of naturalistic problem spaces and adapts flexibly to novel situations, without requiring hand-crafted heuristics or explicit parameter updates. We show that ERMI captures human behavior across 15 experiments spanning function learning, category learning, and decision making, outperforming several established cognitive models in trial-by-trial prediction. Our results suggest that much of human cognition may reflect adaptive alignment to the ecological structure of the problems we encounter in everyday life.

                arXiv:2509.00208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagnosing sleep disorders is an important focus in neuroscience and engineering, as these conditions involve issues such as insufficient sleep, frequent awakenings, and difficulty reaching deep sleep. Accurate detection based on brain signals, particularly electroencephalography (EEG), enables development of personalized treatments. While statistical pattern recognition was once the standard for analyzing EEG, deep learning has become the dominant approach. In this study, we analyzed a public database of 197 full night sleep recordings from participants aged 25-101 years. After preprocessing and feature extraction, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks achieved 93.3% accuracy in distinguishing healthy from disordered sleep, which improved to 95% with fusion techniques. The models were also computationally efficient, suggesting strong clinical potential for rapid and precise sleep disorder diagnosis.

                arXiv:2509.00555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As neuroscientific theories of consciousness continue to proliferate, the need to assess their similarities and differences -- as well as their predictive and explanatory power -- becomes ever more pressing. Recently, a number of structured adversarial collaborations have been devised to test the competing predictions of several candidate theories of consciousness. In this review, we compare and contrast three theories being investigated in one such adversarial collaboration: Integrated Information Theory, Neurorepresentationalism, and Active Inference. We begin by presenting the core claims of each theory, before comparing them in terms of (1) the phenomena they seek to explain, (2) the sorts of explanations they avail, and (3) the methodological strategies they endorse. We then consider some of the inherent challenges of theory testing, and how adversarial collaboration addresses some of these difficulties. More specifically, we outline the key hypotheses that will be tested in this adversarial collaboration, and exemplify how contrasting empirical predictions may pertain to core and auxiliary components of each theory. Finally, we discuss how the data harvested across disparate experiments (and their replicates) may be formally integrated to provide a quantitative measure of the evidential support accrued under each theory. We suggest this approach to theory comparison may afford a useful metric for tracking the amount of scientific progress being made in consciousness research.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00730">Response function as a quantitative measure of consciousness in brain dynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.00730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the neural correlates of consciousness remains a central challenge in neuroscience. In this study, we investigate the relationship between consciousness and neural responsiveness by analyzing intracranial ECoG recordings from non-human primates across three distinct states: wakefulness, anesthesia, and recovery. Using a nonequilibrium recurrent neural network (RNN) model, we fit state-dependent cortical dynamics to extract the neural response function as a dynamics complexity indicator. Our findings demonstrate that the amplitude of the neural response function serves as a robust dynamical indicator of conscious state, consistent with the role of a linear response function in statistical physics. Notably, this aligns with our previous theoretical results showing that the response function in RNNs peaks near the transition between ordered and chaotic regimes -- highlighting criticality as a potential principle for sustaining flexible and responsive cortical dynamics. Empirically, we find that during wakefulness, neural responsiveness is strong, widely distributed, and consistent with rich nonequilibrium fluctuations. Under anesthesia, response amplitudes are significantly suppressed, and the network dynamics become more chaotic, indicating a loss of dynamical sensitivity. During recovery, the neural response function is elevated, supporting the gradual re-establishment of flexible and responsive activity that parallels the restoration of conscious processing. Our work suggests that a robust, brain-state-dependent neural response function may be a necessary dynamical condition for consciousness, providing a principled framework for quantifying levels of consciousness in terms of nonequilibrium responsiveness in the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00939">Retinal processing of natural scenes : challenges ahead</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.00939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While a great deal is known about the way the retina processes simple stimuli, our understanding of how the retina processes natural stimuli is still limited. Here we highlight some of the challenges that remain to be addressed to understand retinal processing of natural stimuli and describe emerging research avenues to overcome them.
  A key issue is model complexity. When complexifying the probing stimuli towards natural stimuli, the number of parameters required in models of retinal computations increases, raising issues of overfitting, generalization, and interpretability. This increase in complexity is also a challenge for normative approaches as it makes it difficult to derive non-linear retinal computations from simple principles.
  We describe two types of approaches that may help circumvent this issue in the future. First, we propose that a new form of reductionism is emerging: instead of breaking down natural stimuli into sums of simpler stimuli, it becomes possible to 'divide and conquer' natural scenes into different visual inputs corresponding to different visual tasks, in order to study retinal computations separately for each of these visual tasks. Second, several studies suggest that it will soon be possible to mitigate the issue of complexity, by 'embodying' the models with more biological constraints, in particularly those derived from connectomic studies. Together, these approaches may offer a powerful strategy to move beyond current limitations and advance our understanding of how the retina processes natural visual environments, and suggest approaches that could be used beyond, for other sensory areas.

                arXiv:2509.01326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eye movements can reveal early signs of neurodegeneration, including those associated with Parkinson's Disease (PD). This work investigates the utility of a set of gaze-based features for the automatic screening of PD from different visual exploration tasks. For this purpose, a novel methodology is introduced, combining classic fixation/saccade oculomotor features (e.g., saccade count, fixation duration, scanned area) with features derived from gaze clusters (i.e., regions with a considerable accumulation of fixations). These features are automatically extracted from six exploration tests and evaluated using different machine learning classifiers. A Mixture of Experts ensemble is used to integrate outputs across tests and both eyes. Results show that ensemble models outperform individual classifiers, achieving an Area Under the Receiving Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.95 on a held-out test set. The findings support visual exploration as a non-invasive tool for early automatic screening of PD.

                arXiv:2509.01426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain atlases are essential for reducing the dimensionality of neuroimaging data and enabling interpretable analysis. However, most existing atlases are predefined, group-level templates with limited flexibility and resolution. We present Deep Cluster Atlas (DCA), a graph-guided deep embedding clustering framework for generating individualized, voxel-wise brain parcellations. DCA combines a pretrained autoencoder with spatially regularized deep clustering to produce functionally coherent and spatially contiguous regions. Our method supports flexible control over resolution and anatomical scope, and generalizes to arbitrary brain structures. We further introduce a standardized benchmarking platform for atlas evaluation, using multiple large-scale fMRI datasets. Across multiple datasets and scales, DCA outperforms state-of-the-art atlases, improving functional homogeneity by 98.8\% and silhouette coefficient by 29\%, and achieves superior performance in downstream tasks such as autism diagnosis and cognitive decoding. Codes and models will be released soon.

                arXiv:2509.01760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brains adapt to the statistical structure of their input. In the visual system, local light intensities change rapidly, the variance of the intensity changes more slowly, and the dynamic range of contrast itself changes more slowly still. We use a motion-sensitive neuron in the fly visual system to probe this hierarchy of adaptation phenomena, delivering naturalistic stimuli that have been simplified to have a clear separation of time scales. We show that the neural response to visual motion depends on contrast, and this dependence itself varies with context. Using the spike-triggered average velocity trajectory as a response measure, we find that context dependence is confined to a low-dimensional space, with a single dominant dimension. Across a wide range of conditions this adaptation serves to match the integration time to the mean interval between spikes, reducing redundancy.

                arXiv:2509.02139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper gives an overview of a theory for modelling the interaction between geometric image transformations and receptive field responses for a visual observer that views objects and spatio-temporal events in the environment. This treatment is developed over combinations of (i) uniform spatial scaling transformations, (ii) spatial affine transformations, (iii) Galilean transformations and (iv) temporal scaling transformations.
  By postulating that the family of receptive fields should be covariant under these classes of geometric image transformations, it follows that the receptive field shapes should be expanded over the degrees of freedom of the corresponding image transformations, to enable a formal matching between the receptive field responses computed under different viewing conditions for the same scene or for a structurally similar spatio-temporal event.
  We conclude the treatment by discussing and providing potential support for a working hypothesis that the receptive fields of simple cells in the primary visual cortex ought to be covariant under these classes of geometric image transformations, and thus have the shapes of their receptive fields expanded over the degrees of freedom of the corresponding geometric image transformations.

                arXiv:2509.02234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concealed information test (CIT) is widely used for detecting deception in criminal investigations, primarily leveraging the P300 component of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, the traditional bootstrapped amplitude difference (BAD) method struggles to accurately differentiate deceptive individuals from innocent ones when irrelevant stimuli carry familiarity or inherent meaning, thus limiting its practical applicability in real-world investigations. This study aimed to enhance the deception detection capability of the P300-based CIT, particularly under conditions of low stimulus heterogeneity. To closely simulate realistic investigative scenarios, we designed a realistic mock-crime setup in which participants were familiarized with all CIT stimuli except the target stimulus. EEG data acquired during CIT sessions were analyzed using the BAD method, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning (DL) methods (ShallowNet and EEGNet). Among these techniques, EEGNet demonstrated the highest deception detection accuracy at 86.67%, when employing our proposed data augmentation approach. Overall, DL methods could significantly improve the accuracy of deception detection under challenging conditions of low stimulus heterogeneity by effectively capturing subtle cognitive responses not accessible through handcrafted features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that employed DL approaches for subject-independent deception classification using the CIT paradigm.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00107">Self-organized learning emerges from coherent coupling of critical neurons</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.00107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep artificial neural networks have surpassed human-level performance across a diverse array of complex learning tasks, establishing themselves as indispensable tools in both social applications and scientific research.
  Despite these advances, the underlying mechanisms of training in artificial neural networks remain elusive.
  Here, we propose that artificial neural networks function as adaptive, self-organizing information processing systems in which training is mediated by the coherent coupling of strongly activated, task-specific critical neurons.
  We demonstrate that such neuronal coupling gives rise to Hebbian-like neural correlation graphs, which undergo a dynamic, second-order connectivity phase transition during the initial stages of training.
  Concurrently, the connection weights among critical neurons are consistently reinforced while being simultaneously redistributed in a stochastic manner.
  As a result, a precise balance of neuronal contributions is established, inducing a local concentration within the random loss landscape which provides theoretical explanation for generalization capacity.
  We further identify a later on convergence phase transition characterized by a phase boundary in hyperparameter space, driven by the nonequilibrium probability flux through weight space.
  The critical computational graphs resulting from coherent coupling also decode the predictive rules learned by artificial neural networks, drawing analogies to avalanche-like dynamics observed in biological neural circuits.
  Our findings suggest that the coherent coupling of critical neurons and the ensuing local concentration within the loss landscapes may represent universal learning mechanisms shared by both artificial and biological neural computation.

                arXiv:2509.00670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have emerged as a transformative technology with applications spanning robotics, virtual reality, medicine, and rehabilitation. However, existing BCI frameworks face several limitations, including a lack of stage-wise flexibility essential for experimental research, steep learning curves for researchers without programming expertise, elevated costs due to reliance on proprietary software, and a lack of all-inclusive features leading to the use of multiple external tools affecting research outcomes. To address these challenges, we present PyNoetic, a modular BCI framework designed to cater to the diverse needs of BCI research. PyNoetic is one of the very few frameworks in Python that encompasses the entire BCI design pipeline, from stimulus presentation and data acquisition to channel selection, filtering, feature extraction, artifact removal, and finally simulation and visualization. Notably, PyNoetic introduces an intuitive and end-to-end GUI coupled with a unique pick-and-place configurable flowchart for no-code BCI design, making it accessible to researchers with minimal programming experience. For advanced users, it facilitates the seamless integration of custom functionalities and novel algorithms with minimal coding, ensuring adaptability at each design stage. PyNoetic also includes a rich array of analytical tools such as machine learning models, brain-connectivity indices, systematic testing functionalities via simulation, and evaluation methods of novel paradigms. PyNoetic's strengths lie in its versatility for both offline and real-time BCI development, which streamlines the design process, allowing researchers to focus on more intricate aspects of BCI development and thus accelerate their research endeavors.

                arXiv:2509.01073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method for measuring brain activity with high temporal resolution; however, EEG signals often exhibit low signal-to-noise ratios because of contamination from physiological and environmental artifacts. One of the major challenges hindering the real-world deployment of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) involves the frequent occurrence of motion-related EEG artifacts. Most prior studies on EEG motion artifact removal rely on single-modality approaches, such as Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without incorporating simultaneously recorded modalities like inertial measurement units (IMUs), which directly capture the extent and dynamics of motion. This work proposes a fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM)-based correlation attention mapping method that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU data to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG signals. The fine-tuned model contains approximately 9.2 million parameters and uses 5.9 hours of EEG and IMU recordings for training, just 0.2346\% of the 2500 hours used to train the base model. We compare our results against the established ASR-ICA benchmark across varying time scales and motion activities, showing that incorporating IMU reference signals significantly improves robustness under diverse motion scenarios.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01806">Intermittent localization and fast spatial learning by non-Markov random walks with decaying memory</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.01806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random walks on lattices with preferential relocation to previously visited sites provide a simple modeling of the displacements of animals and humans. When the lattice contains a single impurity or resource site where the walker spends more time on average at each visit than on the other sites, the long range memory can suppress diffusion and induce by reinforcement a steady state localized around the resource. This phenomenon can be identified with a spatial learning process by the walker. Here we study theoretically and numerically how the decay of memory impacts learning in these models. If memory decays as $1/\tau$ or slower, where $\tau$ is the time backward into the past, the localized solutions are the same as with perfect, non-decaying memory and they are linearly stable. If forgetting is faster than $1/\tau$, for instance exponential, an unusual regime of intermittent localization is observed, where well localized periods of exponentially distributed duration are interspersed with intervals of diffusive motion. At the transition between the two regimes, for a kernel in $1/\tau$, the approach to the stable localized state is the fastest, opposite to the expected critical slowing down effect. Hence forgetting can allow the walker to save memory without compromising learning and to achieve a faster learning. These findings agree with biological evidence on the benefits of forgetting.

                arXiv:1708.00779v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the earliest electroencephalography experiments, large scale oscillations have been observed in the mammalian brain. More recently, episodes of oscillation and bursting have been identified not only in the cerebral cortex and thalamus, but pervasively in the healthy basal ganglia. The basal ganglia mediated synchronization model, introduced here, implicates these episodes in the integration of stimulus-response and reinforcement mechanisms in the basal ganglia with cortical association mechanisms. In so doing, the model helps explain how oscillations and synchrony are functionally central, and in particular, how they organize neural activity to exploit the selectivity of coincidence detectors in cortex and beyond. In the core mechanism of the model, salient spatiotemporal activity patterns in cortex are selectively focused by and routed through the basal ganglia to the thalamus. Coherent thalamocortical activity patterns then project back to widely separated areas of cortex, where they establish and facilitate contextually appropriate functional connections, while disconnecting and inhibiting competing ones. Corticostriatal, striatopallidal, and striatonigral conduction delays are crucial to this mechanism. These delays are unusually long, and unusually varied, in arrangements that facilitate learning of useful time alignments and associated resonant frequencies. Other structural arrangements in the basal ganglia show further specialization for this role, with convergence in the inputs from cortex, and divergence in many of the return paths to cortex, that systematically reflect corticocortical anatomical connectivity. The basal ganglia also target the dopaminergic, cholinergic, and serotonergic centers of the brainstem and basal forebrain, and the intralaminar and reticular nuclei of the thalamus, structures broadly implicated in the modulation of network activity and [...]

Abstract: We introduce Net2Brain, a graphical and command-line user interface toolbox for comparing the representational spaces of artificial deep neural networks (DNNs) and human brain recordings. While different toolboxes facilitate only single functionalities or only focus on a small subset of supervised image classification models, Net2Brain allows the extraction of activations of more than 600 DNNs trained to perform a diverse range of vision-related tasks (e.g semantic segmentation, depth estimation, action recognition, etc.), over both image and video datasets. The toolbox computes the representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) over those activations and compares them to brain recordings using representational similarity analysis (RSA), weighted RSA, both in specific ROIs and with searchlight search. In addition, it is possible to add a new data set of stimuli and brain recordings to the toolbox for evaluation. We demonstrate the functionality and advantages of Net2Brain with an example showcasing how it can be used to test hypotheses of cognitive computational neuroscience.

                arXiv:2501.18716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: The goal of this work was to develop a deep network for whole-head segmentation including clinical MRIs with abnormal anatomy, and compile the first public benchmark dataset for this purpose. We collected 98 MRIs with volumetric segmentation labels for a diverse set of human subjects including normal, as well as abnormal anatomy in clinical cases of stroke and disorders of consciousness. Approach: Training labels were generated by manually correcting initial automated segmentations for skin/scalp, skull, CSF, gray matter, white matter, air cavity and extracephalic air. We developed a MultiAxial network consisting of three 2D U-Net that operate independently in sagittal, axial and coronal planes and are then combined to produce a single 3D segmentation. Results: The MultiAxial network achieved a test-set Dice scores of 0.88+-0.04 (median +- interquartile range) on whole head segmentation including gray and white matter. This compared to 0.86 +- 0.04 for Multipriors and 0.79 +- 0.10 for SPM12, two standard tools currently available for this task. The MultiAxial network gains in robustness by avoiding the need for coregistration with an atlas. It performed well in regions with abnormal anatomy and on images that have been de-identified. It enables more accurate and robust current flow modeling when incorporated into ROAST, a widely-used modeling toolbox for transcranial electric stimulation.Conclusions: We are releasing a new state-of-the-art tool for whole-head MRI segmentation in abnormal anatomy, along with the largest volume of labeled clinical head MRIs including labels for non-brain structures. Together the model and data may serve as a benchmark for future efforts.

                arXiv:2508.01992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a foundational architecture of artificial intelligence models, Transformer has been recently adapted to spiking neural networks with promising performance across various tasks. However, existing spiking Transformer (ST)-based models require a substantial number of parameters and incur high computational costs, thus limiting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose combining synapse pruning with a synergistic learning-based compensation strategy to derive lightweight ST-based models. Specifically, two types of tailored pruning strategies are introduced to reduce redundancy in the weight matrices of ST blocks: an unstructured $\mathrm{L_{1}P}$ method to induce sparse representations, and a structured DSP method to induce low-rank representations. In addition, we propose an enhanced spiking neuron model, termed the synergistic leaky integrate-and-fire (sLIF) neuron, to effectively compensate for model pruning through synergistic learning between synaptic and intrinsic plasticity mechanisms. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly reduce model size and computational overhead while maintaining competitive performance. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed pruning and compensation strategies in constructing efficient and high-performing ST-based models.

Abstract: Objective. Personalized transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) has gained growing attention due to the substantial inter-individual variability in brain anatomy and physiology. While previous reviews have discussed the physiological mechanisms and clinical applications of tES, there remains a critical gap in up-to-date syntheses focused on the computational modeling frameworks that enable individualized stimulation optimization. Approach. This review presents a comprehensive overview of recent advances in computational techniques supporting personalized tES. We systematically examine developments in forward modeling for simulating individualized electric fields, as well as inverse modeling approaches for optimizing stimulation parameters. We critically evaluate progress in head modeling pipelines, optimization algorithms, and the integration of multimodal brain data. Main results. Recent advances have substantially accelerated the construction of subject-specific head conductor models and expanded the landscape of optimization methods, including multi-objective optimization and brain network-informed optimization. These advances allow for dynamic and individualized stimulation planning, moving beyond empirical trial-and-error approaches.Significance. By integrating the latest developments in computational modeling for personalized tES, this review highlights current challenges, emerging opportunities, and future directions for achieving precision neuromodulation in both research and clinical contexts.

                arXiv:2509.01739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are among the most widely and successfully applied optimizers for multi-objective problems. However, to store many optimal trade-offs (the Pareto optima) at once, MOEAs are typically run with a large, static population of solution candidates, which can slow down the algorithm. We propose the dynamic NSGA-II (dNSGA-II), which is based on the popular NSGA-II and features a non-static population size. The dNSGA-II starts with a small initial population size of four and doubles it after a user-specified number $\tau$ of function evaluations, up to a maximum size of $\mu$. Via a mathematical runtime analysis, we prove that the dNSGA-II with parameters $\mu \geq 4(n + 1)$ and $\tau \geq \frac{256}{50} e n$ computes the full Pareto front of the \textsc{OneMinMax} benchmark of size $n$ in $O(\log(\mu) \tau + \mu \log(n))$ function evaluations, both in expectation and with high probability. For an optimal choice of $\mu$ and $\tau$, the resulting $O(n \log(n))$ runtime improves the optimal expected runtime of the classic NSGA-II by a factor of $\Theta(n)$. In addition, we show that the parameter $\tau$ can be removed when utilizing concurrent runs of the dNSGA-II. This approach leads to a mild slow-down by a factor of $O(\log(n))$ compared to an optimal choice of $\tau$ for the dNSGA-II, which is still a speed-up of $\Theta(n / \log(n))$ over the classic NSGA-II.

Abstract: Traditional budget allocation models struggle with the stochastic and nonlinear nature of real-world financial data. This study proposes a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) framework for dynamic budget allocation, enhanced with Dirichlet-inspired stochasticity and quantum mutation-based genetic optimization. Using Apple Inc. quarterly financial data (2009 to 2025), the RL agent learns to allocate budgets between Research and Development and Selling, General and Administrative to maximize profitability while adhering to historical spending patterns, with L2 penalties discouraging unrealistic deviations. A Dirichlet distribution governs state evolution to simulate shifting financial contexts. To escape local minima and improve generalization, the trained policy is refined using genetic algorithms with quantum mutation via parameterized qubit rotation circuits. Generation-wise rewards and penalties are logged to visualize convergence and policy behavior. On unseen fiscal data, the model achieves high alignment with actual allocations (cosine similarity 0.9990, KL divergence 0.0023), demonstrating the promise of combining deep RL, stochastic modeling, and quantum-inspired heuristics for adaptive enterprise budgeting.

                arXiv:2509.00663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization for Replica-Exchange-based Physics-informed Operator learning Network, which is a novel operator learning network to efficiently solve parametric partial differential equations. In forward and inverse settings, this operator learning network only admits minimum requirement of noisy observational data. While physics-informed neural networks and operator learning approaches such as Deep Operator Networks and Fourier Neural Operators offer promising alternatives to traditional numerical solvers, they struggle with balancing operator and physics losses, maintaining robustness under noisy or sparse data, and providing uncertainty quantification. The proposed framework addresses these limitations by integrating: (i) evolutionary multi-objective optimization to adaptively balance operator and physics-based losses in the Pareto front; (ii) replica exchange stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics to improve global parameter-space exploration and accelerate convergence; and (iii) built-in Bayesian uncertainty quantification from stochastic sampling. The proposed operator learning method is tested numerically on several different problems including one-dimensional Burgers equation and the time-fractional mixed diffusion-wave equation. The results indicate that our framework consistently outperforms the general operator learning methods in accuracy, noise robustness, and the ability to quantify uncertainty.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00924">Beyond Universal Approximation Theorems: Algorithmic Uniform Approximation by Neural Networks Trained with Noisy Data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.00924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At its core, machine learning seeks to train models that reliably generalize beyond noisy observations; however, the theoretical vacuum in which state-of-the-art universal approximation theorems (UATs) operate isolates them from this goal, as they assume noiseless data and allow network parameters to be chosen freely, independent of algorithmic realism. This paper bridges that gap by introducing an architecture-specific randomized training algorithm that constructs a uniform approximator from $N$ noisy training samples on the $d$-dimensional cube $[0,1]^d$. Our trained neural networks attain the minimax-optimal quantity of \textit{trainable} (non-random) parameters, subject to logarithmic factors which vanish under the idealized noiseless sampling assumed in classical UATs.
  Additionally, our trained models replicate key behaviours of real-world neural networks, absent in standard UAT constructions, by: (1) exhibiting sub-linear parametric complexity when fine-tuning on structurally related and favourable out-of-distribution tasks, (2) exactly interpolating the training data, and (3) maintaining reasonable Lipschitz regularity (after the initial clustering attention layer). These properties bring state-of-the-art UATs closer to practical machine learning, shifting the central open question from algorithmic implementability with noisy samples to whether stochastic gradient descent can achieve comparable guarantees.

Abstract: Inductive reasoning enables humans to infer abstract rules from limited examples and apply them to novel situations. In this work, we compare an LLM-based hypothesis search framework with direct program generation approaches on few-shot rule induction tasks. Our findings show that hypothesis search achieves performance comparable to humans, while direct program generation falls notably behind. An error analysis reveals key bottlenecks in hypothesis generation and suggests directions for advancing program induction methods. Overall, this paper underscores the potential of LLM-based hypothesis search for modeling inductive reasoning and the challenges in building more efficient systems.

                arXiv:2509.01438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community detection in graphs is crucial for understanding the organization of nodes into densely connected clusters. While numerous strategies have been developed to identify these clusters, the success of community detection can lead to privacy and information security concerns, as individuals may not want their personal information exposed. To address this, community deception methods have been proposed to reduce the effectiveness of detection algorithms. Nevertheless, several limitations, such as the rationality of evaluation metrics and the unnoticeability of attacks, have been ignored in current deception methods. Therefore, in this work, we first investigate the limitations of the widely used deception metric, i.e., the decrease of modularity, through empirical studies. Then, we propose a new deception metric, and combine this new metric together with the attack budget to model the unnoticeable community deception task as a multi-objective optimization problem. To further improve the deception performance, we propose two variant methods by incorporating the degree-biased and community-biased candidate node selection mechanisms. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed community deception strategies.

Abstract: Microbiomes not only underpin Earth's biogeochemical cycles but also play crucial roles in both engineered and natural ecosystems, such as the soil, wastewater treatment, and the human gut. However, microbiome engineering faces significant obstacles to surmount to deliver the desired improvements in microbiome control. Here, we use the backpropagation neural network (BPNN), optimized through differential evolution (DE-BP), to predict the microbial composition of activated sludge (AS) systems collected from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located worldwide. Furthermore, we introduce a novel clustering algorithm termed Directional Position Nonlinear Emotional Preference Migration Behavior Clustering (DPNG-EPMC). This method is applied to conduct a clustering analysis of WWTPs across various feature attributes. Finally, we employ the Similar Time Generative Adversarial Networks (SiTime-GAN), to synthesize novel microbial compositions and feature attributes data. As a result, we demonstrate that the DE-BP model can provide superior predictions of the microbial composition. Additionally, we show that the DPNG-EPMC can be applied to the analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes. Finally, we demonstrate that the SiTime-GAN model can generate valuable incremental synthetic data. Our results, obtained through predicting the microbial community and conducting analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes, develop an understanding of the factors influencing AS communities.

                arXiv:2509.01987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complementary Learning Systems theory holds that intelligent agents need two learning systems. Semantic memory is encoded in the neocortex with dense, overlapping representations and acquires structured knowledge. Episodic memory is encoded in the hippocampus with sparse, pattern-separated representations and quickly learns the specifics of individual experiences. Recently, this duality between semantic and episodic memories has been challenged by predictive coding, a biologically plausible neural network model of the neocortex which was shown to have hippocampus-like abilities on auto-associative memory tasks. These results raise the question of the episodic capabilities of the neocortex and their relation to semantic memory. In this paper, we present such a predictive coding model of the neocortex and explore its episodic capabilities. We show that this kind of model can indeed recall the specifics of individual examples but only if it is trained on a small number of examples. The model is overfitted to these exemples and does not generalize well, suggesting that episodic memory can arise from semantic learning. Indeed, a model trained with many more examples loses its recall capabilities. This work suggests that individual examples can be encoded gradually in the neocortex using dense, overlapping representations but only in a limited number, motivating the need for sparse, pattern-separated representations as found in the hippocampus.

Abstract: Model merging techniques aim to integrate the abilities of multiple models into a single model. Most model merging techniques have hyperparameters, and their setting affects the performance of the merged model. Because several existing works show that tuning hyperparameters in model merging can enhance the merging outcome, developing hyperparameter optimization algorithms for model merging is a promising direction. However, its optimization process is computationally expensive, particularly in merging LLMs. In this work, we develop surrogate benchmarks for optimization of the merging hyperparameters to realize algorithm development and performance comparison at low cost. We define two search spaces and collect data samples to construct surrogate models to predict the performance of a merged model from a hyperparameter. We demonstrate that our benchmarks can predict the performance of merged models well and simulate optimization algorithm behaviors.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing systems, where information is transmitted through action potentials in a bio-plausible fashion, is gaining increasing interest due to its promise of low-power event-driven computing. Application of neuromorphic computing in robotic locomotion research have largely focused on Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) for bionics robotic control algorithms - inspired from neural circuits governing the collaboration of the limb muscles in animal movement. Implementation of artificial CPGs on neuromorphic hardware platforms can potentially enable adaptive and energy-efficient edge robotics applications in resource constrained environments. However, underlying rewiring mechanisms in CPG for gait emergence process is not well understood. This work addresses the missing gap in literature pertaining to CPG plasticity and underscores the critical homeostatic functionality of astrocytes - a cellular component in the brain that is believed to play a major role in multiple brain functions. This paper introduces an astrocyte regulated Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-based CPG for learning locomotion gait through Reward-Modulated STDP for quadruped robots, where the astrocytes help build inhibitory connections among the artificial motor neurons in different limbs. The SNN-based CPG is simulated on a multi-object physics simulation platform resulting in the emergence of a trotting gait while running the robot on flat ground. $23.3\times$ computational power savings is observed in comparison to a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning based robot control algorithm. Such a neuroscience-algorithm co-design approach can potentially enable a quantum leap in the functionality of neuromorphic systems incorporating glial cell functionality.

                arXiv:2406.14865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge transfer-based evolutionary optimization has garnered significant attention, such as in multi-task evolutionary optimization (MTEO), which aims to solve complex problems by simultaneously optimizing multiple tasks. While this emerging paradigm has been primarily focusing on task similarity, there remains a hugely untapped potential in harnessing the shared characteristics between different domains. For example, real-world complex systems usually share the same characteristics, such as the power-law rule, small-world property and community structure, thus making it possible to transfer solutions optimized in one system to another to facilitate the optimization. Drawing inspiration from this observation of shared characteristics within complex systems, we present a novel framework, multi-domain evolutionary optimization (MDEO). First, we propose a community-level measurement of graph similarity to manage the knowledge transfer among domains. Furthermore, we develop a graph learning-based network alignment model that serves as the conduit for effectively transferring solutions between different domains. Moreover, we devise a self-adaptive mechanism to determine the number of transferred solutions from different domains, and introduce a knowledge-guided mutation mechanism that adaptively redefines mutation candidates to facilitate the utilization of knowledge from other domains. To evaluate its performance, we use a challenging combinatorial problem known as adversarial link perturbation as the primary illustrative optimization task. Experiments on multiple real-world networks of different domains demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in efficacy compared to classical evolutionary optimization.

                arXiv:2505.06850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph-structured combinatorial problems in complex networks are prevalent in many domains, and are computationally demanding due to their complexity and non-linear nature. Traditional evolutionary algorithms (EAs), while robust, often face obstacles due to content-shallow encoding limitations and lack of structural awareness, necessitating hand-crafted modifications for effective application. In this work, we introduce an original framework, visual evolutionary optimization (VEO), leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as the backbone evolutionary optimizer in this context. Specifically, we propose a context-aware encoding way, representing the solution of the network as an image. In this manner, we can utilize MLLMs' image processing capabilities to intuitively comprehend network configurations, thus enabling machines to solve these problems in a human-like way. We have developed MLLM-based operators tailored for various evolutionary optimization stages, including initialization, crossover, and mutation. {Furthermore, we propose that graph sparsification can effectively enhance the applicability and scalability of VEO on large-scale networks, owing to the scale-free nature of real-world networks.} We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using a well-known task in complex networks, influence maximization, and validate it on eight different real-world networks of various structures. The results have confirmed VEO's reliability and enhanced effectiveness compared to traditional evolutionary optimization.

Abstract: The move-acceptance hyper-heuristic was recently shown to be able to leave local optima with astonishing efficiency (Lissovoi et al., Artificial Intelligence (2023)). In this work, we propose two modifications to this algorithm that demonstrate impressive performances on a large class of benchmarks including the classic Cliff$_d$ and Jump$_m$ function classes. (i) Instead of randomly choosing between the only-improving and any-move acceptance operator, we take this choice via a simple two-state Markov chain. This modification alone reduces the runtime on Jump$_m$ functions with gap parameter $m$ from $\Omega(n^{2m-1})$ to $O(n^{m+1})$. (ii) We then replace the all-moves acceptance operator with the operator that only accepts worsenings. Such a, counter-intuitive, operator has not been used before in the literature. However, our proofs show that our only-worsening operator can greatly help in leaving local optima, reducing, e.g., the runtime on Jump functions to $O(n^3 \log n)$ independent of the gap size. In general, we prove a remarkably good runtime of $O(n^{k+1} \log n)$ for our Markov move-acceptance hyper-heuristic on all members of a new benchmark class SEQOPT$_k$, which contains a large number of functions having $k$ successive local optima, and which contains the commonly studied Jump$_m$ and Cliff$_d$ functions for $k=2$.

Abstract: Bio-inspired algorithms, known as metaphor-based algorithms, utilize natural processes such as evolution, swarm behavior, foraging, and plant growth to solve complex, nonlinear, high-dimensional optimization problems. However, a plethora of these algorithms require a more rigorous review before making them applicable to the relevant fields. This survey categorizes these algorithms into eight groups: evolutionary, swarm intelligence, physics-inspired, ecosystem and plant-based, predator-prey, neural-inspired, human-inspired, and hybrid approaches, and reviews their principles, strengths, novelty, and critical limitations. We provide a critique on the novelty issues of many of these algorithms. We illustrate some of the suitable usage of the prominent algorithms in machine learning, engineering design, bioinformatics, and intelligent systems, and highlight recent advances in hybridization, parameter tuning, and adaptive strategies. Finally, we identify open challenges such as scalability, convergence, reliability, and interpretability to suggest directions for future research. This work aims to serve as a resource for both researchers and practitioners interested in understanding the current landscape and future directions of reliable and authentic advancement of bio-inspired algorithms.

                arXiv:2506.23717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-bit spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently become a heated research spot, pursuing energy-efficient and high-accurate AI. However, with more bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to the point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on the insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra bits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit allocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise allocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and accuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and the bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable through gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths and temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle different temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal lengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically formulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may incur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size renewal mechanism to alleviate this issue. Experiments on various datasets, including the static CIFAR and ImageNet datasets and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS, DVS-GESTURE, and SHD datasets, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the overall memory and computation cost while achieving higher accuracy. Particularly, our SEWResNet-34 can achieve a 2.69% accuracy gain and 4.16x lower bit budgets over the advanced baseline work on ImageNet. This work will be open-sourced.

                arXiv:2507.20746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks offer low energy consumption due to their event-driven nature. Beyond binary spike outputs, their intrinsic floating-point dynamics merit greater attention. Neuronal threshold levels and reset modes critically determine spike count and timing. Hard reset cause information loss, while soft reset apply uniform treatment to neurons. To address these issues, we design an adaptive reset neuron that establishes relationships between inputs, outputs, and reset, while integrating a simple yet effective threshold adjustment strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves excellent performance while maintaining lower energy consumption. In particular, it attains state-of-the-art accuracy on Tiny-ImageNet and CIFAR10-DVS. Codes are available at https://github.com/2ephyrus/AR-LIF.

                arXiv:2209.12467v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolution strategy (ES) is one of the promising classes of algorithms for black-box continuous optimization. Despite its broad successes in applications, theoretical analysis on the speed of its convergence is limited on convex quadratic functions and their monotonic transformation. In this study, an upper bound and a lower bound of the rate of linear convergence of the (1+1)-ES on locally $L$-strongly convex functions with $U$-Lipschitz continuous gradient are derived as $\exp\left(-\Omega_{d\to\infty}\left(\frac{L}{d\cdot U}\right)\right)$ and $\exp\left(-\frac1d\right)$, respectively. Notably, any prior knowledge on the mathematical properties of the objective function, such as Lipschitz constant, is not given to the algorithm, whereas the existing analyses of derivative-free optimization algorithms require it.

                arXiv:2507.19109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Pareto-NRPA, a new Monte-Carlo algorithm designed for multi-objective optimization problems over discrete search spaces. Extending the Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation (NRPA) algorithm originally formulated for single-objective problems, Pareto-NRPA generalizes the nested search and policy update mechanism to multi-objective optimization. The algorithm uses a set of policies to concurrently explore different regions of the solution space and maintains non-dominated fronts at each level of search. Policy adaptation is performed with respect to the diversity and isolation of sequences within the Pareto front. We benchmark Pareto-NRPA on two classes of problems: a novel bi-objective variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows problem (MO-TSPTW), and a neural architecture search task on well-known benchmarks. Results demonstrate that Pareto-NRPA achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms, both in terms of convergence and diversity of solutions. Particularly, Pareto-NRPA strongly outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary multi-objective algorithms on constrained search spaces. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the first adaptation of NRPA to the multi-objective setting.

                <p>High-level spinal cord injury (SCI) often reduces neural regulation of cardiovascular function. During the chronic phase, humoral regulation via the renin&ndash;angiotensin system (RAS) is enhanced to compensatorily maintaining blood pressure. It was recently shown that transplanting early-stage neurons into the injured cord mitigates cardiovascular disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying this recovery remain largely unknown. Here, we employed various pharmacological interventions to elucidate whether this strategic transplantation affects the imbalance of neuroendocrine regulation of hemodynamics and the role of specific serotonergic and catecholaminergic components. Female rats received a complete crush at the fourth thoracic spinal cord. Embryonic neural progenitor cells (NPCs) harvested from the raphe nuclei or the spinal cord were transplanted into the lesion. Naive rats or injury alone served as controls. After 8&ndash;9&nbsp;weeks, radio-telemetric recordings demonstrated that both implants decreased tachycardia at rest and diminished the frequency or severity of autonomic dysreflexia (AD). Pharmacological interventions demonstrated that both NPC grafts partially restored neural regulation of blood pressure without normalizing the aberrant RAS hyperactivity. Subsequently, specific neural mechanisms were explored through intrathecal administration of the 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> antagonist ketanserin, the 5-HT<SUB>1A</SUB> antagonist WAY100635, or the &alpha;1-adrenoreceptor antagonist prazosin. It revealed that graft-derived serotonergic signaling was involved in the restoration of the resting heart rate via 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> receptors but did not attenuate AD. In addition, catecholaminergic mechanisms remained critical for blood pressure maintenance after SCI. Ultimately, the results provide insight into understanding the mechanistic nuances associated with cell therapy for SCI-induced cardiovascular dysfunction.</p>

                <p>by Eric V. Strobl, Eric R. Gamazon</p>

Root causal genes correspond to the first gene expression levels perturbed during pathogenesis by genetic or non-genetic factors. Targeting root causal genes has the potential to alleviate disease entirely by eliminating pathology near its onset. No existing algorithm has been designed to discover root causal genes from observational data alone. We therefore propose the Transcriptome-Wide Root Causal Inference (TWRCI) algorithm that identifies root causal genes and their causal graph using a combination of genetic variant and unperturbed bulk RNA sequencing data. TWRCI uses a novel competitive regression procedure to annotate cis and trans-genetic variants to the gene expression levels they directly cause. The algorithm simultaneously determines the sequence in which gene expression changes propagate through the system to pinpoint the underlying causal graph and estimate root causal effects. TWRCI outperforms alternative approaches across a diverse group of metrics by directly targeting root causal genes while accounting for distal relations, linkage disequilibrium, patient heterogeneity and widespread pleiotropy. We demonstrate the algorithm by uncovering the root causal mechanisms of two complex diseases, which we confirm by replication using independent genome-wide summary statistics.

                <p>by Madison Shoraka, Herby Jean-Baptiste, Bettina Buttaro, Gillian Queisser</p>

A biofilm is a community of microorganisms adhered to a surface, bound together by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). They are ubiquitous in nature and develop on a range of surfaces including living tissue. Biofilms themselves typically do not negatively affect their host, but under certain conditions they can retain pathogenic features and cause a wide range of illnesses including persistent or chronic infections. In this study, we look at the bacterium <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i>. <i>E. faecalis</i> is a gram-positive, commensal bacterium commonly found in the human gastrointestinal tract. Generally, commensal <i>E. faecalis</i> does not negatively impact human health, but pathogenic strains have been found to acquire mobile genetic elements, including plasmids. When <i>E. faecalis</i> with the pCF10 plasmid forms a biofilm it constructs raised complex structures with variable cellular packing, including aggregates, instead of a homogeneous and less densely packed biofilm above a rigid base. This reconfiguration of the biofilm confers resistance to high levels of erythromycin. For this study, we carried out biological experiments which show that pCF10-containing <i>E. faecalis</i> biofilms undergo a rapid reconfiguration of its initial architecture, resulting in a doubling of cellular population over a single hour of antibiotic treatment. We developed a mathematical and computational model, calibrated using image processing techniques, to identify the characteristics of the biofilm’s spatial architecture that allow for the rapid one-hour reconfiguration under treatment. This model involves both stochastic cellular automata and deterministic partial differential equations. The numerical simulations carried out in this study demonstrate that biofilm survival requires both the robust formation of initial complex structures and an associated extracellular DNA (eDNA) cloud. These findings highlight the fundamental role of biofilm heterogeneity, containing aggregated structures with an associated eDNA cloud, in erythromycin resistance of <i>E. faecalis</i> with the pCF10 plasmid. The identification of eDNA as a target to increase the susceptibility of the biofilm to erythromycin could ultimately improve antibiotic treatment protocols.

                <p>by Gui Araujo, Miguel Lurgi</p>

Unveiling the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms underpinning the assembly of stable and complex ecosystems is a main focus of community ecology. Ecological theory predicts the necessity of structural constraints on the network of species interactions to allow for growth and persistence of multi-species communities. However, the mechanisms behind their emergence are not well understood. An understanding of how the coexistence of diverse species interaction types could influence the development of complexity and how a persistent composition of interactions could arise in nature is needed. Using an eco-evolutionary model, we investigate the assembly of complex species interaction networks with multiple interaction types and its consequences for ecosystem stability. Our results show that highly mutualistic communities promote complex and stable network configurations, thus resulting in a positive complexity-stability relationship. We show that evolution by speciation enhances the emergence of such conditions compared to a purely ecological assembly scenario of repeated invasions by migrating species. Furthermore, communities evolved in isolation promote a disproportionately higher complexity and a larger diversity of outcomes. Our results produce valuable theoretical insight into the mechanisms behind the emergence of ecological complexity and into the roles of mutualism and speciation in community formation.

                <p>by Matthew Aguirre, Jeffrey P. Spence, Guy Sella, Jonathan K. Pritchard</p>

Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) govern many core developmental and biological processes underlying human complex traits. Even with broad-scale efforts to characterize the effects of molecular perturbations and interpret gene coexpression, it remains challenging to infer the architecture of gene regulation in a precise and efficient manner. Key properties of GRNs, like hierarchical structure, modular organization, and sparsity, provide both challenges and opportunities for this objective. Here, we seek to better understand properties of GRNs using a new approach to simulate their structure and model their function. We produce realistic network structures with a novel generating algorithm based on insights from small-world network theory, and we model gene expression regulation using stochastic differential equations formulated to accommodate modeling molecular perturbations. With these tools, we systematically describe the effects of gene knockouts within and across GRNs, finding a subset of networks that recapitulate features of a recent genome-scale perturbation study. With deeper analysis of these exemplar networks, we consider future avenues to map the architecture of gene expression regulation using data from cells in perturbed and unperturbed states, finding that while perturbation data are critical to discover specific regulatory interactions, data from unperturbed cells may be sufficient to reveal regulatory programs.

                <p>by Andrew Patton, Jörn Davidsen</p>

Although the brain’s structural and functional alterations with age are individually well documented, how differences in cognitive abilities emerge from variations in the underlying spatio-temporal patterns of regional brain activity is largely unknown. Patterns of increased synchronization between brain regions are taken as enhanced cognitive integration, while decreased synchronization is indicative of cognitive segregation. The ability to dynamically switch between different levels of integration and segregation across different cognitive systems is believed to be crucial for overall cognitive performance. Building on a recently proposed cognitively informed, synchronization-based framework, we study here age-related variations in dynamical flexibility between segregation and integration, as captured by changes in the variable patterns of partial synchronization or chimera states. Leveraging personalized brain network models based on large-scale, multisite datasets of cross-sectional healthy cohorts, we systematically show how regional brain stimulation produces distinct patterns of synchronization. We find that chimera states play a crucial role in regulating the balance between cognitive integration and segregation as the brain ages, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying cognitive decline and preservation in aging. Whereas the emergent synchronization behavior of brain regions belonging to the same cognitive system often show the same aging trends, different cognitive systems can demonstrate distinct trends. This supports the idea that aging affects cognitive systems differently and that understanding this variability is essential for a more comprehensive view of neuro-cognitive aging. At the same time, dynamical flexibility increases in the oldest age groups across most cognitive systems. This may reflect compensatory mechanisms to counteract age-related cognitive declines and points towards a phenomenon of dedifferentiation. Yet, the multiplicity of behaviors highlights that whereas dedifferentiation emerges in certain cognitive systems, differentiation can also occur in others. This illustrates that these processes, though seemingly oppositional, can coexist and unfold in parallel across different cognitive systems.

The primary cilium is a microtubule-based organelle essential for various cellular functions, particularly signal transduction. While the role of cilia in regulating signaling pathways has been extensively studied, the impact of signaling pathways on cilia formation remains less well understood. Wnt signals are critical modulators of cell fate. In this study, we investigate how modulating Wnt signaling affects cilia formation in human retinal pigment epithelial (hTERT-RPE1) cells. Our findings show that enhancement of Wnt/LRP6 signaling before serum starvation delays ciliogenesis. Cells with high baseline Wnt activity exhibited distal appendage dysregulation, failure to remove CP110/CEP97 from mother centrioles, and reduced Rab8-vesicle docking, which are critical events for cilia membrane establishment and axoneme extension. Additionally, these cells displayed reduced autophagic flux, increased mTOR kinase activity, and elevated OFD1 levels at centriolar satellites. Importantly, mTOR inhibition rescued ciliogenesis in cells with elevated Wnt activity, underscoring the interplay between these signaling pathways. Our data also indicate that insufficient Wnt signaling activation disrupts ciliogenesis, emphasizing the need for precisely regulated Wnt levels.

                <p>by Emilio E. Méndez-Olivos, Katrinka M. Kocha, Joshua Bloomekatz, Shan Liao, Peng Huang</p>

In vertebrates, the sclerotome is a transient embryonic structure that gives rise to various tissue support cells, including fibroblasts. However, how fibroblast precursors are guided to diverse tissues remain poorly understood. Using zebrafish, our lab has previously shown that sclerotome-derived cells undergo extensive migration to generate distinct fibroblast subtypes, including tenocytes along the myotendinous junction and fin mesenchymal cells in the fin fold. The pan-fibroblast gene platelet-derived growth factor receptor a (<i>pdgfra</i>), which has been implicated in cell migration across various contexts, is specifically expressed in the sclerotome and its descendants. Loss of functional Pdgfra in a <i>pdgfra</i> gene-trap mutant results in severe defects in the migration of sclerotome-derived cells, leading to a dose-dependent loss of tenocytes and fin mesenchymal cells. By combining live imaging and mosaic labeling with a membrane-bound dominant-negative tool, we demonstrate that Pdgfra acts cell-autonomously to regulate the migration of sclerotome-derived cells. In the absence of ligand <i>pdgfab</i>, which is expressed in the medial somite, sclerotome-derived cells fail to migrate medially, resulting in a loss of tenocytes, although they can migrate normally toward the fin fold and generate fin mesenchymal cells. Strikingly, localized expression of Pdgfab in <i>pdgfab</i> mutants can direct the migration of sclerotome-derived cells to both normal and ectopic locations, suggesting a chemoattractive role for the Pdgfab ligand. Together, our results demonstrate that Pdgfab/Pdgfra-mediated chemoattraction guides the migration of sclerotome-derived fibroblast precursors to specific locations, where they diversify into distinct fibroblast subtypes.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003352">Viral expansion after transfer is a primary driver of influenza A virus transmission bottlenecks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Katie E. Holmes, Lucas M. Ferreri, Baptiste Elie, Ketaki Ganti, Chung-Young Lee, David VanInsberghe, Anice C. Lowen</p>

For many viruses, narrow bottlenecks acting during transmission sharply reduce genetic diversity in a recipient host relative to the donor. Since genetic diversity represents adaptive potential, such losses of diversity are thought to limit the opportunity for viral populations to undergo antigenic change and other adaptive processes. Thus, a detailed picture of evolutionary dynamics during transmission is critical to understanding the forces driving viral evolution at an epidemiologic scale. To advance this understanding, we used a barcoded virus library and a guinea pig model of transmission to decipher where in the transmission process influenza A virus populations lose diversity. In inoculated guinea pigs, we show that a high level of viral barcode diversity is maintained. Within-host continuity in the barcodes detected across time furthermore indicates that stochastic effects are not pronounced within the inoculated hosts. Importantly, in both aerosol-exposed and direct contact animals, we observed many barcodes at the earliest time point(s) positive for infectious virus, indicating robust transfer of diversity through the environment. This high viral diversity is short-lived, however, with a sharp decline seen 1–2 days after initiation of infection. Although major losses of diversity at transmission are well described for influenza A virus, our data indicate that events that occur following viral transfer and during the earliest stages of natural infection have a central role in this process. This finding suggests that host factors, such as immune effectors, may have greater opportunity to impose selection during influenza A virus transmission than previously recognized.

                <p>by Emily P. Van Syoc, Emily R. Davenport, Seth R. Bordenstein</p>

Human genetic determinants of the gut mycobiome remain uninvestigated despite decades of research highlighting tripartite relationships between gut bacteria, genetic background, and disease. Here, we present the first genome-wide association study on the number and types of human genetic loci influencing gut fungi relative abundance. We detect 148 fungi-associated variants (FAVs) across 7 chromosomes that statistically associate with 9 fungal taxa. Of these FAVs, several occur in the protein-coding genes <i>PTPRC</i>, <i>ANAPC10</i>, <i>NAV2</i>, and <i>CDH13</i>. Additional FAVs link to tissue-specific gene expression as fungi-associated expression quantitative trait loci. Notably, the relative abundance of gut yeast <i>Kazachstania</i> associates with genetic variation in <i>CDH13</i> encoding T-cadherin, a protein linked to cardiovascular disease. <i>Kazachstania</i> forms a causal relationship with cardiovascular disease risk in a mendelian two-sample randomization analysis. These findings establish previously unrecognized connections between human genetics, gut fungi, and chronic disease, broadening the paradigm of human-microbe interactions in the gut to the mycobiome.

                The integrated stress response (ISR) is an evolutionarily conserved signaling network that regulates protein synthesis in response to diverse cellular stressors to promote stress adaptation. The ISR also responds to physiological stimuli to modify the cellular proteome in an activity-dependent manner. Many common brain pathologies, including neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, induce chronic cellular stress and subsequent ISR activation, which substantially contributes to disease progression. Importantly, various brain cell types exhibit disparate levels of sensitivity to cellular stress and differ in how the activation of the ISR influences their physiology. In this review, we highlight cell type-specific roles of the ISR in brain health and disease. We also discuss how therapeutically targeting the ISR in pathological states should account for the cell types being affected.

                Tau aggregation is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative disorders. Van Alstyne and colleagues identify polyserine targeting as a strategy to enrich fusion proteins with tau aggregates. Utilizing this approach, FAF2/UBXD8 is characterized as a suppressor of tau pathology across Drosophila and mouse animal models, which is enhanced by polyserine-mediated targeting.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106525">Gene expression variation across genetically identical individuals predicts reproductive traits</a></h4>

              
                In recent decades, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been the major approach to understand the biological basis of individual differences in traits and diseases. However, GWAS approaches have limited predictive power to explain individual differences, particularly for complex traits and diseases in which environmental factors play a substantial role in their etiology. Indeed, individual differences persist even in genetically identical individuals, although fully separating genetic and environmental causation is difficult in most organisms. To understand the basis of individual differences in the absence of genetic differences, we measured two quantitative reproductive traits in 180 genetically identical young adult <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> roundworms in a shared environment and performed single-individual transcriptomics on each worm. We identified hundreds of genes for which expression variation was strongly associated with reproductive traits, some of which depended on individuals’ historical environments and some of which was random. Multiple small sets of genes together were highly predictive of reproductive traits, explaining on average over half and over a quarter of variation in the two traits. We manipulated mRNA levels of predictive genes to identify a set of causal genes, demonstrating the utility of this approach for both prediction and understanding underlying biology. Finally, we found that the chromatin environment of predictive genes was enriched for H3K27 trimethylation, suggesting that gene expression variation may be driven in part by chromatin structure. Together, this work shows that individual, non-genetic differences in gene expression are both highly predictive and causal in shaping reproductive traits.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95838">Acquisition phase-specific contribution of climbing fiber transmission to cerebellum-dependent motor memory in mice</a></h4>

              
                Climbing fiber (CF) transmission from the inferior olive (IO) triggers complex spikes (Cs) in Purkinje cells (PCs) driven by a burst of calcium spikes. In the context of motor learning, especially the compensatory optic response, CF transmission serves as an instructive signal selectively conveyed to PCs. While the significance of CF input in motor memory formation is widely acknowledged, a comprehensive understanding of its distinct contribution across different temporal windows, spanning from the initial learning phase to the retrieval period, remains incomplete. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the necessity of CF-induced instructive signals in motor learning by assessing their roles in memory acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval. We employed optogenetics to selectively inhibit CF transmission during targeted time windows. Consequently, the absence of CF-induced instructive signals during motor learning impairs memory acquisition. However, when these signals were suppressed during the consolidation and retrieval period, there was neither a loss of long-term memory nor a prevention of memory retrieval. Our results highlight that CF transmission plays a specialized and critical role primarily in memory acquisition, rather than in subsequent processes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104514">Opening and closing of a cryptic pocket in VP35 toggles it between two different RNA-binding modes</a></h4>

              
                Cryptic pockets are of growing interest as potential drug targets, particularly to control protein-nucleic acid interactions that often occur via flat surfaces. However, it remains unclear whether cryptic pockets contribute to protein function or if they are merely happenstantial features that can easily be evolved away to achieve drug resistance. Here, we explore whether a cryptic pocket in the Interferon Inhibitory Domain (IID) of viral protein 35 (VP35) of Zaire ebolavirus aids its ability to bind double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). We use simulations and experiments to study the relationship between cryptic pocket opening and dsRNA binding of the IIDs of two other filoviruses, Reston and Marburg. These homologs have nearly identical structures but block different interferon pathways due to different affinities for blunt ends and backbone of the dsRNA. Simulations and thiol-labeling experiments demonstrate that the homologs have varying probabilities of pocket opening. Subsequent dsRNA-binding assays suggest that closed conformations preferentially bind dsRNA blunt ends while open conformations prefer binding the backbone. Point mutations that modulate pocket opening proteins further confirm this preference. These results demonstrate that the open cryptic pocket has a function, suggesting cryptic pockets are under selective pressure and may be difficult to evolve away to achieve drug resistance.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105265">The Product neutrality function defining genetic interactions emerges from mechanistic models of cell growth</a></h4>

              
                Genetic analyses, which examine the phenotypic effects of mutations both individually and in combination, have been fundamental to our understanding of cellular functions. Such analyses rely on a neutrality function that predicts the expected phenotype for double mutants based on the phenotypes of the two individual non-interacting mutations. In this study, we examine fitness, the most fundamental cellular phenotype, through an analysis of the extensive colony growth rate data available for budding yeast. Our results confirm that the Product neutrality function describes the colony growth rate, or fitness, of a double mutant as the product of the fitnesses of the individual single mutants. This Product neutrality function performs better than Additive or Minimum neutrality functions, supporting its continued use in genetic interaction studies. Furthermore, we explore the mechanistic origins of this neutrality function by analyzing two theoretical models of cell growth. We perform a computational genetic analysis to show that in both models, the Product neutrality function naturally emerges due to the interdependence of cellular processes that maximize growth rates. Thus, our findings provide mechanistic insight into how the Product neutrality function arises and affirm its utility in predicting genetic interactions affecting cell growth and proliferation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106443">Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the trained immunity era</a></h4>

              
                The long-term functional adaptation of innate immune cells following an initial stimulation, referred to as trained immunity or innate immune memory, enhances responsiveness and protection against secondary infections. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), an evolutionarily conserved family, recognize microbial-associated molecular patterns, initiating innate and adaptive immune responses. TLR signaling cascades induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, antimicrobial peptides, and interferons, promoting pathogen clearance, while also driving epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming that enhances immune responses and protection to subsequent challenges. However, TLRs also recognize endogenous ligands contributing to chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases. This review examines the role of TLRs and their various agonists in mediating trained immunity across diverse immune cell types, with an emphasis on their dual role in protecting against infections and chronic inflammation. It highlights recent clinical trials of TLR agonists as immunomodulatory agents and their therapeutic potential in infectious diseases and cancer. By providing an in-depth analysis of TLR-driven trained immunity, this review highlights the extensive influence of TLRs on immune cell populations and their implications for the development of novel, broad-spectrum immunotherapies.

                TDP-43 dysfunction is an early pathogenic determinant of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 pathology (FTLD-TDP), a devastating disorder currently without effective therapy. Here, we exploit a blood-brain-barrier (BBB)-permeable AAV (AAV-PHP.eB) that confers broad brain biodistribution to restore TDP-43 function in a TDP-43 deficient model (CamKIIa-CreER;Tardbp mice) that mimics the early stage of TDP-43 dysfunction occurring in FTLD-TDP. Intracerebroventricular delivery by AAV-PHP.eB of CTR, our previously characterized splicing repressor, revealed its accumulation in ~40% of adult hippocampal neurons. Remarkably, treatment of adult CamKIIa-CreER;Tardbpf/f mice with AAV-PHP.eB-CTR restored TDP-43 function, attenuated neuronal aberrant activity and memory deficits, and rescued neuron loss. Importantly, we showed that TDP-43's autoregulatory element restricts CTR expression to a physiological range. No overt phenotype was observed after long-term exposure to AAV-PHP.eB-CTR in aged mice, highlighting a favorable safety profile for this gene therapy. These results validate that BBB-crossing AAVs can deliver CTR with a biodistribution in the adult brain that is broad enough to rescue FTD-like phenotypes, supporting clinical testing of this gene therapy for FTLD-TDP.

                Leptin signaling has neuroprotective effects and is increasingly linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Beyond metabolism, leptin modulates {beta}-amyloid metabolism, tau phosphorylation, and synaptic plasticity. While homozygous Lepr mutations are well studied, the impact of heterozygous mutations on neurodegeneration is unclear. To assess partial Lepr loss, one-year-old db/+ mice were evaluated for metabolic, behavioral, and neuropathological changes. Tests included glucose tolerance, memory assays, A{beta}42 and tau levels, CDK5 activity, and transcriptomics. Human LEPR variants were curated and classified using ACMG guidelines. Aged db/+ mice showed metabolic dysfunction, cognitive deficits, and AD-like pathology. Compared to controls, db/+ mice had increased body weight, insulin resistance, memory impairments, elevated A{beta}42, tau hyperphosphorylation, CDK5 hyperactivation, and astrocyte activation. Transcriptomics revealed altered synaptic and mitochondrial pathways. Thirty-three pathogenic or likely pathogenic human LEPR variants were identified. Lepr haploinsufficiency contributes to age-related cognitive decline and AD-like pathology, suggesting it as a genetic risk factor and therapeutic target.

                Spiking recurrent neural networks (SRNNs) rival gated RNNs on various tasks, yet they still lack several hallmarks of biological neural networks. We introduce a biologically grounded SRNN that implements Dale's law with voltage-dependent AMPA and GABA reversal potentials. These reversal potentials modulate synaptic gain as a function of the postsynaptic membrane potential, and we derive theoretically how they make each neuron's effective dynamics and subthreshold resonance input-dependent. We trained SRNNs on the Spiking Heidelberg Digits dataset, and show that SRNN with reversal potentials cuts spike energy by up to 4x, while increasing task accuracy. This leads to high-performing Dalean SRNNs, substantially improving on Dalean networks without reversal potentials. Thus, Dale's law with reversal potentials, a core feature of biological neural networks, can render SRNNs more accurate and energy-efficient.

                Astrocytic calcium dysregulation and reactivity precede Abeta; deposition in amyloid-{beta} deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD) but the neurotoxic mechanisms remain unclear. We show that GSDME acts as a switch, linking MAM-mediated calcium release to astrocyte-driven neurotoxicity. Specifically, Abeta-activated microglial signals activate astrocytic GSDME, releasing its N-terminal fragment, which targets MAMs and triggers ER calcium efflux. This induces biphasic CaMKIIalpha; phosphorylation, initially boosting NRF2 defenses, then activating NF-kappaB-driven inflammation, shifting astrocytes from protective to toxic states. GSDME activation also drives astrocyte-derived exosomes (ADEs) to carry neurotoxic tau, proinflammatory miRNAs, and toxic lipids, propagating toxicity. GSDME deletion in AD mice reduces Abeta; burden, restores NF-kappaB/NRF2 balance, reprograms astrocytes and ADEs to protective states, and rescues cognition. Multi-omics profiling of serum ADEs from AD patients reveals a disease-specific signature with central neurotoxicity and peripheral immune regulation. These findings position GSDME as a promising dual diagnostic and therapeutic target for early AD invention.

                Post-mortem tau pathology is frequently observed in Parkinson's disease (PD) using immunohistochemistry (IHC) to measure large inclusions, however, small protein aggregates that precede inclusions are considered a major driver of toxicity in neurodegenerative disease. We aimed to uncover the distribution of nanoscopic aggregates across six brain regions in post-mortem tissue from 14 PD and 15 controls using the single-molecule pull-down assay (SiMPull). In the hippocampus and amygdala, tau IHC and SiMPull were associated with advanced age in controls and dementia status in PD. Despite negligible tau IHC-labelled aggregates in the putamen, we identified a unique population of high-intensity nanoscopic tau aggregates for a subset of PD cases using SiMPull, ranging from 10-1,000 epitopes per aggregate and 30-1,000 nm in length. Previous evidence linking nigrostriatal tau pathology and motor deficits indicates that the nanoscopic tau aggregates identified in this study may contribute to striatal dysfunction in PD.

">Cryptic splicing in synaptic and membrane excitability genes links TDP-43 loss to neuronal dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                TDP-43 pathology is a defining pathological hallmark of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). A major feature of TDP-43 pathology is its nuclear depletion, leading to the aberrant inclusion of cryptic exons during RNA splicing. STMN2 and UNC13A have emerged as prominent TDP-43 splicing targets, but the broader impact of TDP-43-dependent cryptic splicing on neuronal function remains unclear. Here, we report new TDP-43 splicing targets critical for membrane excitability and synaptic function, including KALRN, RAP1GAP, SYT7 and KCNQ2. Using human stem cell-derived neurons, we show that TDP-43 reduction induces cryptic splicing and downregulation of these genes, resulting in impaired excitability and synaptic transmission. In postmortem brains from patients with FTD, these cryptic splicing events occur selectively in neurons with TDP-43 pathology. Importantly, suppressing individual cryptic splicing events using antisense oligonucleotides partially restores neuronal function, and combined targeting almost fully rescues the synaptic deficit caused by TDP-43 loss. Together, our findings provide evidence that cryptic splicing in these synaptic and membrane excitability genes is not only a downstream marker but instead a direct driver of neuronal dysfunction, establishing a mechanistic link between TDP-43 pathology and neurodegeneration in ALS and FTD.

">Differential effects of sodium on agonist-induced conformational transitions and signaling at μ and κ opioid receptors</a></h4>

              
                Sodium ions are classically conceptualized as negative allosteric modulators for G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), although there have been reports of either positive allosteric modulation or no effect of sodium on GPCR function. Here we identified opposing actions of sodium on the mu and kappa-opioid receptors. We utilized a variety of methods including radioligand binding, real-time conformational monitoring of transitions using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and signaling assays using the TRUPATH resource. At the mu receptors, sodium behaved as a negative allosteric modulator of binding, conformational transitions and signaling. Intriguingly, bitopic mu agonists were unaffected by sodium concentrations. By contrast, at the kappa opioid receptor sodium negatively modulated agonist binding and positively modulated conformational transitions and signaling. Taken together, these findings support the notion that the differential sensitivities to sodium concentrations will result in opposing effects on cell surface and intracellular signaling.

">Functional comparison of control and 3' deletion human NRXN1 isoforms in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Neuropsychiatric conditions including Schizophrenia are historically difficulty to study in vivo due to the extensive genetic heterogeneity present between patients. Recent exome sequencing of a Schizophrenia patient cohort identified a set of 3' deletions present within multiple highly expressed-isoforms of the synaptic adhesion molecule neurexin1 (NRXN1), a gene that is broadly implicated across many neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. To understand how isoform differences and mutations within isoforms impact neuronal function and behaviors, we expressed 8 NRXN1 isoform variants in C. elegans and tested their effects on a stereotyped food-deprivation response and social feeding behavior. Overall, expression of the NRXN1 isoforms followed a pattern similar to that of the endogenous ortholog NRX-1, with expression primarily localized to the nerve ring in the head of the animal. However, several isoform variants displayed distinct localization, with ectopic or abnormal expression in neuronal cell bodies. We observed in the food deprivation response behavior that the isoforms (both control and 3' deletion variants) fell into one of three phenotypic categories; unchanged, partial rescue, or gain of function. A similar trend was observed for social feeding behavior; most of the NRXN1 isoforms had no impact compared with npr-1;nrx-1 controls, but some had partial rescue or induced stronger phenotypes. In summary, NRXN1 isoforms are able to partially rescue behavioral defects caused by the loss of nrx-1, suggesting that they may functionally replace the endogenous protein. Further, we identified differential impacts between some control and 3' deletion isoform variants, confirming pathogenic impact of 3' deletion isoforms in behavior. Overall, C. elegans presents a genetically tractable model in which to study the impacts of protein coding deletions associated with human neuropsychiatric conditions that impact genes with many isoforms on robust and stereotyped behaviors in vivo.

">Brain Mecp2 Gene Dosage and Gene Therapy Shape Multi-Omic Signatures and Biomarkers in Rett Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by MECP2 mutations. Like other genetic neurodevelopmental disorders, it lacks molecular biomarkers to evaluate disease and therapeutic outcomes. We present a strategy to define biomarkers of MeCP2 dysfunction in brain with potential to delineate mechanisms and monitor therapeutic interventions. This strategy relies on a library of proteins responsive to Mecp2 gene dosage and correlated with molecular and clinical outcomes after AAV9-mediated MECP2 gene therapy in Mecp2 KO mice. Gene rescue restored MeCP2 in brain, improved clinical phenotypes, and reverted transcriptome and proteome abnormalities. We identified 327 shared proteins among 1852 cortical and hippocampal proteins responsive to Mecp2/MECP2. Of these, 119 also displayed Mecp2/MECP2-dependent transcript changes. Both the Mecp2 responsive proteome and transcript/protein pairs were enriched in synaptic and metabolic pathways, including central carbon and NAD+ metabolism. We used this therapy-responsive protein library to guide selection of candidate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in RTT. CSF composition from neurotypical and RTT groups was analyzed using ultrasensitive nucleic acid-based multiplexed ELISA. Twenty eight proteins were altered in RTT, nine overlapping with Mecp2 dosage and therapy sensitive proteins. Multivariate regression linked several candidates to Mecp2/MeCP2 abundance and phenotypic improvement in mice. This paradigm provides a rigorous molecular systems level framework integrating genetics, preclinical gene therapy, and clinical metrics to define robust cross species biomarkers and mechanisms in RTT, with potential applicability to other neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Physical exercise and brain network dynamics: reduction of frontoparietal-striatal connectivity following 1 hour of aerobic cycling</a></h4>

              
                Physical exercise is beneficial for metabolic health and cognitive performance. In addition, exercise can be highly pleasurable and and serves as an effective stress reliever. Extant studies have highlighted frontal, parietal, and subcortical brain changes following acute bouts of exercise. However, slower, slightly delayed brain correlates after exercise at the network level have not been studied. Therefore, this study's objective was to investigate the changes in dynamic functional connectivity after 60 minutes of exercise in healthy males. Here we measured a 6-minute resting state fMRI in 24 young males at baseline and after a 60-minute cycling exercise challenge. Apart from routine preprocessing, the data were denoised with FSL-FIX and modeled with i) leading eigenvector dynamics analysis (LEiDA) to probe whole brain network dynamics and ii) with group independent component analysis (ICA) and dual regression to quantify static brain connectivity. The within subject statistical tests compared baseline to post-exercise conditions. We found that a striato-fronto-parietal network is destabilized after exercise, as indicated by a lower probability of occurrence in dynamic analysis through LEiDA. The brain areas in the network include the bilateral caudate, putamen and pallidum as well as middle orbitofrontal, frontal operculum, frontal trigonum and inferior parietal cortices. No differences between baseline and post exercise conditions were found in the dual regression of the group ICA components. We conclude that 60 minutes of cycling causes a prolonged effect in brain network dynamics, reducing synchronization between the striatum and frontoparietal networks with respect to baseline. This provides insights into the network-level neural correlates of aerobic exercise, which may be directly linked with the stress relieving effects of physical exercise.

">Zebrafish sleep displays distinct sub-states</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is an essential and evolutionarily-conserved behavior. While mammals and several other species have been shown to exhibit well-defined sleep sub-states, some of which have been ascribed specific functions, it remains unclear to what extent such differentiation exists across the animal kingdom. Here we show, using long-term behavioral data combined with Hidden Markov Modeling, that larval zebrafish display distinct deep and light sleep sub-states. Although both states occur primarily at night, fish respond differently to sleep deprivation and arousing stimuli depending on which sleep sub-state they are in. Moreover, the proportions of deep and light sleep are selectively altered by genetic and pharmacological manipulations of melatonin, serotonin, and norepinephrine signaling, offering new insights into how these neuromodulators shape sleep architecture. These results support zebrafish as a tractable model for dissecting the regulation and function of sleep sub-states. More broadly, they demonstrate that structured, multi-state sleep is a conserved feature of vertebrate behavior.

">Aperiodic EEG Activity Provides a Linear, Bidirectional, and Spatially Uniform Marker of Subjective and Objective Vigilance in Humans, Both Within and Across States</a></h4>

              
                Vigilance is increasingly conceived as a continuum, ranging from full alertness to deep sleep. Despite its fundamental role in cognition, behaviour, and health, reliable physiological markers of vigilance remain limited, and clinical assessments often rely on subjective or time-consuming evaluations. Traditionally, vigilance has been estimated through visual inspection of the electroencephalogram (EEG), identifying recognizable oscillatory patterns like rapid, wakefulness-defining alpha waves (~10 Hz) and large slow waves (~1 Hz) which typify sleep. However, these oscillatory features often appear only intermittently and follow complex, non-linear trajectories across time, space, and frequency, limiting their utility for automated, continuous tracking of vigilance. Recent research has shifted attention to the non-oscillatory, or aperiodic, component of the EEG, which may follow simpler dynamics and offer a more robust index of brain state. Yet most studies often continue to use narrowly defined, discrete vigilance states and transitions in only one direction (e.g., from wakefulness to sleep), without jointly examining oscillatory and aperiodic activity. Here, we address these key gaps by evaluating the capacity of both oscillatory and aperiodic features of EEG power spectra, derived from high-density recordings, to predict vigilance as a continuous variable. Across three independent datasets, we consistently show that although oscillatory features reliably track changes in vigilance, they are unequivocally outperformed by aperiodic activity. Aperiodic features demonstrate a stronger, more linear, and spatially consistent relationship with both objective and subjective indices of vigilance, offering a more robust and scalable physiological marker of this fundamental feature of the brain.

">Intrinsic Gestational Timing Governs Human Cerebellar Development After Preterm Birth</a></h4>

              
                Intrinsic biological clocks govern human brain development, but whether these programs recover from early disruption, such as premature birth, remains unknown. The cerebellum, with peak maturation in the last trimester, provides a model to address this challenge. We analyzed an unprecedented combination of in-vivo and postmortem cohorts of human postnatal cerebella spanning 22-42 weeks gestation, integrating longitudinal neuroimaging, spatial transcriptomics, and machine-learning-based histology to capture developmental states inaccessible to experimental models. Gestational age imposed lasting differences in postnatal cerebellar growth, architecture, and molecular programs. Spatially resolved gene expression data revealed lineage-specific rules: granule cells followed an immutable developmental clock, whereas Purkinje cells failed to undergo the maturation-linked reduction in cell numbers, retaining their population but with reduced dendritic complexity, reflected by a thinner molecular layer after early extrauterine transition. These findings redefine prematurity as a state-dependent arrest of intrinsic brain programs and provide a foundation for regenerative and neuroprotective interventions.

">Targeting Lysosomal pH Restores Mitochondrial Quality Control in GBA1-Mutant Parkinsons Disease</a></h4>

              
                Heterozygous mutations in the Glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA1), encoding the lysosomal hydrolase Beta-glucocerebrosidase (GCase), are a genetic risk factor for Parkinsons disease (PD). To explore the pathophysiological consequences of these mutations, we have used fibroblasts and dopaminergic neurons generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from patients with GBA1-related PD. GCase activity, lysosomal acidification, protease activity, mitophagy and mitochondrial bioenergetic function were all impaired. Mitochondria were fragmented, with reduced membrane potential and oxygen consumption. We propose that impaired bioenergetic function is a consequence of impaired lysosomal acidification and compromised mitophagy. The V-ATPase complex drives lysosomal acidification. Its assembly is regulated by MTORC1, which is constitutively phosphorylated in mutant cells. FLIM-FRET measurements confirmed impaired V-ATPase assembly which reversed following rapamycin treatment. Acidic nanoparticles, which accumulate in lysosomes, rescued lysosomal pH, and restored mitophagy and mitochondrial membrane potential in GBA1 mutant dopaminergic neurons. These data identify a core pathway as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of GBA1-mediated PD.

">Electrical stimulation elicits space- and parameter-dependent spiking responses in human cortical organoids</a></h4>

              
                Electrical stimulation (ES) is used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders and investigate brain dynamics, yet its effects on human cortical microcircuits remain poorly understood. Cortical organoids provide a unique platform to investigate these mechanisms in isolation from subcortical and long-range cortical inputs. Here we illustrate how cortical organoids respond to ES, identifying the response profiles of isolated cortical circuits while detailing a roadmap of how ES parameters affect the organoid spiking activity. We employed a high-density multielectrode array to record neuronal activity from cortical organoids (n=417 units in N=7 organoids) during ES, systematically varying stimulation frequency, intensity, pulse width, and charge density. By analyzing single unit spiking activity, we found that ES elicits excitatory, inhibitory, and mixed responses in 39%, 12%, and 17% of the units, respectively. On average, this response lasted 100 ms and became stable within 26 trials. The magnitude of both excitatory and inhibitory responses was maximal near the stimulation site and decayed with distance. The response magnitude was inversely correlated with pulse intensity and duration, but not with stimulation frequency and charge density. These findings demonstrate that local cortical circuits are sufficient to initiate the early excitatory phase of the canonical ES response, whose magnitude depends on ES parameters, and can sustain the excitatory phase for over 100 ms. The reduced late inhibitory phase, together with the absence of late excitatory components observed 200 ms after ES in intact adult brains in-vivo, suggests that these phases may depend on neuronal maturation or inter-area connections. Our work thus establishes cortical organoids as a framework for studying the local contributions to ES-induced activity in a developmental model of the human cortex.

">Coping strategy dynamics and resilience profiles after early life stress revealed by behavioral sequencing</a></h4>

              
                Animal models can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying stress-related disorders. Yet, significant translational challenges persist, as laboratory behavioral assays are often reductionistic, with limited attention to ethologically relevant behavioral diversity. Recent advances in high-throughput pose-estimation tools and computational ethology methods are addressing this limitation by enhancing the resolution and validity of behavioral phenotyping. In this context, it is known that early life stress (ELS) reshapes how animals handle subsequent threats later in life, but the fine-scale dynamics and ethological details of this shift remain elusive. To overcome this, we combined a deep-learning pose-estimation pipeline (DeepLabCut) with a supervised freezing classifier (SimBA) and an unsupervised behavioral motifs identification platform (keypoint MoSeq) to study in detail the diversity and dynamics of behavior in an auditory fear-conditioning (FC) paradigm in two independent cohorts of adult male mice that were exposed to ELS through the limited bedding and nesting (LBN) paradigm. We first validated the blunted freezing response after ELS in a supervised manner using SimBA. Next, keypoint MoSeq segmented the same pose-estimation data into ethologically meaningful motifs over time. When compared to control animals, ELS offspring showed an altered FC response, reduced behavioral entropy and limited diversity in their behavioral repertoire. Such response was characterized by longer active-behavior bouts and more recurrent transitions between states, indicating a more stereotyped and predictable response. Multidimensional scaling of time-binned behavioral vectors and distance metrics identified a resilient subpopulation within the ELS group that displayed a control-like behavioral profile, characterized by a steeper increase in freezing behavior during the FC task and a more diverse behavioral repertoire with reduced recurrence of stereotyped actions, less frequent and shorter active bouts and prolonged passive responses. Overall, our findings suggest that ELS shifts the balance between passive and active coping strategies and that resilience is marked by a less stereotypical yet more diverse and flexible behavioral response to a subsequent stressful demand. Finally, we further validated the unsupervised behavioral motifs with a predictive model that identified distinctive kinematic features of these responses, which could be used to build new behavioral classifiers that can be applied in other behavioral paradigms. These results demonstrate the potential of computational ethology to dissect complex behavioral patterns and improve our understanding of individual stress responses. By combining supervised and unsupervised behavioral analysis tools, we can deepen our understanding of the latent structure of stress behavior and identify objective markers of vulnerability and resilience.

">Absence of short-term axon initial segment plasticity in human, mouse, and rat cortical circuits</a></h4>

              
                Maintaining neuronal inputs and outputs within the physiological range relies on the ability of neurons to update their responsiveness to inputs dependent on changing activity levels. Termed homeostatic plasticity, the mechanisms that neurons employ to control their responsiveness are varied, and proposed to include structural changes to a key neuronal structure, the axon initial segment (AIS). As the site of action potential initiation, the AIS has been postulated to rapidly change its length in response to increased or decreased cellular and circuit activity. To date, AIS structural plasticity has only been tested in tissue cultures and rodent models. In our current study, we assess the ability of neurons to alter their AIS length over a variety of timescales in ex vivo rodent and human brain slices, human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and in mice dark-reared during early life; using a combination of electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry. We find no evidence for changes to AIS length following depolarisation for up to 3 hours, despite positive controls confirming modulated activity. However, we do find that neuronal physiological properties are altered by changes in activity, but these are largely independent of action potential initiation associated with the AIS. In summary, we find no evidence supporting a role for AIS structural plasticity in mouse, rat, or human cortical neurons.

">Frequency-specific maturation of cortical organization and social-cognitive links from childhood to adolescence</a></h4>

              
                The human brain unfolds its functional architecture over multiple timescales during childhood and adolescence, yet we know little about how these developmental trajectories vary between individuals. Slow brain signals at different frequencies are thought to support distinct functional processes, but their contribution to shaping large-scale cortical organization across development remains unclear. Here, we map the maturation of cortical organization by decomposing spontaneous slow brain activity into multiple frequency bands in participants aged 6-19 years. We identify a reproducible three-stage progression - child-like, transitional, and adult-like configurations - whose timing depends on frequency: faster dynamics mature earliest, intermediate frequencies develop gradually, and lower-frequency dynamics reorganize abruptly around puberty. Individual cognitive and social traits modulate these trajectories: children with higher social anxiety or higher IQ reach adult-like configurations earlier in specific frequency bands, whereas lower-IQ children show generalized delays. These results reveal that cortical organization matures along multiple, frequency-specific timescales and that intellectual and socio-emotional factors shape its pace. Our multi-frequency framework provides a new perspective on hierarchical brain development and may inform biomarkers for atypical neurodevelopment.

<p>A high-resolution electron microscopy dataset of a mid-morphogenesis (comma stage) <i>C. elegans</i> embryo was used to reconstruct developmental intermediates as sensory neurons and their glial partners assemble into sense organs. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p><i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> sense organs provide a powerful model for understanding how different cell types interact to assemble a functional organ. Each sense organ is composed of two glial cells, called the sheath and socket, and one or more neurons. A major challenge in studying their development has been the lack of methods to directly observe these structures in the embryo. Here, we mine a recently published high-resolution ultrastructural dataset of a comma-stage embryo that provides an untapped resource for visualizing early developmental events. From this dataset, we reconstructed all head sense organs (two amphid [AM], four cephalic [CEP], six inner labial [IL], four outer labial quadrant [OLQ], and two outer labial lateral [OLL]). Symmetric sense organs were at different stages of morphogenesis, allowing us to infer developmental steps by which they form. First, we found that the sheath glial cell begins wrapping its partner neurons at the distal tip of the dendrites where it self-fuses into a seamless tube and then “zippers” down the dendrite. In many cases, sheath glia wrap the progenitors of partner neurons prior to their terminal division. After sheath wrapping has begun, the socket glia wraps the sheath glia circumferentially before presumably elongating to form the mature sheath–socket channel. We also observed transient interactions not found in the mature animal, such as amphid sheath glia wrapping the AUA neuron, that may reflect ancestral relationships. This study demonstrates the value of large public EM datasets that can be mined for new insights and sheds light on how neurons and glia undergo coordinated morphogenesis.</p>

                Anastasaki and colleagues establish a previously unknown glutamate growth dependency in pediatric low-grade brain tumors (gliomas). Glioma cells hijack normal neuron-glial molecular circuits present during neurodevelopment, using aberrant glutamate receptor stimulation to activate PDGFRα/ERK via Src. This uncovers a molecular link between neurotransmitter signaling and tumor growth in children.

                Zhou et al. show that creatine sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis by impairing ERK2 activation, thereby inhibiting ERK2-mediated stabilization of FSP1. Combining creatine supplementation with targeting PD-1 synergistically enhances anti-tumor immunity in mice. These results suggest that creatine activates ferroptosis, induces tumor suppression, and enhances ferroptosis-based treatments for CRC.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89106">Evidence for deliberate burial of the dead by Homo naledi</a></h4>

              
                In this study, we describe new results of excavations in the Dinaledi Subsystem of the Rising Star cave system, South Africa. In two areas within the Hill Antechamber and the Dinaledi Chamber, this work uncovered concentrations of abundant <i>Homo naledi</i> fossils including articulated, matrix-supported skeletal regions consistent with rapid covering by sediment prior to the decomposition of soft tissue. We additionally re-examine the spatial positioning of skeletal material and associated sediments within the Puzzle Box area, from which abundant <i>H. naledi</i> remains representing a minimum of six individuals were recovered in 2013 and 2014. Multiple lines of evidence exclude the hypothesis that skeletal remains from these three areas come from bodies that decomposed on the floor of the chamber or within a shallow depression prior to burial by sediments. The spatial positioning of skeletal material, the topography of the subsystem, and observations on sediments within and surrounding features exclude the hypothesis that rapid burial by sediment was a result of gravity-driven slumping or spontaneous movement of sediments. We present a minimal hypothesis of hominin cultural burial and test the evidence from all three areas, finding that this hypothesis is most compatible with the pattern of evidence. These results suggest that mortuary behavior, including cultural burial, was part of the repertoire of <i>Homo naledi</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105451">Coral anthozoan-specific opsins employ a novel chloride counterion for spectral tuning</a></h4>

              
                Animal opsins are G protein-coupled receptors that have evolved to sense light by covalently binding a retinal chromophore via a protonated (positively charged) Schiff base. A negatively charged amino acid in the opsin, acting as a counterion, stabilizes the proton on the Schiff base, which is essential for sensitivity to visible light. In this study, we investigate the spectroscopic properties of a unique class of opsins from a reef-building coral belonging to the anthozoan-specific opsin II group (ASO-II opsins), which intriguingly lack a counterion residue at any of established sites. Our findings reveal that, unlike other known animal opsins, the protonated state of the Schiff base in visible light-sensitive ASO-II opsins is highly dependent on exogenously supplied chloride ions (Cl<sup>−</sup>). By using structural modeling and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations to interpret spectroscopy data, we conclude that, in the dark state, ASO-II opsins employ environmental Cl<sup>−</sup> as their native counterion, while a nearby polar residue, Glu292 in its protonated neutral form, facilitates Cl<sup>−</sup> binding. In contrast, Glu292 plays a crucial role in maintaining the protonation state of the Schiff base in the light-activated protein, serving as the counterion in the photoproduct. Furthermore, Glu292 is involved in G protein activation of the ASO-II opsin, suggesting that this novel counterion system coordinates multiple functional properties.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102840">Automatic and accurate reconstruction of long-range axonal projections of single-neuron in mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Single-neuron axonal projections reveal the route map of neuron output and provide a key cue for understanding how information flows across the brain. Reconstruction of single-neuron axonal projections requires intensive manual operations in tens of terabytes of brain imaging data and is highly time-consuming and labor-intensive. The main issue lies in the need for precise reconstruction algorithms to avoid reconstruction errors, yet current methods struggle with densely distributed axons, focusing mainly on skeleton extraction. To overcome this, we introduce a point assignment-based method that uses cylindrical point sets to accurately represent axons and a minimal information flow tree model to suppress the snowball effect of reconstruction errors. Our method successfully reconstructs single-neuron axonal projections across hundreds of GBs (Gigabytes) images within a mouse brain with an average of 80% f1-score, while current methods only provide less than 40% f1-score reconstructions from a few hundred MBs (Megabytes) images. This huge improvement is helpful for high-throughput mapping of neuron projections.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104238">Development of D-box peptides to inhibit the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome</a></h4>

              
                E3 ubiquitin ligases engage their substrates via ‘degrons’ - short linear motifs typically located within intrinsically disordered regions of substrates. As these enzymes are large, multi-subunit complexes that generally lack natural small-molecule ligands and are difficult to inhibit via conventional means, alternative strategies are needed to target them in diseases, and peptide-based inhibitors derived from degrons represent a promising approach. Here we explore peptide inhibitors of Cdc20, a substrate-recognition subunit and activator of the E3 ubiquitin ligase the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) that is essential in mitosis and consequently of interest as an anti-cancer target. APC/C engages substrates via degrons that include the ‘destruction box’ (D-box) motif. We used a rational design approach to construct binders containing unnatural amino acids aimed at better filling a hydrophobic pocket that contributes to the D-box binding site on the surface of Cdc20. We confirmed binding by thermal-shift assays and surface plasmon resonance and determined the structures of a number of the Cdc20-peptide complexes. Using a cellular thermal shift assay, we confirmed that the D-box peptides also bind to and stabilise Cdc20 in the cell. We found that the D-box peptides inhibit ubiquitination activity of APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> and are more potent than the small-molecule inhibitor Apcin. Lastly, these peptides function as portable degrons capable of driving the degradation of a fused fluorescent protein. Interestingly, we find that although inhibitory activity of the peptides correlates with Cdc20-binding affinity, degradation efficacy does not, which may be due to the complex nature of APC/C regulation and effects of degron binding of subunit recruitment and conformational changes. Our study lays the groundwork for the further development of these peptides as molecular therapeutics for blocking APC/C as well as potentially for harnessing the APC/C for targeted protein degradation.

                Mental planning is essential for producing action sequences. Despite the contribution of planning to many everyday activities, the neurocognitive processes that map a selected plan into a concrete course of action are unclear. We asked whether planning and execution are linked by abstract task relationships that are divorced from the specifics of action implementation. Human participants underwent functional MRI while performing a task that required encoding and maintaining abstract representations in order to plan and later apply those representations to execute action sequences. Our analyses revealed that dorsomedial prefrontal cortex encoded representations during the planning period that shifted progressively from information based on perceptual input to information associated with the abstract task context. These abstract representations were then used to translate between the action plan and its execution irrespective of the perceptual and motor details, indicating that DMPFC builds and sustains an abstract representational bridge that links planning to action.

">Lifestyle and transcriptional signatures associated with ethnicity/race-related variations in the functional connectome</a></h4>

              
                The functional connectome architecture of the human brain, which involves ethnicity/race characteristics, has significantly advanced our understanding of brain-behaviour relationships. However, the multifaceted underpinnings of ethnicity/race-related variations in the brain functional connectome remain largely unclear. In this study, we leverage precision individualized functional mapping to examine ethnicity/race-related differences in the brain's intrinsic functional organization, as well as their associations with lifestyle factors and transcriptional signatures. Our findings indicate that variations in network topography and functional connectivity across ethnic/racial groups follow a hierarchical pattern along the sensorimotor-association axis and are constrained by brain morphology. We identify lifestyle factors, primarily education and substance use, that mediate the associations between ethnicity/race and functional connectivity. Via the use of human brain gene expression data, we further demonstrate that cortical gene expression patterns are spatially associated with ethnicity/race-related variations in functional connectivity. Gene ontology analysis of ethnic/racial-associated genes reveals significant enrichment in biological processes, including synaptic signalling pathways and neuronal system development. Collectively, these results reveal the complex relationships between ethnicity/race-related differences in brain function and brain morphology, lifestyle factors, and transcriptomic profiles.

">Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling of Interoceptive Psychophysics</a></h4>

              
                Interoception, the capacity to sense, perceive, and metacognitively appraise viscerosensory and homeostatic signals, is a growing focus in psychology and psychiatry. Adaptive psychophysical tasks now allow quantification of perceptual sensitivity, bias, and precision in cardiac and respiratory domains. However, accurately estimating these parameters often requires large numbers of trials or participants, posing practical challenges, especially in clinical research where participant availability and tolerance are limited. One approach to reduce participant burden while maintaining statistical rigour is to optimise data analysis. Here, we present hierarchical Bayesian models tailored for cardiac and respiratory interoceptive psychophysics that efficiently estimate sensitivity, bias, and precision at both individual and group levels. Using simulations and empirical data, we validate these models and demonstrate that they allow enhanced inference relative to conventional approaches. To support adoption, we provide openly-accessible resources, including a tutorial on how to implement and fit these models in R (written with researchers without modelling expertise in mind) and an app for sample-size justification. These tools facilitate robust, efficient, and generalisable modelling of interoceptive performance, enabling rigorous studies even with limited trials or participant availability.

">Multi-Scale Anti-Correlated Neural States Dominate Naturalistic Whole-Brain Activity</a></h4>

              
                The human brain's response to naturalistic stimuli is characterized by complex spatiotemporal dynamics. Within these dynamics there is a transitioning structure between sets of anti-correlated neural states that is frequently observed but has not been systematically investigated across scales. In this paper, we use three different naturalistic fMRI datasets to quantify anti-correlation in global and local neural states during naturalistic viewing or listening and investigate their interdependence and their relationship to changes in the stimuli. We demonstrate that continuous naturalistic brain activity shows an anti-correlational structure that spans both global and local spatial scales, with regions in the dorsal attention network showing strong alignment between local and global state transitions. On the global scale, ongoing dynamics are dominated by two antagonistic states that correspond to Default Mode Network and Task Positive Network configurations, with a third transitional state mediating between them. On the local scale, we observe anti-correlated neural states that are associated with periods of relatively high and low brain activity. Across the brain, these are driven by subsets of voxels that are systematically anti-correlated with their area's dominant activity pattern. This antagonism is related to stimulus changes, which tend to trigger a switch to the TPN state globally and to high activity states locally. On the local scale we also see a modality-specific pattern, with visual changes mostly driving transitions in visual cortical regions and auditory changes predominantly affecting auditory and language-related areas. The consistency of these findings across datasets with different stimulus types (audiovisual and purely auditory) indicates that anti-correlated neural states represent a domain-general organizational principle of brain function. We propose that anti-correlated dynamics functionally represent a convergent solution to the fundamental challenge of maintaining coherent internal representations while remaining responsive to meaningful changes in the environment.

">The effects of action-based predictions in early visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                During voluntary movement, predictions about the sensory consequences of an action typically result in reduced sensory sensitivity. The forward model theory proposes that this reduced sensitivity is due to neural suppression or cancellation of sensory action outcomes. However, recently this theory has been challenged by three alternative theories: the pre-activation account, sharpening, and the opposing processes theory. In this fMRI study, we directly tested and compared these four theories using univariate and multivariate analyses both prior to and during stimulus presentation. Participants performed a visual orientation discrimination task on two sequentially presented gratings, which were either presented automatically (passive condition) or triggered by their own button press (active condition). Auditory cues at trial onset indicated the overall grating orientation, followed by a preparatory phase in which participants anticipated the upcoming stimuli. During this phase, the predicted stimulus orientation was decodable from early visual cortex activity in both active and passive conditions at levels significantly above chance, indicating pre-activation of the predicted orientation, but with no difference between active and passive conditions. BOLD responses did not emerge earlier in active conditions, arguing against the pre-activation theory. During stimulus presentation, actively generated stimuli elicited larger BOLD responses than passively presented ones, contradicting the forward model theory, which predicts overall response suppression. Decoding accuracy did not differ between conditions, inconsistent with the sharpening hypothesis, which predicts enhanced neural precision for actively generated stimuli. Instead, our findings align most closely with the opposing processes theory, which posits pre-activation in both conditions. However, the stronger BOLD response for actively generated stimuli is not predicted by any existing theory, suggesting that additional mechanisms - such as heightened attention or motor-related enhancement - may contribute to sensory processing during self-initiated actions.

">Species-specific Rates of Fatty Acid MetabolismSet the Scale of Temporal Patterning of Corticogenesisthrough Protein Acetylation Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Developmental processes display temporal differences across species, leading to divergence in organ size and composition. In the cerebral cortex, neurons of diverse identities are generated sequentially through a temporal patterning mechanism conserved throughout mammals. This corticogenesis process is considerably prolonged in the human species, leading to increased brain size and complexity, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we found that human cortical progenitors displayed lower levels of fatty acid oxidation than their mouse counterparts, in line with their protracted pattern. Treatments that enhance mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) accelerated the development of human cortical organoids, including faster progression of neural progenitor cell fate and precocious generation of late-born neurons and glia. FAO accelerated temporal patterning through increased Acetyl-CoA-dependent protein acetylation, including on specific histone transcriptional marks. Thus, species-specific metabolic rates regulate the turnover of post-translation modifications to set the scale of temporal gene regulatory networks of corticogenesis.

">Neurophysiological Markers for the Acute Pain Model in Rats Under Urethane-induced Anesthesia</a></h4>

              
                Certain neurophysiological mechanisms of pain can be investigated in anesthetized animals, and such a model is potentially useful for the development of pain treatment. Yet, the interference of pain-related neural patterns and anesthesia-related patterns should be understood. Here we studied he interplay between acute pain-induced and urethane-induced EEG activity. We analyzed the activity of the rats' somatosensory cortex under urethane-induced anesthesia both before and after introducing a painful stimulus (formalin injection into the left hind limb). Our analysis of the EEG parameters, such as EEG amplitude, amplitude differences between the left and right hemispheres, and spectral entropy showed significant pain-related effects. The responses to painful stimuli depended on the anesthesia phase.

">Evidence of spinal cord comparator modules for rapid corrections of movements</a></h4>

              
                Successful movement requires continuous adjustments in response to changes in internal and external environments. To do so, neural circuits continuously compare efference copies of motor commands with sensory input to respond to sensory prediction errors. Some responses need to be very fast and, for limbs, likely occur in as yet undefined spinal cord circuits. Here, we describe spinal circuits involving dI3 neurons, showing that they receive multimodal sensory inputs and direct efferent copies from both Renshaw cells and motor neurons. We further show that they form connections to motor pools, including diverging connections to antagonist motor nuclei. Reducing dI3 neuronal activity diminished stumbling responses, as did disrupting Renshaw cell circuits, providing evidence for a comparator role of dI3 neurons for online corrections. Together, our findings reveal a pivotal role for dI3 neurons functioning as comparators of internal predictions and external sensory feedback to mediate rapid corrections of ongoing movements.

">In vivo inhibition of stearoyl-CoA desaturase modulates the hippocampal fatty acid profile and restores density of dendritic spines in the aggressive 5xFAD model of Alzheimer s disease</a></h4>

              
                While alterations in brain lipids are a central feature of Alzheimer s disease (AD), therapeutic strategies targeting brain lipid metabolism are still lacking. Prior preclinical work has shown that pharmacological inhibition of the fatty acid desaturase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), leads to recovery of hippocampal synapses with associated improvements in learning and memory in the slow-progressing 3xTg AD mouse model. Here, we used the rapidly progressing, highly amyloidogenic 5xFAD AD model to further delve into the effect of the SCD inhibitor (SCDi) on AD-associated fatty acid alterations and synapse loss. Hippocampus, cortex and plasma samples were collected from male and female 5xFAD and non-carrier control mice for fatty acid profiling and assessment of disease hallmarks. Plaque pathology, gliosis, and fatty acid alterations that included an increase in the C16:1/C16:0 desaturation index, a measure of SCD enzymatic activity, were apparent in the female hippocampus at 5 months of age, with similar fatty acid changes appearing in males by 8 months. Intracerebroventricular infusion of SCDi via osmotic pump for 28 days in 5 months old female 5xFAD and NC mice modulated the SCD-related fatty acid disturbances as well as PUFA concentrations. Quantification of Golgi staining revealed an SCDi-induced recovery of dendritic spine density. The beneficial effects of SCDi treatment on fatty acid balance and hippocampal dendritic spines in this more aggressive amyloidogenic 5xFAD model further support SCD inhibition as a promising therapeutic avenue for AD.

">Evaluation of Data-based Motion Correction Techniques for High Temporal Resolution Functional PET</a></h4>

              
                Functional Positron Emission Tomography (fPET) data offers novel insights into brain energy demands and molecular connectivity. Recent advances in improving temporal resolutions for this imaging technique have opened up new research possibilities. However, lower signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) inherent to short PET frames bring into question whether current realignment approaches still provide appropriate motion correction. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of standard motion correction methods and explore potential improvements for high temporal resolution fPET with 3s frames. We investigated two techniques aimed at improving the SNR to facilitate more accurate realignment of fPET images, in comparison to conventional motion correction: a deep-learning technique based on the application of a conditional generative adversarial network and an exponentially weighted sliding window average. Performance was evaluated by correlating rigid motion parameters between approaches and with simultaneously acquired fMRI data, and by assessing magnitudes of task-induced activation. Our results indicate that neither of the two methods substantially improve mitigation of motion artefacts. Given the increased computational effort of both techniques, we propose that the standard motion correction procedure is adequate for processing high temporal resolution fPET data. Nevertheless, future development of targeted strategies to enhance motion correction may further advance this imaging technique.

">Repeated Viewing of a Narrative Movie Changes Event Timescales in The Brain</a></h4>

              
                Many experiences occur repeatedly throughout our lives: we might watch the same movie more than once and listen to the same song on repeat. How does the brain modify its representations of events when experiences are repeated? We hypothesized that, with repeated viewing of a narrative movie, brain regions would adapt their event representations by becoming either finer (more detailed) or coarser (more generalized). To test this hypothesis, we analyzed data from 30 human participants who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while watching three 90-second clips from "The Grand Budapest Hotel" six times each. We used hidden Markov models and pattern similarity analysis applied to searchlights across the brain to quantify the strength of event structure at different timescales for each clip presentation. We then tested how event structure strength changed at both slow and fast timescales with repeated viewings. Most brain regions exhibited stability in the strength of event structure at both slow and fast timescales. Other regions, however, showed flexible event representations that became more or less granular across repeated clip presentations. Notably, several brain regions exhibited consistent changes in the strength of event structure at a slow timescale across different movie clips. Furthermore, in lateral occipital cortex and middle temporal gyrus, greater loss of event structure at a slow timescale predicted more detailed memory recall. These results highlight that event dynamics in the brain are not fixed, but can change flexibly with experience.

">Live access to the emotional dynamics of REM sleep dreams in lucid dreamers with narcolepsy</a></h4>

              
                Sleep helps regulate emotions, but it is still unclear whether -and how- the emotions we experience in dreams contribute to this regulation. To uncover the potential function of dream emotions, we must first understand what they are and how they unfold in dreams. The emotional content of dreams has mostly been studied using post-sleep dream reports, which provide a biased and static snapshot of a complex and dynamic experience. In this study, we took a more direct approach, accessing dream emotions in real-time. We asked twenty-four lucid dreamers with narcolepsy to report the emotional valence of their dreams, - positive, negative or neutral-, while still asleep, using predefined facial codes during daytime naps monitored with polysomnography. Of the 126 naps recorded, 62 contained at least one emotional code during REM sleep, yielding 191 codes in total. The ratios of positive and negative codes were evenly balanced per nap. The 33 naps with at least two codes allowed us to track the dream emotional dynamics. Over half of these naps showed opposite emotional valences (positive and negative). By measuring the time elapsed between codes, we estimated the average duration of a given dream's emotional valence in REM sleep to be about one minute. Positive emotions emerged on average earlier than negative ones during lucid REM sleep. These findings confirm the highly emotional nature of dreams and, more importantly, highlight that emotions in REM sleep dreams are fluid and fast-changing. Such emotional dynamics during REM sleep dreams may help us to better understand the mechanisms of the emotional regulatory function of dreams.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The dorsal midline thalamus (DMT) is composed of the paraventricular (PV) and paratenial (PT) nuclei. While the anatomical and functional properties of PV are well-established, PT has remarkably received very little attention—even though the efferent projections of PV and PT are very similar. Using a combination of retrograde tracing and immunohistochemistry, we examined the anatomical inputs to PT and compared them with those to the anterior and posterior PV and to the anterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus. In addition, we examined orexinergic and serotonergic afferents to the PT, comparing them with those to other thalamic nuclei. We found that PT and PV receive input from a common set of structures, including the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex, nuclei of the diagonal band, septum, subiculum of the hippocampus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, hypothalamus, reticular nucleus of the thalamus, dorsal raphe nucleus, and periaqueductal gray. However, the pattern and density of these various afferents to PT and PV significantly differed. For instance, PT received much stronger inputs from the orbitofrontal cortex, while PV received stronger projections from the subiculum of the hippocampus and more widespread input from the hypothalamus and the brainstem. By comparison, afferents to AD differed from PT (and PV), as AD received substantial input from the retrosplenial and anterior cingulate cortices, and uniquely from the lateral mammillary nucleus. Further, orexinergic (ORX) and serotonergic (5-HT) fibers distributed at best modestly to PT, which contrasted with quite dense ORX and 5-HT innervation of PV. The present findings, essentially representing the first comprehensive examination of afferent projections to PT, show that the inputs to PT mainly arise from limbic forebrain structures—with pronounced projections from the orbitofrontal cortex, nuclei of the diagonal band, and the reticular nucleus of the thalamus. The functional properties of PT partially overlap with those of PV, but as described herein PT also participates in unique affective, cognitive, and motivational behaviors.</p>

<p>The multi-compartmental organization of spleen-projecting neurons—from the celiac ganglia to the spleen—complicates anatomical identification. We provide a dissection guide, characterize their microstructure, and use neuronal tracing to validate the celiac ganglia–spleen connection while demonstrating that these neurons can be transduced by a viral vector.

</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In recent years, several studies have demonstrated the crucial role played by the sympathetic spleen innervation in regulating immune cell function involving fighting pathogens or tissue injury. These findings have sparked interest across different research fields with a common goal of understanding and manipulating splenic sympathetic activity to modulate immune function and inflammation. However, the anatomical identification of spleen-projecting neurons in rodents presents a considerable challenge, given the multi-compartmentalized location of their cellular components.</p>
<p>This article addresses this challenge by providing a detailed anatomical dissection guide of the mouse celiac ganglion and splenic nerve, harboring the cell body and projecting axons, respectively. By combining antero- and retrograde neuronal tracing, immunofluorescence, 3D reconstruction, and viral tracing techniques, we validate the connectivity between the celiac ganglion and the spleen and provide insights into their microanatomy. Importantly, we demonstrate the feasibility of viral transduction in these neurons. Additionally, we identified nerve-associated macrophages (NAMs) within the splenic nerve and demonstrated their responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli. Our findings offer a comprehensive anatomical framework for studying spleen-projecting neurons, paving the way for future investigations into their role in immune regulation and inflammation, as well as their manipulation using advanced neurobiological tools.</p>

Bone health is a growing concern in aging populations, and bioactive peptides in dairy products offer a promising approach to preventing bone-related diseases. However, the lack of a public database for osteogenic peptides (OPs) has limited the computational detection efforts. In this work, we introduce OP-AND, a curated public database of osteogenic peptides. We also propose a novel hypothesis that peptides derived from proteins involved in osteoclast formation may serve as non-osteogenic. Considering the limited availability of OP data, we present SimPep, a deep learning framework that achieves 86.87% accuracy and 76.88% area under receiver-operating characteristic curve score using 5-fold cross-validation. SimPep’s performance is further evaluated on external datasets, and a pipeline is introduced to select potential OPs for experimental studies. The camel milk alpha s1-casein peptide ‘MKLLILTCLVAVALARPKYPLRYPEVF’ is highlighted as a top candidate for future exploration. The OP-AND database is available in https://github.com/CBRC-lab/SimPep_and_OP-AND.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013376">The R-loop grammar predicts R-loop formation under different topological constraints</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Margherita Maria Ferrari, Svetlana Poznanović, Manda Riehl, Jacob Lusk, Stella Hartono, Georgina Gonzalez-Isunza, Frédéric Chédin, Mariel Vázquez, Nataša Jonoska</p>

R-loops are transient three-stranded nucleic acids that form during transcription when the nascent RNA hybridizes with the template DNA, freeing the non-template strand of the DNA. There is growing evidence that R-loops play important roles in physiological processes such as the regulation of gene expression, and that they contribute to chromosomal instability and disease. It is known that R-loop formation is influenced by both the sequence and the topology of the DNA substrate, but many questions remain about how R-loops form and the three-dimensional structures that they adopt. Here we represent an R-loop as a word in a formal grammar, the <i>R-loop grammar</i>. We use the R-loop grammar to predict R-loop formation. We train the R-loop grammar on experimental data obtained by single-molecule R-loop footprinting and sequencing (SMRF-seq). Despite not explicitly encoding topological information, the R-loop grammar accurately predicts R-loop formation on plasmids with varying starting topologies and outperforms previous methods in R-loop prediction.

                <p>by Arnab Mutsuddy, Jonah R. Huggins, Aurore K. Amrit, Atalanta Manuela Harley-Gasaway, Cemal Erdem, Evan T. Jones, Olivia G. Laurine, Jon C. Calhoun, Marc R. Birtwistle</p>

Data from cell viability assays, which measure cumulative division and death events in a population and reflect substantial cellular heterogeneity, are widely available. However, interpreting such data with mechanistic computational models is hindered because direct model/data comparison is often muddled. We developed an algorithm that tracks simulated division and death events in mechanistically-detailed single-cell lineages to enable such a model/data comparison and suggest causes of cell-cell drug response variability. Using our previously developed model of mammalian single-cell proliferation and death signaling, we simulated drug dose response experiments for four targeted anti-cancer drugs (alpelisib, neratinib, trametinib and palbociclib) and compared them to experimental data. Simulations are consistent with data for strong growth inhibition by trametinib (MEK inhibitor) and overall lack of efficacy for alpelisib (PI-3K inhibitor), but are inconsistent with data for palbociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) and neratinib (EGFR inhibitor). Model/data inconsistencies suggest that (i) the importance of CDK4/6 for driving the cell cycle may be overestimated, and (ii) the cellular balance between basal (tonic) and ligand-induced signaling is a critical determinant of receptor inhibitor response. Simulations show subpopulations of rapidly and slowly dividing cells in both control and drug-treated conditions. Variations in mother cells prior to drug treatment impinging on ERK pathway activity are associated with the rapidly dividing phenotype and trametinib resistance. This work lays a foundation for the application of mechanistic modeling to large-scale cell viability datasets and better understanding determinants of cellular heterogeneity in drug response.

                <p>by Francesca Soncin</p>

The placenta is one of the most diverse organs among eutherian mammals, and comparative placentation studies can reveal fundamental processes that support a successful pregnancy. A new study in PLOS Biology uses swine placental organoids and in vivo spatial transcriptomics to uncover key insights into placental cell diversity and evolution.

More work is needed to characterize the evolutionary diversity of placental development in eutherian mammals. This Primer discusses a recent PLOS Biology study that provides a rich spatial transcriptomic characterization of the porcine placenta and develops a new swine trophoblast organoid model

<p>Graphical abstract illustrating the study design, experimental workflow, and key findings from single-cell profiling of peripheral mononuclear cells in multiple sclerosis patients undergoing anti-CD20 therapy, revealing disease- and treatment-associated immune signatures.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to investigate disease-related and anti-CD20 therapy-related changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients compared to healthy controls (HC) using multi-omics single-cell analysis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Targeted single-cell sequencing of transcriptomes and epitopes was performed on PBMCs isolated from 64 blood samples collected from MS patients at baseline and at 3 time points following anti-CD20 treatment, alongside HC. Multicolor spectral flow cytometry was performed on 15 of the samples.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cell cluster analysis identified a subpopulation of classical monocytes with significantly high interleukin-1 beta (<i>IL1B</i>) expression and a pro-inflammatory profile compared to other monocyte clusters. This monocyte cluster expressed genes of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, such as <i>CXCL8</i>, <i>CCL3</i>, <i>CCL4</i>, and <i>TNFα</i> and was a major cell transmitter subset within the intercellular communication network. The IL1B<sup>high</sup> monocyte cluster was prevalent in HC (8.1% of PBMCs), but reduced in untreated MS patients (0.8% of PBMCs). High <i>CXCR4</i> expression and Gene Ontology-term analysis indicated that IL1B<sup>high</sup> monocytes from MS patients had central nervous system (CNS)-infiltrating abilities in contrast to HC, likely regulated by <i>LEF1</i>. After anti-CD20 treatment, IL1B<sup>high</sup> monocytes showed changes in pro-inflammatory gene expression and <i>MYC</i>-associated regulatory networks, and their abundance increased 6-fold in the blood.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our single-cell analysis identified a unique peripheral IL1B<sup>high</sup> monocyte cluster with a suggested CNS-infiltrating cellular phenotype that may explain its lower abundance in the blood of untreated compared to anti-CD20 treated MS patients. Treatment-associated changes in this population may contribute to the non-B cell related effects of anti-CD20 therapy. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a highly variable, multisystemic genetic disorder caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the 3′ untranslated region of <i>DMPK.</i> Toxicity is exerted by repeat-containing <i>DMPK</i> transcripts that sequester muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins and lead to deleterious yet predictable changes in alternative splicing. To contend with high phenotypic and molecular variability that complicate application of viral-based therapies, we develop and test a DM1-responsive genetic element to control viral-based therapeutic output.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used MBNL-dependent cassette exons to generate adeno-associated virus (AAV)-compatible control elements (DMX<sup>on</sup>). Minigenes were tested in vitro using a Dox-inducible MBNL1 cell model and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived DM1 myotubes and in vivo using DM1 model mice following intramuscular and systemic AAV injection. DMX<sup>on</sup> splicing, correction of endogenous splicing or skeletal muscle myotonia, and prevention of cardiac toxicity associated with therapeutic MBNL1 overexpression were assessed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>DMX<sup>on</sup> cassettes respond to MBNL1 dose or expression of CUG repeat RNA. DMX<sup>on</sup> controlled expression of therapeutic MBNL1 protein can improve skeletal muscle myotonia or prevent cardiac toxicity due to MBNL1 overexpression in mice.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DMX<sup>on</sup> control elements can increase the therapeutic window of viral-based therapeutics in DM1, and activity is dependent upon delivered cargo and model severity. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In Parkinson's disease (PD), the power of beta oscillations (± 13–30 hertz [Hz]) from subthalamic nucleus (STN) local field potentials (LFPs) is associated with motor symptoms. Beta power can be used for adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) algorithms based upon symptom fluctuations. The time course of beta power modulations after levodopa intake at home remains to be described.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ten-minute averages of beta peak power were recorded in 33 patients with PD treated with STN-DBS for a median duration of 134 days during the titration phase. Median beta power after scheduled medication intakes (n = 24,103) and the effects of peak frequency, stun effect, stimulation amplitude, levodopa dose, and preoperative levodopa response were analyzed using cluster-based permutation testing.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Beta power was significantly reduced between 30 and 140 minutes after intake for stimulation amplitudes between 0 and 2.1 mA (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). This response was seen in low (12.7–20.5 Hz) but not high (21.5–30.3 Hz) beta frequencies. Significant clusters were found regardless of stun effect and preoperative levodopa response, during low stimulation amplitudes (&lt; 1 mA), and for 100 and 150 mg but not 50 mg doses. A linear mixed-effects model for the area under the curve (AUC) levodopa beta response (30–180 min) revealed a dose–response relationship, a stronger negative response in low-beta compared with high-beta frequencies, and no significant effect of stimulation amplitude.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>STN beta power responds to levodopa during low to moderate stimulation amperages, depending on the beta peak frequency and dose, which is informative for aDBS implementation. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Mechanotransduction is essential for complex cellular behaviors such as muscle contraction and hearing sensation. RNA processing is a molecular mechanism that regulates gene expression. Bais and Giudice review the recently growing body of research showing that mechanotransduction and RNA processing work together to modulate cell adaptations to mechanical forces.
