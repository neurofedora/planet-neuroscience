<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a neuromuscular disease caused by expansions of a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. SBMA is associated with the progressive loss of lower motor neurons, together with muscle weakness and atrophy. PolyQ-AR is converted to a toxic species upon binding to its natural ligands, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Our previous patch-clamp studies on a motor neuron-derived cell model of SBMA showed alterations in voltage-gated ion currents. Here, we identified and characterized chloride currents most likely belonging to the chloride channel-2 (ClC-2) subfamily, which showed significantly increased amplitudes in the SBMA cells. The treatment with the pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), a neuropeptide with a proven protective effect in a mouse model of SBMA, recovered chloride channel current alterations in SBMA cells. These observations suggest that the CIC-2 currents are affected in SBMA, an alteration that may contribute and potentially determine the pathophysiology of the disease.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) works effectively in inhibiting HIV replication in patients. However, the use of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) often causes side effects of neuropathic pain, and its mechanism remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we aim to explore the mechanism of NRTIs-induced neuropathic pain at the transcriptome level. C57BL/6 J mice were given intraperitoneal injection of zalcitabine (ddC) or saline (control) for 2 weeks, during which the mechanical pain threshold of the mice was detected by von Frey test. Then the L3~L5 spinal segments of the mice were isolated and subsequently used for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on the last day of treatment. The mechanical pain threshold of mice given ddC decreased significantly. Compared with the control group, ddC caused significant changes in the expression of 135 genes, of which 66 upregulated and 69 downregulated. Enrichment analysis showed that the functions of these genes are mainly enriched in regulation of transcription, multicellular organism development, and cell differentiation, and the pathway is mainly enriched in the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway and AMPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, key genes such as Gabrd, Kcnd3, Npcd, Insr, Lypd6, Scd2, and Mef2d were also identified. These may serve as drug targets for the prevention or treatment of NRTI-induced neuropathic pain.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Cortical disinhibition is the underlying pathological alteration contributing to neuropathic pain associated with peripheral nerve injury. Nerve injury resulting in disinhibition of the anterior cingulate cortex has been reported. However, the effect of optogenetic inhibition of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) on the sensory component of nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain has not been well studied. To investigate the feasibility of optogenetic ACC modulation, we injected an optogenetic virus or a null virus into the ACC of a nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain model. The unilateral ACC was modulated, and the optogenetic effect was measured by mechanical and thermal sensitivity tests. The assessment was performed in “pre—light off,” “stimulation—yellow light on,” and “post—light off” states. Optogenetic inhibition of the ACC in injury models revealed improved mechanical and thermal latencies with profound pain-relieving effects against nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain. The sensory thalamic discharge in electrophysiological in vivo recordings was also altered during laser stimulation. This finding indicates that hyperactivity of the ACC in nerve injury increases output to the spinothalamic tract through direct or indirect pathways. The direct photoinhibition of ACC neurons could play a vital role in restoring equilibrium and provide novel insight into techniques that can assuage peripheral nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The choroid plexus (CP) constitutes a barrier between the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which regulates the exchange of substances between these two fluids through mechanisms that are not completely understood. Polyamines as spermine, spermidine and putrescine are produced by all cells and are present in the CSF. Interestingly, their levels are altered in some neuronal disorders as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, thus increasing the interest in their signalling in the central nervous system (CNS). Cadaverine, on the other hand, is synthetized by the intestinal microbiome, suggesting that the presence of this bacterial metabolite in the CSF requires that it is up taken to the CNS across brain barriers. We knew that polyamines are detected by the olfactory signalling cascade operating at the CP, but the receptor involved had not been identified. The zebrafish TAAR13c was the only receptor known to bind a polyamine-cadaverine. Thus, we searched for a human receptor with homology to TAAR13c and found that some human TAARs including TAAR1 showed great homology. Then, we confirmed the expression of TAAR1 mRNA and protein in a human cell line of the CP, and in human CP samples. Calcium imaging assays after TAAR1 knockdown in these cells with a specific siRNA against TAAR1 showed a consistent reduction in the responses of these cells to cadaverine and spermidine, but not to spermine, suggesting that TAAR1 is activated by cadaverine and spermidine, but not spermine.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) plays a crucial role in controlling the resolution of inflammation. In this study, we aimed to assess gene expression and the level of IL-10 in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of rats, after a single injection of neurotoxicant trimethyltin chloride (TMT). It was shown that 4 weeks after the treatment with TMT, the level of IL-10 in the prefrontal cortex, but not in the hippocampus of TMT-treated rats, was increased. However, expression level of IL-10 mRNA was upregulated both in the hippocampus and in the prefrontal cortex 3 weeks after the injection. Concomitantly, within the same post-treatment period, the expression level of the cyclooxygenase-2 was upregulated in both brain structures, indicating the induction of neuroinflammation. Considering that TMT leads to the death of neurons mainly in the hippocampus, we assume that in contrast to the prefrontal cortex, the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in the hippocampus is not sufficiently increased to prevent the damaging effect of the neurotoxicant. Therefore, an exogenous increase in the level of IL-10 may be useful for the survival of neurons in conditions of neurotoxic damage to the hippocampus.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Loss-of-function variants in <em class="a-plus-plus">CREBBP</em> or <em class="a-plus-plus">EP300</em> result in Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome (RSTS). The previously reported cluster of variants in the last part of exon 30 and the beginning of exon 31 of <em class="a-plus-plus">CREBBP</em>, overlapping with the ZNF2 (zinc finger, ZZ-type; residues 1701 to 1744) and ZNF3 (zinc finger, TAZ-type; residues 1764 to 1853) domains, is associated with atypical RSTS. The main features include developmental delay, short stature, microcephaly, distinctive facial features, autistic behavior, feeding difficulties, recurrent upper airway infections, and hearing impairment. Here, we report a 2-year-7-month-old Chinese girl presenting mild cognitive impairments, developmental delay, short stature, recurrent upper airway infections, and facial dysmorphism that resembled the phenotypes of previously reported atypical RSTS patients. The characteristic facial and limb dysmorphism for RSTS was absent in our patient. In addition, our patient exhibited novel phenotypes including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), sleep problem, and abnormal walking posture. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified a novel de novo in-frame deletion variant in the beginning of exon 30 of <em class="a-plus-plus">CREBBP</em> (NM_004380:c.4897_4899delTTC, p.Phe1633del) in the HAT domain where no pathogenic variants have been previously reported to be responsible for atypical RSTS. Our case allows us to more accurately define the borders of the <em class="a-plus-plus">CREBBP</em> coding sequence resulting in atypical RSTS, which are extended to the beginning of exon 30 (residue 1633) at the 5′ end of <em class="a-plus-plus">CREBBP</em> in the HAT domain, and reveals novel phenotypes observed in our atypical Chinese RSTS patient.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">KLF4 is a zinc-finger transcription factor that plays an essential role in many biological processes, including neuroinflammation, neuron regeneration, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Through effects on these processes, KLF4 has likely roles in Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and traumatic brain injury. However, little is known about the role of KLF4 in more immediate behavioral processes that similarly depend upon broad changes in brain excitability, such as the sleep process. Here, behavioral approaches, western blot, and immunohistochemical experiments were used to explore the role of KLF4 on sedation and the potential mechanisms of those effects. The results showed that overexpression of KLF4 prolonged loss of righting reflex (LORR) duration in pentobarbital-treated mice and increased c-Fos expression in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO), while it decreased c-Fos expression in the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN). Moreover, overexpression of KLF4 reduced the expression of p53 in the hypothalamus and increased the expression of STAT3 in the hypothalamus. Therefore, these results suggest that KLF4 exerts sedative effects through the regulation of p53 and STAT3 expression, and it indicates a role of KLF4 ligands in the treatment of sleep disorders.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Spinal cord microcirculation plays an important role in maintaining the function of spinal cord neurons and other cells. Previous studies have largely focused on the ability of microtubule stabilization to inhibit the fibroblast migration and promote axon regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the effect of microtubule stabilization treatment on microcirculation reconstruction after SCI remains unclear. By using immunofluorescence, we found that microtubule stabilization treatment improved microcirculation reconstruction via increasing the number of microvessels, pericytes, and the perfused microvessels after SCI. To clarify the underlying mechanisms, rat brain microvascular endothelial cells and pericytes were subjected to glucose oxygen deprivation. By using flow cytometry and western blotting, we found that microtubule stabilization treatment inhibited apoptosis and migration of endothelial cells and pericytes but promoted proliferation and survival of endothelial cells and pericytes through upregulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), VEGF receptor 2, platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGFB), PDGF receptor β, and angiopoietin-1 after SCI. Taken together, this study provides evidence for the mechanisms underlying the promotion of microcirculation reconstruction after SCI by microtubule stabilization treatment. Importantly, this study suggests the potential of microtubule stabilization as a therapeutic target to reduce microcirculation dysfunction after SCI in the clinic.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative condition characterized by motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, resting tremor, and rigidity. PD diagnosis is based on medical history, review of signs, symptoms, neurological and physical examinations. Unfortunately, by the time the disease is diagnosed, dopamine (DA) neuronal loss is often extended, thereby resulting in ineffective therapies. Recent evidence suggests that neuroinflammation may be pivotal during PD onset and progression. However, suitable cellular models and biomarkers to detect early signs of neuroinflammation are still missing. In this study, we developed a well-differentiated DAergic neuronal cell line where we triggered a neuroinflammatory response to assess the temporal expression of the tissue- and urokinase plasminogen activators (tPA and uPA) and their endogenous inhibitor (PAI-1) along with that of pro-inflammatory mediators and the neuronal marker nNOS. Human neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y were differentiated into DAergic neuronal-like cells using a combination of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and serum depletion. Terminally-differentiated neurons were then exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for short (up to 24 h) or long term (up to 10 days) to mimic acute or chronic inflammation. Results demonstrated that uPA protein expression was stably upregulated during chronic inflammation, whereas the expression of nNOS protein better reflected the cellular response to acute inflammation. Additional studies revealed that the temporal induction of uPA was associated with increased AKT phosphorylation, but did not seem to involve cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) activation, nor the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In conclusion, our in vitro data suggests that nNOS and uPA may serve as viable candidate biomarkers of acute and chronic neuroinflammation.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">GSK-126 is recognized as an inhibitor of enhancer of zeste homolog-2 (EZH2) activity. Because of its inhibition of EZH2 activation, GSK-126 is considered a potential anti-tumor drug. EZH2 is a histone methyltransferase that catalyzes histone 3 tri-methylation at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), resulting in gene silencing. A previous report showed that decreased H3K27me3 levels in the hippocampus may promote seizure susceptibility, possibly restricting the clinical application of GSK-126. The role of GSK-126 in seizure susceptibility was investigated in this study. We first determined a critical concentration of pentamethazol (PTZ) under which mice exhibit no seizures. We then found that mice pretreated with GSK-126 and injected with the same concentration of PTZ experienced marked convulsions. Peripheral injections of GSK-126 decreased H3K27me3 levels in the hippocampus of mice, while some seizure-related genes (Oasl1, Sox7, armcx5, Ncx3, etc.) were found to be differentially expressed in the hippocampus of those mice . These differences in the expression levels might reflect the crucial role of these genes and related pathways in the promotion of seizure susceptibility. Our results suggest that GSK-126 promotes seizure susceptibility due to its role as an EZH2 inhibitor. These findings may provide evidence to support the development of GSK-126 as a clinical drug.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The mutation of the homeostatic iron regulatory genes (HFE) impaired the hepatic hepcidin transcription leading to the chronic excess of the iron pool, with the adverse consequences of free radical oxidative damages. We herein reported the findings of Thai family members who had the compound of uncommon HFE rs2794719, together with transferrin (TF) rs1867504, transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) rs7385804, and hemojuvelin (HJV) rs16827043 genetic variants involved in the hepcidin transcriptional pathway. These compounded genetic variants could produce the spectrum of clinical phenotypes that spanned from mild to moderate symptoms of chronic anemia to an established motor neuron disorder. The feasible pathophysiologies were the impairment of the transferrin receptor functions, which affected the endocytic uptake of halo-transferrin into the erythroblast precursors. Such a defect left the erythropoiesis depleted of their iron supply. These alterations also promoted the TfR-independent uptake of iron into other target tissues and left the TrF2/BMP-dependent-hepcidin activation pathway unattended. We used the predicted molecular interactive proteomes to support our speculated dysregulated iron metabolism. During the early stage of an elevated ferritin level, there was no inhibition of ferroportin activities from hepcidin. These pathophysiological processes went on to the point of an iron overload threshold. After that, the hepcidin transcription started to kick in with the resulting decreased serum iron levels and deterioration of clinical symptoms.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Mechanisms and progression of ischemic injuries in the retina are still incompletely clarified. Therefore, the time course of microglia activation as well as resulting cytokine expression and downstream signaling were investigated. Ischemia was induced in one eye by transiently elevated intraocular pressure (60 min) followed by reperfusion; the other eye served as a control. Eyes were processed for RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry analyses at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h as well as at 3 and 7 days. Already 2 h after ischemia, more microglia/macrophages were in an active state in the ischemia group. This was accompanied by an upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and TGFβ. Activation of TLR3, TLR2, and the adaptor molecule Myd88 was also observed after 2 h. NFκB revealed a wave-like activation pattern. In addition, an extrinsic caspase pathway activation was noted at early time points, while enhanced numbers of cleaved caspase 3<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup> cells could be observed in ischemic retinae throughout the study. Retinal ischemia induced an early and strong microglia/macrophage response as well as cytokine and apoptotic activation processes. Moreover, in early and late ischemic damaging processes, TLR expression and downstream signaling were involved, suggesting an involvement in neuronal death in ischemic retinae.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The effective prevention of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) needs to be explored, and the effect of preoperative pain on POCD remains unclear. We established a chronic pain model induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) and models of acute pain and anxiety without pain in mice that were subsequently subjected to partial hepatectomy surgery. Morris water maze (MWM) tests were performed to evaluate the learning and memory abilities of the mice. ELISA was used to measure IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in serum, and HPLC-MS was used to detect neurotransmitters in the prefrontal cortices and hippocampi of the mice. The results indicated that chronic pain induced by CCI might have significantly impaired the learning and memory abilities of mice, while acute pain and anxiety without pain only affected the memory abilities of mice. Perioperative acute pain increased the level of IL-1β in serum, and CCI might have increased the level of IL-6. CCI and acute pain increased dopamine (DA) levels in the cortex, similar to anxiety. Like anxiety, CCI increased 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Acute pain led to a decrease in the acetylcholine (ACH) level in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that acute pain and CCI-induced chronic pain might aggravate postoperative cognitive dysfunction via neurotransmitters and by changing the levels of inflammatory factors such as IL-1β and IL-6.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a multifactorial, central nervous system, immune-mediated disease characterized by inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration. Evidence suggests a steady rise in MS prevalence over the past five decades in the United States and around the world. Even with increased understanding of immunology, the specific etiological trigger of MS remains unknown. Evidence suggests that oxidative/nitroxidative stress is an important contributor to MS etiology, progression, and clinical symptoms. A multifaceted treatment approach aimed at counteracting oxidative/nitroxidative stress including MS disease–modifying medications, Mediterranean style diet, stress-relieving activities, smoking and alcohol cessation, exercise, and peer support programs is the best way to treat the disease.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Due to molecular mimicry, maternal antibacterial antibodies are suspected to promote neurodevelopmental changes in the offspring that finally can cause disorders like autism and schizophrenia. Using a human first trimester prenatal brain multiprotein array (MPA), we demonstrate here that antibodies to the digestive tract bacteria <em class="a-plus-plus">Helicobacter pylori</em> (α-<em class="a-plus-plus">HPy</em>) and <em class="a-plus-plus">Campylobacter jejuni</em> (α-<em class="a-plus-plus">CJe</em>) interact with different synaptic proteins, including the calcium sensor synaptotagmin 5 (Syt5). Interactions of both antisera with Syt5 were confirmed by Western blot with a HEK293-cells overexpression lysate of this protein. Immunofluorescence and Western blotting revealed SiMa cells to express Syt5, which also co-migrated with a band/spot labeled by either α-<em class="a-plus-plus">HPy</em> or α-<em class="a-plus-plus">CJe</em>. Functionally, a 12-h pretreatment of SiMa cells with 10 μg/ml of either α-<em class="a-plus-plus">HPy</em> or α-<em class="a-plus-plus">CJe</em> resulted in a significant reduction of acetylcholine(ACh)-dependent calcium signals as compared to controls. Also ACh-dependent vesicle recycling was significantly reduced in cells pretreated with either α-<em class="a-plus-plus">HPy</em> or α-<em class="a-plus-plus">CJe</em>. Similar effects were observed upon pretreatment of SiMa cells with Syt5-specific antibodies. In conclusion, the present study supports the view that prenatal maternal antibacterial immune responses towards <em class="a-plus-plus">HPy</em> and by this to Syt5 are able to cause functional changes, which in the end might contribute also to neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

Moreover, the regulatory network was constructed with the hub genes as seed nodes with associated transcription factors (TFs) and microRNA (miRNAs). In this analysis, we identified MYC as the major TF and the miRNAs <em class="a-plus-plus">miR-21</em>, <em class="a-plus-plus">miR-155</em>, <em class="a-plus-plus">miR-7</em>, and <em class="a-plus-plus">miR26A1</em> have a significant role in modulating the hub genes. Briefly, these significant hub genes and their enriched pathways, TFs, and miRNAs have aided in the better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying PD and its potential core target genes.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Recent studies have shed light on the involvement of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the initiation and development of stroke. However, the regulatory function of many lncRNAs in large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) has not been fully elucidated. Based on the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis recently proposed by Pandolfi, the present study was conducted using experimental techniques and bioinformatics to investigate the expression and regulatory function of a lncRNA involved in the development of LAA. The lncRNAs differentially expressed in stroke were obtained using meta-analysis, and one lncRNA was selected for experimental studies on patients with LAA (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 100) and healthy controls (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 100) using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The patients were also evaluated through meta-analysis to identify the function of the selected lncRNA, miRNAs, and mRNAs with altered expression in stroke. Finally, the experimental results and meta-analysis findings were integrated, and different functional groups were assigned. The results indicated that the level of lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1 was significantly lower in the patients with LAA compared to the healthy control subjects (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &gt; 0.05). Logistic regression analyses revealed that the expression of lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1 was inversely correlated with LAA (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> = 009, OR = 0.871, 95% CI: 0.786–0.965). In addition, a network of differentially expressed genes (DE genes) was created for miRNAs and mRNAs based on their association with lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1. Functional analysis showed that the DE genes in the network are involved in the apoptosis and alternative splicing of RNAs. The findings of the present study suggest that the downregulation of lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1 is associated with LAA development by interrupting the regulatory network of cells. The results of network analysis demonstrated that the lncRNA-RUNX1-IT1 could influence the expression of mRNAs and miRNAs involved in the apoptosis and alternative splicing of RNAs.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub> has been used for the past two decades as neuroprotective treatment in a variety of preterm conditions. Despite the putative advantages of MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub> as a neuroprotective agent in the preterm brain, the short- and long-term molecular function of MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub> as a neuroprotective agent has not been fully elucidated. Neuregulin (NRG1)-ErbB4 signaling plays a critical role in embryonic brain development, in the biology of dopaminergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic systems. We hypothesize that this pathway may be associated with the neuroprotective role of MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub>. The current study aims to investigate the ability of MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub> to modulate the normal developing expression pattern of selected genes related to the NRG1-ErbB, dopaminergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic systems. We demonstrate that overall short-term treatment of dam rats with MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub> affects the expression of fetal brain NRG1, NRG3, ErbB4, GAD67, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine D<sub class="a-plus-plus">2</sub> and D<sub class="a-plus-plus">1</sub> receptors, GluN1, and GluN2B. More specifically, the administration of MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub> alters the expression of NRG-ErbB, GAD67, TH, and D2R at early gestation day 16 (GD16) regardless of the activation of the maternal immune system by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our data suggest that MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub> treatment may affect the expression of major neuronal systems and pathways mostly at an early gestation day. These changes might be an initial clue (foundation stone) in the molecular mechanism that underlies the beneficial effect of MgSO<sub class="a-plus-plus">4</sub> as a neuroprotective agent for the developmental brain.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Psychosocial stress has been widely reported to contribute to psychiatric disturbances. Perturbations in the enzymes of GABAergic and cholinergic systems have been implicated as precursors in different stress-related neuropsychiatric diseases. Targeting glutamic acid decarboxylase-67 kDa (GAD67) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) via oxidative, nitrergic, and neuroinflammatory mechanisms have been recognized as prospective strategies for the prevention of psychosocial stress-induced behavioral impairments. Naringin, a neuro-active flavonoid compound isolated from citrus fruits, has been shown to produce memory-enhancing, antiepileptic, antidepressant, and anti-inflammatory activities similarly to ginseng, a very potent adaptogen. In this communication, we assessed the effect of naringin on social-defeat stress (SDS)-induced behavioral, GABAergic, cholinergic, oxidative, nitrergic, and neuroinflammatory changes in mice using the resident–intruder paradigm. The intruder male mice were culled into six groups. Groups 1 and 2 (normal- and SDS-controls) received sterile saline, groups 3–5 were given naringin (25-100 mg/kg, i.p.) whereas group 6 had ginseng (50 mg/kg, i.p.) daily for 14 days, but followed by 10 min SDS (physical and psychological) exposure to groups 2–6 with aggressor–resident mice. Behavioral effects using Y-maze, elevated-plus maze, sociability, and tail-suspension tests were assessed on day 14. GAD67, AChE enzymes, and biomarkers of oxidative, nitrergic, and neuroinflammatory changes were assayed in the striatum, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus. Naringin and ginseng reversed all SDS-induced behavioral impairments. Naringin increased the levels of GAD67 and decreased AChE activities in the striatum, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus. Furthermore, naringin reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6), malondialdehyde, nitrite concentrations, and increased glutathione levels in a region-dependent manner. Our study suggests that naringin attenuated SDS-induced behavioral endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disease through increased GAD67 synthesis, inhibition of AChE activity, oxidative, nitrergic stress, and neuroinflammatory processes in stress-sensitive brain regions.</p>

<p>by Pascal F. Hagolani, Roland Zimm, Renske Vroomans, Isaac Salazar-Ciudad</p>

How does morphological complexity evolve? This study suggests that the likelihood of mutations increasing phenotypic complexity becomes smaller when the phenotype itself is complex. In addition, the complexity of the genotype-phenotype map (GPM) also increases with the phenotypic complexity. We show that complex GPMs and the above mutational asymmetry are inevitable consequences of how genes need to be wired in order to build complex and robust phenotypes during development.
We randomly wired genes and cell behaviors into networks in EmbryoMaker. EmbryoMaker is a mathematical model of development that can simulate any gene network, all animal cell behaviors (division, adhesion, apoptosis, etc.), cell signaling, cell and tissues biophysics, and the regulation of those behaviors by gene products. Through EmbryoMaker we simulated how each random network regulates development and the resulting morphology (i.e. a specific distribution of cells and gene expression in 3D). This way we obtained a zoo of possible 3D morphologies. Real gene networks are not random, but a random search allows a relatively unbiased exploration of what is needed to develop complex robust morphologies. Compared to the networks leading to simple morphologies, the networks leading to complex morphologies have the following in common: 1) They are rarer; 2) They need to be finely tuned; 3) Mutations in them tend to decrease morphological complexity; 4) They are less robust to noise; and 5) They have more complex GPMs. These results imply that, when complexity evolves, it does so at a progressively decreasing rate over generations. This is because as morphological complexity increases, the likelihood of mutations increasing complexity decreases, morphologies become less robust to noise, and the GPM becomes more complex. We find some properties in common, but also some important differences, with non-developmental GPM models (e.g. RNA, protein and gene networks in single cells).<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RI6MFTnDlEo" width="1" />

<p>by Mengmeng Niu, Yajun He, Jing Xu, Liangping Ding, Tao He, Yong Yi, Mengyuan Fu, Rongtian Guo, Fengtian Li, Hu Chen, Ye-Guang Chen, Zhi-Xiong Jim Xiao</p>

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling plays a critical role in promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell migration, invasion, and tumor metastasis. ΔNp63α, the major isoform of p63 protein expressed in epithelial cells, is a key transcriptional regulator of cell adhesion program and functions as a critical metastasis suppressor. It has been documented that the expression of ΔNp63α is tightly controlled by oncogenic signaling and is frequently reduced in advanced cancers. However, whether TGF-β signaling regulates ΔNp63α expression in promoting metastasis is largely unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that activation of TGF-β signaling leads to stabilization of E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXO3, which, in turn, targets ΔNp63α for proteasomal degradation in a Smad-independent but Erk-dependent manner. Knockdown of FBXO3 or restoration of ΔNp63α expression effectively rescues TGF-β-induced EMT, cell motility, and tumor metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, clinical analyses reveal a significant correlation among TGF-β receptor I (TβRI), FBXO3, and p63 protein expression and that high expression of TβRI/FBXO3 and low expression of p63 are associated with poor recurrence-free survival (RFS). Together, these results demonstrate that FBXO3 facilitates ΔNp63α degradation to empower TGF-β signaling in promoting tumor metastasis and that the TβRI-FBXO3-ΔNp63α axis is critically important in breast cancer development and clinical prognosis. This study suggests that FBXO3 may be a potential therapeutic target for advanced breast cancer treatment.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/26UgbajAt_Y" width="1" />

<p>Over the last ten years, developments in whole-brain microscopy now allow for
high-resolution imaging of intact brains of small rodents such as mice. These
complex images contain a wealth of information, but many neuroscience
laboratories do not have all of the computational knowledge and tools needed to
process these data. We review recent open source tools for registration of
images to atlases, and the segmentation, visualisation and analysis of brain
regions and labelled structures such as neurons. Since the field lacks fully
integrated analysis pipelines for all types of whole-brain microscopy analysis,
we propose a pathway for tool developers to work together to meet this
challenge.

<p>In recent years, to improve the evolutionary algorithms used to solve
optimization problems involving a large number of decision variables, many
attempts have been made to simplify the problem solution space of a given
problem for the evolutionary search. In the literature, the existing approaches
can generally be categorized as decomposition-based methods and
dimension-reduction-based methods. The former decomposes a large-scale problem
into several smaller subproblems, while the latter transforms the original
high-dimensional solution space into a low-dimensional space. However, it is
worth noting that a given large-scale optimization problem may not always be
decomposable, and it is also difficult to guarantee that the global optimum of
the original problem is preserved in the reduced low-dimensional problem space.
This paper thus proposes a new search paradigm, namely the multi-space
evolutionary search, to enhance the existing evolutionary search methods for
solving large-scale optimization problems. In contrast to existing approaches
that perform an evolutionary search in a single search space, the proposed
paradigm is designed to conduct a search in multiple solution spaces that are
derived from the given problem, each possessing a unique landscape. The
proposed paradigm makes no assumptions about the large-scale optimization
problem of interest, such as that the problem is decomposable or that a certain
relationship exists among the decision variables. To verify the efficacy of the
proposed paradigm, comprehensive empirical studies in comparison to four
state-of-the-art algorithms were conducted using the CEC2013 large-scale
benchmark problems.

<p>Sexual selection is a fundamental aspect of evolution for all eukaryotic
organisms with mating types. This paper suggests intersexual selection is best
viewed as a mechanism to compensate for the unavoidable dynamics of coevolution
between sexes that emerge with isogamy. Using the NK model of fitness
landscapes, the conditions under which allosomes emerge are first explored.
This extends previous work on the evolution of sex where the fitness landscape
smoothing of a rudimentary form of the Baldwin effect is suggested as the
underlying cause. The NKCS model of coevolution is then used to show how
varying fitness landscape size, ruggedness, and connectedness can vary the
conditions under which a very simple sexual selection mechanism proves
beneficial. This is found to be the case whether one or both sexes exploit
sexual selection.

<p>Aided by recent advances in Deep Learning, Image Caption Generation has seen
tremendous progress over the last few years. Most methods use transfer learning
to extract visual information, in the form of image features, with the help of
pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network models followed by transformation of
the visual information using a Caption Generator module to generate the output
sentences. Different methods have used different Convolutional Neural Network
Architectures and, to the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic study
which compares the relative efficacy of different Convolutional Neural Network
architectures for extracting the visual information. In this work, we have
evaluated 17 different Convolutional Neural Networks on two popular Image
Caption Generation frameworks: the first based on Neural Image Caption (NIC)
generation model and the second based on Soft-Attention framework. We observe
that model complexity of Convolutional Neural Network, as measured by number of
parameters, and the accuracy of the model on Object Recognition task does not
necessarily co-relate with its efficacy on feature extraction for Image Caption
Generation task.

<p>Consumer grade cyber-physical systems are becoming an integral part of our
life, automatizing and simplifying everyday tasks; they are almost always
capable of connection to the network allowing remote monitoring and
programming. They rely on powerful programming languages, cloud
infrastructures, and ultimately on complex software stacks. Indeed, due to
complex interactions between hardware, networking and software, developing and
testing such systems is known to be a challenging task. Ensuring properties
such as dependability, security or data confidentiality is far from obvious.
Various quality assurance and testing strategies have been proposed.
</p>
<p>The most common approach for pre-deployment testing is to model the system
and run simulations with models or software in the loop. In practice, most
often, tests are run for a small number of simulations, which are selected
based on the engineers' domain knowledge and experience.
</p>
<p>We have implemented our approach in Python, using standard frameworks and
used it to generate scenarios violating temperature constraints for a smart
thermostat implemented as a part of our IoT testbed. Data collected from an
application managing a smart building have been used to learn models of the
environment under ever changing conditions. The suggested approach allowed us
to identify several pit-fails, scenarios (i.e. environment conditions), where
the system behaves not as expected.

<p>Generating diverse populations of high quality solutions has gained interest
as a promising extension to the traditional optimization tasks. We contribute
to this line of research by studying evolutionary diversity optimization for
two of the most prominent permutation problems, namely the Traveling
Salesperson Problem (TSP) and Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP). We explore
the worst-case performance of a simple mutation-only evolutionary algorithm
with different mutation operators, using an established diversity measure.
Theoretical results show most mutation operators for both problems ensure
production of maximally diverse populations of sufficiently small size within
cubic expected run-time. We perform experiments on QAPLIB instances in
unconstrained and constrained settings, and reveal much more optimistic
practical performances. Our results should serve as a baseline for future
studies.

<p>With the goal to provide absolute lower bounds for the best possible running

benchmark problems, we recently suggested a dynamic programming approach that
computes optimal expected running times and the regret values inferred when
deviating from the optimal parameter choice.

probabilities between different states can be expressed by relatively simple
mathematical expressions. With the goal to cover broader sets of problems, we

exactly, but in which they can be approximated numerically, up to arbitrary
precision, by Monte Carlo sampling.
</p>
<p>We apply our hybrid Monte Carlo dynamic programming approach to a
concatenated jump function and demonstrate how the obtained bounds can be used
to gain a deeper understanding into parameter control schemes.

<p>If machine failures can be detected preemptively, then maintenance and
repairs can be performed more efficiently, reducing production costs. Many
machine learning techniques for performing early failure detection using
vibration data have been proposed; however, these methods are often power and
data-hungry, susceptible to noise, and require large amounts of data
preprocessing. Also, training is usually only performed once before inference,
so they do not learn and adapt as the machine ages. Thus, we propose a method
of performing online, real-time anomaly detection for predictive maintenance
using Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM). Inspired by the human neocortex, HTMs
learn and adapt continuously and are robust to noise. Using the Numenta Anomaly
Benchmark, we empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art algorithms at preemptively detecting real-world cases of
bearing failures and simulated 3D printer failures. Our approach achieves an
average score of 64.71, surpassing state-of-the-art deep-learning (49.38) and
statistical (61.06) methods.

<p>Nonlinear network dynamics are notoriously difficult to understand. Here we
study a class of recurrent neural networks called combinatorial
threshold-linear networks (CTLNs) whose dynamics are determined by the
structure of a directed graph. They are a special case of TLNs, a popular
framework for modeling neural activity in computational neuroscience. In prior
work, CTLNs were found to be surprisingly tractable mathematically. For small
networks, the fixed points of the network dynamics can often be completely
determined via a series of {\it graph rules} that can be applied directly to
the underlying graph. For larger networks, it remains a challenge to understand
how the global structure of the network interacts with local properties. In
this work, we propose a method of covering graphs of CTLNs with a set of
smaller {\it directional graphs} that reflect the local flow of activity. While
directional graphs may or may not have a feedforward architecture, their fixed
point structure is indicative of feedforward dynamics. The combinatorial
structure of the graph cover is captured by the {\it nerve} of the cover. The
nerve is a smaller, simpler graph that is more amenable to graphical analysis.
We present three nerve theorems that provide strong constraints on the fixed
points of the underlying network from the structure of the nerve. We then
illustrate the power of these theorems with some examples. Remarkably, we find
that the nerve not only constrains the fixed points of CTLNs, but also gives
insight into the transient and asymptotic dynamics. This is because the flow of
activity in the network tends to follow the edges of the nerve.

<p>In a first-of-its-kind study, this paper proposes the formulation of
constructing prediction intervals (PIs) in a time series as a bi-objective
optimization problem and solves it with the help of Nondominated Sorting
Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). We also proposed modeling the chaos present in the
time series as a preprocessor in order to model the deterministic uncertainty
present in the time series. Even though the proposed models are general in
purpose, they are used here for quantifying the uncertainty in macroeconomic
time series forecasting. Ideal PIs should be as narrow as possible while
capturing most of the data points. Based on these two objectives, we formulated
a bi-objective optimization problem to generate PIs in 2-stages, wherein
reconstructing the phase space using Chaos theory (stage-1) is followed by
generating optimal point prediction using NSGA-II and these point predictions
are in turn used to obtain PIs (stage-2). We also proposed a 3-stage hybrid,
wherein the 3rd stage invokes NSGA-II too in order to solve the problem of
constructing PIs from the point prediction obtained in 2nd stage. The proposed
models when applied to the macroeconomic time series, yielded better results in
terms of both prediction interval coverage probability (PICP) and prediction
interval average width (PIAW) compared to the state-of-the-art Lower Upper
Bound Estimation Method (LUBE) with Gradient Descent (GD). The 3-stage model
yielded better PICP compared to the 2-stage model but showed similar
performance in PIAW with added computation cost of running NSGA-II second time.

<p>Deep reinforcement learning approaches have shown impressive results in a
variety of different domains, however, more complex heterogeneous architectures
such as world models require the different neural components to be trained
separately instead of end-to-end. While a simple genetic algorithm recently
showed end-to-end training is possible, it failed to solve a more complex 3D
task. This paper presents a method called Deep Innovation Protection (DIP) that
addresses the credit assignment problem in training complex heterogenous neural
network models end-to-end for such environments. The main idea behind the
approach is to employ multiobjective optimization to temporally reduce the
selection pressure on specific components in multi-component network, allowing
other components to adapt. We investigate the emergent representations of these
evolved networks, which learn to predict properties important for the survival
of the agent, without the need for a specific forward-prediction loss.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.635880">(Dys)regulation of Synaptic Activity and Neurotransmitter Release by β-Amyloid: A Look Beyond Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis</a></h4>

<p>Beside its widely studied role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), β-amyloid (Aβ) is a normal and soluble product of neuronal metabolism that regulates several key physiological functions, exerting neuromodulatory effects on synaptic plasticity, memory, and neurotransmitter release. Such effects have been observed to occur in a hormetic fashion, with Aβ exhibiting a dual role influenced by its concentration, the different isoforms, or aggregation forms of the peptide. However, to date, our knowledge about the physiological functions of Aβ and, in particular, its modulatory role on synaptic activity and neurotransmission in the normal brain is fragmentary, thus hindering a clear comprehension of the biological mechanisms underlying the derangement from function to dysfunction. In particular, according to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the switch from physiology to pathology is linked to the abnormal increase in Aβ levels, due to an imbalance in Aβ production and clearance. In this regard, increased Aβ levels have been hypothesized to induce early defects in synaptic function and such alterations have been suggested to account, at least in part, for the onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., apathy, anxiety, changes in mood, depression, and agitation/aggression), frequently observed in the prodromal stage of AD. Therefore, understanding the biological mechanisms underlying early synaptic alterations in AD is a key starting point to frame the relevant time windows for AD treatment and to gain insight into AD etiopathogenesis.</p>

<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been linked with tauopathy. However, imaging methods that can non-invasively detect tau-protein abnormalities following TBI need further investigation. This study aimed to investigate the potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to detect tauopathy following TBI in P301L mutant-tau-transgenic-pR5-mice. A total of 24 9-month-old pR5 mice were randomly assigned to sham and TBI groups. Controlled cortical injuries/craniotomies were performed for TBI/sham groups followed by DTI data acquisition on days 1 and 7 post-injury. DTI data were analyzed by using voxelwise analysis and track-based spatial statistics for gray matter and white matter. Further, immunohistochemistry was performed for total-tau and phosphorylated-tau, astrocytes, and microglia. To detect the association of DTI with these pathological markers, a correlation analysis was performed between DTI and histology findings. At day 1 post-TBI, DTI revealed a widespread reduction in fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial diffusivity (AxD) in the TBI group compared to shams. On day 7, further reduction in FA, AxD, and mean diffusivity and increased radial diffusivity were observed. FA was significantly increased in the amygdala and cortex. Correlation results showed that in the ipsilateral hemisphere FA reduction was associated with increased phosphorylated-tau and glial-immunoreactivity, whereas in the contralateral regions, the FA increase was associated with increased immunostaining for astrocytes. This study is the first to exploit DTI to investigate the effect of TBI in tau-transgenic mice. We show that alterations in the DTI signal were associated with glial activity following TBI and would most likely reflect changes that co-occur with/without phosphorylated-tau. In addition, FA may be a promising measure to identify discrete pathological processes such as increased astroglia activation, tau-hyperphosphorylation or both in the brain following TBI.</p>

<p>The clinical characteristics and biological effects on the nervous system of infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain poorly understood. The aim of this study is to advance epidemiological and mechanistic understanding of the neurological manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using stroke as a case study. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of clinical studies reporting stroke history, intensive inflammatory response, and procoagulant state C-reactive protein (CRP), Procalcitonin (PCT), and coagulation indicator (D-dimer) in patients with COVID-19. Via network-based analysis of SARS-CoV-2 host genes and stroke-associated genes in the human protein-protein interactome, we inspected the underlying inflammatory mechanisms between COVID-19 and stroke. Finally, we further verified the network-based findings using three RNA-sequencing datasets generated from SARS-CoV-2 infected populations. We found that the overall pooled prevalence of stroke history was 2.98% (95% CI, 1.89–4.68; I<sup>2</sup>=69.2%) in the COVID-19 population. Notably, the severe group had a higher prevalence of stroke (6.06%; 95% CI 3.80–9.52; I<sup>2</sup> = 42.6%) compare to the non-severe group (1.1%, 95% CI 0.72–1.71; I<sup>2</sup> = 0.0%). There were increased levels of CRP, PCT, and D-dimer in severe illness, and the pooled mean difference was 40.7 mg/L (95% CI, 24.3–57.1), 0.07 μg/L (95% CI, 0.04–0.10) and 0.63 mg/L (95% CI, 0.28–0.97), respectively. Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), one of the leukocyte adhesion molecules, is suspected to play a vital role of SARS-CoV-2 mediated inflammatory responses. RNA-sequencing data analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients further revealed the relative importance of inflammatory responses in COVID-19-associated neurological manifestations. In summary, we identified an elevated vulnerability of those with a history of stroke to severe COVID-19 underlying inflammatory responses (i.e., VCAM-1) and procoagulant pathways, suggesting monotonic relationships, thus implicating causality.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.598693">A Deep Learning Approach for the Photoacoustic Tomography Recovery From Undersampled Measurements</a></h4>

<p>Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a propitious imaging modality, which is helpful for biomedical study. However, fast PAT imaging and denoising is an exigent task in medical research. To address the problem, recently, methods based on compressed sensing (CS) have been proposed, which accede the low computational cost and high resolution for implementing PAT. Nevertheless, the imaging results of the sparsity-based methods strictly rely on sparsity and incoherence conditions. Furthermore, it is onerous to ensure that the experimentally acquired photoacoustic data meets CS’s prerequisite conditions. In this work, a deep learning–based PAT (Deep-PAT)method is instigated to overcome these limitations. By using a neural network, Deep-PAT is not only able to reconstruct PAT from a fewer number of measurements without considering the prerequisite conditions of CS, but also can eliminate undersampled artifacts effectively. The experimental results demonstrate that Deep-PAT is proficient at recovering high-quality photoacoustic images using just 5% of the original measurement data. Besides this, compared with the sparsity-based method, it can be seen through statistical analysis that the quality is significantly improved by 30% (approximately), having average SSIM = 0.974 and PSNR = 29.88 dB with standard deviation ±0.007 and ±0.089, respectively, by the proposed Deep-PAT method. Also, a comparsion of multiple neural networks provides insights into choosing the best one for further study and practical implementation.</p>

<p>In this work fMRI BOLD datasets are shown to contain slice-dependent non-stationarities. A model containing slice-dependent, non-stationary signal power is proposed to address time-varying signal power during BOLD data acquisition. The impact of non-stationary power on functional MRI connectivity is analytically derived, establishing that pairwise connectivity estimates are scaled by a function of the time-varying signal power, with magnitude upper bound by 1, and that the variance of sample correlation is increased, thereby inducing spurious connectivity. Consequently, we make the observation that time-varying power during acquisition of BOLD timeseries has the propensity to diminish connectivity estimates. To ameliorate the impact of non-stationary signal power, a simple correction for slice-dependent non-stationarity is proposed. Our correction is analytically shown to restore both signal stationarity and, subsequently, the integrity of connectivity estimates. Theoretical results are corroborated with empirical evidence demonstrating the utility of our correction. In addition, slice-dependent non-stationary variance is experimentally determined to be optimally characterized by an inverse Gamma distribution. The resulting distribution of a voxel's signal intensity is analytically derived to be a generalized Student's-t distribution, providing support for the Gaussianity assumption typically imposed by fMRI connectivity methods.</p>

<p>Objective: To examine changes in patients’ desired control of the deep brain stimulator (DBS) and perception of global life control throughout DBS.</p><p>Methods: A consecutive cohort of 52 patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) was recruited to participate in a prospective longitudinal study over three assessment points (pre-surgery, post-surgery months 3 and 6). Semi-structured interviews assessing participants’ desire for stimulation control and perception of global control were conducted at all three points. Qualitative data were coded using content analysis. Visual analog scales were embedded in the interviews to quantify participants’ perceptions of control over time.</p><p>Results: Participants reported significant increases in their perception of global control over time and significant declines in their desired control of the stimulation. These changes were unrelated to improvements in motor symptoms. Improvements in global control were negatively correlated with a decline in desired stimulation control. Qualitative data indicate that participants have changed, nuanced levels of desired control over their stimulators. Increased global life control following DBS may be attributed to increased control over PD symptoms, increased ability to engage in valued activities, and increased overall self-regulation, while other domains related to global control remained unaffected by DBS.</p><p>Conclusions: There are few empirical data documenting patients’ desire for stimulation control throughout neuromodulation and how stimulation control is related to other aspects of control despite the growing application of neuromodulation devices to treat a variety of disorders. Our data highlight distinctions in different types of control and have implications for the development of patient-controlled neurostimulation devices.</p>

<p>The lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adolescents is reported to be as high as 20%; thus, MDD constitutes a significant social and public health burden. MDD is often associated with nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) behavior, but the contributing factors including cognitive function have not been investigated in detail. To this end, the present study evaluated cognitive impairment and psychosocial factors in associated with MDD with NSSI behavior. Eighteen and 21 drug-naïve patients with first-episode MDD with or without NSSI (NSSI+/– group) and 24 healthy control subjects (HC) were enrolled in the study. The Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), Adolescent Self-injury Questionnaire, Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation–Chinese Version (BSI-CV), Shame Scale for Middle School Students, Sensation Seeking Scale (SSS) and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) were used to assess depression-related behaviors, and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded as a measure of cognitive function. The latency of the N1, N2, P3a, P3b, and P50 components of ERPs at the Cz electrode point; P50 amplitude and P50 inhibition (S1/S2) showed significant differences between the 3 groups. CTQ scores also differed across three groups, and the NSSI– and NSSI+ groups showed significant differences in scores on the Shame Scale for Middle School Students. Thus, cognitive function was impaired in adolescents with MDD with NSSI behavior, which was mainly manifested as memory decline, attention and executive function deficits, and low anti-interference ability. We also found that childhood abuse, lack of social support, and a sense of shame contributed to NSSI behavior. These findings provide insight into the risk factors for MDD with NSSI behavior, which can help mental health workers more effectively diagnose and treat these patients.</p>

<p>Rationale: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in intracranial EEG (iEEG) are used to delineate the epileptogenic zone during presurgical diagnostic assessment in patients with epilepsy. HFOs are historically divided into ripples (80–250 Hz), fast ripples (FR, &gt;250 Hz), and their co-occurrence (FRandR). In a previous study, we had validated the rate of FRandRs during deep sleep to predict seizure outcome. Here, we ask whether epileptic FRandRs might be confounded by physiological FRandRs that are unrelated to epilepsy.</p><p>Methods: We recorded iEEG in the medial temporal lobe MTL (hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala) in 17 patients while they performed cognitive tasks. The three cognitive tasks addressed verbal working memory, visual working memory, and emotional processing. In our previous studies, these tasks activated the MTL. We re-analyzed the data of these studies with the automated detector that focuses on the co-occurrence of ripples and FRs (FRandR).</p><p>Results: For each task, we identified those channels in which the HFO rate was modulated during the task condition compared to the control condition. However, the number of these channels did not exceed the chance level. Interestingly, even during wakefulness, the HFO rate was higher for channels within the seizure onset zone (SOZ) than for channels outside the SOZ.</p><p>Conclusion: Our prospective definition of an epileptic HFO, the FRandR, is not confounded by physiological HFOs that might be elicited by our cognitive tasks. This is reassuring for the clinical use of FRandR as a biomarker of the EZ.</p>

<p>Embodied theories of grounded semantics postulate that, when word meaning is first acquired, a link is established between symbol (word form) and corresponding semantic information present in modality-specific—including primary—sensorimotor cortices of the brain. Direct experimental evidence documenting the emergence of such a link (i.e., showing that presentation of a previously unknown, meaningless word sound induces, after learning, category-specific reactivation of relevant primary sensory or motor brain areas), however, is still missing. Here, we present new neuroimaging results that provide such evidence. We taught participants aspects of the referential meaning of previously unknown, senseless novel spoken words (such as “Shruba” or “Flipe”) by associating them with either a familiar action or a familiar object. After training, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to analyze the participants’ brain responses to the new speech items. We found that hearing the newly learnt object-related word sounds selectively triggered activity in the primary visual cortex, as well as secondary and higher visual areas.These results for the first time directly document the formation of a link between the novel, previously meaningless spoken items and corresponding semantic information in primary sensory areas in a category-specific manner, providing experimental support for perceptual accounts of word-meaning acquisition in the brain.</p>

<p>Recurrent cortical networks provide reservoirs of states that are thought to play a crucial role for sequential information processing in the brain. However, classical reservoir computing requires manual adjustments of global network parameters, particularly of the spectral radius of the recurrent synaptic weight matrix. It is hence not clear if the spectral radius is accessible to biological neural networks. Using random matrix theory, we show that the spectral radius is related to local properties of the neuronal dynamics whenever the overall dynamical state is only weakly correlated. This result allows us to introduce two local homeostatic synaptic scaling mechanisms, termed flow control and variance control, that implicitly drive the spectral radius toward the desired value. For both mechanisms the spectral radius is autonomously adapted while the network receives and processes inputs under working conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the two adaptation mechanisms under different external input protocols. Moreover, we evaluated the network performance after adaptation by training the network to perform a time-delayed XOR operation on binary sequences. As our main result, we found that flow control reliably regulates the spectral radius for different types of input statistics. Precise tuning is however negatively affected when interneural correlations are substantial. Furthermore, we found a consistent task performance over a wide range of input strengths/variances. Variance control did however not yield the desired spectral radii with the same precision, being less consistent across different input strengths. Given the effectiveness and remarkably simple mathematical form of flow control, we conclude that self-consistent local control of the spectral radius via an implicit adaptation scheme is an interesting and biological plausible alternative to conventional methods using set point homeostatic feedback controls of neural firing.</p>

<p>The advent of optogenetics has revolutionized experimental research in the field of Neuroscience and the possibility to selectively stimulate neurons in 3D volumes has opened new routes in the understanding of brain dynamics and functions. The combination of multiphoton excitation and optogenetic methods allows to identify and excite specific neuronal targets by means of the generation of cloud of excitation points. The most widely employed approach to produce the points cloud is through a spatial light modulation (SLM) which works with a refresh rate of tens of Hz. However, the computational time requested to calculate 3D patterns ranges between a few seconds and a few minutes, strongly limiting the overall performance of the system. The maximum speed of SLM can in fact be employed either with high quality patterns embedded into pre-calculated sequences or with low quality patterns for real time update. Here, we propose the implementation of a recently developed compressed sensing Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm on a consumer graphical processor unit allowing the generation of high quality patterns at video rate. This, would in turn dramatically reduce dead times in the experimental sessions, and could enable applications previously impossible, such as the control of neuronal network activity driven by the feedback from single neurons functional signals detected through calcium or voltage imaging or the real time compensation of motion artifacts.</p>

<p>Increased innate immune activation and inflammation are common findings in psychotic and affective (mood) disorders such as schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), including increased numbers and activation of monocytes and macrophages. These findings often differ depending on the disorder, for example, we previously found increases in circulating inflammatory cytokines associated with monocytes and macrophages in SCZ, while BD had increases in anti-inflammatory cytokines. Despite these differences, few studies have specifically compared immune dysfunction in affective versus non-affective psychotic disorders and none have compared functional monocyte responses across these disorders. To address this, we recruited 25 first episode psychosis (FEP) patients and 23 healthy controls (HC). FEP patients were further grouped based on the presence (AFF) or absence (NON) of mood disorder. We isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and cultured them for 1 week with M-CSF to obtain monocyte-derived macrophages. These cells were then stimulated for 24 h to skew them to inflammatory and alternative phenotypes, in order to identify differences in these responses. Following stimulation with LPS and LPS plus IFNγ, we found that macrophages from the NON-group had diminished inflammatory responses compared to both HC and AFF groups. Interestingly, when skewing macrophages to an alternative phenotype using LPS plus IL-4, the AFF macrophages increased production of inflammatory cytokines. Receiver operating curve analysis showed predictive power of inflammatory cytokine concentrations after LPS stimulation in the AFF group versus NON-group. Our results suggest dysfunctional monocyte responses in both affective and non-affective psychotic disorder, with varying types of immune dysfunction depending on the presence or absence of a mood component.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative maladies with unforeseen complex pathologies. While this neurodegenerative disorder’s neuropathology is reasonably well known, its etiology remains a mystery, making it challenging to aim therapy. Glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) remains an auspicious therapeutic molecule for treating PD. Neurotrophic factor derived from glial cell lines is effective in rodents and nonhuman primates, but clinical findings have been equivocal. Laborious exertions have been made over the past few decades to improve and assess GDNF in treating PD (clinical studies). Definitive clinical trials have, however, failed to demonstrate a survival advantage. Consequently, there seemed to be a doubt as to whether GDNF has merit in the potential treatment of PD. The purpose of this cutting edge review is to speculate as to why the clinical trials have failed to meet the primary endpoint. We introduce a hypothesis, “Failure of GDNF in clinical trials succumbed by nuclear receptor-related factor 1 (Nurr1) shortfall.” We demonstrate how Nurr1 binds to GDNF to induce dopaminergic neuron synthesis. Due to its undisputable neuro-protection aptitude, we display Nurr1 (also called Nr4a2) as a promising therapeutic target for PD.</p>

<p>Background: Despite known associations between low blood hemoglobin level and Alzheimer's disease (AD) or cognitive impairment, the underlying neuropathological links are poorly understood. We aimed to examine the relationships of blood hemoglobin levels with in vivo AD pathologies (i.e., cerebral beta-amyloid [Aβ] deposition, tau deposition, and AD-signature degeneration) and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), which are a measure of cerebrovascular injury. We also investigated the association between hemoglobin level and cognitive performance, and then assessed whether such an association is mediated by brain pathologies.</p><p>Methods: A total of 428 non-demented older adults underwent comprehensive clinical assessments, hemoglobin level measurement, and multimodal brain imaging, including Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomography (PET), AV-1451 PET, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET, and magnetic resonance imaging. Episodic memory score and global cognition scores were also measured.</p><p>Results: A lower hemoglobin level was significantly associated with reduced AD-signature cerebral glucose metabolism (AD-CM), but not Aβ deposition, tau deposition, or WMH volume. A lower hemoglobin level was also significantly associated with poorer episodic memory and global cognition scores, but such associations disappeared when AD-CM was controlled as a covariate, indicating that AD-CM has a moderating effect.</p><p>Conclusion: The present findings suggest that low blood hemoglobin in older adults is associated with cognitive decline via reduced brain metabolism, which seems to be independent of those aspects of AD-specific protein pathologies and cerebrovascular injury that are reflected in PET and MRI measures.</p>

<p>Aging affects the overall physiology, including the image-forming and non-image forming visual systems. Among the components of the latter, the thalamic retinorecipient inter-geniculate leaflet (IGL) and ventral lateral geniculate (vLGN) nucleus conveys light information to subcortical regions, adjusting visuomotor, and circadian functions. It is noteworthy that several visual related cells, such as neuronal subpopulations in the IGL and vLGN are neurochemically characterized by the presence of calcium binding proteins. Calretinin (CR), a representative of such proteins, denotes region-specificity in a temporal manner by variable day–night expression. In parallel, age-related brain dysfunction and neurodegeneration are associated with abnormal intracellular concentrations of calcium. Here, we investigated whether daily changes in the number of CR neurons are a feature of the aged IGL and vLGN in rats. To this end, we perfused rats, ranging from 3 to 24 months of age, within distinct phases of the day, namely zeitgeber times (ZTs). Then, we evaluated CR immunolabeling through design-based stereological cell estimation. We observed distinct daily rhythms of CR expression in the IGL and in both the retinorecipient (vLGNe) and non-retinorecipient (vLGNi) portions of the vLGN. In the ZT 6, the middle of the light phase, the CR cells are reduced with aging in the IGL and vLGNe. In the ZT 12, the transition between light to dark, an age-related CR loss was found in all nuclei. While CR expression predominates in specific spatial domains of vLGN, age-related changes appear not to be restricted at particular portions. No alterations were found in the dark/light transition or in the middle of the dark phase, ZTs 0, and 18, respectively. These results are relevant in the understanding of how aging shifts the phenotype of visual related cells at topographically organized channels of visuomotor and circadian processing.</p>

<p>Objective: To define resilience metrics for cognitive decline based on plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β (Aβ) and examine the demographic, genetic, and neuroimaging factors associated with interindividual differences among metrics of resilience and to demonstrate the ability of such metrics to predict the diagnostic conversion to mild cognitive impairment (MCI).</p><p>Methods: In this study, cognitively normal (CN) participants with Aβ-positive were included from the Sino Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Decline (SILCODE, n = 100) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, n = 144). Using a latent variable model of data, metrics of resilience [brain resilience (BR), cognitive resilience (CR), and global resilience (GR)] were defined based on the plasma Aβ and CSF Aβ. Linear regression analyses were applied to investigate the association between characteristics of individuals (age, sex, educational level, genetic, and neuroimaging factors) and their resilience. The plausibility of these metrics was tested using linear mixed-effects models and Cox regression models in longitudinal analyses. We also compared the effectiveness of these metrics with conventional metrics in predicting the clinical progression.</p><p>Results: Although individuals in the ADNI cohort were older (74.68 [5.65] vs. 65.38 [4.66], p &lt; 0.001) and had higher educational levels (16.3 [2.6] vs. 12.6 [2.8], p &lt; 0.001) than those in the SILCODE cohort, similar loadings between resilience and its indicators were found within both models. BR and GR were mainly associated with age, women, and brain volume in both cohorts. Prediction models showed that higher CR and GR were related to better cognitive performance, and specifically, all types of resilience to CSF Aβ could predict longitudinal cognitive decline.</p><p>Conclusion: Different phenotypes of resilience depending on cognition and brain volumes were associated with different factors. Such comprehensive resilience provided insight into the mechanisms of susceptibility for Alzheimer's disease (AD) at the individual level, and interindividual differences in resilience had the potential to predict the disease progression in CN people.</p>

<p>Background: The incidence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in the elderly is high, and the disorder is associated with a variety of chronic diseases. Microvesicles (MVs) are extracellular vesicles secreted by various cells during stimulation or apoptosis that play an important role in the pathogenesis of OSA. However, concentrations of circulating MVs in elderly patients with OSA remain unclear.</p><p>Methods: Patients aged &gt;60 years old were recruited and underwent polysomnography. Circulating plasma MV concentrations, including annexin V<sup>+</sup>MVs, endothelial MVs (EMVs), platelet MVs (PMVs), and leukocyte MVs (LMVs) levels, were measured using a flow cytometer with different labeling methods. Potential factors affecting the concentration of circulating MVs in elderly patients with OSA were determined via Spearman's correlation and multiple linear regression analysis.</p><p>Results: Levels of circulating MVs, including both single- (annexin V<sup>+</sup>MVs, CD144<sup>+</sup>EMVs, CD41a<sup>+</sup>PMVs, and CD45<sup>+</sup>LMVs) and dual-labeled MVs (annexin V<sup>+</sup>CD144<sup>+</sup>EMVs), were elevated in elderly patients with OSA. Circulating MVs were positively correlated with OSA severity (AHI, ODI, and SPO<sub>2min</sub>). To some extent, obesity affected the MV concentrations in elderly patients with OSA. In addition, age and comorbidities may be associated with MV levels, but the correlations between the MV levels and age or comorbidities were not significant.</p><p>Conclusion: Concentrations of circulating MVs in elderly patients with OSA are associated with the labeling method used, OSA severity, and obesity. The effects of age and comorbidities on circulating MV levels require further verification using a larger sample size.</p>

<p>Network efficiency characterizes how information flows within a network, and it has been used to study the neural basis of cognitive intelligence in adolescence, young adults, and elderly adults, in terms of the white matter in the human brain and functional connectivity networks. However, there were few studies investigating whether the human brain at different ages exhibited different underpins of cognitive and emotional intelligence (EI) from young adults to the middle-aged group, especially in terms of the morphological similarity networks in the human brain. In this study, we used 65 datasets (aging 18–64), including sMRI and behavioral measurements, to study the associations of network efficiency with cognitive intelligence and EI in young adults and the middle-aged group. We proposed a new method of defining the human brain morphological networks using the morphological distribution similarity (including cortical volume, surface area, and thickness). Our results showed inverted age × network efficiency interactions in the relationship of surface-area network efficiency with cognitive intelligence and EI: a negative age × global efficiency (nodal efficiency) interaction in cognitive intelligence, while a positive age × global efficiency (nodal efficiency) interaction in EI. In summary, this study not only proposed a new method of morphological similarity network but also emphasized the developmental effects on the brain mechanisms of intelligence from young adult to middle-aged groups and may promote mental health study on the middle-aged group in the future.</p>

<p>Aberrant secretion and accumulation of α-synuclein (α-Syn) as well as the loss of parkin function are associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Our previous study suggested a functional interaction between those two proteins, showing that the extracellular α-Syn evoked post-translational modifications of parkin, leading to its autoubiquitination and degradation. While parkin plays an important role in mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover, including mitochondrial fission/fusion as well as mitophagy, the involvement of parkin deregulation in α-Syn-induced mitochondrial damage is largely unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that treatment with exogenous α-Syn triggers mitochondrial dysfunction, reflected by the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, elevated synthesis of the mitochondrial superoxide anion, and a decrease in cellular ATP level. At the same time, we observed a protective effect of parkin overexpression on α-Syn-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. α-Syn-dependent disturbances of mitophagy were also shown to be directly related to reduced parkin levels in mitochondria and decreased ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins. Also, α-Syn impaired mitochondrial biosynthesis due to the parkin-dependent reduction of PGC-1α protein levels. Finally, loss of parkin function as a result of α-Syn treatment induced an overall breakdown of mitochondrial homeostasis that led to the accumulation of abnormal mitochondria. These findings may thus provide the first compelling evidence for the direct association of α-Syn-mediated parkin depletion to impaired mitochondrial function in PD. We suggest that improvement of parkin function may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent mitochondrial impairment and neurodegeneration in PD (thereby slowing the progression of the disease).</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63762">Glycine acylation and trafficking of a new class of bacterial lipoprotein by a composite secretion system</a></h4>

Protein acylation is critical for many cellular functions across all domains of life. In bacteria, lipoproteins have important roles in virulence and are targets for the development of antimicrobials and vaccines. Bacterial lipoproteins are secreted from the cytosol via the Sec pathway and acylated on an N-terminal cysteine residue through the action of three enzymes. In Gram-negative bacteria, the Lol pathway transports lipoproteins to the outer membrane. Here we demonstrate that the Aat secretion system is a composite system sharing similarity with elements of a type I secretion systems and the Lol pathway. During secretion, the AatD subunit acylates the substrate CexE on a highly conserved N-terminal glycine residue. Mutations disrupting glycine acylation interfere with membrane incorporation and trafficking. Our data reveal CexE as the first member of a new class of glycine-acylated lipoprotein, while Aat represents a new secretion system that displays the substrate lipoprotein on the cell surface.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61525">Real time monitoring of peptidoglycan synthesis by membrane-reconstituted penicillin binding proteins</a></h4>

Peptidoglycan is an essential component of the bacterial cell envelope that surrounds the cytoplasmic membrane to protect the cell from osmotic lysis. Important antibiotics such as β-lactams and glycopeptides target peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Class A penicillin binding proteins are bifunctional membrane-bound peptidoglycan synthases that polymerize glycan chains and connect adjacent stem peptides by transpeptidation. How these enzymes work in their physiological membrane environment is poorly understood. Here we developed a novel FRET-based assay to follow in real time both reactions of class A PBPs reconstituted in liposomes or supported lipid bilayers and we applied this assay with PBP1B homologues from <i>Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> in the presence or absence of their cognate lipoprotein activator. Our assay will allow unravelling the mechanisms of peptidoglycan synthesis in a lipid-bilayer environment and can be further developed to be used for high throughput screening for new antimicrobials.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60321">Graphical-model framework for automated annotation of cell identities in dense cellular images</a></h4>

Although identifying cell names in dense image stacks is critical in analyzing functional whole-brain data enabling comparison across experiments, unbiased identification is very difficult, and relies heavily on researchers' experiences. Here we present a probabilistic-graphical-model framework, CRF_ID, based on Conditional Random Fields, for unbiased and automated cell identification. CRF_ID focuses on maximizing intrinsic similarity between shapes. Compared to existing methods, CRF_ID achieves higher accuracy on simulated and ground-truth experimental datasets, and better robustness against challenging noise conditions common in experimental data. CRF_ID can further boost accuracy by building atlases from annotated data in highly computationally efficient manner, and by easily adding new features (e.g. from new strains). We demonstrate cell annotation in <i>C. elegans</i> images across strains, animal orientations, and tasks including gene-expression localization, multi-cellular and whole-brain functional imaging experiments. Together, these successes demonstrate that unbiased cell annotation can facilitate biological discovery, and this approach may be valuable to annotation tasks for other systems.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58749">Specialized contributions of mid-tier stages of dorsal and ventral pathways to stereoscopic processing in macaque</a></h4>

The division of labor between the dorsal and ventral visual pathways has been well studied, but not often with direct comparison at the single-neuron resolution with matched stimuli. Here we directly compared how single neurons in MT and V4, mid-tier areas of the two pathways, process binocular disparity, a powerful cue for 3D perception and actions. We found that MT neurons transmitted disparity signals more quickly and robustly, whereas V4 or its upstream neurons transformed the signals into sophisticated representations more prominently. Therefore, signaling speed and robustness were traded for transformation between the dorsal and ventral pathways. The key factor in this tradeoff was disparity-tuning shape: V4 neurons had more even-symmetric tuning than MT neurons. Moreover, the tuning symmetry predicted the degree of signal transformation across neurons similarly within each area, implying a general role of tuning symmetry in the stereoscopic processing by the two pathways.

Return of fear poses a problem for extinction-based therapies of clinical anxiety. Experimental research has discovered several pathways to return of fear, one of which is known as reinstatement. Here, we evaluated in rats the potential of scopolamine, a non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist that is also safe for use in humans, to prevent the reinstatement of extinguished fear. We conducted three experiments with a total sample of 96 female rats. All rats went through a fear acquisition session (tone-shock pairings, CS-US), followed by two extinction sessions (CS only) and a post-extinction fear memory test. Twenty-four hours later, rats were placed in the same or a different context from extinction and received two unsignaled foot shock (US) presentations. On the following day, CS-evoked freezing returned when the reinstating USs had occurred in the same context compared to a different context (context-dependent reinstatement, Experiment 1). Systemic administration of scopolamine before or after the reinstating USs blocked the return of CS-evoked freezing on the following day (Experiments 2 and 3). Our findings suggest that administering scopolamine around the time of an aversive experience could prevent relapse of extinguished fears in humans.

Functional imaging of neural cell populations is critical for mapping intra- and inter-regional network dynamics across the neocortex. Recently we showed that an unsupervised machine learning decomposition of densely sampled recordings of cortical calcium dynamics results in a collection of components comprised of neuronal signal sources distinct from optical, movement, and vascular artifacts. Here we build a supervised learning classifier that automatically separates neural activity and artifact components, using a set of extracted spatial and temporal metrics that characterize the respective components. We demonstrate that the performance of the machine classifier matches human identification of signal components in novel data sets. Further, we analyze control data recorded in glial cell reporter and non-fluorescent mouse lines that validates human and machine identification of functional component class. This combined workflow of data-driven video decomposition and machine classification of signal sources will aid robust and scalable mapping of complex cerebral dynamics.

Sleep disturbances are common during aging. Compared to young animals, old mice show altered sleep structure, with changes in both slow and fast lectrocorticographic (ECoG) activity and fewer transitions between sleep and wake stages. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), which is involved in adaptive changes during aging, was previously shown to increase ECoG activity in young mice and monkeys. Furthermore, IGF-I shapes sleep architecture by modulating the activity of mouse orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH). We now report that both ECoG stimulation and activation of orexin neurons by systemic IGF-I is abrogated in old mice. Moreover, stimulation of orthodromically activated LH neurons by either systemic or local IGF-I in young mice is absent in old mice. As orexin neurons of old mice show markedly increased IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) levels, suggesting loss of sensitivity to IGF-I, we treated old mice with AIK3a305, a novel IGF-IR sensitizer, and observed restored responses to IGF-I and rejuvenation of sleep patterns. Thus, disturbed sleep structure in aging mice may be related to impaired IGF-I signaling onto orexin neurons, reflecting a broader loss of IGF-I activity in the aged mouse brain.

<p>by Rahmatullah Roche, Sutanu Bhattacharya, Debswapna Bhattacharya</p>

Crystallography and NMR system (CNS) is currently a widely used method for fragment-free <i>ab initio</i> protein folding from inter-residue distance or contact maps. Despite its widespread use in protein structure prediction, CNS is a decade-old macromolecular structure determination system that was originally developed for solving macromolecular geometry from experimental restraints as opposed to predictive modeling driven by interaction map data. As such, the adaptation of the CNS experimental structure determination protocol for <i>ab initio</i> protein folding is intrinsically anomalous that may undermine the folding accuracy of computational protein structure prediction. In this paper, we propose a new CNS-free hierarchical structure modeling method called DConStruct for folding both soluble and membrane proteins driven by distance and contact information. Rigorous experimental validation shows that DConStruct attains much better reconstruction accuracy than CNS when tested with the same input contact map at varying contact thresholds. The hierarchical modeling with iterative self-correction employed in DConStruct scales at a much higher degree of folding accuracy than CNS with the increase in contact thresholds, ultimately approaching near-optimal reconstruction accuracy at higher-thresholded contact maps. The folding accuracy of DConStruct can be further improved by exploiting distance-based hybrid interaction maps at tri-level thresholding, as demonstrated by the better performance of our method in folding free modeling targets from the 12th and 13th rounds of the Critical Assessment of techniques for protein Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments compared to popular CNS- and fragment-based approaches and energy-minimization protocols, some of which even using much finer-grained distance maps than ours. Additional large-scale benchmarking shows that DConStruct can significantly improve the folding accuracy of membrane proteins compared to a CNS-based approach. These results collectively demonstrate the feasibility of greatly improving the accuracy of <i>ab initio</i> protein folding by optimally exploiting the information encoded in inter-residue interaction maps beyond what is possible by CNS.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ogSwYNXbpmU" width="1" />

<p>by Richard P. Mann</p>

The collective behaviour of animal and human groups emerges from the individual decisions and actions of their constituent members. Recent research has revealed many ways in which the behaviour of groups can be influenced by differences amongst their constituent individuals. The existence of individual differences that have implications for collective behaviour raises important questions. How are these differences generated and maintained? Are individual differences driven by exogenous factors, or are they a response to the social dilemmas these groups face? Here I consider the classic case of patch selection by foraging agents under conditions of social competition. I introduce a multilevel model wherein the perceptual sensitivities of agents evolve in response to their foraging success or failure over repeated patch selections. This model reveals a bifurcation in the population, creating a class of agents with no perceptual sensitivity. These agents exploit the social environment to avoid the costs of accurate perception, relying on other agents to make fitness rewards insensitive to the choice of foraging patch. This provides a individual-based evolutionary basis for models incorporating perceptual limits that have been proposed to explain observed deviations from the Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) in empirical studies, while showing that the common assumption in such models that agents share identical sensory limits is likely false. Further analysis of the model shows how agents develop perceptual strategic niches in response to environmental variability. The emergence of agents insensitive to reward differences also has implications for societal resource allocation problems, including the use of financial and prediction markets as mechanisms for aggregating collective wisdom.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/msedj_TSJeQ" width="1" />

RNA splicing is widely dysregulated in cancer, frequently due to altered expression or activity of splicing factors (SFs). Microexons are extremely small exons (3–27 nucleotides long) that are highly evolutionarily conserved and play critical roles in promoting neuronal differentiation and development. Inclusion of microexons in mRNA transcripts is mediated by the SF Serine/Arginine Repetitive Matrix 4 (SRRM4), whose expression is largely restricted to neural tissues. However, microexons have been largely overlooked in prior analyses of splicing in cancer, as their small size necessitates specialized computational approaches for their detection. Here, we demonstrate that despite having low expression in normal nonneural tissues, SRRM4 is further silenced in tumors, resulting in the suppression of normal microexon inclusion. Remarkably, SRRM4 is the most consistently silenced SF across all tumor types analyzed, implying a general advantage of microexon down-regulation in cancer independent of its tissue of origin. We show that this silencing is favorable for tumor growth, as decreased SRRM4 expression in tumors is correlated with an increase in mitotic gene expression, and up-regulation of SRRM4 in cancer cell lines dose-dependently inhibits proliferation in vitro and in a mouse xenograft model. Further, this proliferation inhibition is accompanied by induction of neural-like expression and splicing patterns in cancer cells, suggesting that SRRM4 expression shifts the cell state away from proliferation and toward differentiation. We therefore conclude that SRRM4 acts as a proliferation brake, and tumors gain a selective advantage by cutting off this brake.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/rDo_AkWttew" width="1" />

<p>Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) is a Bayesian framework to infer directed
connections between compartments, and has been used to describe the
interactions between underlying neural populations based on functional
neuroimaging data. DCM is typically analyzed with the expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm. However, because the inversion of a large-scale continuous
system is difficult when noisy observations are present, DCM by EM is typically
limited to a small number of compartments ($&lt;10$). Another drawback with the
current method is its complexity; when the forward model changes, the posterior
mean changes, and we need to re-derive the algorithm for optimization. In this
project, we propose the Multiple-Shooting Adjoint (MSA) method to address these
limitations. MSA uses the multiple-shooting method for parameter estimation in
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under noisy observations, and is
suitable for large-scale systems such as whole-brain analysis in functional MRI
(fMRI). Furthermore, MSA uses the adjoint method for accurate gradient
estimation in the ODE; since the adjoint method is generic, MSA is a generic
method for both linear and non-linear systems, and does not require
re-derivation of the algorithm as in EM. We validate MSA in extensive
experiments: 1) in toy examples with both linear and non-linear models, we show
that MSA achieves better accuracy in parameter value estimation than EM;
furthermore, MSA can be successfully applied to large systems with up to 100
compartments; and 2) using real fMRI data, we apply MSA to the estimation of
the whole-brain effective connectome and show improved classification of autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) vs. control compared to using the functional
connectome. The package is provided

<p>The auto feature extraction capability of deep neural networks (DNN) endows
them the potentiality for analysing complicated electroencephalogram (EEG) data
captured from brain functionality research. This work investigates the
potential coherent correspondence between the region-of-interest (ROI) for DNN
to explore, and ROI for conventional neurophysiological oriented methods to
work with, exemplified in the case of working memory study. The attention
mechanism induced by global average pooling (GAP) is applied to a public EEG
dataset of working memory, to unveil these coherent ROIs via a classification
problem. The result shows the alignment of ROIs from different research
disciplines. This work asserts the confidence and promise of utilizing DNN for
EEG data analysis, albeit in lack of the interpretation to network operations.

<p>With the continued innovations of deep neural networks, spiking neural
networks (SNNs) that more closely resemble biological brain synapses have
attracted attention owing to their low power consumption. However, for
continuous data values, they must employ a coding process to convert the values
to spike trains. Thus, they have not yet exceeded the performance of artificial
neural networks (ANNs), which handle such values directly. To this end, we
combine an ANN and an SNN to build versatile hybrid neural networks (HNNs) that
improve the concerned performance.

<p>In the past decade, the heterogeneous information network (HIN) has become an
important methodology for modern recommender systems. To fully leverage its
power, manually designed network templates, i.e., meta-structures, are
introduced to filter out semantic-aware information. The hand-crafted
meta-structure rely on intense expert knowledge, which is both laborious and
data-dependent. On the other hand, the number of meta-structures grows
exponentially with its size and the number of node types, which prohibits
brute-force search. To address these challenges, we propose Genetic
Meta-Structure Search (GEMS) to automatically optimize meta-structure designs
for recommendation on HINs. Specifically, GEMS adopts a parallel genetic
algorithm to search meaningful meta-structures for recommendation, and designs
dedicated rules and a meta-structure predictor to efficiently explore the
search space. Finally, we propose an attention based multi-view graph
convolutional network module to dynamically fuse information from different
meta-structures. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets suggest the
effectiveness of GEMS, which consistently outperforms all baseline methods in
HIN recommendation. Compared with simplified GEMS which utilizes hand-crafted
meta-paths, GEMS achieves over $6\%$ performance gain on most evaluation
metrics. More importantly, we conduct an in-depth analysis on the identified
meta-structures, which sheds light on the HIN based recommender system design.

<p>A semi-supervised learning method for spiking neural networks is proposed.
The proposed method consists of supervised learning by backpropagation and
subsequent unsupervised learning by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP),
which is a biologically plausible learning rule. Numerical experiments show
that the proposed method improves the accuracy without additional labeling when
a small amount of labeled data is used. This feature has not been achieved by
existing semi-supervised learning methods of discriminative models. It is
possible to implement the proposed learning method for event-driven systems.
Hence, it would be highly efficient in real-time problems if it were
implemented on neuromorphic hardware. The results suggest that STDP plays an
important role other than self-organization when applied after supervised
learning, which differs from the previous method of using STDP as pre-training
interpreted as self-organization.

<p>Many real-world mission-critical applications require continual online
learning from noisy data and real-time decision making with a defined
confidence level. Probabilistic models and stochastic neural networks can
explicitly handle uncertainty in data and allow adaptive learning-on-the-fly,
but their implementation in a low-power substrate remains a challenge. Here, we
introduce a novel hardware fabric that implements a new class of stochastic NN
called Neural-Sampling-Machine that exploits stochasticity in synaptic
connections for approximate Bayesian inference. Harnessing the inherent
non-linearities and stochasticity occurring at the atomic level in emerging
materials and devices allows us to capture the synaptic stochasticity occurring
at the molecular level in biological synapses. We experimentally demonstrate
in-silico hybrid stochastic synapse by pairing a ferroelectric field-effect
transistor -based analog weight cell with a two-terminal stochastic selector
element. Such a stochastic synapse can be integrated within the
well-established crossbar array architecture for compute-in-memory. We
experimentally show that the inherent stochastic switching of the selector
element between the insulator and metallic state introduces a multiplicative
stochastic noise within the synapses of NSM that samples the conductance states
of the FeFET, both during learning and inference. We perform network-level
simulations to highlight the salient automatic weight normalization feature
introduced by the stochastic synapses of the NSM that paves the way for
continual online learning without any offline Batch Normalization. We also
showcase the Bayesian inferencing capability introduced by the stochastic
synapse during inference mode, thus accounting for uncertainty in data. We
report 98.25%accuracy on standard image classification task as well as
estimation of data uncertainty in rotated samples.

<p>It has been already shown that combinatorial evolution - the creation of new
things through the combination of existing things - can be a powerful way to
evolve rather than design technical objects such as electronic circuits in a
computer simulation. Intriguingly, only a few iterations seem to be required to
already achieve complex objects. In the present paper we want to employ
combinatorial evolution in software development. Our research question is
whether it is possible to generate computer programs of increasing complexity
using automatic programming through combinatorial evolution. Specifically, we
ask what kind of basic code blocks are needed at the beginning, how are these
code blocks implemented to allow them to combine, and how can code complexity
be measured. We implemented a computer program simulating combinatorial
evolution of code blocks stored in a database to make them available for
combinations. Automatic programming is achieved by evaluating regular
expressions. We found that reserved key words of a programming language are
suitable for defining the basic code blocks at the beginning of the simulation.
We also found that placeholders can be used to combine code blocks and that
code complexity can be described in terms of the importance to the programming
language. As in the previous combinatorial evolution simulation of electronic
circuits, complexity increased from simple keywords and special characters to
more complex variable declarations, to class definitions, to methods, and to
classes containing methods and variable declarations. Combinatorial evolution,
therefore, seems to be a promising approach for automatic programming.

<p>Many physical, biological and neural systems behave as coupled oscillators,
with characteristic phase coupling across different frequencies. Methods such
as $n:m$ phase locking value and bi-phase locking value have previously been
proposed to quantify phase coupling between two resonant frequencies (e.g. $f$,
$2f/3$) and across three frequencies (e.g. $f_1$, $f_2$, $f_1+f_2$),
respectively. However, the existing phase coupling metrics have their
limitations and limited applications. They cannot be used to detect or quantify
phase coupling across multiple frequencies (e.g. $f_1$, $f_2$, $f_3$, $f_4$,
$f_1+f_2+f_3-f_4$), or coupling that involves non-integer multiples of the
frequencies (e.g. $f_1$, $f_2$, $2f_1/3+f_2/3$). To address the gap, this paper
proposes a generalized approach, named multi-phase locking value (M-PLV), for
the quantification of various types of instantaneous multi-frequency phase
coupling. Different from most instantaneous phase coupling metrics that measure
the simultaneous phase coupling, the proposed M-PLV method also allows the
detection of delayed phase coupling and the associated time lag between coupled
oscillators. The M-PLV has been tested on cases where synthetic coupled signals
are generated using white Gaussian signals, and a system comprised of multiple
coupled R\"ossler oscillators. Results indicate that the M-PLV can provide a
reliable estimation of the time window and frequency combination where the
phase coupling is significant, as well as a precise determination of time lag
in the case of delayed coupling. This method has the potential to become a
powerful new tool for exploring phase coupling in complex nonlinear dynamic
systems.

<p>Mental health problems impact quality of life of millions of people around
the world. However, diagnosis of mental health disorders is a challenging
problem that often relies on self-reporting by patients about their behavioral
patterns. Therefore, there is a need for new strategies for diagnosis of mental
health problems. The recent introduction of body-area networks consisting of a
plethora of accurate sensors embedded in smartwatches and smartphones and deep
neural networks (DNNs) points towards a possible solution. However, disease
diagnosis based on WMSs and DNNs, and their deployment on edge devices, remains
a challenging problem. To this end, we propose a framework called MHDeep that
utilizes commercially available WMSs and efficient DNN models to diagnose three
important mental health disorders: schizoaffective, major depressive, and
bipolar. MHDeep uses eight different categories of data obtained from sensors
integrated in a smartwatch and smartphone. Due to limited available data,
MHDeep uses a synthetic data generation module to augment real data with
synthetic data drawn from the same probability distribution. We use the
synthetic dataset to pre-train the DNN models, thus imposing a prior on the
weights. We use a grow-and-prune DNN synthesis approach to learn both the
architecture and weights during the training process. We use three different
data partitions to evaluate the MHDeep models trained with data collected from
74 individuals. We conduct data instance level and patient level evaluations.
MHDeep achieves an average test accuracy of 90.4%, 87.3%, and 82.4%,
respectively, for classifications between healthy instances and schizoaffective
disorder instances, major depressive disorder instances, and bipolar disorder
instances. At the patient level, MHDeep DNNs achieve an accuracy of 100%, 100%,
and 90.0% for the three mental health disorders, respectively.

<p>The generation of action potential brings into play specific mechanosensory
stimuli manifest in the variation of membrane capacitance, resulting from the
selective membrane permeability to ions exchanges and testifying to the central
role of electromechanical processes in the buildup mechanism of nerve impulse.
As well established [See e.g. D. Gross et al, Cellular and Molecular
Neurobiology vol. 3, p. 89 (1983)], in these electromechanical processes the
net instantaneous charge stored in the membrane is regulated by the rate of
change of the net fluid density through the membrane, orresponding to the
difference in densities of extacellular and intracellular fluids. An
electromechanical model is proposed for which mechanical forces are assumed to
result from the flow of ionic liquids through the nerve membrane, generating
pressure waves stimulating the membrane and hence controlling the net charge
stored in the membrane capacitor. The model features coupled nonlinear partial
differential equations: the familiar Hodgkin-Huxley's cable equation for the
transmembrane voltage in which the membrane capacitor is now a capacitive
diode, and the Heimburg-Jackson's nonlinear hydrodynamic equation for the
pressure wave controlling the total charge in the membrane capacitor. In the
stationary regime, the Hodgkin-Huxley cable equation with variable capacitance
reduces to a linear operator problem with zero eigenvalue, the bound states of
which can be obtained exactly for specific values of characteristic parameters
of the model. In the dynamical regime, numerical simulations of the modified
Hodgkin-Huxley equation lead to a variety of typical figures for the
transmembrane voltage, reminiscent of action potentials observed in real
physiological contexts.

<p>We consider the challenges in extracting stimulus-related neural dynamics
from other intrinsic processes and noise in naturalistic functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI). Most studies rely on inter-subject correlations (ISC)
of low-level regional activity and neglect varying responses in individuals. We
propose a novel, data-driven approach based on low-rank plus sparse (L+S)
decomposition to isolate stimulus-driven dynamic changes in brain functional
connectivity (FC) from the background noise, by exploiting shared network
structure among subjects receiving the same naturalistic stimuli. The
time-resolved multi-subject FC matrices are modeled as a sum of a low-rank
component of correlated FC patterns across subjects, and a sparse component of
subject-specific, idiosyncratic background activities. To recover the shared
low-rank subspace, we introduce a fused version of principal component pursuit
(PCP) by adding a fusion-type penalty on the differences between the rows of
the low-rank matrix. The method improves the detection of stimulus-induced
group-level homogeneity in the FC profile while capturing inter-subject
variability. We develop an efficient algorithm via a linearized alternating
direction method of multipliers to solve the fused-PCP. Simulations show
accurate recovery by the fused-PCP even when a large fraction of FC edges are
severely corrupted. When applied to natural fMRI data, our method reveals FC
changes that were time-locked to auditory processing during movie watching,
with dynamic engagement of sensorimotor systems for speech-in-noise. It also
provides a better mapping to auditory content in the movie than ISC.

<p>Motivated by biological considerations, we study sparse neural maps from an
input layer to a target layer with sparse activity, and specifically the
problem of storing $K$ input-target associations $(x,y)$, or memories, when the
target vectors $y$ are sparse. We mathematically prove that $K$ undergoes a
phase transition and that in general, and somewhat paradoxically, sparsity in
the target layers increases the storage capacity of the map. The target vectors
can be chosen arbitrarily, including in random fashion, and the memories can be
both encoded and decoded by networks trained using local learning rules,
including the simple Hebb rule. These results are robust under a variety of
statistical assumptions on the data. The proofs rely on elegant properties of
random polytopes and sub-gaussian random vector variables. Open problems and
connections to capacity theories and polynomial threshold maps are discussed.

the time is ripe to consider explicit implementations of this theory using deep
learning techniques. We propose a roadmap based on unsupervised neural
translation between multiple latent spaces (neural networks trained for

Abstract
Glutamate transporter proteins, expressed on both neurons and glia, serve as the main gatekeepers that dictate the spatial and temporal actions of extracellular glutamate. Glutamate is essential to the function of the healthy brain yet paradoxically contributes to the toxicity associated with many neurodegenerative diseases. Rapid transporter‐mediated glutamate uptake, primarily occurring at astrocytic processes, tightens the efficiency of excitatory network activity and prevents toxic glutamate build‐up in the extracellular space. Glutamate transporter dysfunction is thought to underlie myriad central nervous system (CNS) diseases including Alzheimer and Huntington disease. Over the past few decades, techniques such as biochemical uptake assays and electrophysiological recordings of transporter currents from individual astrocytes have revealed the remarkable ability of the CNS to efficiently clear extracellular glutamate. In more recent years, the rapidly evolving glutamate‐sensing “sniffers” now allow researchers to visualize real‐time glutamate transients on a millisecond time scale with single synapse spatial resolution in defined cell populations. As we transition to an increased reliance on optical‐based methods of glutamate visualization and quantification, it is of utmost importance to understand not only the advantages that glutamate biosensors bring to the table but also the associated caveats and their implications for data interpretation. In this review, we summarize the strengths and limitations of the commonly used methods to quantify glutamate uptake. We then discuss what these techniques, when viewed as a complementary whole, have told us about the brain's ability to regulate glutamate levels, in both health and in the context of neurodegenerative disease.

<p>Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are specialized, reticular structures of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that can be found covering the soma and proximal dendrites of a neuronal subpopulation. Recent studies have shown that PNNs can highly influence synaptic plasticity and are disrupted in different neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia. Interestingly, there is a growing evidence that microglia can promote the loss of PNNs and contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders. Based on this knowledge, we analyzed the impact of activated microglia on hippocampal neuronal networks in vitro. Therefore, primary cortical microglia were cultured and stimulated via polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C; 50 μg/ml) administration. The Poly I:C treatment induced the expression and secretion of different cytokines belonging to the CCL- and CXCL-motif chemokine family as well as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). In addition, the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) could be verified via RT-PCR analysis. Embryonic hippocampal neurons were then cultured for 12 days in vitro (DIV) and treated for 24 h with microglial conditioned medium. Interestingly, immunocytochemical staining of the PNN component Aggrecan revealed a clear disruption of PNNs accompanied by a significant increase of glutamatergic and a decrease of γ-aminobutyric acid-(GABA)ergic synapse numbers on PNN wearing neurons. In contrast, PNN negative neurons showed a significant reduction in both, glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. Electrophysiological recordings were performed via multielectrode array (MEA) technology and unraveled a significantly increased spontaneous network activity that sustained also 24 and 48 h after the administration of microglia conditioned medium. Taken together, we could observe a strong impact of microglial secreted factors on PNN integrity, synaptic plasticity and electrophysiological properties of cultured neurons. Our observations might enhance the understanding of neuron-microglia interactions considering the ECM.</p>

<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in young adults and a risk factor for acquired epilepsy. Severe TBI, after a period of time, causes numerous neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative problems with varying comorbidities; and brain homeostasis may never be restored. As a consequence of disrupted equilibrium, neuropathological changes such as circuit remodeling, reorganization of neural networks, changes in structural and functional plasticity, predisposition to synchronized activity, and post-translational modification of synaptic proteins may begin to dominate the brain. These pathological changes, over the course of time, contribute to conditions like Alzheimer disease, dementia, anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). PTE is one of the most common, devastating complications of TBI; and of those affected by a severe TBI, more than 50% develop PTE. The etiopathology and mechanisms of PTE are either unknown or poorly understood, which makes treatment challenging. Although anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are used as preventive strategies to manage TBI, control acute seizures and prevent development of PTE, their efficacy in PTE remains controversial. In this review, we discuss novel mechanisms and risk factors underlying PTE. We also discuss dysfunctions of neurovascular unit, cell-specific neuroinflammatory mediators and immune response factors that are vital for epileptogenesis after TBI. Finally, we describe current and novel treatments and management strategies for preventing PTE.</p>

<p>Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is the most frequent autosomal recessive ataxia in western countries, with a mean age of onset at 10–15 years. Patients manifest progressive cerebellar and sensory ataxia, dysarthria, lower limb pyramidal weakness, and other systemic manifestations. Previously, we described a family displaying two expanded GAA alleles not only in the proband affected by late-onset FRDA but also in the two asymptomatic family members: the mother and the younger sister. Both of them showed a significant reduction of frataxin levels, without any disease manifestation. Here, we analyzed if a protective mechanism might contribute to modulate the phenotype in this family. We particularly focused on the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), the first line of antioxidant defense in cells, and on the glutathione (GSH) system, an index of reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification ability. Our findings show a great reactivity of the GSH system to the frataxin deficiency, particularly in the asymptomatic mother, where the genes of GSH synthesis [glutamate–cysteine ligase (GCL)] and GSSG detoxification [GSH S-reductase (GSR)] were highly responsive. The GSR was activated even in the asymptomatic sister and in the proband, reflecting the need of buffering the GSSG increase. Furthermore, and contrasting the NRF2 expression documented in FRDA tissues, NRF2 was highly activated in the mother and in the younger sister, while it was constitutively low in the proband. This suggests that, also under frataxin depletion, the endogenous stimulation of NRF2 in asymptomatic FRDA subjects may contribute to protect against the progressive oxidative damage, helping to prevent the onset of neurological symptoms and highlighting an “out-brain origin” of the disease.</p>

<p>Multimodal neuroimaging provides a rich source of data for identifying brain regions associated with disease progression and aging. However, present studies still typically analyze modalities separately or aggregate voxel-wise measurements and analyses to the structural level, thus reducing statistical power. As a central example, previous works have used two quantitative MRI parameters—R2* and quantitative susceptibility (QS)—to study changes in iron associated with aging in healthy and multiple sclerosis subjects, but failed to simultaneously account for both. In this article, we propose a unified framework that combines information from multiple imaging modalities and regularizes estimates for increased interpretability, generalizability, and stability. Our work focuses on joint region detection problems where overlap between effect supports across modalities is encouraged but not strictly enforced. To achieve this, we combine L<sub>1</sub> (lasso), total variation (TV), and L<sub>2</sub> group lasso penalties. While the TV penalty encourages geometric regularization by controlling estimate variability and support boundary geometry, the group lasso penalty accounts for similarities in the support between imaging modalities. We address the computational difficulty in this regularization scheme with an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) optimizer. In a neuroimaging application, we compare our method against independent sparse and joint sparse models using a dataset of R2* and QS maps derived from MRI scans of 113 healthy controls: our method produces clinically-interpretable regions where specific iron changes are associated with healthy aging. Together with results across multiple simulation studies, we conclude that our approach identifies regions that are more strongly associated with the variable of interest (e.g., age), more accurate, and more stable with respect to training data variability. This work makes progress toward a stable and interpretable multimodal imaging analysis framework for studying disease-related changes in brain structure and can be extended for classification and disease prediction tasks.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.578594">Eros, Beauty, and Phon-Aesthetic Judgements of Language Sound. We Like It Flat and Fast, but Not Melodious. Comparing Phonetic and Acoustic Features of 16 European Languages</a></h4>

<p>This article concerns sound aesthetic preferences for European foreign languages. We investigated the phonetic-acoustic dimension of the linguistic aesthetic pleasure to describe the “music” found in European languages. The Romance languages, French, Italian, and Spanish, take a lead when people talk about melodious language – the music-like effects in the language (a.k.a., phonetic chill). On the other end of the melodiousness spectrum are German and Arabic that are often considered sounding harsh and un-attractive. Despite the public interest, limited research has been conducted on the topic of phonaesthetics, i.e., the subfield of phonetics that is concerned with the aesthetic properties of speech sounds (Crystal, 2008). Our goal is to fill the existing research gap by identifying the acoustic features that drive the auditory perception of language sound beauty. What is so music-like in the language that makes people say “it is music in my ears”? We had 45 central European participants listening to 16 auditorily presented European languages and rating each language in terms of 22 binary characteristics (e.g., beautiful – ugly and funny – boring) plus indicating their language familiarities, L2 backgrounds, speaker voice liking, demographics, and musicality levels. Findings revealed that all factors in complex interplay explain a certain percentage of variance: familiarity and expertise in foreign languages, speaker voice characteristics, phonetic complexity, musical acoustic properties, and finally musical expertise of the listener. The most important discovery was the trade-off between speech tempo and so-called linguistic melody (pitch variance): the faster the language, the flatter/more atonal it is in terms of the pitch (speech melody), making it highly appealing acoustically (sounding beautiful and sexy), but not so melodious in a “musical” sense.</p>

Purpose<p>White matter damage (WMD) was defined as the appearance of rough and uneven echo enhancement in the white matter around the ventricle. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a risk prediction model for neonatal WMD.</p>Materials and Methods<p>We collected data for 1,733 infants hospitalized at the Department of Neonatology at The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from 2017 to 2020. Infants were randomly assigned to training (n = 1,216) or validation (n = 517) cohorts at a ratio of 7:3. Multivariate logistic regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analyses were used to establish a risk prediction model and web-based risk calculator based on the training cohort data. The predictive accuracy of the model was verified in the validation cohort.</p>Results<p>We identified four variables as independent risk factors for brain WMD in neonates by multivariate logistic regression and LASSO analysis, including gestational age, fetal distress, prelabor rupture of membranes, and use of corticosteroids. These were used to establish a risk prediction nomogram and web-based calculator (https://caowenjun.shinyapps.io/dynnomapp/). The C-index of the training and validation sets was 0.898 (95% confidence interval: 0.8745–0.9215) and 0.887 (95% confidence interval: 0.8478–0.9262), respectively. Decision tree analysis showed that the model was highly effective in the threshold range of 1–61%. The sensitivity and specificity of the model were 82.5 and 81.7%, respectively, and the cutoff value was 0.099.</p>Conclusion<p>This is the first study describing the use of a nomogram and web-based calculator to predict the risk of WMD in neonates. The web-based calculator increases the applicability of the predictive model and is a convenient tool for doctors at primary hospitals and outpatient clinics, family doctors, and even parents to identify high-risk births early on and implementing appropriate interventions while avoiding excessive treatment of low-risk patients.</p>

<p>Enhanced neuronal activity in the healthy brain can induce de novo myelination and behavioral changes. As neuronal activity can be achieved using non-invasive measures, it may be of interest to utilize the innate ability of neuronal activity to instruct myelination as a novel strategy for myelin repair in demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Preclinical studies indicate that stimulation of neuronal activity in demyelinated lesions indeed has the potential to improve remyelination and that the stimulation paradigm is an important determinant of success. However, future studies will need to reveal the most efficient stimulation protocols as well as the biological mechanisms implicated. Nonetheless, clinical studies have already explored non-invasive brain stimulation as an attractive therapeutic approach that ameliorates MS symptomatology. However, whether symptom improvement is due to improved myelin repair remains unclear. In this mini-review, we discuss the neurobiological basis and potential of enhancing neuronal activity as a novel therapeutic approach in MS.</p>

<p>Background: Exercise training induces beneficial effects on neurodegenerative diseases, and specifically on multiple sclerosis (MS) and it’s model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, it is unclear whether exercise training exerts direct protective effects on the central nervous system (CNS), nor are the mechanisms of neuroprotection fully understood. In this study, we investigated the direct neuroprotective effects of high-intensity continuous training (HICT) against the development of autoimmune neuroinflammation and the role of resident microglia.</p><p>Methods: We used the transfer EAE model to examine the direct effects of training on the CNS. Healthy mice performed HICT by treadmill running, followed by injection of encephalitogenic proteolipid (PLP)-reactive T-cells to induce EAE. EAE severity was assessed clinically and pathologically. Brain microglia from sedentary (SED) and HICT healthy mice, as well as 5-days post EAE induction (before the onset of disease), were analyzed ex vivo for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) formation, mRNA expression of M1/M2 markers and neurotrophic factors, and secretion of cytokines and chemokines.</p><p>Results: Transfer of encephalitogenic T-cells into HICT mice resulted in milder EAE, compared to sedentary mice, as indicated by reduced clinical severity, attenuated T-cell, and neurotoxic macrophage/microglial infiltration, and reduced loss of myelin and axons. In healthy mice, HICT reduced the number of resident microglia without affecting their profile. Isolated microglia from HICT mice after transfer of encephalitogenic T-cells exhibited reduced ROS formation and released less IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) in response to PLP-stimulation.</p><p>Conclusions: These findings point to the critical role of training intensity in neuroprotection. HICT protects the CNS against autoimmune neuroinflammation by reducing microglial-derived ROS formation, neurotoxicity, and pro-inflammatory responses involved in the propagation of autoimmune neuroinflammation.</p>

<p>Extracellular vesicles or EVs are secreted by most, if not all, eukaryote cell types and recaptured by neighboring or distant cells. Their cargo, composed of a vast diversity of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, supports the EVs’ inter-cellular communication. The role of EVs in many cellular processes is now well documented both in physiological and pathological conditions. In this review, we focus on the role of EVs in the central nervous system (CNS) in physiological as well as pathological conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases or brain cancers. We also discuss the future of EVs in clinical research, in particular, their value as biomarkers as well as innovative therapeutic agents. While an increasing number of studies reveal EV research as a promising field, progress in the standardization of protocols and innovation in analysis as well as in research tools is needed to make a breakthrough in our understanding of their impact in the pathophysiology of the brain.</p>

<p>Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a widespread neurotropic virus. Primary infection of HSV-1 in facial epithelium leads to retrograde axonal transport to the central nervous system (CNS) where it establishes latency. Under stressful conditions, the virus reactivates, and new progeny are transported anterogradely to the primary site of infection. During the late stages of neuronal infection, axonal damage can occur, however, the impact of HSV-1 infection on the morphology and functional integrity of neuronal dendrites during the early stages of infection is unknown. We previously demonstrated that acute HSV-1 infection in neuronal cell lines selectively enhances Arc protein expression - a major regulator of long-term synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation, known for being a protein-interaction hub in the postsynaptic dendritic compartment. Thus, HSV-1 induced Arc expression may alter the functionality of infected neurons and negatively impact dendritic spine dynamics. In this study we demonstrated that HSV-1 infection induces structural disassembly and functional deregulation in cultured cortical neurons, an altered glutamate response, Arc accumulation within the somata, and decreased expression of spine scaffolding-like proteins such as PSD-95, Drebrin and CaMKIIβ. However, whether these alterations are specific to the HSV-1 infection mechanism or reflect a secondary neurodegenerative process remains to be determined.</p>

<p>Neuroserpin is a serine protease inhibitor that regulates the activity of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) in the nervous system. Neuroserpin is strongly expressed during nervous system development as well as during adulthood, when it is predominantly found in regions eliciting synaptic plasticity. In the hippocampus, neuroserpin regulates developmental neurogenesis, synaptic maturation and in adult mice it modulates synaptic plasticity and controls cognitive and social behavior. High expression levels of neuroserpin in the neocortex starting from prenatal stage and persisting during adulthood suggest an important role for the serpin in the formation of this brain region and in the maintenance of cortical functions. In order to uncover neuroserpin function in the murine neocortex, in this work we performed a comprehensive investigation of its expression pattern during development and in the adulthood. Moreover, we assessed the role of neuroserpin in cortex formation by comparing cortical lamination and neuronal maturation between neuroserpin-deficient and control mice. Finally, we evaluated a possible regulatory role of neuroserpin at cortical synapses in neuroserpin-deficient mice. We observed that neuroserpin is expressed starting from the beginning of corticogenesis until adulthood throughout the neocortex in several classes of glutamatergic projection neurons and GABA-ergic interneurons. However, in the absence of neuroserpin we did not detect any alteration either in cortical layer formation, or in neuronal soma size and dendritic length. Furthermore, no significant quantitative changes were observed in the proteome of cortical synapses upon neuroserpin deficiency. We conclude that, although strongly expressed in the neocortex, absence of neuroserpin does not lead to gross developmental abnormalities, and does not perturb the composition of the cortical synaptic proteome.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of neurodegenerative diseases. There are over 44 million people living with the disease worldwide. While there are currently no effective treatments for AD, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived brain organoids have the potential to provide a better understanding of Alzheimer’s pathogenesis. Nevertheless, developing brain organoid models is expensive, time consuming and often does not reflect disease progression. Using accurate and inexpensive computer simulations of human brain organoids can overcome the current limitations. Induced whole brain organoids (aiWBO) will greatly expand our ability to model AD and can guide wet lab research. In this study, we have successfully developed and validated artificially induced a whole brain organoid platform (NEUBOrg) using our previously validated machine learning platform, DeepNEU (v6.1). Using NEUBorg platform, we have generated aiWBO simulations of AD and provided a novel approach to test genetic risk factors associated with AD progression and pathogenesis.</p>

<p>The pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) involves activation of many NLRP3 inflammatory bodies, which may be related to amyloid β peptide and aggregation of misfolded proteins. Autophagy is an important regulator of inflammatory bodies. However, autophagy shows dynamic changes in the development of AD, and its role in inflammation remains controversial. In this study, the key link between autophagic disorders and the NLRP3 inflammasome in AD was investigated. APP/PS1 double transgenic mice and C57 mice with Aβ<sub>25–35</sub> injected into the lateral ventricle were used as two animal models of AD. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis showed that NLRP3 inflammasome-related proteins and inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-α, were increased and microglia were activated in the brains of both AD animal models. Endogenous overexpression of the APPswe gene and exogenous addition of Aβ<sub>25–35</sub> increased the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome-related proteins, while exogenous Aβ<sub>25–35</sub> intervention more significantly activated inflammation. Furthermore, LC3 was increased in the AD animal and cell models, and the level of Lamp1 decreased. After overexpression of the primary regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, TFEB, the lysosome protein Lamp1 was increased, and LC3 and inflammatory protein expression were decreased. These results suggest that the NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated inflammatory response is activated in AD animal and cell models, which may be related to the decline in autolysosome function. Overexpression of the TFEB protein can reduce the inflammatory response by improving autolysosome function in AD model cells.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65146">A nuclease- and bisulfite-based strategy captures strand-specific R-loops genome-wide</a></h4>

R-loops are three-stranded nucleic acid structures with essential roles in many nuclear processes. However, their unchecked accumulation is associated with genome instability and is observed in neurodevelopmental diseases and cancers. Genome-wide profiling of R-loops in normal and diseased cells can help identify locations of pathogenic R-loops and advance efforts to attenuate them. We present an antibody-independent R-loop detection strategy, BisMapR, that combines nuclease-based R-loop isolation with non-denaturing bisulfite chemistry to produce genome-wide profiles that retain strand information. BisMapR achieves greater resolution and is faster than existing strand-specific R-loop profiling strategies. In mouse embryonic stem cells, we apply BisMapR to find that gene promoters form R-loops in both directions and uncover a subset of active enhancers that, despite being bidirectionally transcribed, form R-loops exclusively on one strand. BisMapR reveals a previously unnoticed feature of active enhancers and provides a tool to systematically examine their mechanisms in gene expression.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64984">Shape deformation analysis reveals the temporal dynamics of cell-type-specific homeostatic and pathogenic responses to mutant huntingtin</a></h4>

Loss of cellular homeostasis has been implicated in the etiology of several neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie this loss remain poorly understood on a systems level in each case. Here, using a novel computational approach to integrate dimensional RNA-seq and in vivo neuron survival data, we map the temporal dynamics of homeostatic and pathogenic responses in four striatal cell types of Huntington’s disease (HD) model mice. This map shows that most pathogenic responses are mitigated and most homeostatic responses are decreased over time, suggesting that neuronal death in HD is primarily driven by the loss of homeostatic responses. Moreover, different cell types may lose similar homeostatic processes, for example, endosome biogenesis and mitochondrial quality control in <i>Drd1</i>-expressing neurons and astrocytes. HD relevance is validated by human stem cell, genome-wide association study, and post-mortem brain data. These findings provide a new paradigm and framework for therapeutic discovery in HD and other NDs.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63868">Exocyst-mediated membrane trafficking of the lissencephaly-associated ECM receptor dystroglycan is required for proper brain compartmentalization</a></h4>

To assemble a brain, differentiating neurons must make proper connections and establish specialized brain compartments. Abnormal levels of cell adhesion molecules disrupt these processes. Dystroglycan (Dg) is a major non-integrin cell adhesion receptor, deregulation of which is associated with dramatic neuroanatomical defects such as lissencephaly type II, or cobblestone brain. The previously established <i>Drosophila</i> model for cobblestone encephaly was used to understand how Dg is regulated in the brain. During development, Dg has a spatiotemporally dynamic expression pattern, fine-tuning of which is crucial for accurate brain assembly. In addition, mass spectrometry analyses identified numerous components associated with Dg in neurons, including several proteins of the exocyst complex. Data show that exocyst-based membrane trafficking of Dg allows its distinct expression pattern, essential for proper brain morphogenesis. Further studies of the Dg neuronal interactome will allow identification of new factors involved in the development of dystroglycanopathies and advance disease diagnostics in humans.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63556">Deficient spermiogenesis in mice lacking <i>Rlim</i></a></h4>

The X-linked gene<i> Rlim</i> plays major roles in female mouse development and reproduction, where it is crucial for the maintenance of imprinted X chromosome inactivation in extraembryonic tissues of embryos. However, while females carrying a systemic <i>Rlim</i> knockout (KO) die around implantation, male <i>Rlim</i> KO mice appear healthy and are fertile. Here we report an important role for <i>Rlim</i> in testis where it is highly expressed in post-meiotic round spermatids as well as in Sertoli cells. Systemic deletion of the <i>Rlim</i> gene results in lower numbers of mature sperm that contains excess cytoplasm, leading to decreased sperm motility and <i>in vitro</i> fertilization rates. Targeting the conditional <i>Rlim</i> cKO specifically to the spermatogenic cell lineage largely recapitulates this phenotype. These results reveal functions of <i>Rlim</i> in male reproduction specifically in round spermatids during spermiogenesis.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63537">Viral load and contact heterogeneity predict SARS-CoV-2 transmission and super-spreading events</a></h4>

SARS-CoV-2 is difficult to contain because many transmissions occur during pre-symptomatic infection. Unlike influenza, most SARS-CoV-2 infected people do not transmit while a small percentage infect large numbers of people. We designed mathematical models which link observed viral loads with epidemiologic features of each virus, including distribution of transmissions attributed to each infected person and duration between symptom onset in the transmitter and secondarily infected person. We identify that people infected with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza can be highly contagious for less than one day, congruent with peak viral load. SARS-CoV-2 super-spreader events occur when an infected person is shedding at a very high viral load and has a high number of exposed contacts. The higher predisposition of SARS-CoV-2 towards super-spreading events cannot be attributed to additional weeks of shedding relative to influenza. Rather, a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 exposes more people within equivalent physical contact networks, likely due to aerosolization.

COVID-19 CG (<a href="https://covidcg.org/">covidcg.org</a>) is an open resource for tracking SARS-CoV-2 single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), lineages, and clades using the virus genomes on the GISAID database while filtering by location, date, gene, and mutation of interest. COVID-19 CG provides significant time, labor, and cost-saving utility to projects on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, evolution, diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, and intervention tracking. Here, we describe case studies in which users can interrogate (1) SNVs in the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) across different geographical regions to inform the design and testing of therapeutics, (2) SNVs that may impact the sensitivity of commonly used diagnostic primers, and (3) the emergence of a dominant lineage harboring an S477N RBD mutation in Australia in 2020. To accelerate COVID-19 efforts, COVID-19 CG will be upgraded with new features for users to rapidly pinpoint mutations as the virus evolves throughout the pandemic and in response to therapeutic and public health interventions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63270">Dissecting phenotypic transitions in metastatic disease via photoconversion-based isolation</a></h4>

Cancer patients often harbor occult metastases, a potential source of relapse that is targetable only through systemic therapy. Studies of this occult fraction have been limited by a lack of tools with which to isolate discrete cells on spatial grounds. We developed PIC-IT, a photoconversion-based isolation technique allowing efficient recovery of cell clusters of any size – including single-metastatic cells – which are largely inaccessible otherwise. In a murine pancreatic cancer model, transcriptional profiling of spontaneously arising microcolonies revealed phenotypic heterogeneity, functionally reduced propensity to proliferate and enrichment for an inflammatory-response phenotype associated with NF-κB/AP-1 signaling. Pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB depleted microcolonies but had no effect on macrometastases, suggesting microcolonies are particularly dependent on this pathway. PIC-IT thus enables systematic investigation of metastatic heterogeneity. Moreover, the technique can be applied to other biological systems in which isolation and characterization of spatially distinct cell populations is not currently feasible.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63077">Molecular basis for functional connectivity between the voltage sensor and the selectivity filter gate in <i>Shaker</i> K+ channels</a></h4>

In <i>Shaker</i> K<sup>+</sup> channels, the S4-S5 linker couples the voltage sensor (VSD) and pore domain (PD). Another coupling mechanism is revealed using two W434F-containing channels: L361R:W434F and L366H:W434F. In L361R:W434F, W434F affects the L361R VSD seen as a shallower Q-V curve that crosses the G-V. In L366H:W434F, L366H relieves the W434F effect converting a non-conductive channel in a conductive one. We report a chain of residues connecting the VSD (S4) to the selectivity filter (SF) in the PD of an adjacent subunit as the molecular basis for voltage-sensor selectivity filter gate (VS-SF) coupling. Single alanine substitutions in this region (L409A, S411A, S412A or F433A) are enough to disrupt the VS-SF coupling, shown by the absence of Q-V and G-V crossing in L361R:W434F mutant and by the lack of ionic conduction in the L366H:W434F mutant. This residue chain defines a new coupling between the VSD and the PD in voltage-gated channels.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62875">Three-dimensional reconstruction of a whole insect reveals its phloem sap-sucking mechanism at nano-resolution</a></h4>

Using serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM), we report on the internal 3D structures of the brown planthopper, <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i> (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) at nanometer resolution for the first time. Within the reconstructed organs and tissues, we found many novel and fascinating internal structures in the planthopper such as naturally occurring three four-way rings connecting adjacent spiracles to facilitate efficient gas exchange, and fungal endosymbionts in a single huge insect cell occupying 22% of the abdomen volume to enable the insect to live on plant sap. To understand the muscle and stylet movement during phloem sap-sucking, the cephalic skeleton and muscles were reconstructed in feeding nymphs. The results revealed an unexpected contraction of the protractors of the stylets, and suggested a novel feeding model for the phloem sap-sucking.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61714">Physically asymmetric division of the <i>C. elegans</i> zygote ensures invariably successful embryogenesis</a></h4>

Asymmetric divisions that yield daughter cells of different sizes are frequent during early embryogenesis, but the importance of such a physical difference for successful development remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated this question using the first division of <i>C. elegans </i>embryos, which yields a large AB cell and a small P<sub>1</sub> cell. We equalized AB and P<sub>1</sub> sizes using acute genetic inactivation or optogenetic manipulation of the spindle positioning protein LIN-5. We uncovered that only some embryos tolerated equalization, and that there was a size asymmetry threshold for viability. Cell lineage analysis of equalized embryos revealed an array of defects, including faster cell cycle progression in P<sub>1</sub> descendants, as well as defects in cell positioning, division orientation and cell fate. Moreover, equalized embryos were more susceptible to external compression. Overall, we conclude that unequal first cleavage is essential for invariably successful embryonic development of <i>C. elegans</i>.

Optogenetics enables genome manipulations with high spatiotemporal resolution, opening exciting possibilities for fundamental and applied biological research. Here, we report the development of LiCre, a novel light-inducible Cre recombinase. LiCre is made of a single flavin-containing protein comprising the AsLOV2 photoreceptor domain of <i>Avena sativa</i> fused to a Cre variant carrying destabilizing mutations in its N-terminal and C-terminal domains. LiCre can be activated within minutes of illumination with blue light, without the need of additional chemicals. When compared to existing photoactivatable Cre recombinases based on two split units, LiCre displayed faster and stronger activation by light as well as a lower residual activity in the dark. LiCre was efficient both in yeast, where it allowed us to control the production of<i> β</i>-carotene with light, and in human cells. Given its simplicity and performances, LiCre is particularly suited for fundamental and biomedical research, as well as for controlling industrial bioprocesses.

Corticotropin-releasing factor type-1 receptors (CRFR1) are important for mediating the endocrine stress response, modulating synaptic transmission in the central nervous system, and are involved in mediating behaviors that include stress reactivity, anxiety, fear, pain, motivation, and addiction. Understanding the precise role of specific CRFR1 neuronal populations and circuits/networks in CRFR1-relevant behavior is limited by a lack of genetic access to CRFR1-expressing cells in rats. Here, we describe the generation and validation of a transgenic CRFR1:Cre-tdTomato rat line on a Wistar background. Within the central amygdala (CeA) of male and female CRFR1:Cre-tdTomato rats, we show that Crfr1 and Cre mRNA expression are highly colocalized and that CRFR1:Cre-tdTomato cells are largely confined to the medial subdivision of the CeA, consistent with CRF expression patterns in outbred animals. Using tdTomato fluorescent protein as a reporter, we measured membrane properties, inhibitory synaptic transmission, and CRF sensitivity in CeA CRFR1-expressing cells and found that these properties were similar to those previously reported in CRFR1:Cre mice, and that CeA CRFR1 neurons were excited by exogenous CRF application. We also show that stimulatory Gq-coupled DREADD receptors can be targeted to CeA CRFR1 cells via Cre-dependent expression and that these cells can be activated by clozapine-n-oxide (CNO) in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we report that DREADD-mediated activation of CeA CRFR1 cells increases anxiety-like behavior and increases nocifensive responses. Our results demonstrate the utility of this novel CRFR1:Cre-tdTomato transgenic rat line for studying the anatomy, physiology, and behavioral function of select CRFR1-expressing cell populations and circuits under normal conditions and in rat models of human disease.

Variants in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are associated with increased risk for familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). Pathogenic variants in LRRK2, including the common variant G2019S, result in increased LRRK2 kinase activity, supporting the therapeutic potential of LRRK2 kinase inhibitors for PD. To better understand the role of LRRK2 in disease and to support the clinical development of LRRK2 inhibitors, quantitative and high-throughput assays to measure LRRK2 levels and activity are needed. We developed and applied such assays to measure the levels of LRRK2 as well as the phosphorylation of LRRK2 itself or one of its substrates, Rab10 (pT73 Rab10). We observed increased LRRK2 activity in various cellular models of disease, including iPSC-derived microglia, as well as in human subjects carrying disease-linked variant in LRRK2 (G2019S). Capitalizing on the high-throughput and sensitive nature of these assays, we detected a significant reduction in LRRK2 activity in subjects carrying missense variants in LRRK2 associated with reduced disease risk. Finally, we optimized these assays to enable analysis of LRRK2 activity following inhibition in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and whole blood, demonstrating their potential utility as biomarkers to assess changes in LRRK2 expression and activity in the clinic.

Decomposition of whole-brain functional connectivity patterns reveals a principal gradient that captures the separation of sensorimotor cortex from heteromodal regions in the default mode network (DMN); this gradient captures the systematic order of networks on the cortical surface. Functional homotopy is strongest in sensorimotor areas, and weakest in heteromodal cortices, suggesting there may be differences between the left and right hemispheres (LH/RH) in the principal gradient, especially towards its apex. This study characterised hemispheric differences in the position of large-scale cortical networks along the principal gradient, and their functional significance. We collected resting-state fMRI and semantic and non-verbal reasoning task performance in 175+ healthy volunteers. We then extracted the principal gradient of connectivity for each participant and tested which networks showed significant hemispheric differences in gradient value. We investigated the functional associations of these differences by regressing participants' behavioural efficiency in tasks outside the scanner against their interhemispheric gradient difference for each network. LH showed a higher overall principal gradient value, consistent with its role in heteromodal semantic cognition. One frontotemporal control subnetwork was linked to individual differences in semantic cognition: when it was nearer heteromodal DMN on the principal gradient in LH, participants showed more efficient semantic retrieval. In contrast, when a dorsal attention subnetwork was closer to the heteromodal end of the principal gradient in RH, participants showed better visual reasoning. Lateralization of function may reflect differences in connectivity between control and heteromodal regions in LH, and attention and visual regions in RH.

Most studies investigating the impact of cerebral cortex (CC) onto the cerebellum highlight the role of the pontine mossy fibre system. However, cerebro-cerebellar communication may also be mediated by the olivary climbing fibres via a hub in the mesodiencephalic junction (MDJ). Here, we show that rostromedial and caudal parts of mouse CC predominantly project to the principal olive via the rostroventral MDJ and that more rostrolateral CC regions prominently project to the rostral medial accessory olive via the caudodorsal MDJ. Moreover, transneuronal tracing results show that the cerebellar nuclei innervate the olivary-projecting neurons in the MDJ that receive input from CC, and that they adhere to the same topographical relations. By unravelling these topographic and dense, mono- and disynaptic projections from the CC through the MDJ and inferior olive to the cerebellum, this work establishes that cerebro-cerebellar communication can be mediated by both the mossy fibre and climbing fibre system.

SARS-CoV-2 may cause acute respiratory disease, but the infection can also initiate neurological symptoms. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes brain inflammation in the macaque model. An increased metabolic activity in the pituitary gland of two macaques was observed by longitudinal positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT). Post-mortem analysis demonstrated infiltration of T-cells and activated microglia in the brain, and viral RNA was detected in brain tissues from one animal. We observed Lewy bodies in brains of all rhesus macaques. These data emphasize the virus' capability to induce neuropathology in this nonhuman primate model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. As in humans Lewy body formation is an indication for the development of Parkinson's disease, this data represents a warning for potential long-term neurological effects after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Females demonstrate greater risk aversion than males on a variety of tasks, but the underlying neurobiological basis is still unclear. We studied how theta (4-7 Hz) oscillations at rest related to three different measures of risk taking. Thirty-five participants (15 females) completed the Bomb Risk Elicitation Task (BRET), which allowed us to measure risk taking during an economic game. The Domain-Specific Risk-Taking Scale (DOSPERT) was used to measure self-assessed risk attitudes as well as reward and punishment sensitivities. In addition, the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS11) was included to quantify impulsiveness. To obtain measures of frontal theta asymmetry and frontal theta power, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) acquired prior to task completion, while participants were at rest. Frontal theta asymmetry correlated with average risk taking during the game but only in the female sample. By contrast, frontal theta power correlated with risk taking as well as with measures of reward and punishment sensitivity in the joint sample. Importantly, we showed that reward sensitivity mediated a correlation between risk taking and the power of theta oscillations localized to the anterior cingulate cortex. In addition, we observed significant sex differences in source- and sensor-space theta power, risk taking during the game, and reward sensitivity. Our findings suggest that sensitivity to rewards, associated with resting-state theta oscillations in the anterior cingulate cortex, is a trait that potentially contributes to sex differences in risk taking.

Information processing in the neocortex is carried out by neuronal circuits composed of different cell types. Recent census of the neocortex using single cell transcriptomic profiling has uncovered more than 100 putative cell types which subdivide major classes of excitatory and inhibitory neurons into distinct subclasses. The extent to which this molecular classification predicts distinct functional roles during behavior is unclear. Here, we combined population recordings using two-photon calcium imaging with spatial transcriptomics using multiplexed fluorescent in situ hybridization to achieve dense functional and molecular readout of cortical circuits during behavior. We characterized task-related responses across major transcriptomic neuronal subclasses and types in layer 2/3 of primary somatosensory cortex as mice performed a tactile working memory task. We find that as neurons are segregated into increasingly discrete molecular types, their task-related properties continue to differentiate. We identify an excitatory cell type, Baz1a, that is highly driven by tactile stimuli. Baz1a neurons homeostatically maintain stimulus responsiveness during altered sensory experience and show persistent enrichment of subsets of immediately early genes including Fos. Measurements of functional and anatomical connectivity reveal that upper layer 2/3 Baz1a neurons preferentially innervate somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons. We propose that this connection motif reflects a sensory-driven circuit hub that orchestrates local sensory processing in superficial layers of the neocortex.

Sensory-guided behavior requires reliable encoding of stimulus information in neural responses, and task-specific decoding through selective combination of these responses. The former has been the topic of intensive study, but the latter remains largely a mystery. We propose a framework in which shared stochastic modulation of task- informative neurons serves as a label to facilitate downstream decoding. Theoretical analysis and computational simulations demonstrate that a decoder that exploits such a signal can achieve flexible and accurate readout. Using this theoretical framework, we analyze behavioral and physiological data obtained from monkeys performing a visual orientation discrimination task. The responses of recorded V1 neurons exhibit strongly correlated modulation. This modulation is stronger in those neurons that are most informative for the behavioral task and it is substantially reduced in a control condition where recorded neurons are uninformative. We demonstrate that this modulator label can be used to improve downstream decoding within a small number of training trials, consistent with observed behavior. Finally, we find that the trial-by-trial modulatory signal estimated from V1 populations is also present in the activity of simultaneously recorded MT units, and preferentially so if they are task-informative, supporting the hypothesis that it serves as a label for the selection and decoding of relevant downstream neurons.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3/MJD) has a polyQ etiology but, the current knowledge on molecular processes and proteins involved in pathogenesis is not sufficient to fully determine the disease mechanism and find drug targets. Proteases and deubiquitinases, such as Ataxin-3, often have a profound impact on other proteins, yet the global model picture of SCA3 disease progression on the protein level, showing the most crucial proteins and pathways in the brain, and neurons, was not investigated previously. Here, we investigated molecular SCA3 mechanism using interdisciplinary research paradigm combining SCA3 knock-in model, behavior, MRI, brain proteomics, precise axonal proteomics, neuronal energy recordings, labeling of vesicles, and inclusions and focusing in axonal compartment. We have demonstrated that altered metabolic and mitochondrial proteins in the brain and the lack of weight gain in Ki91 SCA3/MJD mice is reflected by the failure of energy metabolism recorded in neonatal SCA3 cerebellar neurons. We have determined that further, during disease progression, proteins responsible for metabolism, cytoskeletal architecture, vesicular and axonal transport proteins are disturbed, revealing axons as one of the essential cell compartments in SCA3 pathogenesis. Therefore we focus on SCA3 pathogenesis in axonal and somatodendritic compartments revealing highly increased axonal localization of protein synthesis machinery, including ribosomes, translation factors, and RNA binding proteins, while the level of proteins responsible for cellular transport, and mitochondria was decreased. We demonstrate the accumulation of axonal vesicles in neonatal SCA3 cerebellar neurons and increased phosphorylation of SMI-312 positive adult cerebellar axons, which indicate axonal dysfunction in SCA3. In summary, the SCA3 disease mechanism is based on the broad influence of mutant ataxin-3 on the neuronal proteome. Processes central in our SCA3 model include disturbed localization of proteins between axonal and somatodendritic compartment, early neuronal energy deficit, altered neuronal cytoskeletal structure, an overabundance of protein synthetic machinery in axons.

Changes in the short-term dynamics of excitatory synapses over development have been observed throughout cortex, but their purpose and consequences remain unclear. Here, we propose that developmental changes in synaptic dynamics buffer the effect of slow inhibitory long-term plasticity, allowing for continuously stable neural activity. Using computational modelling we demonstrate that early in development excitatory short-term depression quickly stabilises neural activity, even in the face of strong, unbalanced excitation. We introduce a model of the commonly observed developmental shift from depression to facilitation and show that neural activity remains stable throughout development, while inhibitory synaptic plasticity slowly balances excitation, consistent with experimental observations. Our model predicts changes in the input responses from phasic to phasic-and-tonic and more precise spike timings. We also observe a gradual emergence of synaptic working memory mediated by short-term facilitation. We conclude that the developmental depression-to-facilitation shift may control excitation-inhibition balance throughout development with important functional consequences.

The brain connectome supports the information flow underlying human cognitions and should reflect the individual variability in human cognitive behaviors. Various studies have utilized the brain connectome to predict individual differences in human behaviors. However, traditional studies viewed the brain connectome feature as a vector of one dimension, a method which neglects topological structures of the brain connectome. To utilize topological properties of the brain connectome, we proposed that graph neural network which combines graph theory and neural network can be adopted. Different from previous node-driven graph neural networks that parameterize on the node feature transformation, we designed an edge-driven graph neural network named graph propagation network that parameterizes on the information propagation within the brain connectome. We compared various models in predicting the individual total cognition based on the resting-state functional connectome. The edge-driven graph propagation network showed the highest prediction accuracy and outperformed the node-driven graph neural network and traditional partial least square regression. The graph propagation network also revealed a directed network topology encoding the information flow, indicating that the high-level association cortices are responsible for the information integration underlying the total cognition. These results suggest that the edge-driven graph propagation network can better explore the topological structure of the brain connectome and can serve as a new method to associate the brain connectome and human behaviors.

Jellyfish are free-swimming, radially symmetric organisms with complex behaviors that arise from coordinated interactions between distinct, autonomously functioning body parts. This behavioral complexity evolved without a corresponding cephalization of the nervous system. The systems-level neural mechanisms through which such decentralized control is achieved remain unclear. Here, we address this question using the jellyfish, Clytia, and present it as a new neuroscience model. We describe a coordinated, asymmetric behavior in which food is passed from the umbrellar margin to the central mouth via directed margin folding. Using newly developed transgenic jellyfish lines to ablate or image specific neuronal subpopulations, we find, unexpectedly, that margin folding reflects the local activation of neural subnetworks that tile the umbrella. Modeling suggests that this structured ensemble activity emerges from sparse, local connectivity rules. These findings reveal how an organismal behavior can emerge from local interactions between functional modules in the absence of a central brain.

The human visual system is able to rapidly and accurately infer the material properties of objects and surfaces in the world. Yet an inverse optics approach---estimating the bi-directional reflectance distribution function of a surface, given its geometry and environment, and relating this to the optical properties of materials---is both intractable and computationally unaffordable. Rather, previous studies have found that the visual system may exploit low-level spatio-chromatic statistics as heuristics for material judgment. Here, we present results from psychophysics and modeling that supports the use of image statistics heuristics in the judgement of metallicity---the quality of appearance that suggests an object is made from metal. Using computer graphics, we generated stimuli that varied along two physical dimensions: the smoothness of a metal object, and the evenness of its transparent coating. This allowed for the manipulation of low-level image statistics, whilst ensuring that each stimulus was a naturalistic, physically plausible image. A conjoint-measurement task decoupled the contributions of these dimensions to the perception of metallicity. Low-level image features, as represented in the activations of oriented linear filters at different spatial scales, were found to correlate with the dimensions of the stimulus space, and decision-making models using these activations replicated observer performance in judging metal smoothness, coating bumpiness, and metallicity. Importantly, the performance of these models did not deteriorate when objects were rotated within their simulated scene, with corresponding changes in image properties. We therefore conclude that low-level image features may provide reliable cues for the robust perception of metallicity.

Our subjective sense that something we encounter is familiar to us is reflected by changes in pupil size. Although pupil dilation effects of familiarity have been well documented, familiarity is not the only, or even the strongest, contributing factor to pupil dilation. Changes in pupil dilation also reflect changes in brightness, affective or emotional responses, hormonal release, expected value or utility, and surprise, among others. Because many factors can affect pupil dilation, important questions remain about how pupil dilation changes reflect high-order cognitive processes, like attention and memory. For example, because surprise and familiarity are often difficult to fully distinguish (since new experiences can be surprising or unexpected), it can be difficult to tease apart pupil dilation effects of surprise versus familiarity. To better understand the effects of surprise and familiarity on pupil dilation, we examined pupil responses during a recognition memory task involving photographs of faces and outdoor scenes. When participants rated novel face images as "familiar," we observed a robust pupil dilation response.

Understanding the activity of the mammalian brain requires an integrative knowledge of circuits at distinct scales, ranging from ion channel time constants to synaptic connection probabilities. To understand how multiple parameters contribute synergistically to circuit behavior as a whole, neuronal computational models are regularly employed. However, traditional models containing anatomically and biophysically realistic neurons are computationally expensive when scaled to model local circuits. To overcome this limitation, we trained several artificial neural net (ANN) architectures to model the activity of realistic, multicompartmental neurons. We identified a single ANN that accurately predicted both subthreshold and action potential firing, and correctly generalized its responses to previously unobserved synaptic input. When scaled, processing times were orders of magnitude faster compared with traditional approaches, allowing for rapid parameter-space mapping in a circuit model of Rett syndrome. Thus, our ANN approach allows for rapid, detailed network experiments using inexpensive, readily available computational resources.

Recent neuroscience studies in awake and behaving animals demonstrate that a deeper understanding of brain function requires a deeper understanding of behavior. Detailed behavioral measurements are now often collected using video cameras, resulting in an increased need for computer vision algorithms that extract useful information from this video data. In this work we introduce a new semi-supervised framework that combines the output of supervised pose estimation algorithms (e.g. DeepLabCut) with unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods to produce interpretable, low-dimensional representations of behavioral videos that extract more information than pose estimates alone. We demonstrate this method, the Partitioned Subspace Variational Autoencoder (PS-VAE), on head-fixed mouse behavioral videos. In a close up video of a mouse face, where we track pupil location and size, our method extracts unsupervised outputs that correspond to the eyelid and whisker pad positions, with no additional user annotations required. We use this resulting interpretable behavioral representation to construct saccade and whisking detectors, and quantify the accuracy with which these signals can be decoded from neural activity in visual cortex. In a two-camera mouse video we show how our method separates movements of experimental equipment from animal behavior, and extracts unsupervised features like chest position, again with no additional user annotation needed. This allows us to construct paw and body movement detectors, and decode individual features of behavior from widefield calcium imaging data. Our results demonstrate how the interpretable partitioning of behavioral videos provided by the PS-VAE can facilitate downstream behavioral and neural analyses.

Alpha-band oscillations (8-14 Hz) are essential for attention and perception processes by facilitating the selection of relevant information. Directing visuospatial endogenous (voluntary) attention to a given location consistently results in a power suppression of alpha activity over occipito-parietal areas contralateral to the attended visual field. In contrast, the neural oscillatory dynamics underlying the involuntary capture of attention, or exogenous attention, are currently under debate. By exploiting the inherent capacity of emotionally salient visual stimuli to capture attention, we aimed to investigate whether exogenous attention is characterized by either a reduction or an increase in alpha-band activity. Electroencephalographic activity was recorded while participants completed a Posner visuospatial cueing task, in which a lateralized image with either positive, negative, or neutral emotional content competed with a target stimulus presented in the opposite hemifield. Compared with trials with no distractors, alpha power was reduced over occipital regions contralateral to distracting images. This reduction of alpha activity turned out to be functionally relevant, as it correlated with impaired behavioural performance on the ongoing task and was enhanced for distractors with negative valence. Taken together, our results demonstrate that visuospatial exogenous attention is characterized by a suppression of alpha-band activity contralateral to distractor location, similar to the oscillatory underpinnings of endogenous attention. Further, these results highlight the key role of exogenous attention as an adaptive mechanism for the efficient detection of biologically salient stimuli.

Amyloid beta (A{beta} of Alzheimers disease) and -synuclein (-Syn of Parkinsons disease) form large fibrils. Evidence is increasing however that much smaller oligomers are more toxic and that these oligomers can form transmembrane ion channels. We have proposed previously that A{beta}42 oligomers, annular protofibrils, and ion channels adopt concentric {beta}-barrel molecular structures. Here we extend that hypothesis to the superfamily of , {beta}, and {gamma}-synucleins. Our models of numerous Synuclein oligomers, annular protofibrils, tubular protofibrils, lipoproteins, and ion channels were developed to be consistent with sizes, shapes, molecular weights, and secondary structures of assemblies as determined by EM and other studies. The models have the following features: 1) all subunits have identical structures and interactions; 2) they are consistent with conventional {beta}-barrel theory; 3) the distance between walls of adjacent {beta}-barrels is between 0.6 and 1.2 nm; 4) hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, interactions among aromatic side-chains, burial and tight packing of hydrophobic side-chains, and aqueous solvent exposure of hydrophilic side-chains are relatively optimal; and 5) residues that are identical among distantly related homologous proteins cluster in the interior of most oligomers whereas residues that are hypervariable are exposed on protein surfaces. Atomic scale models of some assemblies were developed.

Even though the retinal microcircuit organization has been described in detail at the single-cell level, little is known about how groups of retinal cells' coordinated activity encode and process parallel information representing the spatial and temporal structure of changing environmental conditions. To describe the population dynamics of retinal neuronal ensembles, we used microelectrode array recordings that describe hundreds of retinal ganglion cells' simultaneous activity in response to a short movie captured in the natural environment where our subject develops their visual behaviors. The vectorization of population activity allowed the identification of retinal neuronal ensembles that synchronize to specific segments of natural stimuli. These synchronous retinal neuronal ensembles were reliably activated by the same stimuli at different trials, indicating a robust population response of retinal microcircuits. The generation of asynchronous events required integrating a physiologically meaningful time window larger than 80 ms, demonstrating that retinal neuronal ensembles' time integration filters non-structured visual information. Interestingly, individual neurons could be part of several ensembles indicating that parallel circuits could encode environmental conditions changes. We conclude that parallel neuronal ensembles could represent the functional unit of retinal computations and propose that the further study of retinal neuronal ensembles could reveal emergent properties of retinal circuits that individual cells' activity cannot explain.

The unbiased identification of brain circuits responsible for behavior and their local cellular computations is a challenge for neuroscience. We establish here a hierarchical cross-scale approach from behavioral modeling and fMRI in task-performing mice to cellular network dynamics to identify how reward predictions are represented in the forebrain upon olfactory conditioning. fMRI identified functional segregation in reward prediction and error computations among olfactory cortices and subcortical circuits. Among them, the olfactory tubercle contributed both to dynamic reward predictions and prediction error. In this region, cellular recordings revealed two parallel neuronal populations for prediction coding. One population produced stabilized predictions as distributed stimulus-bound transient network activity; the other evolved during anticipatory waiting and fully reflected predicted value in single-units, dynamically integrating the recent cue-specific history of uncertain outcomes. Thus, the cross-scale approach revealed regional functional differentiation among the distributed forebrain circuits with a limbic hotspot for multiple non-redundant reward prediction coding.

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measures the hemoglobin concentration changes associated with neuronal activity. Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) consists in reconstructing the optical density changes measured from scalp channels to the near-infrared light attenuation changes within the cortical regions. In the present study, we adapted a nonlinear source localization method developed and validated in the context of Electro- and Magneto-Encephalography (EEG/MEG): the Maximum Entropy on the Mean (MEM), to solve the inverse problem of DOT reconstruction. We first introduced depth weighting strategy within the MEM framework for DOT reconstruction to avoid biasing the reconstruction results of DOT towards superficial regions. We also proposed a new initialization of the MEM model improving the temporal accuracy of the original MEM framework. To evaluate MEM performance and compare with widely used depth weighted Minimum Norm Estimate (MNE) inverse solution, we applied a realistic simulation scheme which contained 4000 simulations generated by 250 different seeds at differ- ent locations and 4 spatial extents ranging from 3 to 40cm2 along the cortical surface. Our results showed that overall MEM provided more accurate DOT reconstructions than MNE. Moreover, we found that MEM was remained particularly robust in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. The proposed method was further illustrated, by comparing to functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) activation maps, on real data involving finger tapping tasks with two different montages. The results showed that MEM provided more accurate HbO and HbR reconstructions in spatial agreement with the fMRI main cluster, when compared to MNE.

Laboratory behavioural tasks are an essential research tool. As questions asked of behaviour and brain activity become more sophisticated, the ability to specify and run richly structured tasks becomes more important. An increasing focus on reproducibility also necessitates accurate communication of task logic to other researchers. To these ends we developed pyControl, a system of open source hardware and software for controlling behavioural experiments comprising; a simple yet flexible Python-based syntax for specifying tasks as extended state machines, hardware modules for building behavioural setups, and a graphical user interface designed for efficiently running high throughput experiments on many setups in parallel, all with extensive online documentation. These tools make it quicker, easier and cheaper to implement rich behavioural tasks at scale. As important, pyControl facilitates communication and reproducibility of behavioural experiments through a highly readable task definition syntax and self-documenting features.

Neuroscientists now routinely record the activity of large numbers of neurons at high temporal and spatial resolution. With these capabilities comes the promise of causally intervening during these recordings by perturbing neurons or changing experimental conditions, requiring tight integration between data acquisition, analysis, and manipulation. Unfortunately, solutions for real-time interventions are rare, difficult to design and implement, and remain largely unused. Here, we introduce improv, a software platform that allows users to flexibly specify and manage adaptive experiments to integrate data collection, preprocessing, visualization, and user-defined analytics. Using improv for streaming data analysis for two photon calcium imaging and behavior we demonstrate how access to online information can be used for automated, integrated experimentation.

<p>by Michael A. Henson</p>

Approximately 30% of patients who have <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection (CDI) will suffer at least one incident of reinfection. While the underlying causes of CDI recurrence are poorly understood, interactions between <i>C</i>. <i>difficile</i> and commensal gut bacteria are thought to play an important role. In this study, an <i>in silico</i> pipeline was used to process 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence data of 225 stool samples from 93 CDI patients into sample-specific models of bacterial community metabolism. Clustered metabolite production rates generated from post-diagnosis samples generated a high <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> abundance cluster containing disproportionately large numbers of recurrent samples and patients. This cluster was predicted to have significantly reduced capabilities for secondary bile acid synthesis but elevated capabilities for aromatic amino acid catabolism. When applied to 16S sequence data of 40 samples from fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) patients suffering from recurrent CDI and their stool donors, the community modeling method generated a high <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> abundance cluster with a disproportionate large number of pre-FMT samples. This cluster also was predicted to exhibit reduced secondary bile acid synthesis and elevated aromatic amino acid catabolism. Collectively, these <i>in silico</i> predictions suggest that <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> may create a gut environment favorable for <i>C</i>. <i>difficile</i> spore germination and/or toxin synthesis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oxhFM0vDAYo" width="1" />

Biomineralization is the process by which organisms use minerals to harden their tissues and provide them with physical support. Biomineralizing cells concentrate the mineral in vesicles that they secret into a dedicated compartment where crystallization occurs. The dynamics of vesicle motion and the molecular mechanisms that control it, are not well understood. Sea urchin larval skeletogenesis provides an excellent platform for investigating the kinetics of mineral-bearing vesicles. Here we used lattice light-sheet microscopy to study the three-dimensional (3D) dynamics of calcium-bearing vesicles in the cells of normal sea urchin embryos and of embryos where skeletogenesis is blocked through the inhibition of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR). We developed computational tools for displaying 3D-volumetric movies and for automatically quantifying vesicle dynamics. Our findings imply that calcium vesicles perform an active diffusion motion in both, calcifying (skeletogenic) and non-calcifying (ectodermal) cells of the embryo. The diffusion coefficient and vesicle speed are larger in the mesenchymal skeletogenic cells compared to the epithelial ectodermal cells. These differences are possibly due to the distinct mechanical properties of the two tissues, demonstrated by the enhanced f-actin accumulation and myosinII activity in the ectodermal cells compared to the skeletogenic cells. Vesicle motion is not directed toward the biomineralization compartment, but the vesicles slow down when they approach it, and probably bind for mineral deposition. VEGFR inhibition leads to an increase of vesicle volume but hardly changes vesicle kinetics and doesn’t affect f-actin accumulation and myosinII activity. Thus, calcium vesicles perform an active diffusion motion in the cell of the sea urchin embryo, with diffusion length and speed that inversely correlate with the strength of the actomyosin network. Overall, our studies provide an unprecedented view of calcium vesicle 3D-dynamics and point toward cytoskeleton remodeling as an important effector of the motion of mineral-bearing vesicles.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CNEX6T54w-c" width="1" />

<p>by Christof Fehrman, Tyler D. Robbins, C. Daniel Meliza</p>

Neurons exhibit diverse intrinsic dynamics, which govern how they integrate synaptic inputs to produce spikes. Intrinsic dynamics are often plastic during development and learning, but the effects of these changes on stimulus encoding properties are not well known. To examine this relationship, we simulated auditory responses to zebra finch song using a linear-dynamical cascade model, which combines a linear spectrotemporal receptive field with a dynamical, conductance-based neuron model, then used generalized linear models to estimate encoding properties from the resulting spike trains. We focused on the effects of a low-threshold potassium current (K<sub>LT</sub>) that is present in a subset of cells in the zebra finch caudal mesopallium and is affected by early auditory experience. We found that K<sub>LT</sub> affects both spike adaptation and the temporal filtering properties of the receptive field. The direction of the effects depended on the temporal modulation tuning of the linear (input) stage of the cascade model, indicating a strongly nonlinear relationship. These results suggest that small changes in intrinsic dynamics in tandem with differences in synaptic connectivity can have dramatic effects on the tuning of auditory neurons.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nuWmhYhqbb0" width="1" />

Phenotypic profiling of large three-dimensional microscopy data sets has not been widely adopted due to the challenges posed by cell segmentation and feature selection. The computational demands of automated processing further limit analysis of hard-to-segment images such as of neurons and organoids. Here we describe a comprehensive shallow-learning framework for automated quantitative phenotyping of three-dimensional (3D) image data; using unsupervised data-driven voxel-based feature learning, which enables computationally facile classification, clustering and advanced data visualization. We demonstrate the analysis potential on complex 3D images by investigating the phenotypic alterations of: neurons in response to apoptosis-inducing treatments and morphogenesis for oncogene-expressing human mammary gland acinar organoids. Our novel implementation of image analysis algorithms called Phindr3D allowed rapid implementation of data-driven voxel-based feature learning into 3D high content analysis (HCA) operations and constitutes a major practical advance as the computed assignments represent the biology while preserving the heterogeneity of the underlying data. Phindr3D is provided as Matlab code and as a stand-alone program (https://github.com/DWALab/Phindr3D).<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oFpQv-jtcOk" width="1" />

<p>by Daniel J. A. Derrick, Kathryn Wolton, Richard A. Currie, Marcus John Tindall</p>

Effective regulation of the sonic hedgehog (Shh) signalling pathway is essential for normal development in a wide variety of species. Correct Shh signalling requires the formation of Shh aggregates on the surface of producing cells. Shh aggregates subsequently diffuse away and are recognised in receiving cells located elsewhere in the developing embryo. Various mechanisms have been postulated regarding how these aggregates form and what their precise role is in the overall signalling process. To understand the role of these mechanisms in the overall signalling process, we formulate and analyse a mathematical model of Shh aggregation using nonlinear ordinary differential equations. We consider Shh aggregate formation to comprise of multimerisation, association with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) and binding with lipoproteins. We show that the size distribution of the Shh aggregates formed on the producing cell surface resembles an exponential distribution, a result in agreement with experimental data. A detailed sensitivity analysis of our model reveals that this exponential distribution is robust to parameter changes, and subsequently, also to variations in the processes by which Shh is recruited by HSPGs and lipoproteins. The work demonstrates the time taken for different sized Shh aggregates to form and the important role this likely plays in Shh diffusion.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BLSEo3H11Kk" width="1" />

<p>by Satyabrata Parida, Hari Bharadwaj, Michael G. Heinz</p>

Significant scientific and translational questions remain in auditory neuroscience surrounding the neural correlates of perception. Relating perceptual and neural data collected from humans can be useful; however, human-based neural data are typically limited to evoked far-field responses, which lack anatomical and physiological specificity. Laboratory-controlled preclinical animal models offer the advantage of comparing single-unit and evoked responses from the same animals. This ability provides opportunities to develop invaluable insight into proper interpretations of evoked responses, which benefits both basic-science studies of neural mechanisms and translational applications, e.g., diagnostic development. However, these comparisons have been limited by a disconnect between the types of spectrotemporal analyses used with single-unit spike trains and evoked responses, which results because these response types are fundamentally different (point-process versus continuous-valued signals) even though the responses themselves are related. Here, we describe a unifying framework to study temporal coding of complex sounds that allows spike-train and evoked-response data to be analyzed and compared using the same advanced signal-processing techniques. The framework uses a set of peristimulus-time histograms computed from single-unit spike trains in response to polarity-alternating stimuli to allow advanced spectral analyses of both slow (envelope) and rapid (temporal fine structure) response components. Demonstrated benefits include: (1) novel spectrally specific temporal-coding measures that are less confounded by distortions due to hair-cell transduction, synaptic rectification, and neural stochasticity compared to previous metrics, e.g., the correlogram peak-height, (2) spectrally specific analyses of spike-train modulation coding (magnitude and phase), which can be directly compared to modern perceptually based models of speech intelligibility (e.g., that depend on modulation filter banks), and (3) superior spectral resolution in analyzing the neural representation of nonstationary sounds, such as speech and music. This unifying framework significantly expands the potential of preclinical animal models to advance our understanding of the physiological correlates of perceptual deficits in real-world listening following sensorineural hearing loss.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ypkZ6mgh1lI" width="1" />

Proteases are an important class of enzymes, whose activity is central to many physiologic and pathologic processes. Detailed knowledge of protease specificity is key to understanding their function. Although many methods have been developed to profile specificities of proteases, few have the diversity and quantitative grasp necessary to fully define specificity of a protease, both in terms of substrate numbers and their catalytic efficiencies. We have developed a concept of “selectome”; the set of substrate amino acid sequences that uniquely represent the specificity of a protease. We applied it to two closely related members of the Matrixin family–MMP-2 and MMP-9 by using substrate phage display coupled with Next Generation Sequencing and information theory-based data analysis. We have also derived a quantitative measure of substrate specificity, which accounts for both the number of substrates and their relative catalytic efficiencies. Using these advances greatly facilitates elucidation of substrate selectivity between closely related members of a protease family. The study also provides insight into the degree to which the catalytic cleft defines substrate recognition, thus providing basis for overcoming two of the major challenges in the field of proteolysis: 1) development of highly selective activity probes for studying proteases with overlapping specificities, and 2) distinguishing targeted proteolysis from bystander proteolytic events.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PgzcHEn1DAc" width="1" />

Limited data exists regarding the disease course of Huntington's Disease (HD) in children and young adults. Here, we evaluate the trajectory of various cognitive skill development as a function of cytosine‐adenine‐guanine (CAG) repeat length in children and adolescents that carry the mutation that causes HD. We discovered that the development of verbal skills seems to plateau earlier as CAG repeat length increases. These findings increase our understanding of the relationship between neurodegeneration and neurodevelopment and may have far‐reaching implications for future gene‐therapy treatment strategies.

Objectives
Patients with established Parkinson's disease (PD) display differences in peripheral blood markers of immune function, including leukocyte differential counts, compared with controls. These differences may be useful biomarkers to predict PD and may shed light on pathogenesis. We sought to identify whether peripheral immune dysregulation was associated with increased risk of subsequent PD diagnosis.


Methods
We examined the relationship between incident PD, baseline differential leukocyte count and other blood markers of acute inflammation in UK Biobank (UKB), a longitudinal cohort with ~500,000 participants. We used a range of sensitivity analyses and Mendelian randomization (MR) to further explore the nature of associations.


Results
After excluding individuals with comorbidities which could influence biomarkers of inflammation, 465 incident PD cases and 312,125 controls remained. Lower lymphocyte count was associated with increased risk of subsequent PD diagnosis (per 1‐SD decrease in lymphocyte count odds ratio [OR] = 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07–1.32, padjusted = 0.01). There was some evidence that reductions in eosinophil counts, monocyte counts and C‐reactive protein (CRP) were associated with increased PD risk, and that higher neutrophil count was also associated. Only the association between lower lymphocyte count and increased PD risk remained robust to sensitivity analyses. MR suggested that the effect of lower lymphocyte count on PD risk may be causal (per 1‐SD decrease in lymphocyte count; ORMR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.01–1.18, p = 0.02).


Interpretation
We provide converging evidence from observational analyses in UKB and MR that lower lymphocyte count is associated with an increased risk of subsequent PD. ANN NEUROL 2021

Most reported improved clinical (86%) and examination (82%) skills. All gained an understanding of different health care systems, and 83% reported deeper commitment to underserved populations. A total of 41 participants (57%) reported more judicious use of resources upon return to the United States. Global health electives had a positive impact on neurology trainees. More attention to the host country perspective and predeparture training may help inform program structure and participant expectations in the future. ANN NEUROL 2021

<p>The Kalman filter is a fundamental filtering algorithm that fuses noisy
sensory data, a previous state estimate, and a dynamics model to produce a
principled estimate of the current state. It assumes, and is optimal for,
linear models and white Gaussian noise. Due to its relative simplicity and
general effectiveness, the Kalman filter is widely used in engineering
applications. Since many sensory problems the brain faces are, at their core,
filtering problems, it is possible that the brain possesses neural circuitry
that implements equivalent computations to the Kalman filter. The standard
approach to Kalman filtering requires complex matrix computations that are
unlikely to be directly implementable in neural circuits. In this paper, we
show that a gradient-descent approximation to the Kalman filter requires only
local computations with variance weighted prediction errors. Moreover, we show
that it is possible under the same scheme to adaptively learn the dynamics
model with a learning rule that corresponds directly to Hebbian plasticity. We
demonstrate the performance of our method on a simple Kalman filtering task,
and propose a neural implementation of the required equations.

<p>Implicit regularization in deep learning is perceived as a tendency of
gradient-based optimization to fit training data with predictors of minimal
"complexity." The fact that only some types of data give rise to generalization
is understood to result from them being especially amenable to fitting with low
complexity predictors. A major challenge towards formalizing this intuition is
to define complexity measures that are quantitative yet capture the essence of
data that admits generalization. With an eye towards this challenge, we analyze
the implicit regularization in tensor factorization, equivalent to a certain
non-linear neural network. We characterize the dynamics that gradient descent
induces on the factorization, and establish a bias towards low tensor rank, in
compliance with existing empirical evidence. Then, motivated by tensor rank
capturing implicit regularization of a non-linear neural network, we
empirically explore it as a measure of complexity, and find that it stays
extremely low when fitting standard datasets. This leads us to believe that
tensor rank may pave way to explaining both implicit regularization of neural
networks, and the properties of real-world data translating it to
generalization.

<p>The Clustered Shortest-Path Tree Problem (CluSPT) plays an important role in
various types of optimization problems in real-life. Recently, some
Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm (MFEA) have been introduced to deal with
the CluSPT, however these researches still have some shortcomings such as
evolution operators only perform on complete graphs, huge resource consumption
for finding the solution on large search spaces. To overcome these limitations,
this paper describes a MFEA-based approach to solve the CluSPT. The proposed
algorithm utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to construct the spanning trees in
clusters while using evolutionary operators for building the spanning tree
connecting clusters. This approach takes advantage of both exact and
approximate algorithms so it enables the algorithm to function efficiently on
complete and sparse graphs alike. Furthermore, evolutionary operators such as
individual encoding and decoding methods are also designed with great
consideration regarding performance and memory usage. We have included a proof
on the repairing method's efficacy in ensuring all solutions are valid. We have
conducted tests on various types of Euclidean instances to assess the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and methods. Experiment results point
out the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm existing heuristic algorithms
in most of the test cases. The impact of the proposed MFEA was analyzed and a
possible influential factor that may be useful for further study was also
pointed out.

<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative
diseases, with around 50 million patients worldwide. Accessible and
non-invasive methods of diagnosing and characterising AD are therefore urgently
required. Electroencephalography (EEG) fulfils these criteria and is often used
when studying AD. Several features derived from EEG were shown to predict AD
with high accuracy, e.g. signal complexity and synchronisation. However, the
dynamics of how the brain transitions between stable states have not been
properly studied in the case of AD and EEG data. Energy landscape analysis is a
method that can be used to quantify these dynamics. This work presents the
first application of this method to both AD and EEG. Energy landscape assigns
energy value to each possible state, i.e. pattern of activations across brain
regions. The energy is inversely proportional to the probability of occurrence.
By studying the features of energy landscapes of 20 AD patients and 20 healthy
age-matched counterparts, significant differences were found. The dynamics of
AD patients' brain networks were shown to be more constrained - with more local
minima, less variation in basin size, and smaller basins. We show that energy
landscapes can predict AD with high accuracy, performing significantly better
than baseline models.

<p>Given a neural network, training data, and a threshold, it was known that it
is NP-hard to find weights for the neural network such that the total error is
below the threshold. We determine the algorithmic complexity of this
fundamental problem precisely, by showing that it is ER-complete. This means
that the problem is equivalent, up to polynomial-time reductions, to deciding
whether a system of polynomial equations and inequalities with integer
coefficients and real unknowns has a solution. If, as widely expected, ER is
strictly larger than NP, our work implies that the problem of training neural
networks is not even in NP.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">We aimed to identify clinical, molecular and radiological correlates of activities of daily living (ADL) in patients with cerebellar atrophy caused by <em class="a-plus-plus">PMM2</em> mutations (PMM2-CDG), the most frequent congenital disorder of glycosylation. Twenty-six PMM2-CDG patients (12 males; mean age 13 ± 11.1 years) underwent a standardized assessment to measure ADL, ataxia (brief ataxia rating scale, BARS) and phenotype severity (Nijmegen CDG rating scale, NCRS). MRI biometry of the cerebellum and the brainstem were performed in 23 patients (11 males; aged 5 months–18 years) and 19 control subjects with equal gender and age distributions. The average total ADL score was 15.3 ± 8.5 (range 3–32 out of 36 indicating severe functional disability), representing variable functional outcome in PMM2-CDG patients. Total ADL scores were significantly correlated with NCRS (<em class="a-plus-plus">r</em><sup class="a-plus-plus"><em class="a-plus-plus">2</em></sup> = 0.55, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001) and BARS scores (<em class="a-plus-plus">r</em><sup class="a-plus-plus"><em class="a-plus-plus">2</em></sup> = 0.764; <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001). Severe intellectual disability, peripheral neuropathy, and severe <em class="a-plus-plus">PMM2</em> variants were all significantly associated with worse functional outcome. Higher ADL scores were significantly associated with decreased diameters of cerebellar vermis (<em class="a-plus-plus">r</em><sup class="a-plus-plus"><em class="a-plus-plus">2</em></sup> = 0.347; <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.004), hemispheres (<em class="a-plus-plus">r</em><sup class="a-plus-plus"><em class="a-plus-plus">2</em></sup> = 0.436; <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.005), and brainstem, particularly the mid-pons (<em class="a-plus-plus">r</em><sup class="a-plus-plus"><em class="a-plus-plus">2</em></sup> = 0.64; <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001) representing the major radiological predictor of functional disability score in multivariate regression analysis. We show that cerebellar syndrome severity, cognitive level, peripheral neuropathy, and genotype correlate with ADL used to quantify disease-related deficits in PMM2-CDG. Brainstem involvement should be regarded among functional outcome predictors in patients with cerebellar atrophy caused by PMM2-CDG.</p>

<p>Connective Field (CF) modeling estimates the local spatial integration between signals in distinct cortical visual field areas. As we have shown previously using 7T data, CF can reveal the visuotopic organization of visual cortical areas even when applied to BOLD activity recorded in the absence of external stimulation. This indicates that CF modeling can be used to evaluate cortical processing in participants in which the visual input may be compromised. Furthermore, by using Bayesian CF modeling it is possible to estimate the co-variability of the parameter estimates and therefore, apply CF modeling to single cases. However, no previous studies evaluated the (Bayesian) CF model using 3T resting-state fMRI data. This is important since 3T scanners are much more abundant and more often used in clinical research compared to 7T scanners. Therefore in this study, we investigate whether it is possible to obtain meaningful CF estimates from 3T resting state (RS) fMRI data. To do so, we applied the standard and Bayesian CF modeling approaches on two RS scans, which were separated by the acquisition of visual field mapping data in 12 healthy participants. Our results show good agreement between RS- and visual field (VF)- based maps using either the standard or Bayesian CF approach. In addition to quantify the uncertainty associated with each estimate in both RS and VF data, we applied our Bayesian CF framework to provide the underlying marginal distribution of the CF parameters. Finally, we show how an additional CF parameter, beta, can be used as a data-driven threshold on the RS data to further improve CF estimates. We conclude that Bayesian CF modeling can characterize local functional connectivity between visual cortical areas from RS data at 3T. Moreover, observations obtained using 3T scanners were qualitatively similar to those reported for 7T. In particular, we expect the ability to assess parameter uncertainty in individual participants will be important for future clinical studies.</p>

Objective<p>Alpha-neurofeedback (α-NFB) is a novel therapy which trains individuals to volitionally increase their alpha power to improve pain. Learning during NFB is commonly measured using static parameters such as mean alpha power. Considering the biphasic nature of alpha rhythm (high and low alpha), dynamic parameters describing the time spent by individuals in high alpha state and the pattern of transitioning between states might be more useful. Here, we quantify the changes during α-NFB for chronic pain in terms of dynamic changes in alpha states.</p>Methods<p>Four chronic pain and four healthy participants received five NFB sessions designed to increase frontal alpha power. Changes in pain resilience were measured using visual analogue scale (VAS) during repeated cold-pressor tests (CPT). Changes in alpha state static and dynamic parameters such as fractional occupancy (time in high alpha state), dwell time (length of high alpha state) and transition probability (probability of moving from low to high alpha state) were analyzed using Friedman’s Test and correlated with changes in pain scores using Pearson’s correlation.</p>Results<p>There was no significant change in mean frontal alpha power during NFB. There was a trend of an increase in fractional occupancy, mean dwell duration and transition probability of high alpha state over the five sessions in chronic pain patients only. Significant correlations were observed between change in pain scores and fractional occupancy (r = −0.45, p = 0.03), mean dwell time (r = -0.48, p = 0.04) and transition probability from a low to high state (r = -0.47, p = 0.03) in chronic pain patients but not in healthy participants.</p>Conclusion<p>There is a differential effect between patients and healthy participants in terms of correlation between change in pain scores and alpha state parameters. Parameters providing a more precise description of the alpha power dynamics than the mean may help understand the therapeutic effect of neurofeedback on chronic pain.</p>

<p>In general, only one diffusion model would be applied to whole field-of-view voxels in the intravoxel incoherent motion-magnetic resonance imaging (IVIM-MRI) study. However, the choice of the applied diffusion model can significantly influence the estimated diffusion parameters. The quality of the diffusion analysis can influence the reliability of the perfusion analysis. This study proposed an optimal model mapping method to improve the reliability of the perfusion parameter estimation in the IVIM study. Six healthy volunteers (five males and one female; average age of 38.3 ± 7.5 years). Volunteers were examined using a 3.0 Tesla scanner. IVIM-MRI of the brain was applied at 17 b-values ranging from 0 to 2,500 s/mm<sup>2</sup>. The Gaussian model, the Kurtosis model, and the Gamma model were found to be optimal for the CSF, white matter (WM), and gray matter (GM), respectively. In the mean perfusion fraction (f<sub>p</sub>) analysis, the GM/WM ratios were 1.16 (Gaussian model), 1.80 (Kurtosis model), 1.94 (Gamma model), and 1.54 (Optimal model mapping); in the mean pseudo diffusion coefficient (D<sup>*</sup>) analysis, the GM/WM ratios were 1.18 (Gaussian model), 1.19 (Kurtosis model), 1.56 (Gamma model), and 1.24 (Optimal model mapping). With the optimal model mapping method, the estimated f<sub>p</sub> and D<sup>*</sup> were reliable compared with the conventional methods. In addition, the optimal model maps, the associated products of this method, may provide additional information for clinical diagnosis.</p>

<p>Background: Cognitive impairment is one of the core symptoms of schizophrenia, which is considered to be significantly correlated to prognosis. In recent years, many studies have suggested that metabolic disorders could be related to a higher risk of cognitive defects in a general setting. However, there has been limited evidence on the association between metabolism and cognitive function in patients with early-stage schizophrenia.</p><p>Methods: In this study, we recruited 172 patients with early-stage schizophrenia. Relevant metabolic parameters were examined and cognitive function was evaluated by using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) to investigate the relationship between metabolic disorder and cognitive impairment.</p><p>Results: Generally, the prevalence of cognitive impairment among patients in our study was 84.7% (144/170), which was much higher than that in the general population. Compared with the general Chinese setting, the study population presented a higher proportion of metabolic disturbance. Patients who had metabolic disturbance showed no significant differences on cognitive function compared with the other patients. Correlation analysis showed that metabolic status was significantly correlated with cognitive function as assessed by the cognitive domain scores (p &lt; 0.05), while such association was not found in further multiple regression analysis.</p><p>Conclusions: Therefore, there may be no association between metabolic disorder and cognitive impairment in patients with early-stage schizophrenia.</p><p>Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03451734.

<p>Human not only can effortlessly recognize objects, but also characterize object categories into semantic concepts with a nested hierarchical structure. One dominant view is that top-down conceptual guidance is necessary to form such hierarchy. Here we challenged this idea by examining whether deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) could learn relations among objects purely based on bottom-up perceptual experience of objects through training for object categorization. Specifically, we explored representational similarity among objects in a typical DCNN (e.g., AlexNet), and found that representations of object categories were organized in a hierarchical fashion, suggesting that the relatedness among objects emerged automatically when learning to recognize them. Critically, the emerged relatedness of objects in the DCNN was highly similar to the WordNet in human, implying that top-down conceptual guidance may not be a prerequisite for human learning the relatedness among objects. In addition, the developmental trajectory of the relatedness among objects during training revealed that the hierarchical structure was constructed in a coarse-to-fine fashion, and evolved into maturity before the establishment of object recognition ability. Finally, the fineness of the relatedness was greatly shaped by the demand of tasks that the DCNN performed, as the higher superordinate level of object classification was, the coarser the hierarchical structure of the relatedness emerged. Taken together, our study provides the first empirical evidence that semantic relatedness of objects emerged as a by-product of object recognition in DCNNs, implying that human may acquire semantic knowledge on objects without explicit top-down conceptual guidance.</p>

<p>The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a non-selective ligand-gated cation channel involved in synaptic transmission, plasticity, and brain pathology. In the hippocampal dentate gyrus, TRPV1 localizes to dendritic spines and dendrites postsynaptic to excitatory synapses in the molecular layer (ML). At these same synapses, the cannabinoid CB<sub>1</sub> receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>R) activated by exogenous and endogenous cannabinoids localizes to the presynaptic terminals. Hence, as both receptors are activated by endogenous anandamide, co-localize, and mediate long-term depression of the excitatory synaptic transmission at the medial perforant path (MPP) excitatory synapses though by different mechanisms, it is plausible that they might be exerting a reciprocal influence from their opposite synaptic sites. In this anatomical scenario, we tested whether the absence of TRPV1 affects the endocannabinoid system. The results obtained using biochemical techniques and immunoelectron microscopy in a mouse with the genetic deletion of TRPV1 show that the expression and localization of components of the endocannabinoid system, included CB<sub>1</sub>R, change upon the constitutive absence of TRPV1. Thus, the expression of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) drastically increased in TRPV1<sup>−/−</sup> whole homogenates. Furthermore, CB<sub>1</sub>R and MAGL decreased and the cannabinoid receptor interacting protein 1a (CRIP1a) increased in TRPV1<sup>−/−</sup> synaptosomes. Also, CB<sub>1</sub>R positive excitatory terminals increased, the number of excitatory terminals decreased, and CB<sub>1</sub>R particles dropped significantly in inhibitory terminals in the dentate ML of TRPV1<sup>−/−</sup> mice. In the outer 2/3 ML of the TRPV1<sup>−/−</sup> mutants, the proportion of CB<sub>1</sub>R particles decreased in dendrites, and increased in excitatory terminals and astrocytes. In the inner 1/3 ML, the proportion of labeling increased in excitatory terminals, neuronal mitochondria, and dendrites. Altogether, these observations indicate the existence of compensatory changes in the endocannabinoid system upon TRPV1 removal, and endorse the importance of the potential functional adaptations derived from the lack of TRPV1 in the mouse brain.</p>

<p>Bacopa monnieri (BM) is a herbal supplement that increases signaling molecules implicated in synaptogenesis. Combined with cognitive stimulation, it may be a viable supplement to enhance long-term potentiation (LTP) and improve cognitive health in older adults. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial asked 28 healthy adults aged over 55 years to complete cognitive training (CT) 3 hours weekly for 12 weeks. Fifteen consumed a standardized extract of BM and 13 consumed a placebo daily. Cognitive tasks, life-satisfaction, memory complaints and mood were assessed, and bloods analyzed for serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) before and after 12-weeks of the intervention. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) in gray (GM) and white matter (WM) were also analyzed. Results demonstrated slower reaction time in an image discrimination task in the BM group and faster reaction time in a spatial working memory task (SWM-O RT) in the placebo group. Mean accuracy was higher in the BM group for these tasks, suggesting a change in the speed accuracy trade-off. Exploratory neuroimaging analysis showed increased WM mean diffusivity (MD) and GM dispersion of neurites (orientation dispersion index, ODI) and decreased WM fractional anisotropy (FA) and GM neurite density (ND) in the BM group. No other outcomes reached statistical significance. An increase in ODI with a decrease in MD and ND in the BM group may indicate an increase in network complexity (through higher dendritic branching) accompanied by dendritic pruning to enhance network efficiency. These neuroimaging outcomes conflict with the behavioral results, which showed poorer reaction time in the BM group. Given the exploratory outcomes and inconsistent findings between the behavioral and neuroimaging data, a larger study is needed to confirm the synaptogenic mechanisms of BM.</p>

<p>Introduction: Functional imaging studies have demonstrated the recruitment of additional neural resources as a possible mechanism to compensate for age and Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related cerebral pathology, the efficacy of which is potentially modulated by underlying structural network connectivity. Additionally, structural network efficiency (SNE) is associated with intelligence across the lifespan, which is a known factor for resilience to cognitive decline. We hypothesized that SNE may be a surrogate of the physiological basis of resilience to cognitive decline in elderly persons without dementia and with age- and AD-related cerebral pathology.Methods: We included 85 cognitively normal elderly subjects or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients submitted to baseline diffusion imaging, liquor specimens, amyloid-PET and longitudinal cognitive assessments. SNE was calculated from baseline MRI scans using fiber tractography and graph theory. Mixed linear effects models were estimated to investigate the association of higher resilience to cognitive decline with higher SNE and the modulation of this association by increased cerebral amyloid, liquor tau or WMHV. Results: For the majority of cognitive outcome measures, higher SNE was associated with higher resilience to cognitive decline (p-values: 0.011–0.039). Additionally, subjects with higher SNE showed more resilience to cognitive decline at higher cerebral amyloid burden (p-values: &lt;0.001–0.036) and lower tau levels (p-values: 0.002–0.015).Conclusion: These results suggest that SNE to some extent may quantify the physiological basis of resilience to cognitive decline most effective at the earliest stages of AD, namely at increased amyloid burden and before increased tauopathy.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.632141">Resilience and Psychobiological Response to Stress in Older People: The Mediating Role of Coping Strategies</a></h4>

<p>Resilience, the ability to overcome adversity and face stressful demands and experiences, has been strongly associated with successful aging, a low risk of diseases and high mental and physical functioning. This relationship could be based on adaptive coping behaviors, but more research is needed to gain knowledge about the strategies employed to confront social stress. Thus, we aimed to investigate the role of the use of active or passive coping strategies by resilient people in dealing with stressful situations. For this purpose, we measured resilience, coping strategies, and perceived stress in 66 healthy older adults (31 men and 35 women) between 56 and 75 years old who were exposed to stress (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST) or a control situation. The stress response was analyzed at endocrine (cortisol) and psychological (anxiety) levels. In the stress condition, moderated mediation analysis showed a conditional indirect effect of resilience on cortisol reactivity through active coping. However, passive coping strategies did not mediate the resilience-cortisol relationship. In addition, neither active nor passive coping mediated the relationship between resilience and the anxiety response. These results suggest that resilience is associated with active coping strategies, which in turn could explain, at least in part, individual differences in the cortisol response to a psychosocial laboratory stressor. These factors may prevent the development of stress-related pathologies associated with aging and facilitate healthy and satisfactory aging.</p>

<p>Objective: To investigate variation in the characteristics of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), brain activity, and intrinsic functional connectivity (FC) across the Alzheimer's disease spectrum (ADS).</p><p>Methods: The study recruited 20 individuals in each of the following categories: Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), subjective cognitive decline (SCD), and healthy control (HC). All participants completed the 3.0T resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and arterial spin labeling scans in addition to neuropsychological tests. Additionally, the normalized CBF, regional homogeneity (ReHo), and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of individual subjects were compared in the ADS. Moreover, the changes in intrinsic FC were investigated across the ADS using the abnormal rCBF regions as seeds and behavioral correlations. Finally, a support-vector classifier model of machine learning was used to distinguish individuals with ADS from HC.</p><p>Results: Compared to the HC subjects, patients with AD showed the poorest level of rCBF in the left precuneus (LPCUN) and right middle frontal gyrus (RMFG) among all participants. In addition, there was a significant decrease in the ALFF in the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and ReHo in the right PCC. Moreover, RMFG- and LPCUN-based FC analysis revealed that the altered FCs were primarily located in the posterior brain regions. Finally, a combination of altered rCBF, ALFF, and ReHo in posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCUN) showed a better ability to differentiate ADS from HC, AD from SCD and MCI, but not MCI from SCD.</p><p>Conclusions: The study demonstrated the significance of an altered rCBF and brain activity in the early stages of ADS. These findings, therefore, present a potential diagnostic neuroimaging-based biomarker in ADS. Additionally, the study provides a better understanding of the pathophysiology of AD.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, characterized by a complex etiology that makes therapeutic strategies still not effective. A true understanding of key pathological mechanisms and new biomarkers are needed, to identify alternative disease-modifying therapies counteracting the disease progression. Iron is an essential element for brain metabolism and its imbalance is implicated in neurodegeneration, due to its potential neurotoxic effect. However, the role of iron in different stages of dementia is not clearly established. This study aimed to investigate the potential impact of iron both in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in serum to improve early diagnosis and the related therapeutic possibility. In addition to standard clinical method to detect iron in serum, a precise quantification of total iron in CSF was performed using graphite-furnace atomic absorption spectrometry in patients affected by AD, mild cognitive impairment, frontotemporal dementia, and non-demented neurological controls. The application of machine learning techniques, such as clustering analysis and multiclassification algorithms, showed a new potential stratification of patients exploiting iron-related data. The results support the involvement of iron dysregulation and its potential interaction with biomarkers (Tau protein and Amyloid-beta) in the pathophysiology and progression of dementia.</p>

The committed step of eukaryotic DNA replication occurs when the pairs of Mcm2-7 replicative helicases that license each replication origin are activated. Helicase activation requires the recruitment of Cdc45 and GINS to Mcm2-7, forming Cdc45-Mcm2-7-GINS complexes (CMGs). Using single-molecule biochemical assays to monitor CMG formation, we found that Cdc45 and GINS are recruited to loaded Mcm2-7 in two stages. Initially, Cdc45, GINS, and likely additional proteins are recruited to unstructured Mcm2-7 N-terminal tails in a Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK)-dependent manner, forming Cdc45-tail-GINS intermediates (CtGs). DDK phosphorylation of multiple phosphorylation sites on the Mcm2‑7 tails modulates the number of CtGs formed per Mcm2-7. In a second, inefficient event, a subset of CtGs transfer their Cdc45 and GINS components to form CMGs. Importantly, higher CtG multiplicity increases the frequency of CMG formation. Our findings reveal molecular mechanisms sensitizing helicase activation to DDK levels with implications for control of replication origin efficiency and timing.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65066">March Mammal Madness and the power of narrative in science outreach</a></h4>

March Mammal Madness is a science outreach project that, over the course of several weeks in March, reaches hundreds of thousands of people in the United States every year. We combine four approaches to science outreach – gamification, social media platforms, community event(s), and creative products – to run a simulated tournament in which 64 animals compete to become the tournament champion. While the encounters between the animals are hypothetical, the outcomes rely on empirical evidence from the scientific literature. Players select their favored combatants beforehand, and during the tournament scientists translate the academic literature into gripping “play-by-play” narration on social media. To date ~1100 scholarly works, covering almost 400 taxa, have been transformed into science stories. March Mammal Madness is most typically used by high-school educators teaching life sciences, and we estimate that our materials reached ~1% of high-school students in the United States in 2019. Here we document the intentional design, public engagement, and magnitude of reach of the project. We further explain how human psychological and cognitive adaptations for shared experiences, social learning, narrative, and imagery contribute to the widespread use of March Mammal Madness.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64611">Dichloroacetate reverses sepsis-induced hepatic metabolic dysfunction</a></h4>

Metabolic reprogramming between resistance and tolerance occurs within the immune system in response to sepsis. While metabolic tissues such as the liver are subjected to damage during sepsis, how their metabolic and energy reprogramming ensures survival is unclear. Employing comprehensive metabolomic, lipidomic, and transcriptional profiling in a mouse model of sepsis, we show that hepatocyte lipid metabolism, mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) energetics, and redox balance are significantly reprogrammed after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). We identify increases in TCA cycle metabolites citrate, cis-aconitate, and itaconate with reduced fumarate and triglyceride accumulation in septic hepatocytes. Transcriptomic analysis of liver tissue supports and extends the hepatocyte findings. Strikingly, the administration of the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) inhibitor dichloroacetate reverses dysregulated hepatocyte metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction. In summary, our data indicate that sepsis promotes hepatic metabolic dysfunction and that targeting the mitochondrial PDC/PDK energy homeostat rebalances transcriptional and metabolic manifestations of sepsis within the liver.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64317">Evolutionary shifts in taste coding in the fruit pest <i>Drosophila suzukii</i></a></h4>

Although most <i>Drosophila</i> species lay eggs in overripe fruit, the agricultural pest <i>Drosophila suzukii</i> lays eggs in ripe fruit. We found that changes in bitter taste perception have accompanied this adaptation. We show that bitter-sensing mutants of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> undergo a shift in egg laying preference toward ripe fruit. <i>D. suzukii</i> has lost 20% of the bitter-sensing sensilla from the labellum, the major taste organ of the head. Physiological responses to various bitter compounds are lost. Responses to strawberry purées are lost from two classes of taste sensilla. Egg laying is not deterred by bitter compounds that deter other species. Profiling of labellar transcriptomes reveals reduced expression of several bitter <i>Gr</i> genes (<i>gustatory receptors</i>). These findings support a model in which bitter compounds in early ripening stages deter egg laying in most <i>Drosophila</i> species, but a loss of bitter response contributes to the adaptation of <i>D. suzukii</i> to ripe fruit.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64207">Dynamic interactions between the RNA chaperone Hfq, small regulatory RNAs and mRNAs in live bacterial cells</a></h4>

RNA-binding proteins play myriad roles in regulating RNAs and RNA-mediated functions. In bacteria, the RNA chaperone Hfq is an important post-transcriptional gene regulator. Using live-cell super-resolution imaging, we can distinguish Hfq binding to different sizes of cellular RNAs. We demonstrate that under normal growth conditions, Hfq exhibits widespread mRNA-binding activity, with the distal face of Hfq contributing mostly to the mRNA binding <i>in vivo</i>. In addition, sRNAs can either co-occupy Hfq with the mRNA as a ternary complex, or displace the mRNA from Hfq in a binding face-dependent manner, suggesting mechanisms through which sRNAs rapidly access Hfq to induce sRNA-mediated gene regulation. Finally, our data suggest that binding of Hfq to certain mRNAs through its distal face can recruit RNase E to promote turnover of these mRNAs in an sRNA-independent manner, and such regulatory function of Hfq can be decoyed by sRNA competitors that bind strongly at the distal face.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63819">Incomplete removal of extracellular glutamate controls synaptic transmission and integration at a cerebellar synapse</a></h4>

Synapses of glutamatergic mossy fibers onto cerebellar unipolar brush cells (UBCs) generate slow excitatory (ON) or inhibitory (OFF) postsynaptic responses dependent on the complement of glutamate receptors expressed on the UBC's large dendritic brush. Using mouse brain slice recording and computational modeling of synaptic transmission, we found that substantial glutamate is maintained in the UBC synaptic cleft, sufficient to modify spontaneous firing in OFF UBCs and tonically desensitize AMPARs of ON UBCs. The source of this ambient glutamate was spontaneous, spike-independent exocytosis from the mossy fiber terminal, and its level was dependent on activity of glutamate transporters EAAT1-2. Increasing levels of ambient glutamate shifted the polarity of evoked synaptic responses in ON UBCs and altered the phase of responses to in vivo-like synaptic activity. Unlike classical fast synapses, receptors at the UBC synapse are virtually always exposed to a significant level of glutamate, which varies in a graded manner during transmission.

<i>Drosophila</i> reproductive behaviors are directed by <i>fruitless</i> neurons. A reanalysis of genomic studies shows that genes encoding <i>dpr</i> and <i>DIP</i> Immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) members are expressed in <i>fru P1</i> neurons. We find that each <i>fru P1 </i>and <i>dpr/DIP</i> (<i>fru P1</i> ∩ <i>dpr/DIP</i>) overlapping expression pattern is similar in both sexes, but there are dimorphisms in neuronal morphology and cell number. Behavioral studies of <i>fru P1</i> ∩ <i>dpr/DIP</i> perturbation genotypes indicates that the mushroom body functions together with the lateral protocerebral complex to direct courtship behavior. A single-cell RNA-seq analysis of <i>fru P1</i> neurons shows that many <i>DIPs</i> have high expression in a small set of neurons, whereas the <i>dprs</i> are often expressed in a larger set of neurons at intermediate levels, with a myriad of <i>dpr/DIP</i> expression combinations. Functionally, we find that perturbations of sex hierarchy genes and of <i>DIP-ε</i> change the sex-specific morphologies of <i>fru P1</i> ∩ <i>DIP-α</i> neurons.

In recent years, a wealth of <i>Drosophila</i> neuroscience data have become available including cell type, connectome/synaptome datasets for both the larva and adult fly. To facilitate integration across data modalities and to accelerate the understanding of the functional logic of the fly brain, we have developed FlyBrainLab, a unique open-source computing platform that integrates 3D exploration and visualization of diverse datasets with interactive exploration of the functional logic of modeled executable brain circuits. FlyBrainLab's User Interface, Utilities Libraries and Circuit Libraries bring together neuroanatomical, neurogenetic and electrophysiological datasets with computational models of different researchers for validation and comparison within the same platform. Seeking to transcend the limitations of the connectome/synaptome, FlyBrainLab also provides libraries for molecular transduction arising in sensory coding in vision/olfaction. Together with sensory neuron activity data, these libraries serve as entry points for the exploration, analysis, comparison and evaluation of circuit functions of the fruit fly brain.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60220">Identifying molecular features that are associated with biological function of intrinsically disordered protein regions</a></h4>

In previous work, we showed that intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins contain sequence-distributed molecular features that are conserved over evolution, despite little sequence similarity that can be detected in alignments (Zarin et al. 2019). Here, we aim to use these molecular features to predict specific biological functions for individual IDRs and identify the molecular features within them that are associated with these functions. We find that the predictable functions are diverse. Examining the associated molecular features, we note some that are consistent with previous reports, and identify others that were previously unknown. We experimentally confirm that elevated isoelectric point and hydrophobicity, features that are positively associated with mitochondrial localization, are necessary for mitochondrial targeting function. Remarkably, increasing isoelectric point in a synthetic IDR restores weak mitochondrial targeting. We believe feature analysis represents a new systematic approach to understand how biological functions of IDRs are specified by their protein sequences.

Elucidating how long-term exposure to optical defects affects visual processing is key for understanding the capacity for, and limits of, sensory plasticity. Here, we show evidence of functional reallocation of sensory processing resources following long-term exposure to poor optical quality. Using adaptive optics to bypass all optical defects, we assessed visual processing in neurotypically-developed adults with healthy eyes and with keratoconus—a corneal disease causing severe optical aberrations. Under fully-corrected optical conditions, keratoconus patients showed altered contrast sensitivity, with impaired sensitivity for fine spatial details and better-than-typical sensitivity for coarse details. Both gains and losses in sensitivity were more pronounced in patients experiencing poorer optical quality in their daily life, and mediated by changes in signal enhancement mechanisms. These findings show that adult neural processing adapts to better match the changes in sensory inputs caused by long-term exposure to altered optics.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57417">Integration of IL-2 and IL-4 signals coordinates divergent regulatory T cell responses and drives therapeutic efficacy</a></h4>

Cells exist within complex milieus of communicating factors, such as cytokines, that combine to generate context-specific responses, yet nearly all knowledge about the function of each cytokine and the signaling propagated downstream of their recognition is based on the response to individual cytokines. Here, we found that regulatory T cells (Tregs) integrate concurrent signaling initiated by IL-2 and IL-4 to generate a response divergent from the sum of the two pathways in isolation. IL-4 stimulation of STAT6 phosphorylation was blocked by IL-2, while IL-2 and IL-4 synergized to enhance STAT5 phosphorylation, IL-10 production, and the selective proliferation of IL-10-producing Tregs, leading to increased inhibition of conventional T cell activation and the reversal of asthma and multiple sclerosis in mice. These data define a mechanism of combinatorial cytokine signaling and lay the foundation upon which to better understand the origins of cytokine pleiotropy while informing improved the clinical use of cytokines.

Local translation in neurons is mediated in part by the reactivation of stalled polysomes. However, the mechanism for stalling of the polysomes is not understood. Stalled polysomes may be enriched within neuronal RNA granules defined by dense collections of compacted ribosomes found in the pellet of sucrose gradients used to separate polysomes from monosomes. We find that this fraction, isolated from P5 rat brains of both sexes, is enriched in proteins implicated in stalled polysome function, such as the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and Up-frameshift mutation 1 homolog (UPF1). Ribosome profiling of this fraction showed an abundance of footprint reads derived from mRNAs of cytoskeletal proteins implicated in neuronal development and an enrichment of footprint reads on RNA binding proteins. Compared to those usually found in ribosome profiling studies, the footprint reads were more extended on their 3' end and were found in reproducible peaks in the mRNAs. These footprint reads were enriched in motifs previously associated with mRNAs cross-linked to FMRP in vivo, independently linking the ribosomes in the sedimented pellet to the ribosomes associated with FMRP in the cell. The data supports a model in which specific sequences in mRNAs act to stall translation elongation in neurons, attracting FMRP and beginning a process where stalled ribosomes are packaged and transported in RNA granules.

Extensive sampling of neural activity during rich cognitive phenomena is critical for robust understanding of brain function. We present the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD), in which high-resolution fMRI responses to tens of thousands of richly annotated natural scenes are measured while participants perform a continuous recognition task. To optimize data quality, we develop and apply novel estimation and denoising techniques. Simple visual inspections of the NSD data reveal clear representational transformations along the ventral visual pathway. Further exemplifying the inferential power of the dataset, we use NSD to build and train deep neural network models that predict brain activity more accurately than state-of-the-art models from computer vision. NSD also includes substantial resting-state and diffusion data, enabling network neuroscience perspectives to constrain and enhance models of perception and memory. Given its unprecedented scale, quality, and breadth, NSD opens new avenues of inquiry in cognitive and computational neuroscience.

In multi-talker situations individuals adapt behaviorally to the listening challenge mostly with ease, but how do brain neural networks shape this adaptation? We here establish a long-sought link between large-scale neural communications in electrophysiology and behavioral success in the control of attention in challenging listening situations. In an age-varying sample of N = 154 individuals, we find that connectivity between intrinsic neural oscillations extracted from source-reconstructed electroencephalography is top-down regulated during a challenging dual-talker listening task. These dynamics emerge as spatially organized modulations in power-envelope correlations of alpha and low-beta neural oscillations during ~2 seconds intervals most critical for listening behavior relative to resting-state baseline. First, left frontoparietal low-beta connectivity (16-24 Hz) increased during anticipation and processing of spatial-attention cue before speech presentation. Second, posterior alpha connectivity (7-11 Hz) decreased during comprehension of competing speech, particularly around target-word presentation. Connectivity dynamics of these networks were predictive of individual differences in the speed and accuracy of target-word identification, respectively, but proved unconfounded by changes in neural oscillatory activity strength. Successful adaptation to a listening challenge thus latches onto two distinct yet complementary neural systems: a beta-tuned frontoparietal network enabling the flexible adaptation to attentive listening state and an alpha-tuned posterior network supporting attention to speech.

Significance StatementAttending to relevant information during listening is key to human communication. How does this adaptive behavior rely upon neural communications? We here follow up on the long-standing conjecture that, large-scale brain network dynamics constrain our successful adaptation to cognitive challenges. We provide evidence in support of two intrinsic, frequency-specific neural networks that underlie distinct behavioral aspects of successful listening: a beta-tuned frontoparietal network enabling the flexible adaptation to attentive listening state, and an alpha-tuned posterior cortical network supporting attention to speech. These findings shed light on how large-scale neural communication dynamics underlie attentive listening and open new opportunities for brain network-based intervention in hearing loss and its neurocognitive consequences.

Increasing evidence indicates that toxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, produced by sequential proteolytic cleavage of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), induce neuronal circuit hyperexcitability in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As a result, treatments that modulate this early excitatory/inhibitory imbalance could act as potential AD therapies. Levetiracetam, an atypical antiepileptic drug, has garnered recent interest, despite the mechanism(s) of action remaining elusive. In this study, we set out to identify the pathways and mechanisms primarily affected by levetiracetam in diseased brains of amyloid pathology. Using the App knock-in mouse models and multiplexed TMT-quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis to determine how levetiracetam affects the proteome, our findings demonstrate that levetiracetam treatment selectively normalizes levels of presynaptic endocytosis proteins and is capable of lowering Abeta42 levels by altering APP processing. These novel findings demonstrate a mechanism of action for how levetiracetam lowers Abeta42 production.

Ethanol causes the secretion of pro‐inflammatory microvesicles (MVs) from brain tissue. Ethanol‐induced MVs reproduce the pro‐inflammatory gene induction and microglial activation seen with ethanol alone, and inhibition of their secretion blocks ethanol‐induced neuroinflammation. Microglia are required for the generation of pro‐inflammatory MVs, with MV secretion involving activation of microglial PI3K.

Abstract
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) pathology features pro‐inflammatory gene induction and microglial activation. The underlying cellular processes that promote this activation remain unclear. Previously considered cellular debris, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as mediators of inflammatory signaling in several disease states. We investigated the role of microvesicles (MVs, 50 nm–100 µm diameter EVs) in pro‐inflammatory and microglial functional gene expression using primary organotypic brain slice culture (OBSC). Ethanol caused a unique immune gene signature that featured: temporal induction of pro‐inflammatory TNF‐α and IL‐1β, reduction of homeostatic microglia state gene Tmem119, progressive increases in purinergic receptor P2RY12 and the microglial inhibitory fractalkine receptor CX3CR1, an increase in the microglial presynaptic gene C1q, and a reduction in the phagocytic gene TREM2. MV signaling was implicated in this response as reduction of MV secretion by imipramine blocked pro‐inflammatory TNF‐α and IL‐1β induction by ethanol, and ethanol‐conditioned MVs (EtOH‐MVs) reproduced the ethanol‐associated immune gene signature in naïve OBSC slices. Depletion of microglia prior to ethanol treatment prevented pro‐inflammatory activity of EtOH‐MVs, as did incubation of EtOH‐MVs with the HMGB1 inhibitor glycyrrhizin. Ethanol caused HMGB1 secretion from cultured BV2 microglia in MVs through activation of PI3 kinase. In summary, these studies find MVs modulate pro‐inflammatory gene induction and microglial activation changes associated with ethanol. Thus, MVs may represent a novel therapeutic target to reduce neuroinflammation in the setting of alcohol abuse or other diseases that feature a neuroimmune component.

In a transient systemic hypoxic‐ischemic model of placental insufficiency, erythropoietin is found to have lasting, mitigating effects on the diminished cognitive flexibility and increased perseveration which are associated with encephalopathy of prematurity. Highly translatable testing, including novel object recognition and touchscreen‐based visual discrimination and reversal learning, reveal significant differences post‐treatment.

Abstract
Preterm birth is a principal cause of neurological disability later in life, including cognitive and behavioral deficits. Notably, cognitive impairment has greater impact on quality of life than physical disability. Survivors of preterm birth commonly have deficits of executive function. Difficulties with tasks and planning complexity correlate positively with increasing disability. To overcome these barriers for children born preterm, preclinical and clinical studies have emphasized the importance of neurorestoration. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a endogenous cytokine with multiple beneficial mechanisms of action following perinatal brain injury. While most preclinical investigations have focused on pathology and molecular mechanisms, translational studies of repair using clinically viable biobehavioral biomarkers are still lacking. Here, using an established model of encephalopathy of prematurity secondary to placental insufficiency, we tested the hypothesis that administration of EPO in the neonatal period would attenuate deficits in recognition memory and cognitive flexibility in adult rats of both sexes. We assessed cognition and executive function in two ways. First, using the classic test of novel object recognition and second, using a touchscreen platform. Touchscreen testing allows for rigorous testing of cognition and executive function in preclinical and clinical scenarios. Data show that adult rats exhibit deficits in recognition memory and cognitive flexibility following in utero placental insufficiency. Notably, neonatal treatment of EPO attenuates these deficits in adulthood and facilitates functional repair. Together, these data validate EPO neurorestoration using a clinically relevant outcome measure and support the concept that postnatal treatment following in utero injury can improve cognition and executive function through adulthood.

Abstract
Many studies have reported sex differences in empathy and social skills. In this review, several lines of empirical evidences about sex differences in functions and anatomy of social brain are discussed. The most relevant differences involve face processing, facial expression recognition, response to baby schema, the ability to see faces in things, the processing of social interactions, the response to the others’ pain, interest in social information, processing of gestures and actions, biological motion, erotic, and affective stimuli. Sex differences in oxytocin‐based parental response are also reported. In conclusion, the female and male brains show several neuro‐functional differences in various aspects of social cognition, and especially in emotional coding, face processing, and response to baby schema. An interpretation of this sexual dimorphism is provided in the view of evolutionary psychobiology.

d‐glucose uptake in astrocytes is an essential source for the noradrenaline‐induced increase in intracellular L‐lactate. We found that intracellular l‐lactate arises exclusively from the glycogen—a temporary energy store in the brain. The glycolytic pathway intermediates also support oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. At rest, a large proportion of d‐glucose is metabolized in the Krebs cycle, since the resting l‐lactate concentration is low. This is increased when the Krebs cycle is blocked or when cells are stimulated with noradrenaline.

Abstract
During cognitive efforts mediated by local neuronal networks, approximately 20% of additional energy is required; this is mediated by chemical messengers such as noradrenaline (NA). NA targets astroglial aerobic glycolysis, the hallmark of which is the end product l‐lactate, a fuel for neurons. Biochemical studies have revealed that astrocytes exhibit a prominent glycogen shunt, in which a portion of d‐glucose molecules entering the cytoplasm is transiently incorporated into glycogen, a buffer and source of d‐glucose during increased energy demand. Here, we studied single astrocytes by measuring cytosolic L‐lactate ([lac]i) with the FRET nanosensor Laconic. We examined whether NA‐induced increase in [lac]i is influenced by: (a) 2‐deoxy‐d‐glucose (2‐DG, 3 mM), a molecule that enters the cytosol and inhibits the glycolytic pathway; (b) 1,4‐dideoxy‐1,4‐imino‐d‐arabinitol (DAB, 300 µM), a potent inhibitor of glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen degradation; and (c) 3‐nitropropionic acid (3‐NPA, 1 mM), an inhibitor of the Krebs cycle. The results of these pharmacological experiments revealed that d‐glucose uptake is essential for the NA‐induced increase in [lac]i, and that this exclusively arises from glycogen degradation, indicating that most, if not all, d‐glucose molecules in NA‐stimulated cells transit the glycogen shunt during glycolysis. Moreover, under the defined transmembrane d‐glucose gradient, the glycolytic intermediates were not only used to produce l‐lactate, but also to significantly support oxidative phosphorylation, as demonstrated by an elevation in [lac]i when Krebs cycle was inhibited. We conclude that l‐lactate production via aerobic glycolysis is an essential energy pathway in NA‐stimulated astrocytes; however, oxidative metabolism is important at rest.

The protein α‐synuclein is central to Parkinson's disease. For the first time, we report that α‐synuclein from Parkinson's patients brain samples caused signaling deficits in brain cells, and novel drug candidates known to block the sigma‐2 receptor complex reversed these deficits.

Abstract
α‐Synuclein oligomers are thought to have a pivotal role in sporadic and familial Parkinson's disease (PD) and related α‐synucleinopathies, causing dysregulation of protein trafficking, autophagy/lysosomal function, and protein clearance, as well as synaptic function impairment underlying motor and cognitive symptoms of PD. Moreover, trans‐synaptic spread of α‐synuclein oligomers is hypothesized to mediate disease progression. Therapeutic approaches that effectively block α‐synuclein oligomer‐induced pathogenesis are urgently needed. Here, we show for the first time that α‐synuclein species isolated from human PD patient brain and recombinant α‐synuclein oligomers caused similar deficits in lipid vesicle trafficking rates in cultured rat neurons and glia, while α‐synuclein species isolated from non‐PD human control brain samples did not. Recombinant α‐synuclein oligomers also increased neuronal expression of lysosomal‐associated membrane protein‐2A (LAMP‐2A), the lysosomal receptor that has a critical role in chaperone‐mediated autophagy. Unbiased screening of several small molecule libraries (including the NIH Clinical Collection) identified sigma‐2 receptor antagonists as the most effective at blocking α‐synuclein oligomer‐induced trafficking deficits and LAMP‐2A upregulation in a dose‐dependent manner. These results indicate that antagonists of the sigma‐2 receptor complex may alleviate α‐synuclein oligomer‐induced neurotoxicity and are a novel therapeutic approach for disease modification in PD and related α‐synucleinopathies.

Oxidative stress implicates mitochondrial damage and effects on mitochondrial function, production of ATP, mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis. The mitochondrial dysfunction eventually demonstrates its lethal behaviour on Aβ clearance and mitochondrial fission, especially on the protein Drp1. In AD pathogenesis, Drp1 can play an important regulatory role in mitophagy and autophagy. The miR‐499 causes suppression of calcineurin‐mediated dephosphorylation of Drp1, whereas miR‐30a inhibits mitochondrial fission by suppressing p53 and subsequent Drp‐1 downstream signaling. Mitochondrial targeted antioxidant (MTA) molecules such as Mdivi1, SS31 and Dynasore can reduce excessive mitochondrial fission activity of Drp1 and restore normal mitochondrial functions, fusion‐fission activities, mitophagy and autophagy functions in clearing dead mitochondria for normal synaptic functions.

Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and progressive neurodegenerative disease. The presence of β‐amyloid (Aβ) plaques and phosphorylated Tau tangles are considered to be the two main hallmarks of AD. Recent findings have shown that different changes in the structure and dynamics of mitochondria play an important role in AD pathology progression. Mitochondrial changes in AD are expressed as enhanced mitochondrial fragmentation, altered mitochondrial dynamics, and changes in the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis genes in vitro and in vivo models. Therefore, targeting mitochondria and associated mitochondrial proteins seems to be a promising alternative instead of targeting Aβ and Tau in the prevention of Alzheimer's disease. The dynamin‐related protein (Drp1) is one such protein that plays an important role in the regulation of mitochondrial division and maintenance of mitochondrial structures. Few researchers have shown that inhibition of Drp1 GTPase activity in neuronal cells rescues excessive mitochondrial fragmentation. In addition, the growing evidence revealed that Drp1 can interact with both Aβ and Tau protein in human brain tissues and mouse models. In this review, we would like to update existing knowledge about various changes in and around mitochondria related to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, with particular emphasis on mitophagy and autophagy.

Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells cannot extend cellular process in the presence of Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans. Treatment of OPCs with different neurotrophic factors (BDNF, GDNF, and NT‐3) allows OPCs to overcome the inhibitory effects of CSPGs, allowing for OPC process outgrowth which is a critical step in the differentiation of OPCs.

Abstract
Axonal damage and the subsequent interruption of intact neuronal pathways in the spinal cord are largely responsible for the loss of motor function after injury. Further exacerbating this loss is the demyelination of neighboring uninjured axons. The post‐injury environment is hostile to repair, with inflammation, a high expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) around the glial scar, and myelin breakdown. Numerous studies have demonstrated that treatment with the enzyme chondroitinase ABC (cABC) creates a permissive environment around a spinal lesion that permits axonal regeneration. Neurotrophic factors like brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), neurotrophic factor‐3 (NT‐3), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) have been used to promote neuronal survival and stimulate axonal growth. CSPGs expressed near a lesion also inhibit migration and differentiation of endogenous oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in the spinal cord, and cABC treatment can neutralize this inhibition. This study examined the neurotrophins commonly used to stimulate axonal regeneration after injury and their potential effects on OPCs cultured in the presence of CSPGs. The results reveal differential effects on OPCs, with BDNF and GDNF promoting process outgrowth and NT‐3 stimulating differentiation of OPCs, while CNTF appears to have no observable effect. This finding suggests that certain neurotrophic agents commonly utilized to stimulate axonal regeneration after a spinal injury may also have a beneficial effect on the endogenous oligodendroglial cells as well.

This PET study characterized D2 receptor (D2R) availability within extra‐striatal regions in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with (+) and without (−) REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). With disease progression, only PD‐RBD+ patients showed steep decline in D2R availability within the left uncus parahippocampus. Beyond the striatum, extra‐striatal dopaminergic system may also contribute to PD‐RBD in advanced stages.

Abstract
Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a common condition found in more than 50% of the patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Molecular imaging shows that PD with RBD (PD‐RBD+) have lower striatal dopamine transporter activity within the caudate and putamen relative to PD without RBD (PD‐RBD−). However, the characterization of the extra‐striatal dopamine within the mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways remains unknown. We aim to elucidate this with PET imaging in 15 PD‐RBD+ and 15 PD‐RBD− patients, while having 15 age‐matched healthy controls (HC). Each participant underwent a single PET scan with [11C]FLB‐457 to detect the D2 receptor availability within the extra‐striatal regions of interest (ROI), including the prefrontal, temporal, and limbic areas. [11C]FLB‐457 retention was expressed as the nondisplaceable binding potential. Our results reveal that relative to HC, PD‐RBD+ and PD‐RBD− patients have lower levels of D2 receptor availability within the uncus parahippocampus, superior, lateral, and inferior temporal cortex. PD‐RBD+ showed steep decline in D2 receptors within the left uncus parahippocampus with increasing disease severity, but this was not observed for PD‐RBD− patients. Findings imply that extra‐striatal dopaminergic system may play a role in contributing to symptomatic progress in PD patients with RBD. However, validation with more advanced PD patients are needed.

By observing the behavior of mice in their home cage environment, using the powerful PhenoTyper tracking system, we demonstrate that mice display dramatic reductions in movement and exploration when isolated from their cage mates, an instantaneous effect that escalates over the next 5 days, which is reversible upon re‐pairing.

Abstract
The effects of social isolation on an individual's behavior is an important field of research, especially as public health officials encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of pandemic disease. In this study we evaluate the effects of social isolation on physical activity in mice. Utilizing a pixel‐based tracking system, we continuously monitored the movement of isolated mice compared with paired cage mates in the home cage environment. We demonstrate that mice that are socially isolated dramatically decrease their movement when separated from their cage mate, and especially in the dark cycle, when mice are normally most active. When isolated mice are re‐paired with their original cage mate, this effect is reversed, and mice return to their prior levels of activity. These findings suggest a close link between social isolation and physical activity, and are of particular interest in the wake of coronavirus disease 2019, when many are forced into isolation. Social isolation may affect an individual's overall activity levels in humans too, which may have unintended effects on health that deserve further consideration.

Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has recently gained attention as an alternative treatment of malignant gliomas. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent within tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). Conventional treatments for this CNS tumor include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Surgery is still being considered as the treatment of choice. Even so, the poor prognosis and/or recurrence of the disease after applying any of these treatments highlight the urgency of exploring new therapies and/or improving existing ones to achieve the definitive eradication of tumor masses and remaining cells. PDT is a therapeutic modality that involves the destruction of tumor cells by reactive oxygen species induced by light, which were previously treated with a photosensitizing agent. However, in recent years, its experimental application has expanded to other effects that could improve overall performance against GBM. In the current review, we revisit the main advances of PDT for GBM management and also, the recent mechanistic insights about cellular and molecular aspects related to tumoral resistance to PDT of GBM.

Genetic ablation of G protein‐coupled receptor 37‐like 1 results in increased patched 1 expression and internalization. This leads to the intracellular accumulation of cholesterol, with concomitant stimulation of sonic hedgehog (Shh) production and activation of Shh‐induced proliferative signaling.

Abstract
Mammalian cerebellar astrocytes critically regulate the differentiation and maturation of neuronal Purkinje cells and granule precursors. The G protein‐coupled receptor 37‐like 1 (Gpr37l1) is expressed by Bergmann astrocytes and interacts with patched 1 (Ptch1) at peri‐ciliary membranes. Cerebellar primary astrocyte cultures from wild‐type and Gpr37l1 null mutant mouse pups were established and studied. Primary cilia were produced by cultures of both genotypes, as well as Ptch1 and smoothened (Smo) components of the sonic hedgehog (Shh) mitogenic pathway. Compared to wild‐type cells, Gpr37l1−/− astrocytes displayed striking increases in proliferative activity, Ptch1 protein expression and internalization, intracellular cholesterol content, ciliary localization of Smo, as well as a marked production of active Shh. Similar effects were reproduced by treating wild‐type astrocytes with a putative prosaptide ligand of Gpr37l1. These findings indicate that Gpr37l1–Ptch1 interactions specifically regulate Ptch1 internalization and trafficking, with consequent stimulation of Shh production and activation of proliferative signaling.

Abstract
The mammalian nervous system is a complex network of interconnected cells. We review emerging techniques that use the axonal transport of adeno‐associated virus (AAV) vectors to dissect neural circuits. These intersectional approaches specifically target AAV‐mediated gene expression to discrete neuron populations based on their axonal connectivity, including: (a) neurons with one defined output, (b) neurons with one defined input, (c) neurons with one defined input and one defined output, and (d) neurons with two defined inputs or outputs. The number of labeled neurons can be directly controlled to trace axonal projections and examine cellular morphology. These approaches can precisely target the expression of fluorescent reporters, optogenetic ion channels, chemogenetic receptors, disease‐associated proteins, and other factors to defined neural circuits in mammals ranging from mice to macaques, and thereby provide a powerful new means to understand the structure and function of the nervous system.

In similarly aged individuals, traumatic brain injury (TBI) induced more profound sleep alterations than Alzheimer's disease (AD), with incongruous inflammation. Altered sleep may be associated with deleterious pathological processes and unique pathological sleep pathways may exist in older individuals that incur TBI compared with similarly aged individuals that have AD.

Abstract
Elderly populations (≥65 years old) have the highest risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and/or obtaining a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Using translational mouse models, we investigated sleep disturbances and inflammation associated with normal aging, TBI and aging, and AD. We hypothesized that aging results in marked changes in sleep compared with adult mice, and that TBI and aging would result in sleep and inflammation levels similar to AD mice. We used female 16‐month‐old wild‐type (WT Aged) and 3xTg‐AD mice, as well as a 2‐month‐old reference group (WT Adult), to evaluate sleep changes. WT Aged mice received diffuse TBI by midline fluid percussion, and blood was collected from both WT Aged (pre‐ and post‐TBI) and 3xTg‐AD mice to evaluate inflammation. Cognitive behavior was tested, and tissue was collected for histology. Bayesian generalized additive and mixed‐effects models were used for analyses. Both normal aging and AD led to increases in sleep compared with adult mice. WT Aged mice with TBI slept substantially more, with fragmented shorter bouts, than they did pre‐TBI and compared with AD mice. However, differences between WT Aged and 3xTg‐AD mice in immune cell populations and plasma cytokine levels were incongruous, cognitive deficits were similar, and cumulative sleep was not predictive of inflammation or behavior for either group. Our results suggest that in similarly aged individuals, TBI immediately induces more profound sleep alterations than in AD, although both diseases likely include cognitive impairments. Unique pathological sleep pathways may exist in elderly individuals who incur TBI compared with similarly aged individuals who have AD, which may warrant disease‐specific treatments in clinical settings.

The brain activity of the four brain regions during visuo‐guided grip force tracking tasks were detected by functional near‐infrared spectroscopy. Pearson's correlation method, partial correlation method, and a pairwise maximum entropy model were used to get a more comprehensive and accurate functional connectivity for precise grip force control.

Abstract
The functional connectivity (FC) between multiple brain regions during tasks is currently gradually being explored with functional near‐infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). However, the FC present during grip force tracking tasks performed under visual feedback remains unclear. In the present study, we used fNIRS to measure brain activity during resting states and grip force tracking tasks at 25%, 50%, and 75% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) in 11 healthy subjects, and the activity was measured from four target brain regions: the left prefrontal cortex (lPFC), right prefrontal cortex (rPFC), left sensorimotor cortex (lSMC), and right sensorimotor cortex (rSMC). We determined the FC between these regions utilizing three different methods: Pearson's correlation method, partial correlation method, and a pairwise maximum entropy model (MEM). The results showed that the FC of lSMC‐rSMC and lPFC‐rPFC (interhemispheric homologous pairs) were significantly stronger than those of other brain region pairs. Moreover, FC of lPFC‐rPFC was strengthened during the 75% MVC task compared to the other task states and the resting states. The FC of lSMC‐lPFC and rSMC‐rPFC (intrahemispheric region pairs) strengthened with a higher task load. The results provided new insights into the FC between brain regions during visuo‐guided grip force tracking tasks.

Glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factor derived from glioma cells upregulate matrix metallopeptidase 9 and 14 expression on microglia, which in turn promote glioma progression. 

Abstract
Glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is released by glioma cells and promotes tumor growth. We have previously found that GDNF released from the tumor cells is a chemoattractant for microglial cells, the immune cells of the central nervous system. Here we show that GDNF increases matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 and MMP14 expression in cultured microglial cells from mixed sexes of neonatal mice. The GDNF‐induced microglial MMP9 and MMP14 upregulation is mediated by GDNF family receptor alpha 1 receptors and dependent on p38 mitogen‐activated protein kinase signaling. In organotypic brain slices, GDNF promotes the growth of glioma and this effect depends on the presence of microglia. We also previously found that MMP9 and MMP14 upregulation can be mediated by Toll‐like receptor (TLR) 2 signaling and here we demonstrate that GDNF increases the expression of TLR1 and TLR2. In conclusion, GDNF promotes the pro‐tumorigenic phenotype of microglia.

The potential approaches to treating neonatal H‐I injury are as follows: 1. Inhibiting M1 microglia to secrete pro‐inflammatory cytokines or to promote microglia M2 polarization. 2. Targeting OPCs and oligodendrocytes and promoting their differentiation and maturation to maintain axonal integrity and conductivity and restoring axonal functions through remyelination.

Abstract
Neonatal hypoxic–ischemic (H‐I) injury, which mainly causes neuronal damage and white matter injury (WMI), is among the predominant causes of infant morbidity (cerebral palsy, cognitive and persistent motor disabilities) and mortality. Disruptions to the oxygen and blood supply in the perinatal brain affect the cerebral microenvironment and may affect microglial activation, excitotoxicity, and oxidative stress. Microglia are significantly associated with axonal damage and myelinating oligodendrocytes, which are major pathological components of WMI. However, the effects of H‐I injury on microglial functions and underlying transformation mechanisms remain poorly understood. The historical perception that these cells are major risk factors for ischemic stroke has been questioned due to our improved understanding of the diversity of microglial phenotypes and their alterable functions, which exacerbate or attenuate injuries in different regions in response to environmental instability. Unfortunately, although therapeutic hypothermia is an efficient treatment, death and disability remain the prognosis for a large proportion of neonates with H‐I injury. Hence, novel neuroprotective therapies to treat WMI following H‐I injury are urgently needed. Here, we review microglial mechanisms that might occur in the developing brain due to neonatal H‐I injury and discuss whether microglia function as a double‐edged sword in WMI. Then, we emphasize microglial heterogeneity, notably at the single‐cell level, and sex‐specific effects on the etiology of neurological diseases. Finally, we discuss current knowledge of strategies aiming to improve microglia modulation and remyelination following neonatal H‐I injury. Overall, microglia‐targeted therapy might provide novel and valuable insights into the treatment of neonatal H‐I insult.

At the peak of the critical period, immersion into complete darkness for 10 days significantly reduces the number of perineuronal nets (PNN) in the primary visual cortex of cats but does not alter the number of parvalbumin (PV) cells that they usually surround. Darkness also reduces the size of PV cells even if they are surrounded by a PNN, indicating that PNNs do not inhibit all forms of neural plasticity.







Abstract
During development, the visual system maintains a high capacity for modification by expressing characteristics permissive for plasticity, enabling neural circuits to be refined by visual experience to achieve their mature form. This period is followed by the emergence of characteristics that stabilize the brain to consolidate for lifetime connections that were informed by experience. Attenuation of plasticity potential is thought to derive from an accumulation of plasticity‐inhibiting characteristics that appear at ages beyond the peak of plasticity. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are molecular aggregations that primarily surround fast‐spiking inhibitory neurons called parvalbumin (PV) cells, which exhibit properties congruent with a plasticity inhibitor. In this study, we examined the development of PNNs and PV cells in the primary visual cortex of a highly visual mammal, and assessed the impact that 10 days of darkness had on both characteristics. Here, we show that labeling for PV expression emerges earlier and reaches adult levels sooner than PNNs. We also demonstrate that darkness, a condition known to enhance plasticity, significantly reduces the density of PNNs and the size of PV cell somata but does not alter the number of PV cells in the visual cortex. The darkness‐induced reduction of PV cell size occurred irrespective of whether neurons were surrounded by a PNN, suggesting that PNNs have a restricted capacity to inhibit plasticity. Finally, we show that PV cells surrounded by a PNN were significantly larger than those without one, supporting the view that PNNs may mediate trophic support to the cells they surround.

Abstract
Mnemonic similarity task performance, in which a known target stimulus must be distinguished from similar lures, is supported by the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex. Impairments on this task are known to manifest with advancing age. Interestingly, disrupting hippocampal activity leads to mnemonic discrimination impairments when lures are novel, but not when they are familiar. This observation suggests that other brain structures support discrimination abilities as stimuli are learned. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for retrieval of remote events and executive functions, such as working memory, and is also particularly vulnerable to dysfunction in aging. Importantly, the medial PFC is reciprocally connected to the perirhinal cortex and neuron firing in this region coordinates communication between lateral entorhinal and perirhinal cortices to presumably modulate hippocampal activity. This anatomical organization and function of the medial PFC suggests that it contributes to mnemonic discrimination; however, this notion has not been empirically tested. In the current study, rats were trained on a LEGO object‐based mnemonic similarity task adapted for rodents, and surgically implanted with guide cannulae targeting prelimbic and infralimbic regions of the medial PFC. Prior to mnemonic discrimination tests, rats received PFC infusions of the GABAA agonist muscimol. Analyses of expression of the neuronal activity‐dependent immediate‐early gene Arc in medial PFC and adjacent cortical regions confirmed muscimol infusions led to neuronal inactivation in the infralimbic and prelimbic cortices. Moreover, muscimol infusions in PFC impaired mnemonic discrimination performance relative to the vehicle control across all testing blocks when lures shared 50–90% feature overlap with the target. Thus, in contrast hippocampal infusions, PFC inactivation impaired target‐lure discrimination regardless of the novelty or familiarity of the lures. These findings indicate the PFC plays a critical role in mnemonic similarity task performance, but the time course of PFC involvement is dissociable from that of the hippocampus.

Higher resilience associates with lower pain severity and pain disability in those with chronic pain. Additionally, relationships between resilience and pain‐related brain structure were indicated in the right amygdala, bilateral thalamus, and postcentral gyrus which differed by sex and ethnicity/race. Considering sociodemographic factors in pain and resilience investigations are important.

Abstract
Chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain is disabling to individuals and burdensome to society. A relationship between telomere length and resilience was reported in individuals with consideration for chronic pain intensity. While chronic pain associates with brain changes, little is known regarding the neurobiological interface of resilience. In a group of individuals with chronic MSK pain, we examined the relationships between a previously investigated resilience index, clinical pain and functioning measures, and pain‐related brain structures, with consideration for sex and ethnicity/race. A cross‐sectional analysis of 166 non‐Hispanic Black and non‐Hispanic White adults, 45–85 years of age with pain ≥ 1 body site (s) over the past 3 months was completed. Measures of clinical pain and functioning, biobehavioral and psychosocial resilience, and structural MRI were completed. Our findings indicate higher levels of resilience associate with lower levels of clinical pain and functional limitations. Significant associations between resilience, ethnicity/race, and/or sex, and pain‐related brain gray matter structure were demonstrated in the right amygdaloid complex, bilateral thalamus, and postcentral gyrus. Our findings provide compelling evidence that in order to decipher the neurobiological code of chronic pain and related protective factors, it will be important to improve how chronic pain is phenotyped; to include an equal representation of females in studies including analyses stratifying by sex, and to consider other sociodemographic factors.

After a single, binge‐level exposure to ethanol in development, we found subtle effects on glia in the mouse somatosensory cortex and hippocampus. Ethanol treatment reduced colocalization between two astrocytic markers, GFAP and Aldh1L1; induced region‐specific changes in microglia volume, process morphology, and density; and had no effect on glial interactions.

Abstract
Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the most common cause of nonheritable, preventable mental disability and are characterized by cognitive, behavioral, and physical impairments. FASD occurs in almost 5% of births in the United States, but despite this prevalence there is no known cure, largely because the biological mechanisms that translate alcohol exposure to neuropathology are not well understood. While the effects of early ethanol exposure on neuronal survival and circuitry have received more attention, glia, the cells most closely tied to initiating and propagating inflammatory events, could be an important target for alcohol in the developing brain. Inflammation is known to alter developmental trajectories, but it has recently been shown that even small changes in both astrocytes and microglia in the absence of full‐blown inflammatory signaling can alter brain function long‐term. Here, we studied the acute response of astrocytes and microglia to a single exposure to ethanol in development across sexes in a mouse model of human third trimester exposure, in order to understand how these cells may transition from their normal developmental path to a different program that leads to FASD neuropathology. We found that although a single ethanol exposure delivered subcutaneously on postnatal day 4 did not cause large changes in microglial morphology or the expression of AldH1L1 and GFAP in the cortex and hippocampus, subtle effects were observed. These findings suggest that even a single, early ethanol exposure can induce mild acute alterations in glia that could contribute to developmental deficits.

<p>by Sitong Wang, Ting Ye, Guansheng Li, Xuejiao Zhang, Huixin Shi</p>

In tumor metastasis, the margination and adhesion of tumor cells are two critical and closely related steps, which may determine the destination where the tumor cells extravasate to. We performed a direct three-dimensional simulation on the behaviors of the tumor cells in a real microvascular network, by a hybrid method of the smoothed dissipative particle dynamics and immersed boundary method (SDPD-IBM). The tumor cells are found to adhere at the microvascular bifurcations more frequently, and there is a positive correlation between the adhesion of the tumor cells and the wall-directed force from the surrounding red blood cells (RBCs). The larger the wall-directed force is, the closer the tumor cells are marginated towards the wall, and the higher the probability of adhesion behavior happen is. A relatively low or high hematocrit can help to prevent the adhesion of tumor cells, and similarly, increasing the shear rate of blood flow can serve the same purpose. These results suggest that the tumor cells may be more likely to extravasate at the microvascular bifurcations if the blood flow is slow and the hematocrit is moderate.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RfqpCSMZzc0" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/CISghShPWNE/article">An antigenic diversification threshold for falciparum malaria transmission at high endemicity</a></h4>

<p>by Qixin He, Mercedes Pascual</p>

In malaria and several other important infectious diseases, high prevalence occurs concomitantly with incomplete immunity. This apparent paradox poses major challenges to malaria elimination in highly endemic regions, where asymptomatic <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> infections are present across all age classes creating a large reservoir that maintains transmission. This reservoir is in turn enabled by extreme antigenic diversity of the parasite and turnover of new variants. We present here the concept of a threshold in local pathogen diversification that defines a sharp transition in transmission intensity below which new antigen-encoding genes generated by either recombination or migration cannot establish. Transmission still occurs below this threshold, but diversity of these genes can neither accumulate nor recover from interventions that further reduce it. An analytical expectation for this threshold is derived and compared to numerical results from a stochastic individual-based model of malaria transmission that incorporates the major antigen-encoding multigene family known as <i>var</i>. This threshold corresponds to an “innovation” number we call <i>R</i><sub>div</sub>; it is different from, and complementary to, the one defined by the classic basic reproductive number of infectious diseases, <i>R</i><sub>0</sub>, which does not easily apply under large and dynamic strain diversity. This new threshold concept can be exploited for effective malaria control and applied more broadly to other pathogens with large multilocus antigenic diversity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CISghShPWNE" width="1" />

Rare variants are thought to play an important role in the etiology of complex diseases and may explain a significant fraction of the missing heritability in genetic disease studies. Next-generation sequencing facilitates the association of rare variants in coding or regulatory regions with complex diseases in large cohorts at genome-wide scale. However, rare variant association studies (RVAS) still lack power when cohorts are small to medium-sized and if genetic variation explains a small fraction of phenotypic variance. Here we present a novel Bayesian rare variant Association Test using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (BATI). Unlike existing RVAS tests, BATI allows integration of individual or variant-specific features as covariates, while efficiently performing inference based on full model estimation. We demonstrate that BATI outperforms established RVAS methods on realistic, semi-synthetic whole-exome sequencing cohorts, especially when using meaningful biological context, such as functional annotation. We show that BATI achieves power above 70% in scenarios in which competing tests fail to identify risk genes, e.g. when risk variants in sum explain less than 0.5% of phenotypic variance. We have integrated BATI, together with five existing RVAS tests in the ‘Rare Variant Genome Wide Association Study’ (rvGWAS) framework for data analyzed by whole-exome or whole genome sequencing. rvGWAS supports rare variant association for genes or any other biological unit such as promoters, while allowing the analysis of essential functionalities like quality control or filtering. Applying rvGWAS to a Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia study we identified eight candidate predisposition genes, including EHMT2 and COPS7A.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GEjVniKkgcY" width="1" />

<p>by Katharine Z. Coyte, Chitong Rao, Seth Rakoff-Nahoum, Kevin R. Foster</p>

Humans and many other hosts establish a diverse community of beneficial microbes anew each generation. The order and identity of incoming symbionts is critical for health, but what determines the success of the assembly process remains poorly understood. Here we develop ecological theory to identify factors important for microbial community assembly. Our method maps out all feasible pathways for the assembly of a given microbiome—with analogies to the mutational maps underlying fitness landscapes in evolutionary biology. Building these “assembly maps” reveals a tradeoff at the heart of the assembly process. Ecological dependencies between members of the microbiota make assembly predictable—and can provide metabolic benefits to the host—but these dependencies may also create barriers to assembly. This effect occurs because interdependent species can fail to establish when each relies on the other to colonize first. We support our predictions with published data from the assembly of the preterm infant microbiota, where we find that ecological dependence is associated with a predictable order of arrival. Our models also suggest that hosts can overcome barriers to assembly via mechanisms that either promote the uptake of multiple symbiont species in one step or feed early colonizers. This predicted importance of host feeding is supported by published data on the impacts of breast milk in the assembly of the human microbiome. We conclude that both microbe–microbe and host–microbe interactions are important for the trajectory of microbiome assembly.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/TQx1RXt8PXU" width="1" />

Schematic drawing of the olfactory system. Olfactory mucosa contains olfactory receptor neurons (yellow), extending from the olfactory epithelia to the olfactory bulb (OB). Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) ensheath axons of olfactory receptor neurons until they reach glomeruli. Two subtypes of OECs residing within olfactory mucosa (OM) and OB and named accordingly as OM‐OECs (purple) and OB‐OECs (blue), respectively. Two subtypes of OECs with their secretions, affecting neuronal repair on spinal cord injuries (SCI) differently. OM‐OECs secrete molecules related to extracellular matrix remodeling such as laminin, fibronectin, matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), and transforming growth factor‐β3 (TGF‐β3). Meanwhile, OB‐OECs secrete molecules promoting neuronal proliferation and axonal growth such as NGF, GDNF, BDNF neuregulin, and other neurotrophins

Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is generally the consequence of physical damage, which may result in devastating consequences such as paraplegia or paralysis. Some certain candidates for SCI repair are olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), which are unique glial cells located in the transition region of the peripheral nervous system and central nervous system and perform neuron regeneration in the olfactory system throughout life. Culture studies have clarified many properties of OECs, but their mechanisms of actions are not fully understood. Successful results achieved in animal models showcased that SCI treatment with OEC transplants is suitable for clinical trials. However, clinical trials are limited by difficulties like cell acquisition for autograft transplantation. Despite the improvements in both animal and clinical studies so far, there is still insufficient information about the mechanism of actions, adverse effects, proper application methods, effective subtypes, and sources of cells. This review summarizes pre‐clinical and clinical literature focused on the cellular characterization of both OECs in vitro and post‐transplantation. We highlight the roles and effects of OECs on (a) the injury‐induced glial milieu, (b) neuronal growth/regeneration, and (c) functional recovery after injury. Due to the shown benefits of OECs with in vitro and animal studies and a limited number of clinical trials, where safety and effectivity were shown, it is necessary to conduct more studies on OECs to obtain effective and feasible treatment methods.

Abstract
Astrocytes are closely associated with the regulation of synapse formation and function. In addition, astrocytes have been shown to block certain brain impairments, including synaptic damage from stroke and other diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Although astrocytes do not completely prevent synaptic damage, they appear to be protective and to restore synaptic function following damage. The purpose of this study is to discuss the role of astrocytes in synaptogenesis and synaptic damage in ischemic stroke. I detail the mechanism of action of the multiple factors secreted by astrocytes that are involved in synapse formation. In particular, I describe the characteristics and role in synapse formation of each secreted molecule related to synaptic structure and function. Furthermore, I discuss the effect of astrocytes on synaptogenesis and repair in ischemic stroke and in other CNS diseases. Astrocytes release molecules such as thrombospondin, hevin, secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine, etc., due to activation by ischemia to induce synaptic structure and function, an effect associated with protection of the brain from synaptic damage in ischemic stroke. In conclusion, I show that astrocytes may regulate synaptic transmission while having the potential to block and repair synaptic dysfunction in stroke‐associated brain damage.

Objective
Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is an unpredictable and devastating comorbidity of epilepsy that is believed to be due to cardiorespiratory failure immediately after generalized convulsive seizures.


Methods
We performed cardiorespiratory monitoring of seizure‐induced death in mice carrying either an p.Arg1872Trp or p.Asn1768Asp mutation in a single Scn8a allele – mutations identified from patients that died from SUDEP – and by seizure‐induced death of pentylenetetrazole‐treated wild type mice.


Results
The primary cause of seizure‐induced death for all mice was apnea, as 1) apnea began during a seizure and continued for tens of minutes until terminal asystole, and 2) death was prevented by mechanical ventilation. Fatal seizures always included a tonic phase that was coincident with apnea. This tonic phase apnea was not sufficient to produce death, as it also occurred during many nonfatal seizures; however, all seizures that were fatal had tonic phase apnea. We also made the novel observation that continuous tonic diaphragm contraction occurred during tonic phase apnea, which likely contributes to apnea by preventing exhalation, and this was only fatal when breathing did not resume after the tonic phase ended. Finally, recorded seizures from a patient with developmental epileptic encephalopathy with a previously undocumented SCN8A likely pathogenic variant (p,Leu257Val) revealed similarities to those of the mice; an extended tonic phase that was accompanied by apnea.


Interpretation
We conclude that apnea coincident with the tonic phase of a seizure, and subsequent failure to resume breathing, are the determining events that cause seizure‐induced death in Scn8a mutant mice.

<p>Auxiliary α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels modulate channel trafficking, current properties, and synapse formation. Three of the four isoforms (α<sub>2</sub>δ-1, α<sub>2</sub>δ-2, and α<sub>2</sub>δ-3) are abundantly expressed in the brain; however, of the available knockout models, only α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 knockout or mutant mice display an obvious abnormal neurological phenotype. Thus, we hypothesize that the neuronal α<sub>2</sub>δ isoforms may have partially specific as well as redundant functions. To address this, we generated three distinct α<sub>2</sub>δ double knockout mouse models by crossbreeding single knockout (α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 and -3) or mutant (α<sub>2</sub>δ-2/ducky) mice. Here, we provide a first phenotypic description and brain structure analysis. We found that genotypic distribution of neonatal litters in distinct α<sub>2</sub>δ-1/-2, α<sub>2</sub>δ-1/-3, and α<sub>2</sub>δ-2/-3 breeding combinations did not conform to Mendel’s law, suggesting premature lethality of single and double knockout mice. Notably, high occurrences of infant mortality correlated with the absence of specific α<sub>2</sub>δ isoforms (α<sub>2</sub>Δ-2 &gt; α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 &gt; α<sub>2</sub>δ-3), and was particularly observed in cages with behaviorally abnormal parenting animals of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2/-3 cross-breedings. Juvenile α<sub>2</sub>δ-1/-2 and α<sub>2</sub>δ-2/-3 double knockout mice displayed a waddling gate similar to ducky mice. However, in contrast to ducky and α<sub>2</sub>δ-1/-3 double knockout animals, α<sub>2</sub>δ-1/-2 and α<sub>2</sub>δ-2/-3 double knockout mice showed a more severe disease progression and highly impaired development. The observed phenotypes within the individual mouse lines may be linked to differences in the volume of specific brain regions. Reduced cortical volume in ducky mice, for example, was associated with a progressively decreased space between neurons, suggesting a reduction of total synaptic connections. Taken together, our findings show that α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits differentially regulate premature survival, postnatal growth, brain development, and behavior, suggesting specific neuronal functions in health and disease.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.644951">Dosimetry Analysis in Non-brain Tissues During TMS Exposure of Broca’s and M1 Areas</a></h4>

<p>For human protection, the internal electric field is used as a dosimetric quantity for electromagnetic fields lower than 5–10 MHz. According to international standards, in this frequency range, electrostimulation is the main adverse effect against which protection is needed. One of the topics to be investigated is the quantification of the internal electric field threshold levels of perception and pain. Pain has been reported as a side effect during transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), especially during stimulation of the Broca’s (speech) area of the brain. In this study, we designed an experiment to conduct a dosimetry analysis to quantify the internal electric field corresponding to perception and pain thresholds when targeting the Broca’s and M1 areas from magnetic stimulator exposure. Dosimetry analysis was conducted using a multi-scale analysis in an individualized head model to investigate electrostimulation in an axonal model. The main finding is that the stimulation on the primary motor cortex has higher perception and pain thresholds when compared to Broca’s area. Also, TMS-induced electric field applied to Broca’s area exhibited dependence on the coil orientation at lower electric field threshold which was found to be related to the location and thickness of pain fibers. The derived dosimetry quantities provide a scientific rationale for the development of human protection guidelines and the estimation of possible side effects of magnetic stimulation in clinical applications.</p>

Background<p>The frequently discovered incidental findings (IFs) from imaging observations are increasing. The IFs show the potential clues of structural abnormalities underlying cognitive decline in elders. Detecting brain IFs and their relationship with cognitive and behavioral functions helps provide the information for clinical strategies.</p>Methods<p>Five hundred and seventy-nine participants were recruited in the Shanghai Changfeng Study. All participants performed the demographic, biochemical, and cognitive functions and gait speed assessment and underwent the high-resolution multimodal magnetic resonance imaging scans. We calculated the detection rate of brain IFs. The association between cardiovascular risk factors and IFs and the associations between IFs and cognitive and motor functions were assessed using regression models. The relationships among gray matter volume, cognitive function, and gait speed were assessed with/without adjusting the IFs to evaluate the effects of potential IFs confounders.</p>Results<p>IFs were found in a total of 578 subjects with a detection rate of 99.8%. Age and blood pressure were the most significant cardiovascular risk factors correlated with IFs. IFs were found to be negatively associated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Mini-Mental State Examination, and gait speed. The gray matter volume was found to be positively correlated with the cognitive function without adjusting the white matter hyperintensity but not if adjusted.</p>Conclusion<p>IFs are commonly found in the elderly population and related to brain functions. The adequate intervention of IFs related cardiovascular risk factors that may slow down the progression of brain function decline. We also suggest that IFs should be considered as confounding factors that may affect cognitive issues on the structural neuroimaging researches in aging or diseases.</p>

<p>A common task in brain image analysis includes diagnosis of a certain medical condition wherein groups of healthy controls and diseased subjects are analyzed and compared. On the other hand, for two groups of healthy participants with different proficiency in a certain skill, a distinctive analysis of the brain function remains a challenging problem. In this study, we develop new computational tools to explore the functional and anatomical differences that could exist between the brain of healthy individuals identified on the basis of different levels of task experience/proficiency. Toward this end, we look at a dataset of amateur and professional chess players, where we utilize resting-state functional magnetic resonance images to generate functional connectivity (FC) information. In addition, we utilize T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to estimate morphometric connectivity (MC) information. We combine functional and anatomical features into a new connectivity matrix, which we term as the functional morphometric similarity connectome (FMSC). Since, both the FC and MC information is susceptible to redundancy, the size of this information is reduced using statistical feature selection. We employ off-the-shelf machine learning classifier, support vector machine, for both single- and multi-modality classifications. From our experiments, we establish that the saliency and ventral attention network of the brain is functionally and anatomically different between two groups of healthy subjects (chess players). We argue that, since chess involves many aspects of higher order cognition such as systematic thinking and spatial reasoning and the identified network is task-positive to cognition tasks requiring a response, our results are valid and supporting the feasibility of the proposed computational pipeline. Moreover, we quantitatively validate an existing neuroscience hypothesis that learning a certain skill could cause a change in the brain (functional connectivity and anatomy) and this can be tested via our novel FMSC algorithm.</p>

<p>An efficient method to identify whether mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has progressed to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) will be beneficial to patient care. Previous studies have shown that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has enabled the assessment of AD progression based on imaging findings. The present work aimed to establish an algorithm based on three features, namely, volume, surface area, and surface curvature within the hippocampal subfields, to model variations, including atrophy and structural changes to the cortical surface. In this study, a new biomarker, the ratio of principal curvatures (RPC), was proposed to characterize the folding patterns of the cortical gyrus and sulcus. Along with volumes and surface areas, these morphological features associated with the hippocampal subfields were assessed in terms of their sensitivity to the changes in cognitive capacity by two different feature selection methods. Either the extracted features were statistically significantly different, or the features were selected through a random forest model. The identified subfields and their structural indices that are sensitive to the changes characteristic of the progression from MCI to AD were further assessed with a multilayer perceptron classifier to help facilitate the diagnosis. The accuracy of the classification based on the proposed method to distinguish whether a MCI patient enters the AD stage amounted to 79.95%, solely using the information from the features selected by a logical feature selection method.</p>

<p>Many articles have used voice analysis to detect Parkinson's disease (PD), but few have focused on the early stages of the disease and the gender effect. In this article, we have adapted the latest speaker recognition system, called x-vectors, in order to detect PD at an early stage using voice analysis. X-vectors are embeddings extracted from Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which provide robust speaker representations and improve speaker recognition when large amounts of training data are used. Our goal was to assess whether, in the context of early PD detection, this technique would outperform the more standard classifier MFCC-GMM (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients—Gaussian Mixture Model) and, if so, under which conditions. We recorded 221 French speakers (recently diagnosed PD subjects and healthy controls) with a high-quality microphone and via the telephone network. Men and women were analyzed separately in order to have more precise models and to assess a possible gender effect. Several experimental and methodological aspects were tested in order to analyze their impacts on classification performance. We assessed the impact of the audio segment durations, data augmentation, type of dataset used for the neural network training, kind of speech tasks, and back-end analyses. X-vectors technique provided better classification performances than MFCC-GMM for the text-independent tasks, and seemed to be particularly suited for the early detection of PD in women (7–15% improvement). This result was observed for both recording types (high-quality microphone and telephone).</p>

<p>Emotion recognition plays an important role in intelligent human–computer interaction, but the related research still faces the problems of low accuracy and subject dependence. In this paper, an open-source software toolbox called MindLink-Eumpy is developed to recognize emotions by integrating electroencephalogram (EEG) and facial expression information. MindLink-Eumpy first applies a series of tools to automatically obtain physiological data from subjects and then analyzes the obtained facial expression data and EEG data, respectively, and finally fuses the two different signals at a decision level. In the detection of facial expressions, the algorithm used by MindLink-Eumpy is a multitask convolutional neural network (CNN) based on transfer learning technique. In the detection of EEG, MindLink-Eumpy provides two algorithms, including a subject-dependent model based on support vector machine (SVM) and a subject-independent model based on long short-term memory network (LSTM). In the decision-level fusion, weight enumerator and AdaBoost technique are applied to combine the predictions of SVM and CNN. We conducted two offline experiments on the Database for Emotion Analysis Using Physiological Signals (DEAP) dataset and the Multimodal Database for Affect Recognition and Implicit Tagging (MAHNOB-HCI) dataset, respectively, and conducted an online experiment on 15 healthy subjects. The results show that multimodal methods outperform single-modal methods in both offline and online experiments. In the subject-dependent condition, the multimodal method achieved an accuracy of 71.00% in the valence dimension and an accuracy of 72.14% in the arousal dimension. In the subject-independent condition, the LSTM-based method achieved an accuracy of 78.56% in the valence dimension and an accuracy of 77.22% in the arousal dimension. The feasibility and efficiency of MindLink-Eumpy for emotion recognition is thus demonstrated.</p>

Background and Objectives<p>Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a type of malformations of cortical development and one of the leading causes of drug-resistant epilepsy. Postoperative results improve the diagnosis of lesions on structural MRIs. Advances in quantitative algorithms have increased the identification of FCD lesions. However, due to significant differences in size, shape, and location of the lesion in different patients and a big deal of time for the objective diagnosis of lesion as well as the dependence of individual interpretation, sensitive approaches are required to address the challenge of lesion diagnosis.

<p>The convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a powerful tool of image classification that has been widely adopted in applications of automated scene segmentation and identification. However, the mechanisms underlying CNN image classification remain to be elucidated. In this study, we developed a new approach to address this issue by investigating transfer of learning in representative CNNs (AlexNet, VGG, ResNet-101, and Inception-ResNet-v2) on classifying geometric shapes based on local/global features or invariants. While the local features are based on simple components, such as orientation of line segment or whether two lines are parallel, the global features are based on the whole object such as whether an object has a hole or whether an object is inside of another object. Six experiments were conducted to test two hypotheses on CNN shape classification. The first hypothesis is that transfer of learning based on local features is higher than transfer of learning based on global features. The second hypothesis is that the CNNs with more layers and advanced architectures have higher transfer of learning based global features. The first two experiments examined how the CNNs transferred learning of discriminating local features (square, rectangle, trapezoid, and parallelogram). The other four experiments examined how the CNNs transferred learning of discriminating global features (presence of a hole, connectivity, and inside/outside relationship). While the CNNs exhibited robust learning on classifying shapes, transfer of learning varied from task to task, and model to model. The results rejected both hypotheses. First, some CNNs exhibited lower transfer of learning based on local features than that based on global features. Second the advanced CNNs exhibited lower transfer of learning on global features than that of the earlier models. Among the tested geometric features, we found that learning of discriminating inside/outside relationship was the most difficult to be transferred, indicating an effective benchmark to develop future CNNs. In contrast to the “ImageNet” approach that employs natural images to train and analyze the CNNs, the results show proof of concept for the “ShapeNet” approach that employs well-defined geometric shapes to elucidate the strengths and limitations of the computation in CNN image classification. This “ShapeNet” approach will also provide insights into understanding visual information processing the primate visual systems.</p>

<p>Background: Musculoskeletal pain disorders are among the leading causes of years lived with disability worldwide representing a significant burden to society. Studies investigating a “nociceptive-fusimotor” relationship using experimentally-induced pain/noxious stimuli and muscle spindle afferent (MSA) response have been published over several decades. The purpose of this scoping review was to systematically identify and summarize research findings related to the impact of experimentally-induced pain or noxious stimulation on direct MSA discharge/response.</p><p>Methods: PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane and Embase were searched from database inception to August 2020. Eligible studies were: (a) published in English; (b) clinical or pre-clinical studies; (c) original data studies; (d) included the investigation of MSA response to experimentally-induced pain or noxious stimulation; (e) included quantification of at least one direct physiological measure associated with MSA activity/response. Two-phase screening procedures were conducted by a pair of independent reviewers and data extracted from eligible studies.</p><p>Results: The literature search resulted in 195 articles of which 23 met inclusion criteria. Six studies (26%) were classified as clinical and 17 (74%) as pre-clinical. Two clinical studies investigated the effects of sacral dermatome pin-pricking on MSA response, while the remaining 4 studies investigated the effects of tonic muscle and/or skin pain induced by injection/infusion of hypertonic saline into the tibialis anterior muscle or subdermal tissues. In pre-clinical studies, muscle pain was induced by injection of noxious substances or the surgical removal of the meniscus at the knee joint.</p><p>Conclusion: Clinical studies in awake humans reported that experimentally-induced pain did not affect, or else slightly decreased MSA spontaneous discharge and/or response during weak dorsiflexor muscle contraction, thus failing to support an excitatory nociceptive-fusimotor relationship. However, a majority of pre-clinical studies indicated that ipsilateral and contralateral muscle injection of noxious substances altered MSA resting discharge and/or response to stretch predominately through static fusimotor reflex mechanisms. Methodological differences (use of anesthesia, stretch methodology, etc.) may ultimately be responsible for the discrepancies between clinical and pre-clinical findings. Additional investigative efforts are needed to reconcile these discrepancies and to clearly establish or refute the existence of nociceptive-fusimotor relationship in muscular pain.</p>

<p>Exposure to the repeated low-level blast overpressure (BOP) periodically experienced by military personnel in operational and training environments can lead to deficits in behavior and cognition. While these low-intensity blasts do not cause overt changes acutely, repeated exposures may lead to cumulative effects in the brain that include acute inflammation, vascular disruption, and other molecular changes, which may eventually contribute to neurodegenerative processes. To identify these acute changes in the brain following repeated BOP, an advanced blast simulator was used to expose rats to 8.5 or 10 psi BOP once per day for 14 days. At 24 h after the final BOP, brain tissue was collected and analyzed for inflammatory markers, astrogliosis (GFAP), tight junction proteins (claudin-5 and occludin), and neurodegeneration-related proteins (Aβ40/42, pTau, TDP-43). After repeated exposure to 8.5 psi BOP, the change in cytokine profile was relatively modest compared to the changes observed following 10 psi BOP, which included a significant reduction in several inflammatory markers. Reduction in the tight junction protein occludin was observed in both groups when compared to controls, suggesting cerebrovascular disruption. While repeated exposure to 8.5 psi BOP led to a reduction in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related proteins amyloid-β (Aβ)40 and Aβ42, these changes were not observed in the 10 psi group, which had a significant reduction in phosphorylated tau. Finally, repeated 10 psi BOP exposures led to an increase in GFAP, indicating alterations in astrocytes, and an increase in the mechanosensitive ion channel receptor protein, Piezo2, which may increase brain sensitivity to injury from pressure changes from BOP exposure. Overall, cumulative effects of repeated low-level BOP may increase the vulnerability to injury of the brain by disrupting neurovascular architecture, which may lead to downstream deleterious effects on behavior and cognition.</p>

<p>Serotonin (5-HT) is member of a family of indolamine molecules that participate in a wide variety of biological processes. Despite its important role in the regulation of local blood systems, little is known about the physiological function of 5-HT in reproductive organs, its functional implications, and its role in the reproduction of mammals. In the present work, we evaluated the localization and distribution of 5-HT (using histochemical analysis of indolamines) and different components of the serotoninergic system in rat testes. We detected local synthesis and degradation through immunofluorescence and western blot analyses against the TPH1, MAO<sub>A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>T</sub>, and VMAT1 serotonin transporters. We also identified the localization and distribution of the 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>3A</sub> receptors. RT-PCR results showed the presence of the Tph1, Maoa, Slc6a4, and Htr3a genes in testes and in the brain stem (Tph1 was used as a negative control). High-performance liquid chromatography was used to determine the presence of 5-HT and the activity of tryptophan hydroxylase in testes homogenates in vitro. Our observations suggest that TPH1 activity and local 5-HT synthesis befall in rat testes. We propose that 5-HT could participate in the regulation of testosterone synthesis and in the spermatogenesis process via local serotoninergic system. However, more studies are needed before concluding that rat testes, or those of other mammals, contain an active form of tryptophan hydroxylase and produce 5-HT.</p>

Patients with PSCI had significantly higher pNfL [median (IQR), 55.96 (36.13) vs. 35.73 (17.57) pg/ml; P &lt; 0.001] than Non-PSCI. pNfL was valuable for the prediction of PSCI (OR 1.044, 95% CI 1.038–1.049, P &lt; 0.001) after a logistic regression analysis, even after adjusting for conventional risk factors including age, sex, education level, NIHSS, TOAST classification, and infarction volume (OR 1.041, 95% CI 1.034–1.047, P &lt; 0.001). The optimal cutoff value of the pNfL concentration was 46.12 pg/ml, which yielded a sensitivity of 71.0% and a specificity of 81.5%, with the area under the curve (AUC) at 0.785 (95% CI 0.762–0.808, P &lt; 0.001).</p>Conclusion<p>This prospective cohort study showed that the pNfL concentration within 48 h of onset was an independent risk factor for PSCI 90 days after an anterior circulation stroke, even after being adjusted for potential influencing factors regarded as clinically relevant.</p>Clinical Trial Registration<p>www.chictr.org.cn, identifier ChiCTR1800020330.</p>

<p>Background: Uncertainty exists over the long-term prognostic significance of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) in primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).</p><p>Methods: We performed a longitudinal analysis of CSVD and clinical outcomes in consecutive patients with primary ICH who had MRI. Baseline CSVD load (including white matter hyperintensities [WMH], cerebral microbleeds [CMBs], lacunes, and enlarged perivascular spaces [EPVS]) was evaluated. The cumulative CSVD score was calculated by combining the presence of each CSVD marker (range 0–4). We followed participants for poor functional outcome [modified Rankin scale [mRS] ≥ 4], stroke recurrence, and time-varying survival during a median follow-up of 4.9 [interquartile range [IQR] 3.1–6.0] years. Parsimonious and fuller multivariable logistic regression analysis and Cox-regression analysis were performed to estimate the association of CSVD markers, individually and collectively, with each outcome.</p><p>Results: A total of 153 patients were included in the analyses. CMBs ≥ 10 [adjusted OR [adOR] 3.252, 95% CI 1.181–8.956, p = 0.023] and periventricular WMH (PWMH) (adOR 2.053, 95% CI 1.220–3.456, p = 0.007) were significantly associated with poor functional outcome. PWMH (adOR 2.908, 95% CI 1.230–6.878, p = 0.015) and lobar CMB severity (adOR 1.811, 95% CI 1.039–3.157, p = 0.036) were associated with stroke recurrence. The cumulative CSVD score was associated with poor functional outcome (adOR 1.460, 95% CI 1.017–2.096) and stroke recurrence (adOR 2.258, 95% CI 1.080–4.723). Death occurred in 36.1% (13/36) of patients with CMBs ≥ 10 compared with 18.8% (22/117) in those with CMB &lt; 10 (adjusted HR 2.669, 95% CI 1.248–5.707, p = 0.011). In addition, the cumulative CSVD score ≥ 2 was associated with a decreased survival rate (adjusted HR 3.140, 95% CI 1.066–9.250, p = 0.038).</p><p>Conclusions: Severe PWMH, CMB, or cumulative CSVD burden exert important influences on the long-term outcome of ICH.</p>

<p>Working memory is a core cognitive function and its deficits is one of the most common cognitive impairments. Reduced working memory capacity manifests as reduced accuracy in memory recall and prolonged speed of memory retrieval in older adults. Currently, the relationship between healthy older individuals’ age-related changes in resting brain oscillations and their working memory capacity is not clear. Eyes-closed resting electroencephalogram (rEEG) is gaining momentum as a potential neuromarker of mild cognitive impairments. Wearable and wireless EEG headset measuring key electrophysiological brain signals during rest and a working memory task was utilized. This research’s central hypothesis is that rEEG (e.g., eyes closed for 90 s) frequency and network features are surrogate markers for working memory capacity in healthy older adults. Forty-three older adults’ memory performance (accuracy and reaction times), brain oscillations during rest, and inter-channel magnitude-squared coherence during rest were analyzed. We report that individuals with a lower memory retrieval accuracy showed significantly increased alpha and beta oscillations over the right parietal site. Yet, faster working memory retrieval was significantly correlated with increased delta and theta band powers over the left parietal sites. In addition, significantly increased coherence between the left parietal site and the right frontal area is correlated with the faster speed in memory retrieval. The frontal and parietal dynamics of resting EEG is associated with the “accuracy and speed trade-off” during working memory in healthy older adults. Our results suggest that rEEG brain oscillations at local and distant neural circuits are surrogates of working memory retrieval’s accuracy and processing speed. Our current findings further indicate that rEEG frequency and coherence features recorded by wearable headsets and a brief resting and task protocol are potential biomarkers for working memory capacity. Additionally, wearable headsets are useful for fast screening of cognitive impairment risk.</p>

<p>Astrocytes are specialized glial cells that are essential components of the neurovascular unit (NVU) and are involved in neurodevelopment, brain maintenance and repair, and neurodegeneration. Astrocytes mediate these processes by releasing cellular mediators such as extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are vehicles of cell-cell communication and have been proposed as mediators of damage in AD. However, the transcellular mechanism by which Alzheimer disease (AD) astrocytes impair the function of NVU components is poorly understood. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of adult PS1-KI and 3xTg-AD astrocyte conditioned media (CM) and EVs on NVU components (neuroglia and endothelium) in vitro. Additionally, SAD and FAD astrocyte-derived EVs (A-EVs) were characterized, and we evaluated their effects on NVU in cocultured cells in vitro and on intrahippocampal CA1 cells in vivo. Surprisingly, cultured 3xTg-AD astrocytes showed increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) reactivity compared to PS1-KI astrocytes, which denotes astrocytic hyperreactivity. CM from adult mice 3xTg-AD astrocytes increased cell-cell gaps between endothelial cells, filopodia-like dendritic protrusions in neurons and neuronal and endothelial cell death. 3xTg-AD A-EVs induced neurotoxicity and increased astrocyte GFAP reactivity. Cultured human postmortem astrocytes from AD patients also increased GFAP reactivity and EVs release. No differences in the size or number of A-EVs were detected between AD and control samples; however, both SAD and FAD A-EVs showed increased expression of the surface marker aquaporin 4. A-EVs induced cytotoxicity and astrocyte hyperactivation: specifically, FAD A-EVs induced neuroglial cytotoxicity and increased gaps between the endothelium, while SAD A-EVs mainly altered the endothelium. Similarly, both AD A-EVs increased astrocyte GS reactivity and vascular deterioration in vivo. We associated this finding with perivascular reactive astrocytes and vascular deterioration in the human AD brain. In summary, these results suggest that AD A-EVs impair neuroglial and vascular components.</p>

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause damage to DNA and proteins. Here we report that the RecA recombinase is itself oxidized by ROS. Genetic and biochemical analyses revealed that oxidation of RecA altered its DNA repair and DNA recombination activities. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that exposure to ROS converted 4 out of 9 Met residues of RecA to methionine sulfoxide. Mimicking oxidation of Met35 by changing it for Gln caused complete loss of function whereas mimicking oxidation of Met164 resulted in constitutive SOS activation and loss of recombination activity. Yet, all ROS-induced alterations of RecA activity were suppressed by methionine sulfoxide reductases MsrA and MsrB. These findings indicate that under oxidative stress, MsrA/B is needed for RecA homeostasis control. The implication is that, besides damaging DNA structure directly, ROS prevent repair of DNA damage by hampering RecA activity.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathies (HCMs) are the leading cause of acute cardiac failure in young individuals. Over 300 mutations throughout β-cardiac myosin, including in the motor domain, are associated with HCM. A β-cardiac myosin motor mutation (R712L) leads to a severe form of HCM. Actin-gliding motility of R712L-myosin is inhibited, despite near-normal ATPase kinetics. By optical trapping, the working stroke of R712L-myosin was decreased 4-fold, but actin-attachment durations were normal. A prevalent hypothesis that HCM mutants are hypercontractile is thus not universal. R712 is adjacent to the binding site of the heart failure drug omecamtiv mecarbil (OM). OM suppresses the working stroke of normal β-cardiac myosin, but remarkably, OM rescues the R712L-myosin working stroke. Using a flow chamber to interrogate a single molecule during buffer exchange, we found OM rescue to be reversible. Thus, the R712L mutation uncouples lever arm rotation from ATPase activity and this inhibition is rescued by OM.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63524">Molecular structures of the eukaryotic retinal importer ABCA4</a></h4>

The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family contains thousands of members with diverse functions. Movement of the substrate, powered by ATP hydrolysis, can be outward (export) or inward (import). ABCA4 is a eukaryotic importer transporting retinal to the cytosol to enter the visual cycle. It also removes toxic retinoids from the disc lumen to the cytosol. Mutations in ABCA4 cause impaired vision or blindness. Despite decades of clinical, biochemical, and animal model studies, the molecular mechanism of ABCA4 is unknown. Here we report the structures of human ABCA4 in two conformations. In the absence of ATP, ABCA4 adopts an outward-facing conformation, poised to recruit substrate. The presence of ATP induces large conformational changes that could lead to substrate release. These structures provide a molecular basis to understand many disease-causing mutations and a rational guide for new experiments to uncover how ABCA4 recruits, flips, and releases retinoids.

Abstract
Glutamatergic hilar mossy cells (MCs) have axons that terminate both near and far from their cell body but stay within the DG, making synapses primarily in the molecular layer. The long‐range axons are considered the primary projection, and extend throughout the DG ipsilateral to the soma, and project to the contralateral DG. The specificity of MC axons for the inner molecular layer (IML) has been considered to be a key characteristic of the DG. In the present study, we made the surprising finding that dorsal MC axons are an exception to this rule. We used two mouse lines that allow for Cre‐dependent viral labeling of MCs and their axons: dopamine receptor D2 (Drd2‐Cre) and calcitonin receptor‐like receptor (Crlr‐Cre). A single viral injection into the dorsal DG to label dorsal MCs resulted in labeling of MC axons in both the IML and middle molecular layer (MML). Interestingly, this broad termination of dorsal MC axons occurred throughout the septotemporal DG. In contrast, long‐range axons of ventral MCs terminated in the IML, consistent with the literature. Taken together, these results suggest that dorsal and ventral MCs differ significantly in their axonal projections. Since MC projections in the ML are thought to terminate primarily on GCs, the results suggest a dorsal–ventral difference in MC activation of GCs. The surprising difference in dorsal and ventral MC projections should therefore be considered when evaluating dorsal–ventral differences in DG function.

N6-methyladenine (6mA) is an important DNA modification form associated with a wide range of biological processes. Identifying accurately 6mA sites on a genomic scale is crucial for under-standing of 6mA’s biological functions. However, the existing experimental techniques for detecting 6mA sites are cost-ineffective, which implies the great need of developing new computational methods for this problem. In this paper, we developed, without requiring any prior knowledge of 6mA and manually crafted sequence features, a deep learning framework named Deep6mA to identify DNA 6mA sites, and its performance is superior to other DNA 6mA prediction tools. Specifically, the 5-fold cross-validation on a benchmark dataset of rice gives the sensitivity and specificity of Deep6mA as 92.96% and 95.06%, respectively, and the overall prediction accuracy is 94%. Importantly, we find that the sequences with 6mA sites share similar patterns across different species. The model trained with rice data predicts well the 6mA sites of other three species: <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, <i>Fragaria vesca</i> and <i>Rosa chinensis</i> with a prediction accuracy over 90%. In addition, we find that (1) 6mA tends to occur at GAGG motifs, which means the sequence near the 6mA site may be conservative; (2) 6mA is enriched in the TATA box of the promoter, which may be the main source of its regulating downstream gene expression.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aVrzl3Vk1LE" width="1" />

<p>by Carlos Coronel-Oliveros, Rodrigo Cofré, Patricio Orio</p>

Segregation and integration are two fundamental principles of brain structural and functional organization. Neuroimaging studies have shown that the brain transits between different functionally segregated and integrated states, and neuromodulatory systems have been proposed as key to facilitate these transitions. Although whole-brain computational models have reproduced this neuromodulatory effect, the role of local inhibitory circuits and their cholinergic modulation has not been studied. In this article, we consider a Jansen &amp; Rit whole-brain model in a network interconnected using a human connectome, and study the influence of the cholinergic and noradrenergic neuromodulatory systems on the segregation/integration balance. In our model, we introduce a local inhibitory feedback as a plausible biophysical mechanism that enables the integration of whole-brain activity, and that interacts with the other neuromodulatory influences to facilitate the transition between different functional segregation/integration regimes in the brain.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8SzswQ18cJE" width="1" />

<p>by Yaron Goldberg, Jonathan Friedman</p>

Positive interactions, including intraspecies cooperation and interspecies mutualisms, play crucial roles in shaping the structure and function of many ecosystems, ranging from plant communities to the human microbiome. While the evolutionary forces that form and maintain positive interactions have been investigated extensively, the influence of positive interactions on the ability of species to adapt to new environments is still poorly understood. Here, we use numerical simulations and theoretical analyses to study how positive interactions impact the likelihood that populations survive after an environment deteriorates, such that survival in the new environment requires quick adaptation via the rise of new mutants—a scenario known as evolutionary rescue. We find that the probability of evolutionary rescue in populations engaged in positive interactions is reduced significantly. In cooperating populations, this reduction is largely due to the fact that survival may require at least a minimal number of individuals, meaning that adapted mutants must arise and spread before the population declines below this threshold. In mutualistic populations, the rescue probability is decreased further due to two additional effects—the need for both mutualistic partners to adapt to the new environment, and competition between the two species. Finally, we show that the presence of cheaters reduces the likelihood of evolutionary rescue even further, making it extremely unlikely. These results indicate that while positive interactions may be beneficial in stable environments, they can hinder adaptation to changing environments and thereby elevate the risk of population collapse. Furthermore, these results may hint at the selective pressures that drove co-dependent unicellular species to form more adaptable organisms able to differentiate into multiple phenotypes, including multicellular life.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nKaWTi7jDF8" width="1" />

<p>by Tzu-Hao Lin, Tomonari Akamatsu, Yu Tsao</p>

Remote acquisition of information on ecosystem dynamics is essential for conservation management, especially for the deep ocean. Soundscape offers unique opportunities to study the behavior of soniferous marine animals and their interactions with various noise-generating activities at a fine temporal resolution. However, the retrieval of soundscape information remains challenging owing to limitations in audio analysis techniques that are effective in the face of highly variable interfering sources. This study investigated the application of a seafloor acoustic observatory as a long-term platform for observing marine ecosystem dynamics through audio source separation. A source separation model based on the assumption of source-specific periodicity was used to factorize time-frequency representations of long-duration underwater recordings. With minimal supervision, the model learned to discriminate source-specific spectral features and prove to be effective in the separation of sounds made by cetaceans, soniferous fish, and abiotic sources from the deep-water soundscapes off northeastern Taiwan. Results revealed phenological differences among the sound sources and identified diurnal and seasonal interactions between cetaceans and soniferous fish. The application of clustering to source separation results generated a database featuring the diversity of soundscapes and revealed a compositional shift in clusters of cetacean vocalizations and fish choruses during diurnal and seasonal cycles. The source separation model enables the transformation of single-channel audio into multiple channels encoding the dynamics of biophony, geophony, and anthropophony, which are essential for characterizing the community of soniferous animals, quality of acoustic habitat, and their interactions. Our results demonstrated the application of source separation could facilitate acoustic diversity assessment, which is a crucial task in soundscape-based ecosystem monitoring. Future implementation of soundscape information retrieval in long-term marine observation networks will lead to the use of soundscapes as a new tool for conservation management in an increasingly noisy ocean.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PZkO2rsGjXs" width="1" />

<p>by Alexandre Pitti, Mathias Quoy, Sofiane Boucenna, Catherine Lavandier</p>

We propose a developmental model inspired by the cortico-basal system (CX-BG) for vocal learning in babies and for solving the correspondence mismatch problem they face when they hear unfamiliar voices, with different tones and pitches. This model is based on the neural architecture INFERNO standing for Iterative Free-Energy Optimization of Recurrent Neural Networks. Free-energy minimization is used for rapidly exploring, selecting and learning the optimal choices of actions to perform (eg sound production) in order to reproduce and control as accurately as possible the spike trains representing desired perceptions (eg sound categories). We detail in this paper the CX-BG system responsible for linking causally the sound and motor primitives at the order of a few milliseconds. Two experiments performed with a small and a large audio database show the capabilities of exploration, generalization and robustness to noise of our neural architecture in retrieving audio primitives during vocal learning and during acoustic matching with unheared voices (different genders and tones).<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/m86UNW7ETl4" width="1" />

Gene function annotation is important for a variety of downstream analyses of genetic data. But experimental characterization of function remains costly and slow, making computational prediction an important endeavor. Phylogenetic approaches to prediction have been developed, but implementation of a practical Bayesian framework for parameter estimation remains an outstanding challenge. We have developed a computationally efficient model of evolution of gene annotations using phylogenies based on a Bayesian framework using Markov Chain Monte Carlo for parameter estimation. Unlike previous approaches, our method is able to estimate parameters over many different phylogenetic trees and functions. The resulting parameters agree with biological intuition, such as the increased probability of function change following gene duplication. The method performs well on leave-one-out cross-validation, and we further validated some of the predictions in the experimental scientific literature.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BQFcu6Vs_jY" width="1" />

<p>by Ricardo A. R. Machado, Vanitha Theepan, Christelle A. M. Robert, Tobias Züst, Lingfei Hu, Qi Su, Bernardus C. J. Schimmel, Matthias Erb</p>

Plants produce complex mixtures of primary and secondary metabolites. Herbivores use these metabolites as behavioral cues to increase their fitness. However, how herbivores combine and integrate different metabolite classes into fitness-relevant foraging decisions in planta is poorly understood. We developed a molecular manipulative approach to modulate the availability of sugars and benzoxazinoid secondary metabolites as foraging cues for a specialist maize herbivore, the western corn rootworm. By disrupting sugar perception in the western corn rootworm and benzoxazinoid production in maize, we show that sugars and benzoxazinoids act as distinct and dynamically combined mediators of short-distance host finding and acceptance. While sugars improve the capacity of rootworm larvae to find a host plant and to distinguish postembryonic from less nutritious embryonic roots, benzoxazinoids are specifically required for the latter. Host acceptance in the form of root damage is increased by benzoxazinoids and sugars in an additive manner. This pattern is driven by increasing damage to postembryonic roots in the presence of benzoxazinoids and sugars. Benzoxazinoid- and sugar-mediated foraging directly improves western corn rootworm growth and survival. Interestingly, western corn rootworm larvae retain a substantial fraction of their capacity to feed and survive on maize plants even when both classes of chemical cues are almost completely absent. This study unravels fine-grained differentiation and combination of primary and secondary metabolites into herbivore foraging and documents how the capacity to compensate for the lack of important chemical cues enables a specialist herbivore to survive within unpredictable metabolic landscapes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6QKEQ21AX_M" width="1" />

The blink reflex is critical for protecting the eyes and spreading the tear film, and is a commonly used learning model. We demonstrate monosynaptic trigeminal (shown here) and disynaptic reticular formation pathways connecting the principal and the spinal trigeminal nucleus (pars caudalis) with orbicularis oculi motoneurons in the macaque monkey.






ABSTRACT
The trigeminal blink reflex plays an important role in protecting the corneal surface from damage and preserving visual function in an unpredictable environment. The closing phase of the reflex, produced by activation of the orbicularis oculi muscles, consists of an initial, small, ipsilateral R1 component, followed by a larger, bilateral R2 component. We investigated the circuitry that underlies this reflex in macaque (Macaca fascicularis and mulatta) monkeys by use of single and dual tracer methods. Injection of retrograde tracer into the facial nucleus labeled neurons in the principal trigeminal nucleus, and in the spinal nucleus pars oralis and interpolaris, bilaterally, and in pars caudalis, ipsilaterally. Injection of anterograde tracer into the principal trigeminal nucleus labeled axons that directly terminated on orbicularis oculi motoneurons, with an ipsilateral predominance. Injection of anterograde tracer into pars caudalis of the spinal trigeminal nucleus labeled axons that directly terminated on ipsilateral orbicularis oculi motoneurons. The observed pattern of labeling indicates that the reticular formation ventromedial to the principal and spinal nuclei also contributes extensive bilateral input to orbicularis oculi motoneurons. Thus, much of the trigeminal sensory complex is in a position to supply monosynaptic drive for lid closure, and the adjacent reticular formation can supply a disynaptic drive. These findings indicate that assignment of the R1 and R2 components of the blink reflex to different parts of trigeminal sensory complex cannot be exclusively based on subdivision connectional relationships with facial motoneurons. The characteristics of the R2 component may be due, instead, to other circuit properties.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26052?af=R">Early predictors of 9‐year disability in pediatric multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

Objectives
To assess early predictors of 9‐year disability in pediatric multiple sclerosis patients.


Methods
Clinical and MRI assessments of 123 pediatric multiple sclerosis patients were obtained at disease onset and after 1 and 2 years. A 9‐year clinical follow‐up was also performed. Cox proportional hazard and multivariable regression models were used to assess independent predictors of time to first relapse and 9‐year outcomes.


Results
Time to first relapse was predicted by optic nerve lesions (hazard ratio [HR]=2.10, p=0.02) and high‐efficacy treatment exposure (HR=0.31, p=0.005). Predictors of annualized relapse rate were: at baseline, presence of cerebellar (β=‐0.15, p&lt;0.001), cervical cord lesions (β=0.16, p=0.003) and high‐efficacy treatment exposure (β=‐0.14, p=0.01); considering also 1‐year variables, number of relapses (β=0.14, p=0.002) and the previous baseline predictors; considering 2‐year variables, time to first relapse (2‐year: β=‐0.12, p=0.01) entered, while high‐efficacy treatment exposure exit from the model. Predictors of 9‐year disability worsening were: at baseline, presence of optic nerve lesions [odds ratio (OR)=6.45, p=0.01]; considering 1‐ and 2‐year variables, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) changes (1‐year: OR=26.05, p&lt;0.001; 2‐year: OR=16.38, p=0.02) and ≥2 new T2‐lesions in 2 years (2‐year: OR=4.91, p=0.02). Predictors of higher 9‐year EDSS score were: at baseline, EDSS score (β=0.58, p&lt;0.001), presence of brainstem (β=0.31, p=0.04) and number of cervical cord lesions (β=0.22, p=0.05); considering 1‐ and 2‐year variables, EDSS changes (1‐year: β=0.79, p&lt;0.001; 2‐year: β=0.55, p&lt;0.001), and ≥2 new T2‐lesions (1‐year: β=0.28, p=0.03; 2‐year: β=0.35, p=0.01).


Interpretation
A complete baseline MRI assessment and an accurate clinical and MRI monitoring during the first 2 years of disease contribute to predict 9‐year prognosis in pediatric multiple sclerosis.

<p>Repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (rPMS) may improve motor function following central nervous system lesions, but the optimal parameters of rPMS to induce neural plasticity and mechanisms underlying its action remain unclear. We examined the effects of rPMS over wrist extensor muscles on neural plasticity and motor performance in 26 healthy volunteers. In separate experiments, the effects of rPMS on motor evoked potentials (MEPs), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF), direct motor response (M-wave), Hoffmann-reflex, and ballistic wrist extension movements were assessed before and after rPMS. First, to examine the effects of stimulus frequency, rPMS was applied at 50, 25, and 10 Hz by setting a fixed total number of stimuli. A significant increase in MEPs of wrist extensors was observed following 50 and 25 Hz rPMS, but not 10 Hz rPMS. Next, we examined the time required to induce plasticity by increasing the number of stimuli, and found that at least 15 min of 50 and 25 Hz rPMS was required. Based on these parameters, lasting effects were evaluated following 15 min of 50 or 25 Hz rPMS. A significant increase in MEP was observed up to 60 min following 50 and 25 Hz rPMS; similarly, an attenuation of SICI and enhancement of ICF were also observed. The maximal M-wave and Hoffmann-reflex did not change, suggesting that the increase in MEP was due to plastic changes at the motor cortex. This was accompanied by increasing force and electromyograms during wrist ballistic extension movements following 50 and 25 Hz rPMS. These findings suggest that 15 min of rPMS with 25 Hz or more induces an increase in cortical excitability of the relevant area rather than altering the excitability of spinal circuits, and has the potential to improve motor output.</p>

<p>Iron has been increasingly implicated in the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. In the past decade, development of the new magnetic resonance imaging technique, quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), has enabled for the more comprehensive investigation of iron distribution in the brain. The aim of this systematic review was to provide a synthesis of the findings from existing QSM studies in neurodegenerative diseases. We identified 80 records by searching MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and PsycInfo databases. The disorders investigated in these studies included Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Wilson's disease, Huntington's disease, Friedreich's ataxia, spinocerebellar ataxia, Fabry disease, myotonic dystrophy, pantothenate-kinase-associated neurodegeneration, and mitochondrial membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration. As a general pattern, QSM revealed increased magnetic susceptibility (suggestive of increased iron content) in the brain regions associated with the pathology of each disorder, such as the amygdala and caudate nucleus in Alzheimer's disease, the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease, motor cortex in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, basal ganglia in Huntington's disease, and cerebellar dentate nucleus in Friedreich's ataxia. Furthermore, the increased magnetic susceptibility correlated with disease duration and severity of clinical features in some disorders. Although the number of studies is still limited in most of the neurodegenerative diseases, the existing evidence suggests that QSM can be a promising tool in the investigation of neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>In EEG studies, one of the most common ways to detect a weak periodic signal in the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is spectral evaluation, a process that detects peaks of power present at notable temporal frequencies. However, the presence of noise decreases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which in turn lowers the probability of successful detection of these spectral peaks. In this paper, using a single EEG channel, we compare the detection performance of four different metrics to analyse the SSVEP: two metrics that use spectral power density, and two other metrics that use phase coherency. We employ these metrics find weak signals with a known temporal frequency hidden in the SSVEP, using both simulation and real data from a stereoscopic apparent depth movement perception task. We demonstrate that out of these metrics, the phase coherency analysis is the most sensitive way to find weak signals in the SSVEP, provided that the phase information of the stimulus eliciting the SSVEP is preserved.</p>

<p>Wild-type human SOD1 forms a highly conserved intra-molecular disulfide bond between C57-C146, and in its native state is greatly stabilized by binding one copper and one zinc atom per monomer rendering the protein dimeric. Loss of copper extinguishes dismutase activity and destabilizes the protein, increasing accessibility of the disulfide with monomerization accompanying disulfide reduction. A further pair of free thiols exist at C6 and C111 distant from metal binding sites, raising the question of their function. Here we investigate their role in misfolding of SOD1 along a pathway that leads to formation of amyloid fibrils. We present the seeding reaction of a mutant SOD1 lacking free sulfhydryl groups (AS-SOD1) to exclude variables caused by these free cysteines. Completely reduced fibril seeds decreasing the kinetic barrier to cleave the highly conserved intramolecular disulfide bond, and accelerating SOD1 reduction and initiation of fibrillation. Presence or absence of the pair of free thiols affects kinetics of fibrillation. Previously, we showed full maturation with both Cu and Zn prevents this behavior while lack of Cu renders sensitivity to fibrillation, with presence of the native disulfide bond modulating this propensity much more strongly than presence of Zn or dimerization. Here we further investigate the role of reduction of the native C57-C146 disulfide bond in fibrillation of wild-type hSOD1, firstly through removal of free thiols by paired mutations C6A, C111S (AS-SOD1), and secondly in seeded fibrillation reactions modulated by reductant tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP). Fibrillation of AS-SOD1 was dependent upon disulfide reduction and showed classic lag and exponential growth phases compared with wild-type hSOD1 whose fibrillation trajectories were typically somewhat perturbed. Electron microscopy showed that AS-SOD1 formed classic fibrils while wild-type fibrillation reactions showed the presence of smaller “sausage-like” oligomers in addition to fibrils, highlighting the potential for mixed disulfides involving C6/C111 to disrupt efficient fibrillation. Seeding by addition of sonicated fibrils lowered the TCEP concentration needed for fibrillation in both wild-type and AS-SOD1 providing evidence for template-driven structural disturbance that elevated susceptibility to reduction and thus propensity to fibrillate.</p>

<p>Studying brain function is a challenging task. In the past, we could only study brain anatomical structures post-mortem, or infer brain functions from clinical data of patients with a brain injury. Nowadays technology, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), enable non-invasive brain activity observation. Several approaches have been proposed to interpret brain activity data. The brain connectivity model is a graphical tool that represents the interaction between brain regions, during certain states. It depicts how a brain region cause changes to other parts of the brain, which can be implied as information flow. This model can be used to help interpret how the brain works. There are several mathematical frameworks that can be used to infer the connectivity model from brain activity signals. Granger causality is one such approach and is one of the first that has been applied to brain activity data. However, due to the concept of the framework, such as the use of pairwise correlation, combined with the limitation of brain activity data such as low temporal resolution in case of fMRI signal, makes the interpretation of the connectivity difficult. We therefore propose the application of the Tigramite causal discovery framework on fMRI data. The Tigramite framework uses measures such as causal effect to analyze causal relations in the system. This enables the framework to identify both direct and indirect pathways or connectivities. In this paper, we applied the framework to the Human Connectome Project motor task-fMRI dataset. We then present the results and discuss how the framework improves interpretability of the connectivity model. We hope that this framework will help us understand more complex brain functions such as memory, consciousness, or the resting-state of the brain, in the future.</p>

<p>Pyramidal neurons are the most common neurons in the cerebral cortex. Understanding how they differ between species is a key challenge in neuroscience. We compared human temporal cortex and mouse visual cortex pyramidal neurons from the Allen Cell Types Database in terms of their electrophysiology and dendritic morphology. We found that, among other differences, human pyramidal neurons had a higher action potential threshold voltage, a lower input resistance, and larger dendritic arbors. We learned Gaussian Bayesian networks from the data in order to identify correlations and conditional independencies between the variables and compare them between the species. We found strong correlations between electrophysiological and morphological variables in both species. In human cells, electrophysiological variables were correlated even with morphological variables that are not directly related to dendritic arbor size or diameter, such as mean bifurcation angle and mean branch tortuosity. Cortical depth was correlated with both electrophysiological and morphological variables in both species, and its effect on electrophysiology could not be explained in terms of the morphological variables. For some variables, the effect of cortical depth was opposite in the two species. Overall, the correlations among the variables differed strikingly between human and mouse neurons. Besides identifying correlations and conditional independencies, the learned Bayesian networks might be useful for probabilistic reasoning regarding the morphology and electrophysiology of pyramidal neurons.</p>

<p>To preserve postoperative brain function, it is important for neurosurgeons to fully understand the brain's structure, vasculature, and function. Intraoperative high-frequency electrical stimulation during awake craniotomy is the gold standard for mapping the function of the cortices and white matter; however, this method can only map the “focal” functions and cannot monitor large-scale cortical networks in real-time. Recently, an in vivo electrophysiological method using cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) induced by single-pulse electrical cortical stimulation has been developed in an extraoperative setting. By using the CCEP connectivity pattern intraoperatively, mapping and real-time monitoring of the dorsal language pathway is available. This intraoperative CCEP method also allows for mapping of the frontal aslant tract, another language pathway, and detection of connectivity between the primary and supplementary motor areas in the frontal lobe network. Intraoperative CCEP mapping has also demonstrated connectivity between the frontal and temporal lobes, likely via the ventral language pathway. Establishing intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring is clinically useful for preserving brain function, even under general anesthesia. This CCEP technique demonstrates potential clinical applications for mapping and monitoring large-scale cortical networks.</p>

<p>Research on cognitive control has sparked increasing interest in recent years, as it is an important prerequisite for goal oriented human behavior. The paced auditory serial addition task (PASAT) has been used to test and train cognitive control functions. This adaptive, challenging task includes continuous performance feedback. Therefore, additional cognitive control capacities are required to process this information along with the already high task-load. The underlying neural mechanisms, however, are still unclear. To explore the neural signatures of the PASAT and particularly the processing of distractive feedback information, feedback locked event-related potentials were derived from 24 healthy participants during an adaptive 2-back version of the PASAT. Larger neural activation after negative feedback was found for feedback related negativity (FRN), P300, and late positive potential (LPP). In early stages of feedback processing (i.e., FRN), a larger difference between positive and negative feedback responses was associated with poorer overall performance. This association was inverted in later stages (i.e., P300 and LPP). Together, our findings indicate stage-dependent associations between neural activation after negative information and cognitive functioning. Conceivably, increased early responses to negative feedback signify distraction, whereas higher activity at later stages reflects cognitive control processes to preserve ongoing performance.</p>

<p>Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a neuroimaging technique that has undergone tremendous growth over the last decade due to methodological advantages over other measures of brain activation. The action-observation network (AON), a system of brain structures proposed to have “mirroring” abilities (e.g., active when an individual completes an action or when they observe another complete that action), has been studied in humans through neural measures such as fMRI and electroencephalogram (EEG); however, limitations of these methods are problematic for AON paradigms. For this reason, fNIRS is proposed as a solution to investigating the AON in humans. The present review article briefly summarizes previous neural findings in the AON and examines the state of AON research using fNIRS in adults. A total of 14 fNIRS articles are discussed, paying particular attention to methodological choices and considerations while summarizing the general findings to aid in developing better protocols to study the AON through fNIRS. Additionally, future directions of this work are discussed, specifically in relation to researching AON development and potential multimodal imaging applications.</p>

<p>This study investigated the neuromodulatory effects of transspinal stimulation on soleus H-reflex excitability and electromyographic (EMG) activity during stepping in humans with and without spinal cord injury (SCI). Thirteen able-bodied adults and 5 individuals with SCI participated in the study. EMG activity from both legs was determined for steps without, during, and after a single-pulse or pulse train transspinal stimulation delivered during stepping randomly at different phases of the step cycle. The soleus H-reflex was recorded in both subject groups under control conditions and following single-pulse transspinal stimulation at an individualized exactly similar positive and negative conditioning-test interval. The EMG activity was decreased in both subject groups at the steps during transspinal stimulation, while intralimb and interlimb coordination were altered only in SCI subjects. At the steps immediately after transspinal stimulation, the physiological phase-dependent EMG modulation pattern remained unaffected in able-bodied subjects. The conditioned soleus H-reflex was depressed throughout the step cycle in both subject groups. Transspinal stimulation modulated depolarization of motoneurons over multiple segments, limb coordination, and soleus H-reflex excitability during assisted stepping. The soleus H-reflex depression may be the result of complex spinal inhibitory interneuronal circuits activated by transspinal stimulation and collision between orthodromic and antidromic volleys in the peripheral mixed nerve. The soleus H-reflex depression by transspinal stimulation suggests a potential application for normalization of spinal reflex excitability after SCI.</p>

<p>In vowel discrimination, commonly found discrimination patterns are directional asymmetries where discrimination is faster (or easier) if differing vowels are presented in a certain sequence compared to the reversed sequence. Different models of speech sound processing try to account for these asymmetries based on either phonetic or phonological properties. In this study, we tested and compared two of those often-discussed models, namely the Featurally Underspecified Lexicon (FUL) model (Lahiri and Reetz, 2002) and the Natural Referent Vowel (NRV) framework (Polka and Bohn, 2011). While most studies presented isolated vowels, we investigated a large stimulus set of German vowels in a more naturalistic setting within minimal pairs. We conducted an mismatch negativity (MMN) study in a passive and a reaction time study in an active oddball paradigm. In both data sets, we found directional asymmetries that can be explained by either phonological or phonetic theories. While behaviorally, the vowel discrimination was based on phonological properties, both tested models failed to explain the found neural patterns comprehensively. Therefore, we additionally examined the influence of a variety of articulatory, acoustical, and lexical factors (e.g., formant structure, intensity, duration, and frequency of occurrence) but also the influence of factors beyond the well-known (perceived loudness of vowels, degree of openness) in depth via multiple regression analyses. The analyses revealed that the perceptual factor of perceived loudness has a greater impact than considered in the literature and should be taken stronger into consideration when analyzing preattentive natural vowel processing.</p>

<p>Multiple mechanisms contribute to the generation, propagation, and coordination of the rhythmic patterns necessary for locomotion in Caenorhabditis elegans. Current experiments have focused on two possibilities: pacemaker neurons and stretch-receptor feedback. Here, we focus on whether it is possible that a chain of multiple network rhythmic pattern generators in the ventral nerve cord also contribute to locomotion. We use a simulation model to search for parameters of the anatomically constrained ventral nerve cord circuit that, when embodied and situated, can drive forward locomotion on agar, in the absence of pacemaker neurons or stretch-receptor feedback. Systematic exploration of the space of possible solutions reveals that there are multiple configurations that result in locomotion that is consistent with certain aspects of the kinematics of worm locomotion on agar. Analysis of the best solutions reveals that gap junctions between different classes of motorneurons in the ventral nerve cord can play key roles in coordinating the multiple rhythmic pattern generators.</p>

<p>Systemic nicotine enhances neural processing in primary auditory cortex (A1) as determined using tone-evoked, current-source density (CSD) measurements. For example, nicotine enhances the characteristic frequency (CF)-evoked current sink in layer 4 of A1, increasing amplitude and decreasing latency. However, since presenting auditory stimuli within a stream of stimuli increases the complexity of response dynamics, we sought to determine the effects of nicotine on CSD responses to trains of CF stimuli (one-second trains at 2–40 Hz; each train repeated 25 times). CSD recordings were obtained using a 16-channel multiprobe inserted in A1 of urethane/xylazine-anesthetized mice, and analysis focused on two current sinks in the middle (layer 4) and deep (layers 5/6) layers. CF trains produced adaptation of the layer 4 response that was weak at 2 Hz, stronger at 5–10 Hz and complete at 20–40 Hz. In contrast, the layer 5/6 current sink exhibited less adaptation at 2–10 Hz, and simultaneously recorded auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) showed no adaptation even at 40 Hz. Systemic nicotine (2.1 mg/kg) enhanced layer 4 responses throughout the one-second stimulus train at rates ≤10 Hz. Nicotine enhanced both response amplitude within each train and the consistency of response timing across 25 trials. Nicotine did not alter the degree of adaptation over one-second trials, but its effect to increase amplitudes revealed a novel, slower form of adaptation that developed over multiple trials. Nicotine did not affect responses that were fully adapted (20–40 Hz trains), nor did nicotine affect any aspect of the layer 5/6 current sink or ABRs. The overall effect of nicotine in layer 4 was to enhance all responses within each train, to emphasize earlier trials across multiple trials, and to improve the consistency of timing across all trials. These effects may improve processing of complex acoustic streams, including speech, that contain information in the 2–10 Hz range.</p>

<p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is marked by cardio-respiratory alterations, with increasing reports also indicating neurological and psychiatric symptoms in infected individuals. During COVID-19 pathology, the central nervous system (CNS) is possibly affected by direct severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) invasion, exaggerated systemic inflammatory responses, or hypoxia. Psychosocial stress imposed by the pandemic further affects the CNS of COVID-19 patients, but also the non-infected population, potentially contributing to the emergence or exacerbation of various neurological or mental health disorders. Microglia are central players of the CNS homeostasis maintenance and inflammatory response that exert their crucial functions in coordination with other CNS cells. During homeostatic challenges to the brain parenchyma, microglia modify their density, morphology, and molecular signature, resulting in the adjustment of their functions. In this review, we discuss how microglia may be involved in the neuroprotective and neurotoxic responses against CNS insults deriving from COVID-19. We examine how these responses may explain, at least partially, the neurological and psychiatric manifestations reported in COVID-19 patients and the general population. Furthermore, we consider how microglia might contribute to increased CNS vulnerability in certain groups, such as aged individuals and people with pre-existing conditions.</p>

<p>Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type within the central nervous system (CNS) with various functions. Furthermore, astrocytes show a regional and developmental heterogeneity traceable with specific markers. In this study, the influence of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) on astrocytic maturation within the hippocampus was analyzed during development. Previous studies mostly focused on the involvement of LRP1 in the neuronal compartment, where the deletion caused hyperactivity and motor dysfunctions in knockout animals. However, the influence of LRP1 on glia cells is less intensively investigated. Therefore, we used a newly generated mouse model, where LRP1 is specifically deleted from GLAST-positive astrocytes co-localized with the expression of the reporter tdTomato to visualize recombination and knockout events in vivo. The influence of LRP1 on the maturation of hippocampal astrocytes was assessed with immunohistochemical stainings against stage-specific markers as well as on mRNA level with RT-PCR analysis. The examination revealed that the knockout induction caused a significantly decreased number of mature astrocytes at an early developmental timepoint compared to control animals. Additionally, the delayed maturation of astrocytes also caused a reduced activity of neurons within the hippocampus. As previous studies showed that the glial specification and maturation of astrocytes is dependent on the signaling cascades Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk and PI3K/Akt, the phosphorylation of the signaling molecules Erk1/2 and Akt was analyzed. The hippocampal tissue of LRP1-deficient animals at P21 showed a significantly decreased amount of activated Erk in comparison to control tissue leading to the conclusion that the activation of this signaling cascade is dependent on LRP1 in astrocytes, which in turn is necessary for proper maturation of astrocytes. Our results showed that the deletion of LRP1 at an early developmental timepoint caused a delayed maturation of astrocytes in the hippocampus based on an altered activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk signaling pathway. However, with ongoing development these effects were compensated and the number of mature astrocytes was comparable as well as the activity of neurons. Therefore, LRP1 acts as an early regulator of the differentiation and maturation of astrocytes within the hippocampus.</p>

<p>Background: Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is the initial and rate-limiting enzyme in the metabolism of tryptophan (TRP) to kynurenine (KYN). IDO1-dependent neurotoxic KYN metabolism plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative disorders. However, the function of IDO1 in epilepsy is still unclear.</p><p>Objective: In this study, we investigated whether IDO1 deficiency could affect epilepsy in a lithium-pilocarpine-induced model.</p><p>Methods: Patients with epilepsy and controls were enrolled. Male C57BL/6 mice and IDO1 knockout (KO, IDO1<sup>−/−</sup>) mice were subjected to intraperitoneal injection of lithium and pilocarpine to induce epilepsy. The levels of IDO1 and concentrations of TRP and KYN in patients with epilepsy and epileptic mice were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), respectively. Then, behavioral phenotypes related to epileptic seizures and neuronal damage were compared between KO and wild-type (WT) mice with lithium-pilocarpine-induced epilepsy. To explore the underlying pathways involved in the effects of IDO1 deficiency, the concentrations of kynurenic acid (KYNA) and quinolinic acid (QUIN), glial cell activation, the levels of major pro-inflammatory cytokines, and antioxidant enzyme activity were measured by LC-MS, immunohistochemistry, and ELISA.</p><p>Results: In this study, IDO1 levels and the KYN/TRP ratio in the sera and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were increased in patients with epilepsy. Also, IDO1 levels, the KYN/TRP ratio, and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the sera and hippocampi were increased in mice during the acute phase and chronic phase after status epilepticus (SE). Furthermore, IDO1 was localized in microglial cells in epileptic mice. IDO1 deficiency delayed SE onset and attenuated the frequency, duration, and severity of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs). Moreover, IDO1 deficiency improved neuronal survival. Additionally, IDO1<sup>−/−</sup> epileptic mice showed progressive declines in QUIN production, glial cell activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines levels, and enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity.</p><p>Conclusions: IDO1 deletion suppressed seizures and alleviated neuronal damage by reducing the IDO1-dependent production of neurotoxic metabolites, which finally inhibited glial cell activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production and improved antioxidant enzyme activity. Our study demonstrates that IDO1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy and has the potential to be a therapeutic target for epilepsy treatment.</p>

<p>Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) are a major component of the blood-brain barrier that maintains brain homeostasis. Preserving and restoring the normal biological functions of BMECs can reverse or reduce brain injury. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) may promote brain vascular remodeling and restore normal endothelial function. As a novel vehicle for cell-cell communication, microvesicles (MVs) have varied biological functions. The present study investigated the biological effects of EPC-derived MVs (EPC-MVs) on BMECs in vitro. We isolated MVs from the supernatant of EPCs in a serum-depleted medium. BMECs were cultured alone or in the presence of EPC-MVs. BMEC viability and proliferation were evaluated with the Cell Counting Kit-8 and by flow cytometry, and the proangiogenic effect of EPC-MVs on BMECs was assessed with the transwell migration, wound healing, and tube formation assays. Our results showed that EPC-derived MVs labeled with DiI were internalized by cultured BMECs; this enhanced BMEC viability and promoted their proliferation. EPC-MVs also stimulated migration and tube formation in BMECs. These results demonstrate that EPC-derived MVs exert a proangiogenic effect on BMECs, which has potential applications in cell-free therapy for brain injury.</p>

<p>The most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a hexanucleotide expansion in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 gene (C9ORF72). This hexanucleotide expansion consists of GGGGCC (G<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub>) repeats that have been implicated to lead to three main modes of disease pathology: loss of function of the C9ORF72 protein, the generation of RNA foci, and the production of dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) through repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. Five different DPRs are currently known to be formed: glycine–alanine (GA) and glycine–arginine (GR) from the sense strand, proline–alanine (PA), and proline–arginine (PR) from the antisense strand, and glycine–proline (GP) from both strands. The exact contribution of each DPR to disease pathology is currently under intense scrutiny and is still poorly understood. However, recent advances in both neuropathological and cellular studies have provided us with clues enabling us to better understand the effect of individual DPRs on disease pathogenesis. In this review, we compile the current knowledge of specific DPR involvement on disease development and highlight recent advances, such as the impact of arginine-rich DPRs on nucleolar protein quality control, the correlation of poly-GR with neurodegeneration, and the possible involvement of chimeric DPR species. Further, we discuss recent findings regarding the mechanisms of RAN translation, its modulators, and other promising therapeutic options.</p>

<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating form of neurotrauma. Patients who carry one or two apolipoprotein E (ApoE)4 alleles show worse functional outcomes and longer hospital stays after SCI, but the cellular and molecular underpinnings for this genetic link remain poorly understood. Thus, there is a great need to generate animal models to accurately replicate the genetic determinants of outcomes after SCI to spur development of treatments that improve physical function. Here, we examined outcomes after a moderate contusion SCI of transgenic mice expressing human ApoE3 or ApoE4. ApoE4 mice have worse locomotor function and coordination after SCI. Histological examination revealed greater glial staining in ApoE4 mice after SCI associated with reduced levels of neuronal sprouting markers. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed that subcellular processes (SCPs), such as extracellular matrix organization and inflammatory responses, were highly ranked among upregulated genes at 7 days after SCI in ApoE4 variants. Conversely, SCPs related to neuronal action potential and neuron projection development were increased in ApoE3 mice at 21 days. In summary, our results reveal a clinically relevant SCI mouse model that recapitulates the influence of ApoE genotypes on post SCI function in individuals who carry these alleles and suggest that the mechanisms underlying worse recovery for ApoE4 animals involve glial activation and loss of sprouting and synaptic activity.</p>

<p>In contrast to the prenatal topographic development of sensory cortices, striatal circuit organization is slow and requires the functional maturation of cortical and thalamic excitatory inputs throughout the first postnatal month. While mechanisms regulating synapse development and plasticity are quite well described at excitatory synapses of glutamatergic neurons in the neocortex, comparatively little is known of how this translates to glutamate synapses onto GABAergic neurons in the striatum. Here we investigate excitatory striatal synapse plasticity in an in vitro system, where glutamate can be studied in isolation from dopamine and other neuromodulators. We examined pre-and post-synaptic structural and functional plasticity in GABAergic striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs), co-cultured with glutamatergic cortical neurons. After synapse formation, medium-term (24 h) TTX silencing increased the density of filopodia, and modestly decreased dendritic spine density, when assayed at 21 days in vitro (DIV). Spine reductions appeared to require residual spontaneous activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors. Conversely, chronic (14 days) TTX silencing markedly reduced spine density without any observed increase in filopodia density. Time-dependent, biphasic changes to the presynaptic marker Synapsin-1 were also observed, independent of residual spontaneous activity. Acute silencing (3 h) did not affect presynaptic markers or postsynaptic structures. To induce rapid, activity-dependent plasticity in striatal neurons, a chemical NMDA receptor-dependent “long-term potentiation (LTP)” paradigm was employed. Within 30 min, this increased spine and GluA1 cluster densities, and the percentage of spines containing GluA1 clusters, without altering the presynaptic signal. The results demonstrate that the growth and pruning of dendritic protrusions is an active process, requiring glutamate receptor activity in striatal projection neurons. Furthermore, NMDA receptor activation is sufficient to drive glutamatergic structural plasticity in SPNs, in the absence of dopamine or other neuromodulators.</p>

<p>The cellular redox state, or balance between cellular oxidation and reduction reactions, serves as a vital antioxidant defence system that is linked to all important cellular activities. Redox regulation is therefore a fundamental cellular process for aerobic organisms. Whilst oxidative stress is well described in neurodegenerative disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), other aspects of redox dysfunction and their contributions to pathophysiology are only just emerging. ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting motor neurons, with few useful treatments. Hence there is an urgent need to develop more effective therapeutics in the future. Here, we discuss the increasing evidence for redox dysregulation as an important and primary contributor to ALS pathogenesis, which is associated with multiple disease mechanisms. Understanding the connection between redox homeostasis, proteins that mediate redox regulation, and disease pathophysiology in ALS, may facilitate a better understanding of disease mechanisms, and lead to the design of better therapeutic strategies.</p>

<p>Cytochrome oxidase (CO) histochemistry has been used to reveal the cytoarchitecture of the primate brain, including blobs/puffs/patches in the striate cortex (V1), and thick, thin and pale stripes in the middle layer of the secondary visual cortex (V2). It has been suggested that CO activity is coupled with the spiking activity of neurons, implying that neurons in these CO-rich subcompartments are more active than surrounding regions. However, we have discussed possibility that CO histochemistry represents the distribution of thalamo-cortical afferent terminals that generally use vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) as their main glutamate transporter, and not the activity of cortical neurons. In this study, we systematically compared the labeling patterns observed between CO histochemistry and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for VGLUT2 from the system to microarchitecture levels in the visual cortex of squirrel monkeys. The two staining patterns bore striking similarities at all levels of the visual cortex, including the honeycomb structure of V1 layer 3Bβ (Brodmann's layer 4A), the patchy architecture in the deep layers of V1, the superficial blobs of V1, and the V2 stripes. The microarchitecture was more evident in VGLUT2 IHC, as expected. VGLUT2 protein expression that produced specific IHC labeling is thought to originate from the thalamus since the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the pulvinar complex both show high expression levels of VGLUT2 mRNA, but cortical neurons do not. These observations support our theory that the subcompartments revealed by CO histochemistry represent the distribution of thalamo-cortical afferent terminals in the primate visual cortex.</p>

<p>Transient ischemic brain injury causes massive neuronal death in the hippocampus of both humans and animals. This was accompanied by progressive atrophy of the hippocampus, brain cortex, and white matter lesions. Furthermore, it has been noted that neurodegenerative processes after an episode of ischemia-reperfusion in the brain can continue well-beyond the acute stage. Rarefaction of white matter was significantly increased in animals at 2 years following ischemia. Some rats that survived 2 years after ischemia developed severe brain atrophy with dementia. The profile of post-ischemic brain neurodegeneration shares a commonality with neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, post-ischemic brain injury is associated with the deposition of folding proteins, such as amyloid and tau protein, in the intracellular and extracellular space. Recent studies on post-ischemic brain neurodegeneration have revealed the dysregulation of Alzheimer's disease-associated genes such as amyloid protein precursor, α-secretase, β-secretase, presenilin 1, presenilin 2, and tau protein. The latest data demonstrate that Alzheimer's disease-related proteins and their genes play a key role in the development of post-ischemic brain neurodegeneration with full-blown dementia in disease types such as Alzheimer's. Ongoing interest in the study of brain ischemia has provided evidence showing that ischemia may be involved in the development of the genotype and phenotype of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that brain ischemia can be considered as a useful model for understanding the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) power reductions in the aging brain have been described by numerous previous studies. However, the underlying mechanism for the observed brain signal power reduction remains unclear. One possible cause for reduced EEG signals in elderly subjects might be the increased distance from the primary neural electrical currents on the cortex to the scalp electrodes as the result of cortical atrophies. While brain shrinkage itself reflects age-related neurological changes, the effects of changes in the distribution of electrical conductivity are often not distinguished from altered neural activity when interpreting EEG power reductions. To address this ambiguity, we employed EEG forward models to investigate whether brain shrinkage is a major factor for the signal attenuation in the aging brain. We simulated brain shrinkage in spherical and realistic brain models and found that changes in the conductor geometry cannot fully account for the EEG power reductions even when the brain was shrunk to unrealistic sizes. Our results quantify the extent of power reductions from brain shrinkage and pave the way for more accurate inferences about deficient neural activity and circuit integrity based on EEG power reductions in the aging population.</p>

<p>Prior research has suggested that measurements of brain functioning and performance on dual tasks (tasks which require simultaneous performance) are promising candidate predictors of fall risk among older adults. However, no prior study has investigated whether brain function measurements during dual task performance could improve prediction of fall risks and whether the type of subtasks used in the dual task paradigm affects the strength of the association between fall characteristics and dual task performance. In this study, 31 cognitively normal, community-dwelling older adults provided a self-reported fall profile (number of falls and fear of falling), completed a gait dual task (spell a word backward while walking on a GaitRite mat), and completed a supine dual task (rhythmic finger tapping with one hand while completing the AX continuous performance task (AX-CPT) with the other hand) during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Gait performance, AX-CPT reaction time and accuracy, finger tapping cadence, and brain functioning in finger-tapping-related and AX-CPT-related brain regions all showed declines in the dual task condition compared to the single task condition. Dual-task gait, AX-CPT and finger tapping performance, and brain functioning were all independent predictors of fall profile. No particular measurement domain stood out as being the most strongly associated measure with fall variables. Fall characteristics are determined by multiple factors; brain functioning, motor task, and cognitive task performance in challenging dual-task conditions all contribute to the risk of falling.</p>

<p>Recent neuroimaging studies have shown the possibility of cognitive impairment after pontine stroke. In this study, we aimed to use voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) to investigate changes in the cognitive function in chronic pontine stroke. Functional MRI (fMRI) and behavioral assessments of cognitive function were obtained from 56 patients with chronic pontine ischemic stroke [28 patients with left-sided pontine stroke (LP) and 28 patients with right-sided pontine stroke (RP)] and 35 matched healthy controls (HC). The one-way ANOVA test was performed for the three groups after the VMHC analysis. Results showed that there were significant decreases in the bilateral lingual gyrus (Lingual_L and Lingual_R) and the left precuneus (Precuneus_L) in patients with chronic pontine ischemic stroke compared to HCs. However, in a post-hoc multiple comparison test, this difference remained only between the HC and RP groups. Moreover, we explored the relationship between the decreased z-values in VMHC and the behavior-task scores using a Pearson's correlation test and found that both scores of short-term memory and long-term memory in the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test were positively correlated with z-values of the left lingual gyrus (Lingual_L), the right lingual gyrus (Lingual_R), and the left precuneus (Precuneus_L) in VMHC. Besides that, the z-values of Precuneus_L in VMHC were also negatively correlated with the reaction time for correct responses in the Flanker task and the spatial memory task. In conclusion, first, the lingual gyrus played an important role in verbal memory. Second, the precuneus influenced the working memory, both auditory-verbal memory and visual memory. Third, the right-sided stroke played a greater role in the results of this study. This study provides a basis for further elucidation of the characteristics and mechanisms of cognitive impairment after pontine stroke.</p>

<p>Mitochondria play a pivotal role in bioenergetics and respiratory functions, which are essential for the numerous biochemical processes underpinning cell viability. Mitochondrial morphology changes rapidly in response to external insults and changes in metabolic status via fission and fusion processes (so-called mitochondrial dynamics) that maintain mitochondrial quality and homeostasis. Damaged mitochondria are removed by a process known as mitophagy, which involves their degradation by a specific autophagosomal pathway. Over the last few years, remarkable efforts have been made to investigate the impact on the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) of various forms of mitochondrial dysfunction, such as excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dyshomeostasis, loss of ATP, and defects in mitochondrial dynamics and transport, and mitophagy. Recent research suggests that restoration of mitochondrial function by physical exercise, an antioxidant diet, or therapeutic approaches can delay the onset and slow the progression of AD. In this review, we focus on recent progress that highlights the crucial role of alterations in mitochondrial function and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of AD, emphasizing a framework of existing and potential therapeutic approaches.</p>

<p>Background: More and more elderly patients are being diagnosed with arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in this global aging society, while the treatment strategy remains controversial among these aging population. This study aimed to clarify the long-term outcomes of elderly AVMs after different management modalities.</p><p>Methods: The authors retrospectively reviewed 71 elderly AVMs (&gt;60 years) in two tertiary neurosurgery centers between 2011 and 2019. Patients were divided into four groups: conservation, microsurgery, embolization, and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The perioperative complications, short-term and long-term neurological outcomes, obliteration rates, annualized rupture risk, and mortality rates were compared among different management modalities in the ruptured and unruptured subgroups. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was employed to compare the death-free survival rates among different management modalities. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for predictors of long-term unfavorable outcomes (mRS &gt; 2).</p><p>Results: A total of 71 elderly AVMs were followed up for an average of 4.2 ± 2.3 years. Fifty-four (76.1%) presented with hemorrhage, and the preoperative annualized rupture risk was 9.4%. Among these patients, 21 cases (29.6%) received conservative treatment, 30 (42.3%) underwent microsurgical resection, 13 (18.3%) received embolization, and 7 (9.9%) underwent SRS. In the prognostic comparison, the short-term and long-term neurological outcomes were similar between conservation and intervention both in the ruptured and unruptured subgroups (ruptured: p = 0.096, p = 0.904, respectively; unruptured: p = 0.568, p = 0.306, respectively). In the ruptured subgroup, the intervention cannot reduce long-term mortality (p = 0.654) despite the significant reduction of subsequent hemorrhage than conservation (p = 0.014), and the main cause of death in the intervention group was treatment-related complications (five of seven, 71.4%). In the logistic regression analysis, higher admission mRS score (OR 3.070, 95% CI 1.559–6.043, p = 0.001) was the independent predictor of long-term unfavorable outcomes (mRS&gt;2) in the intervention group, while complete obliteration (OR 0.146, 95% CI 0.026–0.828, p = 0.030) was the protective factor.</p><p>Conclusions: The long-term outcomes of elderly AVMs after different management modalities were similar. Intervention for unruptured elderly AVMs was not recommended. For those ruptured, we should carefully weigh the risk of subsequent hemorrhage and treatment-related complications. Besides, complete obliteration should be pursued once the intervention was initiated.</p><p>Clinical Trial Registration:http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT04136860</p>

We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to search for abnormalities in the ongoing oscillatory neural activity of frail individuals without global cognitive impairment.</p><p>Methods: Fifty four older (≥70 years) and cognitively healthy (Mini-Mental State Examination ≥24) participants were classified as robust (0 criterion, n = 34) or frail (≥ 3 criteria, n = 20) following Fried's phenotype. Memory, language, attention, and executive function were assessed through well-validated neuropsychological tests. Every participant underwent a resting-state MEG and a T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan. We performed MEG power spectral analyses to compare the electrophysiological profiles of frail and robust individuals. We used an ensemble learner to investigate the ability of MEG spectral power to discriminate frail from robust participants.</p><p>Results: We identified increased relative power in the frail group in the mu (p &lt; 0.05) and sensorimotor (p &lt; 0.05) frequencies across right sensorimotor, posterior parietal, and frontal regions. The ensemble learner discriminated frail from robust participants [area under the curve = 0.73 (95% CI = 0.49–0.98)]. Frail individuals performed significantly worse in the Trail Making Test, Digit Span Test (forward), Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure, and Semantic Fluency Test.</p><p>Interpretation: Frail individuals without global cognitive impairment showed ongoing oscillatory alterations within brain regions associated with aspects of motor control, jointly to failures in executive function. Our results suggest that some physical manifestations of frailty might partly arise from failures in central structures relevant to sensorimotor and executive processing.</p>

<p>Creativity is a higher-order neurocognitive process that produces unusual and unique thoughts. Behavioral and neuroimaging studies of younger adults have revealed that creative performance is the product of dynamic and spontaneous processes involving multiple cognitive functions and interactions between large-scale brain networks, including the default mode network (DMN), fronto-parietal executive control network (ECN), and salience network (SN). In this resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) study, group independent component analysis (group-ICA) and resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) measures were applied to examine whether and how various functional connected networks of the creative brain, particularly the default-executive and cerebro-cerebellar networks, are altered with advancing age. The group-ICA approach identified 11 major brain networks across age groups that reflected age-invariant resting-state networks. Compared with older adults, younger adults exhibited more specific and widespread dorsal network and sensorimotor network connectivity within and between the DMN, fronto-parietal ECN, and visual, auditory, and cerebellar networks associated with creativity. This outcome suggests age-specific changes in the functional connected network, particularly in the default-executive and cerebro-cerebellar networks. Our connectivity data further elucidate the critical roles of the cerebellum and cerebro-cerebellar connectivity in creativity in older adults. Furthermore, our findings provide evidence supporting the default-executive coupling hypothesis of aging and novel insights into the interactions of cerebro-cerebellar networks with creative cognition in older adults, which suggest alterations in the cognitive processes of the creative aging brain.</p>

<p>Loss of white matter (WM) integrity contributes to subcortical vascular mild cognitive impairment (svMCI). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has revealed damage beyond the area of WM hyperintensity (WMH) including in normal-appearing WM (NAWM); however, the functional significance of this observation is unclear. To answer this question, in this study we investigated the relationship between microstructural changes in the WMH penumbra (WMH-P) and cognitive function in patients with svMCI by regional tract-based analysis. A total of 111 patients with svMCI and 72 patients with subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) without cognitive impairment (controls) underwent DTI and neuropsychological assessment. WMH burden was determined before computing mean values of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) within WMHs and WMH-Ps. Pearson’s partial correlations were used to assess the relationship between measurements showing significant intergroup differences and composite Z-scores representing global cognitive function. Multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to determine the best model for predicting composite Z-scores. We found that WMH burden in the genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum (GCC, BCC, and SCC respectively); bilateral anterior, superior, and posterior corona radiata; left sagittal stratum was significantly higher in the svMCI group than in the control group (p &lt; 0.05). The WMH burden of the GCC, BCC, SCC, and bilateral anterior corona radiata was negatively correlated with composite Z-scores. Among diffusion parameters showing significant differences across the 10 WM regions, mean FA values of WMH and WMH-P of the BCC were correlated with composite Z-scores in svMCI patients. The results of the multiple linear regression analysis showed that the FA of WMH-P of the BCC and WMH burden of the SCC and GCC were independent predictors of composite Z-score, with the FA of WMH-P of the BCC making the largest contribution. These findings indicate that disruption of the CC microstructure—especially the WMH-P of the BCC—may contribute to the cognitive deficits associated with SIVD.</p>

Abstract
In the hippocampus, spatial and nonspatial information are jointly represented as a neural map in which locations associated with salient features are over‐represented by increased densities of relevant place cells. Although we recently demonstrated that experience‐dependent establishment of these disproportionate maps is governed by selective stabilization of salient place cells following their conversion from non‐place cells, the underlying mechanism for pre‐established map reorganization remained to be understood. To this end, we investigated the changes in CA1 functional cellular maps imaged using two‐photon calcium imaging in mice performing a reward‐rearrangement task in virtual reality. Mice were pre‐trained on a virtual linear track with a visual landmark and a reward in two distinct locations. Then, they were re‐trained on the same track with the exception that the location of reward was shifted to match the landmark location. We found that, in contrast to de novo map formation, robust map reorganization occurred through parallel coordination of new place field formation, lateral shifting of existing place fields, and selective stabilization of place fields encoding salient locations. Our findings demonstrate that intricate interplay between multiple forms of cellular dynamics enables rapid updating of information stored in hippocampal maps.

Abstract
Hippocampal volume is a marker of brain health and is reduced with aging and neurological disease. Exercise may be effective at increasing and preserving hippocampal volume, potentially serving as a treatment for conditions associated with hippocampal atrophy (e.g., dementia). This meta‐analysis aimed to identify whether exercise training has a positive effect on hippocampal volume and how population characteristics and exercise parameters moderate this effect. Studies met the following criteria: (a) controlled trials; (b) interventions of physical exercise; (c) included at least one time‐point of hippocampal volume data before the intervention and one after; (d) assessed hippocampal volume using either manual or automated segmentation algorithms. Animal studies, voxel‐based morphometry analyses, and multi‐modal interventions (e.g., cognitive training or meditation) were excluded. The primary analysis in n = 23 interventions from 22 published studies revealed a significant positive effect of exercise on total hippocampal volume. The overall effect was significant in older samples (65 years of age or older) and in interventions that lasted over 24 weeks and had less than 150 min per week of exercise. These findings suggest that moderate amounts of exercise for interventions greater than 6 months have a positive effect on hippocampal volume including in older populations vulnerable to hippocampal atrophy.

Abstract
Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is associated with hippocampal alterations that can increase the risk of short‐term memory impairments later in life. Despite the role of hippocampal neurogenesis in learning and memory, research into the long‐lasting impact of IUGR on these processes is limited. We aimed to determine the effects of IUGR on neuronal proliferation, differentiation and morphology, and on memory function at adolescent equivalent age. At embryonic day (E) 18 (term ∼E22), placental insufficiency was induced in pregnant Wistar rats via bilateral uterine vessel ligation to generate IUGR offspring (n = 10); control offspring (n = 11) were generated via sham surgery. From postnatal day (P) 36–44, spontaneous location recognition (SLR), novel object location and recognition (NOL, NOR), and open field tests were performed. Brains were collected at P45 to assess neurogenesis (immunohistochemistry), dendritic morphology (Golgi staining), and brain‐derived neurotrophic factor expression (BDNF; Western blot analysis). In IUGR versus control rats there was no difference in object preference in the NOL or NOR, the similar and dissimilar condition of the SLR task, or in locomotion and anxiety‐like behavior in the open field. There was a significant increase in the linear density of immature neurons (DCX+) in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG), but no difference in the linear density of proliferating cells (Ki67+) in the SGZ, nor in areal density of mature neurons (NeuN+) or microglia (Iba‐1+) in the DG in IUGR rats compared to controls. Dendritic morphology of dentate granule cells did not differ between groups. Protein expression of the BDNF precursor (pro‐BDNF), but not mature BDNF, was increased in the hippocampus of IUGR compared with control rats. These findings highlight that while the long‐lasting prenatal hypoxic environment may impact brain development, it may not impact hippocampal‐dependent learning and memory in adolescence.

Abstract
Maximal aerobic capacity (MAC) has been associated with preserved neural tissue or brain maintenance (BM) in healthy older adults, including the hippocampus. Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is considered a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease. While aMCI is characterized by hippocampal deterioration, the MAC‐hippocampal relationship in these patients is not well understood. In contrast to healthy individuals, neurocognitive protective effects in neurodegenerative populations have been associated with mechanisms of cognitive reserve (CR) altering the neuropathology‐cognition relationship. We investigated the MAC‐hippocampal relationship in aMCI (n = 29) from the perspectives of BM and CR mechanistic models with structural MRI and a memory fMRI paradigm using both group‐level (higher‐fit patients vs. lower‐fit patients) and individual level (continuous correlation) approaches. While MAC was associated with smaller hippocampal volume, contradicting the BM model, higher‐fit patients demonstrated statistically significant lower correlation between hippocampal volume and memory performance compared with the lower‐fit patients, supporting the model of CR. In addition, while there was no difference in brain activity between the groups during low cognitive demand (encoding of familiar stimuli), higher MAC level was associated with increased cortical and sub‐cortical activation during increased cognitive demand (encoding of novel stimuli) and also with bilateral hippocampal activity even when controlling for hippocampal volume, suggesting for an independent effect of MAC. Our results suggest that MAC may be associated with hippocampal‐related cognitive reserve in aMCI through altering the relationship between hippocampal‐related structural deterioration and cognitive function. In addition, MAC was found to be associated with increased capacity to recruit neural resources during increased cognitive demands.

Abstract
A number of studies have reported the involvement of the ventral hippocampus (vHip) and the lateral septum (LS) in negative emotional responses. Besides these well‐documented functions, they are also thought to control feeding behavior. In particular, optogenetic and pharmacogenetic interventions to LS‐projecting vHip neurons have demonstrated that the vHip→LS neural circuit exerts an inhibition on feeding behavior. However, there have been no reports of vHip neuronal activity during feeding. Here, we focused on LS‐projecting vCA1 neurons (vCA1→LS) and monitored their activity during feeding behaviors in mice. vCA1→LS neurons were retrogradely labeled with adeno‐associated virus carrying a ratiometric Ca2+ indicator and measured compound Ca2+ dynamics by fiber photometry. We first examined vCA1→LS activity in random food‐exploring behavior and found that vCA1→LS activation seemed to coincide with food intake; however, our ability to visually confirm this during freely moving behaviors was not sufficiently reliable. We next examined vCA1→LS activity in a goal‐directed, food‐seeking lever‐press task which temporally divided the mouse state into preparatory, effort, and consummatory phases. We observed vCA1→LS activation in the postprandial period during the consummatory phase. Such timing‐ and pathway‐specific activation was not observed from pan‐vCA1 neurons. In contrast, reward omission eliminated this activity, indicating that vCA1→LS activation is contingent on the food reward. Sated mice pressed the lever significantly fewer times but still ate food; however, vCA1→LS neurons were not activated, suggesting that vCA1→LS neurons did not respond to habitual behavior. Combined, these results suggest that gastrointestinal interoception rather than food‐intake motions or external sensations are likely to coincide with vCA1→LS activity. Accordingly, we propose that vCA1→LS neurons discriminate between matched or unmatched predictive bodily states in which incoming food will satisfy an appetite. We also demonstrate that vCA1→LS neurons are activated in aversive/anxious situations in an elevated plus maze and tail suspension test. Future behavioral tests utilizing anxious conflict and food intake may reconcile the multiple functions of vCA1→LS neurons.

Abstract
Dynamic signaling between the endocrine system (ES) and the nervous system (NS) is essential for brain and body homeostasis. In particular, reciprocal interaction occurs during pregnancy and motherhood that may involve changes in some brain plasticity processes. Prolactin (PRL), a hormone with pleiotropic effects on the NS, promotes maternal behavior and has been linked to modifications in brain circuits during motherhood; however, it is unclear whether PRL may regulate synaptic plasticity. Therefore, the main aim of the present work was to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms triggered by PRL that regulate synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. By analyzing extracellular recordings in CA3‐CA1 synapses of hippocampal slices, we report that PRL modifies short and long‐term synaptic plasticity in female mice of reproductive age, but not in sexually immature females or adult males. This effect is carried out through mechanisms that include participation of GABAA receptors and activation of the JAK2‐mediated signaling pathway. These findings show for the first time how PRL enhances the synaptic strength in hippocampal circuits and that this effect is sexually dimorphic, which would influence complex brain processes in physiological conditions like pregnancy and lactation.

Abstract
We examined the role of the avian hippocampus and area parahippocampalis in serial‐order behavior and a variety of other tasks known to be sensitive to hippocampal damage in mammals. Damage to the hippocampus and area parahippocampalis caused impairments in autoshaping and performance on an analogue of a radial‐arm maze task, but had no effect on acquisition of 2‐item, 3‐item, and 4‐item serial‐order lists. Additionally, the lesions had no effect on the retention of 3‐items lists, or on the ability to perform novel derived lists composed of elements from lists they had previously learned. The impairments in autoshaping and spatial behavior are consistent with the findings in mammals. The absence of impairments on the serial‐order task may also be consistent once one considers that damage to the hippocampus in mammals seems to affect more internally‐organized rather than externally‐organized serial‐order tasks. Together, the findings support the view that the avian hippocampal complex serves a function very similar to the mammalian hippocampus, a finding that is interesting given that the architecture of the avian hippocampus differs dramatically from that of the mammalian hippocampus.

Abstract
The population of hippocampal neurons actively coding space continually changes across days as mice repeatedly perform tasks. Many hippocampal place cells become inactive while other previously silent neurons become active, challenging the idea that stable behaviors and memory representations are supported by stable patterns of neural activity. Active cell replacement may disambiguate unique episodes that contain overlapping memory cues, and could contribute to reorganization of memory representations. How active cell replacement affects the evolution of representations of different behaviors within a single task is unknown. We trained mice to perform a delayed nonmatching to place task over multiple weeks, and performed calcium imaging in area CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus using head‐mounted miniature microscopes. Cells active on the central stem of the maze “split” their calcium activity according to the animal's upcoming turn direction (left or right), the current task phase (study or test), or both task dimensions, even while spatial cues remained unchanged. We found that, among reliably active cells, different splitter neuron populations were replaced at unequal rates, resulting in an increasing number of cells modulated by turn direction and a decreasing number of cells with combined modulation by both turn direction and task phase. Despite continual reorganization, the ensemble code stably segregated these task dimensions. These results show that hippocampal memories can heterogeneously reorganize even while behavior is unchanging.

Surgical interventions in epileptic patients aimed at the removal of the epileptogenic zone have success rates at only 60-70%. This failure can be partly attributed to the insufficient spatial sampling by the implanted intracranial electrodes during the clinical evaluation, leading to an incomplete picture of spatio-temporal seizure organization in the regions that are not directly observed. Utilizing the partial observations of the seizure spreading through the brain network, complemented by the assumption that the epileptic seizures spread along the structural connections, we infer if and when are the unobserved regions recruited in the seizure. To this end we introduce a data-driven model of seizure recruitment and propagation across a weighted network, which we invert using the Bayesian inference framework. Using a leave-one-out cross-validation scheme on a cohort of 45 patients we demonstrate that the method can improve the predictions of the states of the unobserved regions compared to an empirical estimate that does not use the structural information, yet it is on the same level as the estimate that takes the structure into account. Furthermore, a comparison with the performed surgical resection and the surgery outcome indicates a link between the inferred excitable regions and the actual epileptogenic zone. The results emphasize the importance of the structural connectome in the large-scale spatio-temporal organization of epileptic seizures and introduce a novel way to integrate the patient-specific connectome and intracranial seizure recordings in a whole-brain computational model of seizure spread.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/b57wtduFEV0" width="1" />

<p>by Chen Ming, Stephanie Haro, Andrea Megela Simmons, James A. Simmons</p>

Computational models of animal biosonar seek to identify critical aspects of echo processing responsible for the superior, real-time performance of echolocating bats and dolphins in target tracking and clutter rejection. The Spectrogram Correlation and Transformation (SCAT) model replicates aspects of biosonar imaging in both species by processing wideband biosonar sounds and echoes with auditory mechanisms identified from experiments with bats. The model acquires broadband biosonar broadcasts and echoes, represents them as time-frequency spectrograms using parallel bandpass filters, translates the filtered signals into ten parallel amplitude threshold levels, and then operates on the resulting time-of-occurrence values at each frequency to estimate overall echo range delay. It uses the structure of the echo spectrum by depicting it as a series of local frequency nulls arranged regularly along the frequency axis of the spectrograms after dechirping them relative to the broadcast. Computations take place entirely on the timing of threshold-crossing events for each echo relative to threshold-events for the broadcast. Threshold-crossing times take into account amplitude-latency trading, a physiological feature absent from conventional digital signal processing. Amplitude-latency trading transposes the profile of amplitudes across frequencies into a profile of time-registrations across frequencies. Target shape is extracted from the spacing of the object’s individual acoustic reflecting points, or glints, using the mutual interference pattern of peaks and nulls in the echo spectrum. These are merged with the overall range-delay estimate to produce a delay-based reconstruction of the object’s distance as well as its glints. Clutter echoes indiscriminately activate multiple parts in the null-detecting system, which then produces the equivalent glint-delay spacings in images, thus blurring the overall echo-delay estimates by adding spurious glint delays to the image. Blurring acts as an anticorrelation process that rejects clutter intrusion into perceptions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-Fv413WZkhU" width="1" />

<p>by Junho Lee, Donggu Lee, Sean Lawler, Yangjin Kim</p>

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide and is characterized by hijacking immune system for active growth and aggressive metastasis. Neutrophils, which in their original form should establish immune activities to the tumor as a first line of defense, are undermined by tumor cells to promote tumor invasion in several ways. In this study, we investigate the mutual interactions between the tumor cells and the neutrophils that facilitate tumor invasion by developing a mathematical model that involves taxis-reaction-diffusion equations for the critical components in the interaction. These include the densities of tumor and neutrophils, and the concentrations of signaling molecules and structure such as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). We apply the mathematical model to a Boyden invasion assay used in the experiments to demonstrate that the tumor-associated neutrophils can enhance tumor cell invasion by secreting the neutrophil elastase. We show that the model can both reproduce the major experimental observation on NET-mediated cancer invasion and make several important predictions to guide future experiments with the goal of the development of new anti-tumor strategies. Moreover, using this model, we investigate the fundamental mechanism of NET-mediated invasion of cancer cells and the impact of internal and external heterogeneity on the migration patterning of tumour cells and their response to different treatment schedules.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xRo5UIhpPQA" width="1" />

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has affected over 30 million globally to date. Although high rates of venous thromboembolism and evidence of COVID-19-induced endothelial dysfunction have been reported, the precise aetiology of the increased thrombotic risk associated with COVID-19 infection remains to be fully elucidated. Therefore, we assessed clinical platelet parameters and circulating platelet activity in patients with severe and nonsevere COVID-19. An assessment of clinical blood parameters in patients with severe COVID-19 disease (requiring intensive care), patients with nonsevere disease (not requiring intensive care), general medical in-patients without COVID-19, and healthy donors was undertaken. Platelet function and activity were also assessed by secretion and specific marker analysis. We demonstrated that routine clinical blood parameters including increased mean platelet volume (MPV) and decreased platelet:neutrophil ratio are associated with disease severity in COVID-19 upon hospitalisation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Strikingly, agonist-induced ADP release was 30- to 90-fold higher in COVID-19 patients compared with hospitalised controls and circulating levels of platelet factor 4 (PF4), soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin), and thrombopoietin (TPO) were also significantly elevated in COVID-19. This study shows that distinct differences exist in routine full blood count and other clinical laboratory parameters between patients with severe and nonsevere COVID-19. Moreover, we have determined all COVID-19 patients possess hyperactive circulating platelets. These data suggest abnormal platelet reactivity may contribute to hypercoagulability in COVID-19 and confirms the role that platelets/clotting has in determining the severity of the disease and the complexity of the recovery path.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/FlVljqyi3zU" width="1" />

<p>by Michiel van Gent, Adrian Reich, Sadanandan E. Velu, Michaela U. Gack</p>

The oncogenic human herpesviruses Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) are the causative agents of multiple malignancies. A hallmark of herpesviruses is their biphasic life cycle consisting of latent and lytic infection. In this study, we identified that cellular nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), an evolutionarily conserved RNA degradation pathway, critically regulates the latent-to-lytic switch of EBV and KSHV infection. The NMD machinery suppresses EBV and KSHV Rta transactivator expression and promotes maintenance of viral latency by targeting the viral polycistronic transactivator transcripts for degradation through the recognition of features in their 3′ UTRs. Treatment with a small-molecule NMD inhibitor potently induced reactivation in a variety of EBV- and KSHV-infected cell types. In conclusion, our results identify NMD as an important host process that controls oncogenic herpesvirus reactivation, which may be targeted for the therapeutic induction of lytic reactivation and the eradication of tumor cells.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qY9ePyHwHuI" width="1" />

Abstract
Spatial navigation is a crucial everyday skill, which when impaired leads to a significant decrease in quality of life. In humans, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has provided extensive insights into the neural underpinnings of navigation skills. Whereas the hippocampus has been recognized as the prime region underpinning navigation abilities, by providing a cognitive map of the environment, imaging studies have also implicated a range of other brain regions. In this review, we provide an overview of the fMRI evidence for extrahippocampal contributions to spatial navigation. We show that the parahippocampal cortex, retrosplenial cortex, dorsal striatum, and the posterior parietal cortex provide important complementary functions, and ultimately form part of a functional network that regulates successful way‐finding behavior.

There is emerging evidence for multifarious neurological manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), but little is known regarding whether they reflect structural damage to the nervous system. Serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) is a specific biomarker of neuronal injury. We measured sNfL concentrations of 29 critically ill COVID‐19 patients, 10 critically ill non–COVID‐19 patients, and 259 healthy controls. After adjusting for neurological comorbidities and age, sNfL concentrations were higher in patients with COVID‐19 versus both comparator groups. Higher sNfL levels were associated with unfavorable short‐term outcome, indicating that neuronal injury is common and pronounced in critically ill patients. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:610–616

Objective
This study was undertaken to identify preoperative predictive factors of long‐term motor outcome in a large cohort of consecutive Parkinson disease (PD) patients with bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN‐DBS).


Methods
All consecutive PD patients who underwent bilateral STN‐DBS at the Grenoble University Hospital (France) from 1993 to 2015 were evaluated before surgery, at 1 year (short‐term), and in the long term after surgery. All available demographic variables, neuroimaging data, and clinical characteristics were collected. Preoperative predictors of long‐term motor outcome were investigated by performing survival and univariate/multivariate Cox regression analyses. Loss of motor benefit from stimulation in the long term was defined as a reduction of less than 25% in the Movement Disorder Society–sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS‐UPDRS) part III scores compared to the baseline off‐medication scores. As a secondary objective, potential predictors of short‐term motor outcome after STN‐DBS were assessed by performing univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses.


Results
In the long‐term analyses (mean follow‐up = 8.4 ± 6.26 years, median = 10 years, range = 1–17 years), 138 patients were included. Preoperative higher frontal score and off‐medication MDS‐UPDRS part III scores predicted a better long‐term motor response to stimulation, whereas the presence of vascular changes on neuroimaging predicted a worse motor outcome. In 357 patients with available 1‐year follow‐up, preoperative levodopa response, tremor dominant phenotype, baseline frontal score, and off‐medication MDS‐UPDRS part III scores predicted the short‐term motor outcome.


Interpretation
Frontal lobe dysfunction, disease severity in the off‐medication condition, and the presence of vascular changes on neuroimaging represent the main preoperative clinical predictors of long‐term motor STN‐DBS effects. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:587–597

Although seizures are common in prehospital settings, standardized emergency medical services (EMS) treatment algorithms do not exist nationally. We examined nationwide variability in status epilepticus treatment by analyzing 33 publicly available statewide EMS protocols. All adult protocols recommend intravenous benzodiazepines (midazolam, n = 33; lorazepam, n = 23; diazepam, n = 24), 30 recommend intramuscular benzodiazepines (midazolam, n = 30; lorazepam, n = 8; diazepam, n = 3), and 27 recommend intranasal benzodiazepines (midazolam, n = 27; lorazepam, n = 3); pediatric protocols also frequently recommend rectal diazepam (n = 14). Recommended dosages vary widely, and first‐ and second‐line agents are designated in only 18 and 2 states, respectively. Given this degree of variability, standardized national EMS guidelines are needed. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:604–609

We diagnosed 11 Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) cases among 71,904 COVID patients attended at 61 Spanish emergency departments (EDs) during the 2‐month pandemic peak. The relative frequency of GBS among ED patients was higher in COVID (0.15‰) than non‐COVID (0.02‰) patients (odds ratio [OR] = 6.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.18–12.5), as was the standardized incidence (9.44 and 0.69 cases/100,000 inhabitant‐years, respectively, OR = 13.5, 95% CI = 9.87–18.4). Regarding clinical characteristics, olfactory–gustatory disorders were more frequent in COVID‐GBS than non‐COVID–GBS (OR = 27.59, 95% CI = 1.296–587) and COVID–non‐GBS (OR = 7.875, 95% CI = 1.587–39.09) patients. Although COVID‐GBS patients were more frequently admitted to intensive care, mortality was not increased versus control groups.

Objective
We aimed to characterize the phenotypic spectrum and functional consequences associated with variants in the gene GABRB2, coding for the γ‐aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor subunit β2.


Methods
We recruited and systematically evaluated 25 individuals with variants in GABRB2, 17 of whom are newly described and 8 previously reported with additional clinical data. Functional analysis was performed using a Xenopus laevis oocyte model system.


Results
Our cohort of 25 individuals from 22 families with variants in GABRB2 demonstrated a range of epilepsy phenotypes from genetic generalized epilepsy to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Fifty‐eight percent of individuals had pharmacoresistant epilepsy; response to medications targeting the GABAergic pathway was inconsistent. Developmental disability (present in 84%) ranged from mild intellectual disability to severe global disability; movement disorders (present in 44%) included choreoathetosis, dystonia, and ataxia. Disease‐associated variants cluster in the extracellular N‐terminus and transmembrane domains 1–3, with more severe phenotypes seen in association with variants in transmembrane domains 1 and 2 and the allosteric binding site between transmembrane domains 2 and 3. Functional analysis of 4 variants in transmembrane domains 1 or 2 (p.Ile246Thr, p.Pro252Leu, p.Ile288Ser, p.Val282Ala) revealed strongly reduced amplitudes of GABA‐evoked anionic currents.


Interpretation
GABRB2‐related epilepsy ranges broadly in severity from genetic generalized epilepsy to developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. Developmental disability and movement disorder are key features. The phenotypic spectrum is comparable to other GABAA receptor‐encoding genes. Phenotypic severity varies by protein domain. Experimental evidence supports loss of GABAergic inhibition as the mechanism underlying GABRB2‐associated neurodevelopmental disorders. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:573–586

Objective
Sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (sCJD) comprises several subtypes as defined by genetic and prion protein characteristics, which are associated with distinct clinical and pathological phenotypes. To date, no clinical test can reliably diagnose the subtype. We established two procedures for the antemortem diagnosis of sCJD subtype using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).


Methods
MRI of 1,458 patients referred to the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center were collected through its consultation service. One neuroradiologist blind to the diagnosis scored 12 brain regions and generated a lesion profile for each MRI scan. We selected 487 patients with autopsy‐confirmed diagnosis of “pure” sCJD subtype and at least one positive diffusion MRI examination. We designed and tested two data‐driven procedures for subtype diagnosis: the first procedure—prion subtype classification algorithm with MRI (PriSCA_MRI)—uses only MRI examinations; the second—PriSCA_MRI + Gen—includes knowledge of the prion protein codon 129 genotype, a major determinant of sCJD subtypes. Both procedures were tested on the first MRI and the last MRI follow‐up.


Results
PriSCA_MRI classified the 3 most prevalent subtypes with 82% accuracy.
PriSCA_MRI + Gen raised the accuracy to 89% and identified all subtypes.
Individually, the 2 most prevalent sCJD subtypes, MM1 and VV2, were diagnosed with sensitivities up to 95 and 97%, respectively. The performances of both procedures did not change in 168 patients with longitudinal MRI studies when the last examination was used.


Interpretation
This study provides the first practical algorithms for antemortem diagnosis of sCJD subtypes. MRI diagnosis of subtype is likely to be attainable at early disease stages to prognosticate clinical course and design future therapeutic trials. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:560–572

Objective
Gut microbiome alterations in Parkinson disease (PD) have been reported repeatedly, but their functional relevance remains unclear. Fecal metabolomics, which provide a functional readout of microbial activity, have scarcely been investigated. We investigated fecal microbiome and metabolome alterations in PD, and their clinical relevance.


Methods
Two hundred subjects (104 patients, 96 controls) underwent extensive clinical phenotyping. Stool samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Fecal metabolomics were performed using two platforms, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry.


Results
Fecal microbiome and metabolome composition in PD was significantly different from controls, with the largest effect size seen in NMR‐based metabolome. Microbiome and NMR‐based metabolome compositional differences remained significant after comprehensive confounder analyses. Differentially abundant fecal metabolite features and predicted functional changes in PD versus controls included bioactive molecules with putative neuroprotective effects (eg, short chain fatty acids [SCFAs], ubiquinones, and salicylate) and other compounds increasingly implicated in neurodegeneration (eg, ceramides, sphingosine, and trimethylamine N‐oxide). In the PD group, cognitive impairment, low body mass index (BMI), frailty, constipation, and low physical activity were associated with fecal metabolome compositional differences. Notably, low SCFAs in PD were significantly associated with poorer cognition and low BMI. Lower butyrate levels correlated with worse postural instability–gait disorder scores.


Interpretation
Gut microbial function is altered in PD, characterized by differentially abundant metabolic features that provide important biological insights into gut–brain pathophysiology. Their clinical relevance further supports a role for microbial metabolites as potential targets for the development of new biomarkers and therapies in PD. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:546–559

Objective
This study used childhood cancer survivors as a novel model to study whether children who experience central nervous system (CNS) injury are at higher risk for neurocognitive impairment associated with subsequent late onset chronic health conditions (CHCs).


Methods
Adult survivors of childhood cancer (n = 2,859, ≥10 years from diagnosis, ≥18 years old) completed a comprehensive neurocognitive battery and clinical examination. Neurocognitive impairment was defined as age‐adjusted z score &lt; 10th percentile. Participants impaired on ≥3 tests had global impairment. CHCs were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.3 (grade 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe/disabling; 4, life‐threatening) and were combined into a severity/burden score by frequency and grade (none/low, medium, high, and very high). A total of 1,598 survivors received CNS‐directed therapy including cranial radiation, intrathecal methotrexate, or neurosurgery. Logistic regression estimated the odds of neurocognitive impairment associated with severity/burden score and grade 2 to 4 conditions, stratified by CNS treatment.


Results
CNS‐treated survivors performed worse than non–CNS‐treated survivors on all neurocognitive tests and were more likely to have global neurocognitive impairment (46.9% vs 35.3%, p &lt; 0.001). After adjusting for demographic and treatment factors, there was a dose–response association between severity/burden score and global neurocognitive impairment, but only among CNS‐treated survivors (high odds ratio [OR] = 2.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.42–3.53; very high OR = 4.07, 95% CI = 2.30–7.17). Cardiovascular and pulmonary conditions were associated with processing speed, executive function, and memory impairments in CNS‐treated but not non–CNS‐treated survivors who were impacted by neurologic conditions.


Interpretation
Reduced cognitive/brain reserve associated with CNS‐directed therapy during childhood may make survivors vulnerable to adverse cognitive effects of cardiopulmonary conditions during adulthood. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:534–545

Objective
The objective of this study was to describe clinical features, [18F]‐fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)‐positron emission tomography (PET) metabolism and digital pathology in patients with logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA) and pathologic diagnosis of diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD) and compare to patients with LPA with other pathologies, as well as patients with classical features of probable dementia with Lewy bodies (pDLB).


Methods
This is a clinicopathologic case‐control study of 45 patients, including 20 prospectively recruited patients with LPA among whom 6 were diagnosed with LPA‐DLBD. We analyzed clinical features and compared FDG‐PET metabolism in LPA‐DLBD to an independent group of patients with clinical pDLB and regional α‐synuclein burden on digital pathology to a second independent group of autopsied patients with DLBD pathology and antemortem pDLB (DLB‐DLBD).


Results
All patients with LPA‐DLBD were men. Neurological, speech, and neuropsychological characteristics were similar across LPA‐DLBD, LPA‐Alzheimer's disease (LPA‐AD), and LPA‐frontotemporal lobar degeneration (LPA‐FTLD). Genetic screening of AD, DLBD, and FTLD linked genes were negative with the exception of APOE ε4 allele present in 83% of LPA‐DLBD patients. Seventy‐five percent of the patients with LPA‐DLBD showed a parietal‐dominant pattern of hy pometabolism; LPA‐FTLD – temporal‐dominant pattern, whereas LPA‐AD showed heterogeneous patterns of hypometabolism. LPA‐DLBD had more asymmetrical hypometabolism affecting frontal lobes, with relatively spared occipital lobe in the nondominantly affected hemisphere, compared to pDLB. LPA‐DLBD had minimal atrophy on gross brain examination, higher cortical Lewy body counts, and higher α‐synuclein burden in the middle frontal and inferior parietal cortices compared to DLB‐DLBD.


Interpretation
Whereas AD is the most frequent underlying pathology of LPA, DLBD can also be present and may contribute to the LPA phenotype possibly due to α‐synuclein‐associated functional impairment of the dominant parietal lobe. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:520–533

Objective
Whether the time from intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) to endovascular treatment (EVT) in patients with acute ischemic stroke has an effect on the functional outcome is unknown.


Methods
The Endovascular Treatment in Ischemic Stroke (ETIS) registry is an ongoing, prospective, multicenter, observational study that perform EVT in France. Data were analyzed from patients treated by IVT and EVT between October 2013 and December 2018 in 6 comprehensive stroke centers. In the primary analysis, we assessed the association of time from IVT administration to start of EVT with functional outcome (measured with the modified Rankin Scale [mRS]), by means of ordinal logistic regression. Secondary end points included angiographic and safety outcomes.


Results
We analyzed 1,986 patients with acute ischemic stroke due to anterior circulation large vessel occlusion who underwent IVT and EVT. An increased IVT to start of EVT time was associated with a worse functional outcome at 90 days (mRS = 0–2, adjusted odds ratio [OR] per 30 minutes increase in time = 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.86–0.96; mRS = 0–1, adjusted OR per 30 minutes increase in time = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.84–0.94), a lower chance of modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) grade 2b to 3 reperfusion (adjusted OR per 30 minutes increase in time = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.87–0.98), and an increased probability of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (adjusted OR per 30 minutes increase in time = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.99–1.18).


Interpretation
These findings provide a basis for further studies to determine if the functional outcome of patients with stroke can be greatly improved by optimizing IVT to EVT times. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:511–519

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) depends on precise delivery of electrical current to target tissues. However, the specific brain structures responsible for best outcome are still debated. We applied probabilistic stimulation mapping to a retrospective, multidisorder DBS dataset assembled over 15 years at our institution (ntotal = 482 patients; nParkinson disease = 303; ndystonia = 64; ntremor = 39; ntreatment‐resistant depression/anorexia nervosa = 76) to identify the neuroanatomical substrates of optimal clinical response. Using high‐resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging and activation volume modeling, probabilistic stimulation maps (PSMs) that delineated areas of above‐mean and below‐mean response for each patient cohort were generated and defined in terms of their relationships with surrounding anatomical structures. Our results show that overlap between PSMs and individual patients' activation volumes can serve as a guide to predict clinical outcomes, but that this is not the sole determinant of response. In the future, individualized models that incorporate advancements in mapping techniques with patient‐specific clinical variables will likely contribute to the optimization of DBS target selection and improved outcomes for patients.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25974?af=R">Iron Heterogeneity in Early Active Multiple Sclerosis Lesions</a></h4>

Objective
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a heterogeneous inflammatory demyelinating disease. Iron distribution is altered in MS patients' brains, suggesting iron liberation within active lesions amplifies demyelination and neurodegeneration. Whether the amount and distribution of iron are similar or different among different MS immunopatterns is currently unknown.


Methods
We used synchrotron X‐ray fluorescence imaging, histology, and immunohistochemistry to compare the iron quantity and distribution between immunopattern II and III early active MS lesions. We analyzed archival autopsy and biopsy tissue from 21 MS patients.


Results
Immunopattern II early active lesions contain 64% more iron (95% confidence interval [CI] = 17–127%, p = 0.004) than immunopattern III lesions, and 30% more iron than the surrounding periplaque white matter (95% CI = 3–64%, p = 0.03). Iron in immunopattern III lesions is 28% lower than in the periplaque white matter (95% CI = −40 to −14%, p &lt; 0.001). When normalizing the iron content of early active lesions to that of surrounding periplaque white matter, the ratio is significantly higher in immunopattern II (p &lt; 0.001). Microfocused X‐ray fluorescence imaging shows that iron in immunopattern II lesions localizes to macrophages, whereas macrophages in immunopattern III lesions contain little iron.


Interpretation
Iron distribution and content are heterogeneous in early active MS lesions. Iron accumulates in macrophages in immunopattern II, but not immunopattern III lesions. This heterogeneity in the two most common MS immunopatterns may be explained by different macrophage polarization, origin, or different demyelination mechanisms, and paves the way for developing new or using existing iron‐sensitive magnetic resonance imaging techniques to differentiate among immunopatterns in the general nonbiopsied MS patient population.

Objective
The study was undertaken to identify a monogenic cause of early onset, generalized dystonia.


Methods
Methods consisted of genome‐wide linkage analysis, exome and Sanger sequencing, clinical neurological examination, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and protein expression studies in skin fibroblasts from patients.


Results
We identified a heterozygous variant, c.388G&gt;A, p.Gly130Arg, in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 2 (EIF2AK2) gene, segregating with early onset isolated generalized dystonia in 5 patients of a Taiwanese family. EIF2AK2 sequencing in 191 unrelated patients with unexplained dystonia yielded 2 unrelated Caucasian patients with an identical heterozygous c.388G&gt;A, p.Gly130Arg variant, occurring de novo in one case, another patient carrying a different heterozygous variant, c.413G&gt;C, p.Gly138Ala, and one last patient, born from consanguineous parents, carrying a third, homozygous variant c.95A&gt;C, p.Asn32Thr. These 3 missense variants are absent from gnomAD, and are located in functional domains of the encoded protein. In 3 patients, additional neurological manifestations were present, including intellectual disability and spasticity. EIF2AK2 encodes a kinase (protein kinase R [PKR]) that phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α), which orchestrates the cellular stress response. Our expression studies showed abnormally enhanced activation of the cellular stress response, monitored by PKR‐mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α, in fibroblasts from patients with EIF2AK2 variants. Intriguingly, PKR can also be regulated by PRKRA (protein interferon‐inducible double‐stranded RNA‐dependent protein kinase activator A), the product of another gene causing monogenic dystonia.


Interpretation
We identified EIF2AK2 variants implicated in early onset generalized dystonia, which can be dominantly or recessively inherited, or occur de novo. Our findings provide direct evidence for a key role of a dysfunctional eIF2α pathway in the pathogenesis of dystonia. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:485–497

Objective
Outcome prognostication unbiased by early care limitations (ECL) is essential for guiding treatment in patients presenting with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The aim of this study was to determine whether the max‐ICH (maximally treated ICH) Score provides improved and clinically useful prognostic estimation of functional long‐term outcomes after ICH.


Methods
This multicenter validation study compared the prognostication of the max‐ICH Score versus the ICH Score regarding diagnostic accuracy (discrimination and calibration) and clinical utility using decision curve analysis. We performed a joint investigation of individual participant data of consecutive spontaneous ICH patients (n = 4,677) from 2 retrospective German‐wide studies (RETRACE I + II; anticoagulation‐associated ICH only) conducted at 22 participating centers, one German prospective single‐center study (UKER‐ICH; nonanticoagulation‐associated ICH only), and 1 US‐based prospective longitudinal single‐center study (MGH; both anticoagulation‐ and nonanticoagulation‐associated ICH), treated between January 2006 and December 2015.


Results
Of 4,677 included ICH patients, 1,017 (21.7%) were affected by ECL (German cohort: 15.6% [440 of 2,377]; MGH: 31.0% [577 of 1,283]). Validation of long‐term functional outcome prognostication by the max‐ICH Score provided good and superior discrimination in patients without ECL compared with the ICH Score (area under the receiver operating curve [AUROC], German cohort: 0.81 [0.78–0.83] vs 0.74 [0.72–0.77], p &lt; 0.01; MGH: 0.85 [0.81–0.89] vs 0.78 [0.74–0.82], p &lt; 0.01), and for the entire cohort (AUROC, German cohort: 0.84 [0.82–0.86] vs 0.80 [0.77–0.82], p &lt; 0.01; MGH: 0.83 [0.81–0.85] vs 0.77 [0.75–0.79], p &lt; 0.01). Both scores showed no evidence of poor calibration. The clinical utility investigated by decision curve analysis showed, at high threshold probabilities (0.8, aiming to avoid false‐positive poor outcome attribution), that the max‐ICH Score provided a clinical net benefit compared with the ICH Score (14.1 vs 2.1 net predicted poor outcomes per 100 patients).


Interpretation
The max‐ICH Score provides valid and improved prognostication of functional outcome after ICH. The associated clinical net benefit in minimizing false poor outcome attribution might potentially prevent unwarranted care limitations in patients with ICH. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:474–484

Objective
The purpose of this study was to investigate the significance of circulating micro RNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS).


Methods
We prospectively recruited 3 independent cohorts of patients with RCVS and age‐matched and sex‐matched controls in a single medical center. Next‐generation small RNA sequencing followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify and validate differentially expressed miRNAs, which was cross‐validated in migraine patients in ictal stage or interictal stage. Computational analysis was used to predict the target genes of miRNAs, followed by in vitro functional analysis.


Results
We identified a panel of miRNAs including miR‐130a‐3p, miR‐130b‐3p, let‐7a‐5p, let‐7b‐5p, and let‐7f‐5p that well differentiated patients with RCVS from controls (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [AUC] was 0.906, 0.890, and 0.867 in the 3 cohorts, respectively). The abundance of let‐7a‐5p, let‐7b‐5p, and let‐7f‐5p, but not miR‐130a‐3p nor miR‐130b‐3p, was significantly higher in patients with ictal migraine compared with that of controls and patients with interictal migraine. Target prediction and pathway enrichment analysis suggested that the transforming growth factor‐β signaling pathway and endothelin‐1 responsible for vasomotor control might link these miRNAs to RCVS pathogenesis, which was confirmed in vitro by transfecting miRNAs mimics or incubating the patients’ cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 3 different vascular endothelial cells. Moreover, miR‐130a‐3p was associated with imaging‐proven disruption of the blood‐brain barrier (BBB) in patients with RCVS and its overexpression led to reduced transendothelial electrical resistance (ie, increased permeability) in in vitro human BBB model.


Interpretation
We identified the circulating miRNA signatures associated with RCVS, which may be functionally linked to its headache, BBB integrity, and vasomotor function. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:459–473

Objective
It is unclear if stopping treatment with dabigatran, a new oral anticoagulant (NOAC), induces a paradoxical rebound prothrombotic state. We investigated if short‐term (1–3 days) dabigatran cessation is associated with a higher thrombus volume than expected from a simple reversal of the anticoagulant effect.


Methods
Ten‐week‐old C57Bl/6 mice (n = 338) received one of the following oral treatments: phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS), dabigatran for 7 days with or without 1 to 4 day cessation, and aspirin in either a single dose or daily for 7 days. Some of the animals that ceased dabigatran for 1 to 3 days received single‐dose aspirin. Thereafter, we induced FeCl3‐mediated carotid thrombosis in 130 mice, after which we performed micro computed tomography thrombus imaging. The other 208 mice underwent coagulation assays or platelet function tests. As an explorative pilot study, we reviewed the medical records of 18 consecutive patients with NOAC cessation‐related cerebral infarction in a large acute stroke cohort.


Results
We observed a ~ 40% higher volume of carotid thrombus after dabigatran cessation at 1 to 3 days than after vehicle treatment and showed that this effect could be prevented by single‐dose aspirin pretreatment. Dabigatran cessation unduly increased platelet aggregability for 2 days after drug cessation, an effect mediated through thrombin or arachidonic acid, which effect was significantly attenuated by single‐dose aspirin pretreatment. In patients, short‐term (≤ 3 days) cessation of NOAC therapy, compared with longer‐term (≥ 5 days) cessation, tended to be associated with relatively high stroke severity.


Interpretation
We provide the first preclinical evidence that a rebound prothrombotic state follows short‐term cessation of dabigatran therapy. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:444–458

Objective
Perinatal intracranial hemorrhage (pICH) is a rare event that occurs during the fetal/neonatal period with potentially devastating neurological outcome. However, the etiology of pICH is frequently hard to depict. We investigated the role of rare genetic variations in unexplained cases of pICH.


Methods
We performed whole‐exome sequencing (WES) in fetuses and term neonates with otherwise unexplained pICH and their parents. Variant causality was determined according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria, consistency between suggested genes and phenotypes, and mode of inheritance.


Results
Twenty‐six probands (25 families) were included in the study (9 with a prenatal diagnosis and 17 with a postnatal diagnosis). Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) was the most common type of hemorrhage (n = 16, 62%), followed by subpial (n = 4, 15%), subdural (n = 4, 15%), and parenchymal (n = 2, 8%) hemorrhage. Causative/likely causative variants were found in 4 subjects from 3 of the 25 families (12%) involving genes related to the brain microenvironment (COL4A1, COL4A2, and TREX‐1). Additionally, potentially causative variants were detected in genes related to coagulation (GP1BA, F11, Von Willebrand factor [VWF], FGA, and F7; n = 4, 16%). A potential candidate gene for phenotypic expansion related to microtubular function (DNAH5) was identified in 1 case (4%). Fifty‐five percent of the variants were inherited from an asymptomatic parent. Overall, these findings showed a monogenic cause for pICH in 12% to 32% of the families.


Interpretation
Our findings reveal a clinically significant diagnostic yield of WES in apparently idiopathic pICH and support the use of WES in the evaluation of these cases. ANN NEUROL 2021

Inhibition response function in patients with Parkinson's disease was improved by a training of time estimation, not distance estimation.

Abstract
Parkinson's disease (PD) impairs various cognitive functions, including time perception. Dysfunctional time perception in PD is poorly understood, and no study has investigated the rehabilitation of time perception in patients with PD. We aimed to induce the recovery of time perception in PD patients and investigated the potential relationship between recovery and cognitive functions/domains other than time perception. Sixty patients with PD (27 females) and 20 healthy controls (10 females) were recruited. The participants underwent a feedback training protocol for 4 weeks to improve the accuracy of subjective spatial distance or time duration using a ruler or stopwatch, respectively. They participated in three tests at weekly intervals, each comprising 10 types of cognitive tasks and assessments. After duration feedback training for 1 month, performance on the Go/No‐go task, Stroop task, and impulsivity assessment improved in patients with PD, while no effect was observed after distance feedback training. Additionally, the effect of training on duration production correlated with extended reaction time and improved accuracy in the Go/No‐go and Stroop tasks. These findings suggest that time perception is functionally linked to inhibitory systems. If the feedback training protocol can modulate and maintain time perception, it may improve various cognitive/psychiatric functions in patients with PD. It may also be useful in the treatment of diseases other than PD that cause dysfunctions in temporal processing.

<p>Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by a late clinical onset of psychiatric, cognitive, and motor symptoms. Transcriptional dysregulation is an early and central disease mechanism which is accompanied by epigenetic alterations in HD. Previous studies demonstrated that targeting transcriptional changes by inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs), especially the class I HDACs, provides therapeutic effects. Yet, their exact mechanisms of action and the features of HD pathology, on which these inhibitors act remain to be elucidated. Here, using transcriptional profiling, we found that selective inhibition of HDAC1 and HDAC3 by RGFP109 alleviated transcriptional dysregulation of a number of genes, including the transcription factor genes Neurod2 and Nr4a2, and gene sets and programs, especially those that are associated to insulin-like growth factor pathway, in the striatum of R6/1 mice. RGFP109 treatment led to a modest improvement of the motor skill learning and coordination deficit on the RotaRod test, while it did not alter the locomotor and anxiety-like phenotypes in R6/1 animals. We also found, by volumetric MRI, a widespread brain atrophy in the R6/1 mice at the symptomatic disease stage, on which RGFP109 showed no significant effects. Collectively, our combined work suggests that specific HDAC1 and HDAC3 inhibition may offer benefits for alleviating the motor phenotypic deficits and transcriptional dysregulation in HD.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by extracellular amyloid β (Aβ) and intraneuronal tau protein aggregations. One risk factor for developing AD is the APOE gene coding for the apolipoprotein E protein (apoE). Humans have three versions of APOE gene: ε2, ε3, and ε4 allele. Carrying the ε4 allele is an AD risk factor while carrying the ε2 allele is protective. ApoE is a component of lipoprotein particles in the plasma at the periphery, as well as in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in the interstitial fluid (ISF) of brain parenchyma in the central nervous system (CNS). ApoE is a major lipid transporter that plays a pivotal role in the development, maintenance, and repair of the CNS, and that regulates multiple important signaling pathways. This review will focus on the critical role of apoE in AD pathogenesis and some of the currently apoE-based therapeutics developed in the treatment of AD.</p>

Objective<p>Noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation (nGVS) is often used to improve postural stability in disorders, such as neurorehabilitation montage. For the safe use of nGVS, we investigated whether arterial pressure (AP) and heart rate vary during static supine and slow whole-body tilt with random nGVS (0.4 mA, 0.1–640 Hz, gaussian distribution) in a healthy elderly population.</p>Methods<p>This study was conducted with a double-blind, sham-controlled, cross-over design. Seventeen healthy older adults were recruited. They were asked to maintain a static supine position on a bed for 10 min, and the bed was tilted up (TU) to 70 degrees within 30 s. After maintaining this position for 3 min, the bed was passively tilted down (TD) within 30 s. Real-nGVS or sham-nGVS was applied from 4 to 15 min. The time course of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and RR interval variability (RRIV) were analyzed to estimate the autonomic nervous activity.</p>Result<p>nGVS and/or time, including pre-/post-event (nGVS-start, TU, and TD), had no impact on MAP and RRIV-related parameters. Further, there was no evidence supporting the argument that nGVS induces pain, vertigo/dizziness, and uncomfortable feeling.</p>Conclusion<p>nGVS may not affect the AP and RRIV during static position and whole-body tilting or cause pain, vertigo/dizziness, and discomfort in the elderly.</p>

<p>Caretaking stability in the early life environment supports neurobehavioral development, while instability and neglect constitute adverse environments that can alter maturational processes. Research in humans suggests that different types of early life adversity (ELA) can have differential effects on caretaker relationships and later cognitive and social development; however, identifying mechanistic underpinnings will require animal models with translational validity. Two common rodent models, maternal separation (MS) and limited bedding (LB), influence the mother-infant relationship during a critical window of development. We hypothesized that these paradigms may affect the development of communication strategies on the part of the pup. Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are a care-eliciting mechanism and ethologically relevant response to stressors in the rat pup. USV emission rates and acoustic parameters change throughout early development, presenting the opportunity to define developmental milestones in USVs that would reflect neurobehavioral aberrations if disrupted. This study investigated the effects of MS or LB on the dam-pup relationship by quantifying pup USVs, maternal behavior, and the relationship between the two. First, we used a generalized additive model approach to establish typical developmental trajectories of USV acoustic properties and determine windows of change in MS or LB rearing. Additionally, we quantified maternal behaviors and the predictability of maternal care sequences using an entropy rate calculation. MS and LB each shifted the developmental trajectories of USV acoustic parameters and call types in a sex-specific manner. MS more often impacted male USVs, while LB impacted female USVs. MS dams spent more time passive nursing, and LB dams spent more time on the nest. The predictability of maternal care was associated with the rate of USV emissions exclusively in females. Taken together, findings demonstrate sex- and model-specific effects of rearing environments on a novel developmental trajectory involving the mother-infant relationship, facilitating the translation of animal ELA paradigms to assess later-life consequences.</p>

Introduction<p>Previous transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies have revealed that the activity of the primary motor cortex ipsilateral to an active hand (ipsi-M1) plays an important role in motor control. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the ipsi-M1 excitability would be influenced by goal-directed movement and laterality during unilateral finger movements.</p>Method<p>Ten healthy right-handed subjects performed four finger tapping tasks with the index finger: (1) simple tapping (Tap) task, (2) Real-word task, (3) Pseudoword task, and (4) Visually guided tapping (VT) task. In the Tap task, the subject performed self-paced simple tapping on a touch screen. In the real-word task, the subject tapped letters displayed on the screen one by one to create a Real-word (e.g., apple). Because the action had a specific purpose (i.e., creating a word), this task was considered to be goal-directed as compared to the Tap task. In the Pseudoword task, the subject tapped the letters to create a pseudoword (e.g., gdiok) in the same manner as in the Real-word task; however, the word was less meaningful. In the VT task, the subject was required to touch a series of illuminated buttons. This task was considered to be less goal-directed than the Pseudoword task. The tasks were performed with the right and left hand, and a rest condition was added as control. Single- and paired-pulse TMS were applied to the ipsi-M1 to measure corticospinal excitability and short- and long-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI and LICI) in the resting first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle.</p>Results<p>We found the smaller SICI in the ipsi-M1 during the VT task compared with the resting condition. Further, both SICI and LICI were smaller in the right than in the left M1, regardless of the task conditions.</p>Discussion<p>We found that SICI in the ipsi-M1 is smaller during visual illumination-guided finger movement than during the resting condition. Our finding provides basic data for designing a rehabilitation program that modulates the M1 ipsilateral to the moving limb, for example, for post-stroke patients with severe hemiparesis.</p>

<p>Neural markers, such as the mismatch negativity (MMN), have been used to examine the phonological underspecification of English feature contrasts using the Featurally Underspecified Lexicon (FUL) model. However, neural indices have not been examined within the approximant phoneme class, even though there is evidence suggesting processing asymmetries between liquid (e.g., /ɹ/) and glide (e.g., /w/) phonemes. The goal of this study was to determine whether glide phonemes elicit electrophysiological asymmetries related to [consonantal] underspecification when contrasted with liquid phonemes in adult English speakers. Specifically, /ɹɑ/ is categorized as [+consonantal] while /wɑ/ is not specified [i.e., (–consonantal)]. Following the FUL framework, if /w/ is less specified than /ɹ/, the former phoneme should elicit a larger MMN response than the latter phoneme. Fifteen English-speaking adults were presented with two syllables, /ɹɑ/ and /wɑ/, in an event-related potential (ERP) oddball paradigm in which both syllables served as the standard and deviant stimulus in opposite stimulus sets. Three types of analyses were used: (1) traditional mean amplitude measurements; (2) cluster-based permutation analyses; and (3) event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) analyses. The less specified /wɑ/ elicited a large MMN, while a much smaller MMN was elicited by the more specified /ɹɑ/. In the standard and deviant ERP waveforms, /wɑ/ elicited a significantly larger negative response than did /ɹɑ/. Theta activity elicited by /ɹɑ/ was significantly greater than that elicited by /wɑ/ in the 100–300 ms time window. Also, low gamma activation was significantly lower for /ɹɑ/ vs. /wɑ/ deviants over the left hemisphere, as compared to the right, in the 100–150 ms window. These outcomes suggest that the [consonantal] feature follows the underspecification predictions of FUL previously tested with the place of articulation and voicing features. Thus, this study provides new evidence for phonological underspecification. Moreover, as neural oscillation patterns have not previously been discussed in the underspecification literature, the ERSP analyses identified potential new indices of phonological underspecification.</p>

<p>Over the past decade there has been a growing interest in the development of parallel hardware systems for simulating large-scale networks of spiking neurons. Compared to other highly-parallel systems, GPU-accelerated solutions have the advantage of a relatively low cost and a great versatility, thanks also to the possibility of using the CUDA-C/C++ programming languages. NeuronGPU is a GPU library for large-scale simulations of spiking neural network models, written in the C++ and CUDA-C++ programming languages, based on a novel spike-delivery algorithm. This library includes simple LIF (leaky-integrate-and-fire) neuron models as well as several multisynapse AdEx (adaptive-exponential-integrate-and-fire) neuron models with current or conductance based synapses, different types of spike generators, tools for recording spikes, state variables and parameters, and it supports user-definable models. The numerical solution of the differential equations of the dynamics of the AdEx models is performed through a parallel implementation, written in CUDA-C++, of the fifth-order Runge-Kutta method with adaptive step-size control. In this work we evaluate the performance of this library on the simulation of a cortical microcircuit model, based on LIF neurons and current-based synapses, and on balanced networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, using AdEx or Izhikevich neuron models and conductance-based or current-based synapses. On these models, we will show that the proposed library achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of simulation time per second of biological activity. In particular, using a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU board, the full-scale cortical-microcircuit model, which includes about 77,000 neurons and 3 · 10<sup>8</sup> connections, can be simulated at a speed very close to real time, while the simulation time of a balanced network of 1,000,000 AdEx neurons with 1,000 connections per neuron was about 70 s per second of biological activity.</p>

<p>In mice, social behaviors are largely controlled by the olfactory system. Pheromone detection induces naïve virgin females to retrieve isolated pups to the nest and to be sexually receptive to males, but social experience increases the performance of both types of innate behaviors. Whether animals are intrinsically sensitive to the smell of conspecifics, or the detection of olfactory cues modulates experience for the display of social responses is currently unclear. Here, we employed mice with an olfactory-specific deletion of the G protein Gαi2, which partially eliminates sensory function in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), to show that social behavior in female mice results from interactions between intrinsic mechanisms in the vomeronasal system and experience-dependent plasticity. In pup- and sexually-naïve females, Gαi2 deletion elicited a reduction in pup retrieval behavior, but not in sexual receptivity. By contrast, experienced animals showed normal maternal behavior, but the experience-dependent increase in sexual receptivity was incomplete. Further, lower receptivity was accompanied by reduced neuronal activity in the anterior accessory olfactory bulb and the rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle. Therefore, neural mechanisms utilize intrinsic sensitivity in the mouse vomeronasal system and enable plasticity to display consistent social behavior.</p>

<p>Subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) is a major cause of vascular cognitive impairment (CI) and features extensive atrophy in the cerebral cortex. We aimed to test the hypothesis that cognitive deficits in SIVD are linked to decreased cortical thickness in specific brain regions, which may constitute neuroimaging biomarkers of CI. Sixty-seven SIVD patients without (SIVD-NC, n = 35) and with (SIVD-CI, n = 32) CI and a group of healthy controls (HCs, n = 36) underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cognitive functional assessments. FreeSurfer was used to preprocess structural MRI data and to calculate and compare cortical thickness. The correlation between cortical thickness and cognitive scores was examined in SIVD patients. Significantly altered cortical thickness in the bilateral insula, middle and inferior temporal lobes, precuneus, and medial temporal lobe (MTL) was identified among the three groups (p &lt; 0.05, Monte Carlo simulation corrected). Post hoc results showed significantly decreased thickness in the bilateral insula and temporal lobe in SIVD-NC and SIVD-CI patients compared with HCs. However, the areas with reduced cortical thickness were larger in SIVD-CI than SIVD-NC patients. SIVD-CI patients had significantly reduced thickness in the bilateral precuneus and left MTL (Bonferroni corrected) compared with SIVD-NC patients when we extracted the mean thickness for each region of interest. In SIVD patients, the thicknesses of the left MTL and bilateral precuneus were positively correlated with immediate recall in the memory test. SIVD might lead to extensive cerebral cortical atrophy, while atrophy in the MTL and precuneus might be associated with memory deficits.</p>

<p>by Gil Jorge Barros Henriques, Koichi Ito, Christoph Hauert, Michael Doebeli</p>

Evolutionary branching occurs when a population with a unimodal phenotype distribution diversifies into a multimodally distributed population consisting of two or more strains. Branching results from frequency-dependent selection, which is caused by interactions between individuals. For example, a population performing a social task may diversify into a cooperator strain and a defector strain. Branching can also occur in multi-dimensional phenotype spaces, such as when two tasks are performed simultaneously. In such cases, the strains may diverge in different directions: possible outcomes include division of labor (with each population performing one of the tasks) or the diversification into a strain that performs both tasks and another that performs neither. Here we show that the shape of the population’s phenotypic distribution plays a role in determining the direction of branching. Furthermore, we show that the shape of the distribution is, in turn, contingent on the direction of approach to the evolutionary branching point. This results in a distribution–selection feedback that is not captured in analytical models of evolutionary branching, which assume monomorphic populations. Finally, we show that this feedback can influence long-term evolutionary dynamics and promote the evolution of division of labor.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vePGOwAaJPk" width="1" />

Spectral similarity is used as a proxy for structural similarity in many tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) based metabolomics analyses such as library matching and molecular networking. Although weaknesses in the relationship between spectral similarity scores and the true structural similarities have been described, little development of alternative scores has been undertaken. Here, we introduce Spec2Vec, a novel spectral similarity score inspired by a natural language processing algorithm—Word2Vec. Spec2Vec learns fragmental relationships within a large set of spectral data to derive abstract spectral embeddings that can be used to assess spectral similarities. Using data derived from GNPS MS/MS libraries including spectra for nearly 13,000 unique molecules, we show how Spec2Vec scores correlate better with structural similarity than cosine-based scores. We demonstrate the advantages of Spec2Vec in library matching and molecular networking. Spec2Vec is computationally more scalable allowing structural analogue searches in large databases within seconds.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_ocscd6oNk0" width="1" />

<p>by Stewart Heitmann, Anton Shpak, Jamie I. Vandenberg, Adam P. Hill</p>

Contemporary accounts of the initiation of cardiac arrhythmias typically rely on after-depolarizations as the trigger for reentrant activity. The after-depolarizations are usually triggered by calcium entry or spontaneous release within the cells of the myocardium or the conduction system. Here we propose an alternative mechanism whereby arrhythmias are triggered autonomously by cardiac cells that fail to repolarize after a normal heartbeat. We investigated the proposal by representing the heart as an excitable medium of FitzHugh-Nagumo cells where a proportion of cells were capable of remaining depolarized indefinitely. As such, those cells exhibit bistable membrane dynamics. We found that heterogeneous media can tolerate a surprisingly large number of bistable cells and still support normal rhythmic activity. Yet there is a critical limit beyond which the medium is persistently arrhythmogenic. Numerical analysis revealed that the critical threshold for arrhythmogenesis depends on both the strength of the coupling between cells and the extent to which the abnormal cells resist repolarization. Moreover, arrhythmogenesis was found to emerge preferentially at tissue boundaries where cells naturally have fewer neighbors to influence their behavior. These findings may explain why atrial fibrillation typically originates from tissue boundaries such as the cuff of the pulmonary vein.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GZThKKbT5Ss" width="1" />

Sweating is a basic skin function in body temperature control. In sweat glands, salt excretion and reabsorption are regulated to avoid electrolyte imbalance. To date, the mechanism underlying such regulation is not fully understood. Corin is a transmembrane protease that activates atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a cardiac hormone essential for normal blood volume and pressure. Here, we report an unexpected role of corin in sweat glands to promote sweat and salt excretion in regulating electrolyte homeostasis. In human and mouse eccrine sweat glands, corin and ANP are expressed in the luminal epithelial cells. In corin-deficient mice on normal- and high-salt diets, sweat and salt excretion is reduced. This phenotype is associated with enhanced epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity that mediates Na<sup>+</sup> and water reabsorption. Treatment of amiloride, an ENaC inhibitor, normalizes sweat and salt excretion in corin-deficient mice. Moreover, treatment of aldosterone decreases sweat and salt excretion in wild-type (WT), but not corin-deficient, mice. These results reveal an important regulatory function of corin in eccrine sweat glands to promote sweat and salt excretion.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/sT336htC_cM" width="1" />

Calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP) and the purinergic receptor P2X3 (P2X3R) label relatively distinct populations of nociceptors in the rodent dorsal root ganglion (DRG). These two unique populations, known as the peptidergic and non‐peptidergic nociceptors, innervate different lamina of the rodent spinal dorsal horn. However, contrary to previous reports in rodent, we find that CGRP and P2X3R are highly co‐expressed in the human DRG and terminate in the same laminae (laminae 1–2) of the spinal dorsal horn. Additionally, we find that other markers such as TrpV1 and Nav1.7 are more widely expressed in human and innervate laminae 1–2 of the spinal dorsal horn. Our findings are consistent with the known polymodal nature of most primate nociceptors and indicate that sensory neurons and their central projections are different between mice and humans.







Abstract
Peripheral sensory neurons are characterized by their size, molecular profiles, and physiological responses to specific stimuli. In mouse, the peptidergic and non‐peptidergic subsets of nociceptors are distinct and innervate different lamina of the spinal dorsal horn. The unique molecular signature and neuroanatomical organization of these neurons supports a labeled line theory for certain types of nociceptive stimuli. However, long‐standing evidence supports the polymodal nature of nociceptors in many species. We have recently shown that the peptidergic marker, CGRP, and the non‐peptidergic marker, P2X3R, show largely overlapping expression at the mRNA level in human dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Herein, our aim was to assess the protein distribution of nociceptor markers, including their central projections, in the human DRG and spinal cord. Using DRGs obtained from organ donors, we observed that CGRP and P2X3R were co‐expressed by approximately 33% of human DRG neurons and TrpV1 was expressed in ~60% of human DRG neurons. In the dorsal spinal cord, CGRP, P2X3R, TrpV1, and Nav1.7 proteins stained the entirety of lamina 1–2, with only P2XR3 showing a gradient of expression. This was confirmed by measuring the size of the substantia gelatinosa using Hematoxylin and Eosin staining of adjacent sections. Our findings are consistent with the known polymodal nature of most primate nociceptors and indicate that the central projection patterns of nociceptors are different between mice and humans. Elucidating how human nociceptors connect to subsets of dorsal horn neurons will be important for understanding the physiological consequences of these species differences.

<p>Whereas, there is data to support that cuneothalamic projections predominantly reach a topographically confined volume of the rat thalamus, the ventroposterior lateral (VPL) nucleus, recent findings show that cortical neurons that process tactile inputs are widely distributed across the neocortex. Since cortical neurons project back to the thalamus, the latter observation would suggest that thalamic neurons could contain information about tactile inputs, in principle regardless of where in the thalamus they are located. Here we use a previously introduced electrotactile interface for producing sets of highly reproducible tactile afferent spatiotemporal activation patterns from the tip of digit 2 and record neurons throughout widespread parts of the thalamus of the anesthetized rat. We find that a majority of thalamic neurons, regardless of location, respond to single pulse tactile inputs and generate spike responses to such tactile stimulation patterns that can be used to identify which of the inputs that was provided, at above-chance decoding performance levels. Thalamic neurons with short response latency times, compatible with a direct tactile afferent input via the cuneate nucleus, were typically among the best decoders. Thalamic neurons with longer response latency times as a rule were also found to be able to decode the digit 2 inputs, though typically at a lower decoding performance than the thalamic neurons with presumed direct cuneate inputs. These findings provide support for that tactile information arising from any specific skin area is widely available in the thalamocortical circuitry.</p>

<p>Novelty detection is a core feature of behavioral adaptation and involves cascades of neuronal responses—from initial evaluation of the stimulus to the encoding of new representations—resulting in the behavioral ability to respond to unexpected inputs. In the past decade, a new important novelty detection feature, beta2 (~20–30 Hz) oscillations, has been described in the hippocampus (HC). However, the interactions between beta2 and the hippocampal network are unknown, as well as the role—or even the presence—of beta2 in other areas involved with novelty detection. In this work, we combined multisite local field potential (LFP) recordings with novelty-related behavioral tasks in mice to describe the oscillatory dynamics associated with novelty detection in the CA1 region of the HC, parietal cortex, and mid-prefrontal cortex. We found that transient beta2 power increases were observed only during interaction with novel contexts and objects, but not with familiar contexts and objects. Also, robust theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling was observed during the exploration of novel environments. Surprisingly, bursts of beta2 power had strong coupling with the phase of delta-range oscillations. Finally, the parietal and mid-frontal cortices had strong coherence with the HC in both theta and beta2. These results highlight the importance of beta2 oscillations in a larger hippocampal-cortical circuit, suggesting that beta2 plays a role in the mechanism for detecting and modulating behavioral adaptation to novelty.</p>

<p>This study adopted diffusion tensor imaging to detect alterations in the diffusion parameters of the white matter fiber in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and used quantitative susceptibility mapping to detect changes in magnetic susceptibility. However, whether the changes of susceptibility values due to excessive iron in the basal ganglia have correlations with the alterations of the diffusion properties of the white matter in patients with AD are still unknown. We aim to investigate the correlations among magnetic susceptibility values of the basal ganglia, diffusion indexes of the white matter, and cognitive function in patients with AD. Thirty patients with AD and nineteen healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. Diffusion indexes of the whole brain were detected using tract-based spatial statistics. The caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus were selected as regions of interest, and their magnetic susceptibility values were measured. Compared with HCs, patients with AD showed that there were significantly increased axial diffusivity (AxD) in the internal capsule, superior corona radiata (SCR), and right anterior corona radiata (ACR); increased radial diffusivity (RD) in the right anterior limb of the internal capsule, ACR, and genu of the corpus callosum (GCC); and decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the right ACR and GCC. The alterations of RD values, FA values, and susceptibility values of the right caudate nucleus in patients with AD were correlated with cognitive scores. Besides, AxD values in the right internal capsule, ACR, and SCR were positively correlated with the magnetic susceptibility values of the right caudate nucleus in patients with AD. Our findings revealed that the magnetic susceptibility of the caudate nucleus may be an MRI-based biomarker of the cognitive dysfunction of AD and abnormal excessive iron distribution in the basal ganglia had adverse effects on the diffusion properties of the white matter.</p>

<p>Early- and late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients often exhibit distinct features. We sought to compare overall white matter connectivity and evaluate the pathological factors (amyloid, tau, and vascular pathologies) that affect the disruption of connectivity in these two groups. A total of 50 early- and 38 late-onset AD patients, as well as age-matched cognitively normal participants, were enrolled and underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to construct fractional anisotropy-weighted white matter connectivity maps. [<sup>18</sup>F]-THK5351 PET, [<sup>18</sup>F]-Flutemetamol PET, and magnetic resonance imaging were used for the evaluation of tau and related astrogliosis, amyloid, and small vessel disease markers (lacunes and white matter hyperintensities). Cluster-based statistics was performed for connectivity comparisons and correlation analysis between connectivity disruption and the pathological markers. Both patient groups exhibited significantly disrupted connectivity compared to their control counterparts with distinct patterns. Only THK retention was related to connectivity disruption in early-onset AD patients, and this disruption showed correlations with most cognitive scores, while late-onset AD patients had disrupted connectivity correlated with amyloid deposition, white matter hyperintensities, and lacunes in which only a few cognitive scores showed associations. These findings suggest that the pathogenesis of connectivity disruption and its effects on cognition are distinct between EOAD and LOAD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.606557">Effects of Ocular Direct Current Stimulation on Full Field Electroretinogram</a></h4>

<p>Studies on weak current stimulation (1–2 mA) examine effects on neuronal cells for the treatment of neurological diseases, like depression. Ocular current stimulation showed positive effects on retinal nerve cells which indicate that neurodegenerative ocular diseases, e.g., glaucoma, can be treated with current stimulation of the eye. However, up to now it remains unclear which exact retinal cells can be influenced. During an ocular direct current stimulation, a significant reduction of the characteristic P50 amplitude of a pattern-reversal electroretinogram (PERG) was found for an anodal and a cathodal stimulation. This current stimulation effect could originate from the modulation of pre-ganglion cell activity or by changes in local ON and OFF responses of ganglion cells. For clarification, we investigate acute direct current stimulation effects on a full field electroretinogram (ERG), which represents the activity of pre-ganglion cells (specifically cones and bipolar cells). The ERG from 15 subjects was evaluated before (ERG 1) and during (ERG 2) an ocular direct current stimulation with 800 μA over 5 min. The current was applied through a ring rubber electrode placed around the eye and a 25 cm<sup>2</sup> rubber electrode placed at the ipsilateral temple. For ERG measurements, sintered Ag/AgCl skin-electrodes were positioned on the lower eyelid (active), the earlobe (reference), and the forehead (ground). The volunteers were stimulated in three independent sessions, each with a different current application (randomized order): cathodal polarity, anodal polarity (referred to the electrode around the eye), or sham stimulation. The changes between the two ERG measurements of the characteristic full field ERG amplitudes, a-wave, b-wave, and b′-wave (b-wave measured from zero line) were tested with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (α = 0.05). Comparing before to during the current stimulation for all applications, the ERG waves showed no effects on amplitudes or latencies. Furthermore, no significant difference between the cathodal, anodal, and sham stimulation could be found by a Friedman test. These results indicate an unlikely contribution of pre-ganglion cells to the previously reported stimulation effect on PERG signals.</p>

<p>We present a framework for the topological and semantic assembly of multiscale physiology route maps. The framework, called ApiNATOMY, consists of a knowledge representation (KR) model and a set of knowledge management (KM) tools. Using examples of ApiNATOMY route maps, we present a KR format that is suitable for the analysis and visualization by KM tools. The conceptual KR model provides a simple method for physiology experts to capture process interactions among anatomical entities. In this paper, we outline the KR model, modeling format, and the KM procedures to translate concise abstraction-based specifications into fully instantiated models of physiology processes.</p>

Background<p>Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (naMCI), and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are regarded to be at high risk of converting to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) can reflect functional deterioration while diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is capable of detecting white matter integrity. Our study aimed to investigate the structural and functional alterations to further reveal convergence and divergence among SCD, naMCI, and aMCI and how these contribute to cognitive deterioration.</p>Methods<p>We analyzed ALFF under slow-4 (0.027–0.073 Hz) and slow-5 (0.01–0.027 Hz) bands and white matter fiber integrity among normal controls (CN), SCD, naMCI, and aMCI groups. Correlation analyses were further utilized among paired DTI alteration, ALFF deterioration, and cognitive decline.</p>Results<p>For ALFF calculation, ascended ALFF values were detected in the lingual gyrus (LING) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG) within SCD and naMCI patients, respectively. Descended ALFF values were presented mainly in the LING, SFG, middle frontal gyrus, and precuneus in aMCI patients compared to CN, SCD, and naMCI groups. For DTI analyses, white matter alterations were detected within the uncinate fasciculus (UF) in aMCI patients and within the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) in naMCI patients. SCD patients presented alterations in both fasciculi. Correlation analyses revealed that the majority of these structural and functional alterations were associated with complicated cognitive decline. Besides, UF alterations were correlated with ALFF deterioration in the SFG within aMCI patients.</p>Conclusions<p>SCD shares structurally and functionally deteriorative characteristics with aMCI and naMCI, and tends to convert to either of them. Furthermore, abnormalities in white matter fibers may be the structural basis of abnormal brain activation in preclinical AD stages. Combined together, it suggests that structural and functional integration may characterize the preclinical AD progression.</p>

<p>Basic emotions such as happiness, sadness, and anger are universal, regardless of the human species, and are governed by specific brain regions. A recent report revealed that mentalizing, which is the ability to estimate other individuals’ emotional states via facial expressions, can be preserved with the help of awake surgery. However, it is still questionable whether we can maintain the ability to understand others’ emotions by preserving the positive mapping sites of intraoperative assessment. Here, we demonstrated the cortical regions related to basic emotions via awake surgery for patients with frontal glioma and investigated the usefulness of functional mapping in preserving basic emotion. Of the 56 consecutive patients with right cerebral hemispheric glioma who underwent awake surgery at our hospital, intraoperative assessment of basic emotion could be successfully performed in 22 patients with frontal glioma and were included in our study. During surgery, positive responses were found in 18 points in 12 patients (54.5%). Of these, 15 points from 11 patients were found at the cortical level, mainly the premotor and posterior part of the prefrontal cortices. Then, we focused on cortical 15 positive mappings with 40 stimulations and investigated the types of emotions that showed errors by every stimulation. There was no specific rule for the region-emotional type, which was beyond our expectations. In the postoperative acute phase, the test score of basic emotion declined in nine patients, and of these, it decreased under the cut-off value (Z-score ≤ −1.65) in three patients. Although the total score declined significantly just after surgery (p = 0.022), it recovered within 3 months postoperatively. Our study revealed that through direct electrical stimulation (DES), the premotor and posterior parts of the prefrontal cortices are related to various kinds of basic emotion, but not a single one. When the region with a positive mapping site is preserved during operation, basic emotion function might be maintained although it declines transiently after surgery.</p>

<p>Understanding and producing embedded sequences according to supra-regular grammars in language has always been considered a high-level cognitive function of human beings, named “syntax barrier” between humans and animals. However, some neurologists recently showed that macaques could be trained to produce embedded sequences involving supra-regular grammars through a well-designed experiment paradigm. Via comparing macaques and preschool children's experimental results, they claimed that human uniqueness might only lie in the speed and learning strategy resulting from the chunking mechanism. Inspired by their research, we proposed a Brain-inspired Sequence Production Spiking Neural Network (SP-SNN) to model the same production process, followed by memory and learning mechanisms of the multi-brain region cooperation. After experimental verification, we demonstrated that SP-SNN could also handle embedded sequence production tasks, striding over the “syntax barrier.” SP-SNN used Population-Coding and STDP mechanism to realize working memory, Reward-Modulated STDP mechanism for acquiring supra-regular grammars. Therefore, SP-SNN needs to simultaneously coordinate short-term plasticity (STP) and long-term plasticity (LTP) mechanisms. Besides, we found that the chunking mechanism indeed makes a difference in improving our model's robustness. As far as we know, our work is the first one toward the “syntax barrier” in the SNN field, providing the computational foundation for further study of related underlying animals' neural mechanisms in the future.</p>

<p>Given the rapid development of light weight EEG devices which we have witnessed the past decade, it is reasonable to ask to which extent neuroscience could now be taken outside the lab. In this study, we have designed an EEG paradigm well suited for deployment “in the wild.” The paradigm is tested in repeated recordings on 20 subjects, on eight different occasions (4 in the laboratory, 4 in the subject's own home). By calculating the inter subject, intra subject and inter location variance, we find that the inter location variation for this paradigm is considerably less than the inter subject variation. We believe the paradigm is representative of a large group of other relevant paradigms. This means that given the positive results in this study, we find that if a research paradigm would benefit from being performed in less controlled environments, we expect limited problems in doing so.</p>

<p>The ability to identify and avoid environmental stimuli that signal danger is essential to survival. Our understanding of how the brain encodes aversive behaviors has been primarily focused on roles for the amygdala, hippocampus (HIPP), prefrontal cortex, ventral midbrain, and ventral striatum. Relatively little attention has been paid to contributions from the dorsal striatum (DS) to aversive learning, despite its well-established role in stimulus-response learning. Here, we review studies exploring the role of DS in aversive learning, including different roles for the dorsomedial and dorsolateral striatum in Pavlovian fear conditioning as well as innate and inhibitory avoidance (IA) behaviors. We outline how future investigation might determine specific contributions from DS subregions, cell types, and connections that contribute to aversive behavior.</p>

<p>While it is well-known that pre-stroke exercise conditioning reduces the incidence of stroke and the development of comorbidities, it is unclear whether post-stroke exercise conditioning is also neuroprotective. The present study investigated whether exercise postconditioning (PostE) induced neuroprotection and elucidated the involvement of SIRT1 regulation on the ROS/ER stress pathway. Adult rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by either: (1) resting; (2) mild exercise postconditioning (MPostE); or (3) intense exercise postconditioning (IPostE). PostE was initiated 24 h after reperfusion and performed on a treadmill. At 1 and 3 days thereafter, we determined infarct volumes, neurological defects, brain edema, apoptotic cell death through measuring pro- (BAX and Caspase-3) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) proteins, and ER stress through the measurement of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), inositol-requiring 1α (IRE1α), protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), Caspase-12, and SIRT1. Proteins were measured by Western blot. ROS production was detected by flow cytometry.Compared to resting rats, both MPostE and IPostE significantly decreased brain infarct volumes and edema, neurological deficits, ROS production, and apoptotic cell death. MPostE further increased Bcl-2 expression and Bcl-2/BAX ratio as well as BAX and Caspase-3 expressions and ROS production (*p &lt; 0.05). Both PostE groups saw decreases in ER stress proteins, while MPostE demonstrated a further reduction in GRP78 (***p &lt; 0.001) and Caspase-12 (*p &lt; 0.05) expressions at 1 day and IRE1α (**p &lt; 0.01) and CHOP (*p &lt; 0.05) expressions at 3 days. Additionally, both PostE groups saw significant increases in SIRT1 expression.In this study, both mild and intense PostE levels induced neuroprotection after stroke through SIRT1 and ROS/ER stress pathway. Additionally, the results may provide a base for our future study regarding the regulation of SIRT1 on the ROS/ER stress pathway in the biochemical processes underlying post-stroke neuroprotection. The results suggest that mild exercise postconditioning might play a similar neuroprotective role as intensive exercise and could be an effective exercise strategy as well.</p>

<p>The interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) is a highly conserved limbic structure in the vertebrate brain, located in the isthmus and rhombomere 1. It is formed by various populations that migrate from different sites to the distinct domains within the IPN: the prodromal, rostral interpeduncular, and caudal interpeduncular nuclei. The aim here was to identify genes that are differentially expressed across these domains, characterizing their putative functional roles and interactions. To this end, we screened the 2,038 genes in the Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas database expressed at E18.5 and we identified 135 genes expressed within the IPN. The functional analysis of these genes highlighted an overrepresentation of gene families related to neuron development, cell morphogenesis and axon guidance. The interactome analysis within each IPN domain yielded specific networks that mainly involve members of the ephrin/Eph and Cadherin families, transcription factors and molecules related to synaptic neurotransmission. These results bring to light specific mechanisms that might participate in the formation, molecular regionalization, axon guidance and connectivity of the different IPN domains. This genoarchitectonic model of the IPN enables data on gene expression and interactions to be integrated and interpreted, providing a basis for the further study of the connectivity and function of this poorly understood nuclear complex under both normal and pathological conditions.</p>

Background<p>Accruing positron emission tomography (PET) studies have suggested that dopaminergic functioning and metabolic changes are correlated with cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Yet, the relationship between dopaminergic or cerebral metabolism and different cognitive domains in PD is poorly understood. To address this scarcity, we aimed to investigate the interactions among dopaminergic bindings, metabolic network changes, and the cognitive domains in PD patients.</p>Methods<p>We recruited 41 PD patients, including PD patients with no cognitive impairment (PD-NC; n = 21) and those with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI; n = 20). All patients underwent clinical evaluations and a schedule of neuropsychological tests and underwent both 11C-N-2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-fluorophenyl)-tropane (11C-CFT) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET imaging.</p>Results<p>11C-CFT imaging revealed a significant positive correlation between executive function and striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) binding at both the voxel and regional levels. Metabolic imaging revealed that executive function correlated with 18F-FDG uptake, mainly in inferior frontal gyrus, putamen, and insula. Further analysis indicated that striatal DAT binding correlated strictly with metabolic activity in the temporal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, and cingulate gyrus.</p>Conclusion<p>Our findings might promote the understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in PD.</p>

Abstract
While total white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been associated with hippocampal atrophy, less is known about how the regional distribution of WMH volume may differentially affect the hippocampus in healthy aging. Additionally, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers may be at an increased risk for greater WMH volumes and hippocampal atrophy in aging. The present study sought to investigate whether regional WMH volume mediates the relationship between age and hippocampal volume and if this association is moderated by APOE ε4 status in a group of 190 cognitively healthy adults (APOE ε4 status [carrier/non‐carrier] = 59/131), ages 50–89. Analyses revealed that temporal lobe WMH volume significantly mediated the relationship between age and average bilateral hippocampal volume, and this effect was moderated by APOE ε4 status (−0.020 (SE = 0.009), 95% CI, [−0.039, −0.003]). APOE ε4 carriers, but not non‐carriers, showed negative indirect effects of age on hippocampal volume through temporal lobe WMH volume (APOE ε4 carriers: −0.016 (SE = 0.007), 95% CI, [−0.030, −0.003]; APOE ε4 non‐carriers: .005 (SE = 0.006), 95% CI, [−0.006, 0.017]). These findings remained significant after additionally adjusting for sex, years of education, hypertension status and duration, cholesterol status, diabetes status, Body Mass Index, history of smoking, and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale‐IV Full Scale IQ. There were no significant moderated mediation effects for frontal, parietal, and occipital lobe WMH volumes, with or without covariates. Our findings indicate that in cognitively healthy older adults, elevated WMH volume regionally localized to the temporal lobes in APOE ε4 carriers is associated with reduced hippocampal volume, suggesting greater vulnerability to brain aging and the risk for Alzheimer's disease.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25121?af=R">Fractional anisotropy from diffusion tensor imaging correlates with acute astrocyte and myelin swelling in neonatal swine models of excitotoxic and hypoxic‐ischemic brain injury</a></h4>

In neonatal piglets with encephalopathy from excitotoxic brain injury, fractional anisotropy from diffusion tensor imaging correlates with swollen astrocytes immunophenotyped by glutamate transporter‐1 (GLT‐1) and normal neurons with perineuronal GLT‐1+ astrocyte decorations in the striatum.







Abstract
The specific cytopathology that causes abnormal fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) after neonatal hypoxia‐ischemia (HI) is not completely understood. The panoply of cell types in the brain might contribute differentially to changes in DTI metrics. Because glia are the predominant cell type in brain, we hypothesized that changes in FA and MD would signify perturbations in glial microstructure. Using a 3‐Tesla clinical scanner, we conducted in vivo DTI MRI in nine neonatal piglets at 20–96 h after excitotoxic brain injury from striatal quinolinic acid injection or global HI. FA and MD from putamen, caudate, and internal capsule in toto were correlated with astrocyte swelling, neuronal excitotoxicity, and white matter injury. Low FA correlated with more swollen astrocytes immunophenotyped by aquaporin‐4 (AQP4), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and glutamate transporter‐1 (GLT‐1). Low FA was also related to the loss of neurons with perineuronal GLT‐1+ astrocyte decorations, large myelin swellings, lower myelin density, and oligodendrocyte cell death identified by 2′,3′‐cyclic nucleotide 3′‐phosphodiesterase, bridging integrator‐1, and nuclear morphology. MD correlated with degenerating oligodendrocytes and depletion of normal GFAP+ astrocytes but not with astrocyte or myelin swelling. We conclude that FA is associated with cytotoxic edema in astrocytes and oligodendrocyte processes as well as myelin injury at the cellular level. MD can detect glial cell death and loss, but it may not discern subtle pathology in swollen astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, or myelin. This study provides a cytopathologic basis for interpreting DTI in the neonatal brain after HI.
