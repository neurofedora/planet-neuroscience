                Xie at al. show Omicron BA.5 evades vaccine-elicited neutralization most efficiently among all known SARS-CoV-2 variants. The neutralization against BA.5 remains low after 4 doses of mRNA vaccine, whereas 2 or 3 doses of vaccine plus BA.1 infection elicit high neutralization against BA.5. The results support a bivalent vaccine approach.

	<p>Objective: Drug dependence has become a major global public health problem. This study aimed to investigate the effects of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier and neurological damage in methamphetamine (MA)-dependent individuals. Methods: MA-dependent individuals (all males) were recruited and randomly divided into MA exercise group (MAE) and MA control group (MAC) by using random number table method. The MAE group underwent 12 weeks of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, and the MAC group underwent conventional detoxification. The Neurofilament light chain (NfL), S100 calcium binding protein b (S100b), and Neuron-Specific Enolase (NSE) levels in the blood of MA-dependent individuals were measured before and after the exercise intervention. Results: After the exercise intervention was implemented, the amount of change in NfL in the plasma of the MAE (1.75 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.40) group was significantly different from that of the MAC (0.60 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.21) group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01); the amount of change in NSE in the serum of the MAE [&amp;amp;minus;1.51 (&amp;amp;minus;3.99~0.31)] group was significantly different from that of the MAC [0.03 (&amp;amp;minus;1.18~1.16)] group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05); and the amount of change in S100b in the serum of the MAE [0.66 (0.40~0.95)] group was not significantly different from that of the MAC (0.60 (0.21~1.04)) group (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Conclusion: This study showed that 12 weeks of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise treatment significantly promoted the recovery of blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier and neurological damage in MA-dependent patients compared with conventional withdrawal.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">PD-L1 expression as predictor of immunotherapy eligibility in penile squamous cell carcinoma patients [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Penile cancer is a rare malignancy and potentially lethal disease with an incidence of 0,6-2,1 per 100.000. Squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) is the most commonly found penile malignancy. PD-L1 is a tumor marker that co-stimulates the receptor PD-1 to suppress T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity. Methods: This study is a retrospective cohort study with a total sampling method. The slides taken from the biopsies of seventy-six male patients from Haji Adam Malik Hospital diagnosed with penile squamous cell carcinoma who have already undergone penile biopsy were re-examined for this study, and PD-L1 levels were measured accordingly. Statistical methods were used to assess the association between PD-L1 levels and with SqCC stage. Results: A total of 76 male patients are the subjects of this study. PD-L1 positivity is identified in 25 patients with +1 intensity in 10 patients (13,2%), +2 in 7 patients (9,2) and +3 intensity in 8 patients (10,5%). There are 36 patients (47,4%) diagnosed with stage T3 SqCC, 35 patients (46,1%) with stage N2 SqCC, and 10 patients (13,2%) with stage M1 SqCC. There is significant correlation between PD-L1 expression and metastasis (p=0,022). However, there is no significant correlation between PD-L1 expression and stage N tumor (p=0,167). Conclusions: PD-L1 highly expressed in advanced stage penile SqCC (32.9%), which is associated with the high-risk clinicopathologic features and poor clinical outcomes. These findings showed a potential usage of immunotherapy in advanced penile SqCC treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A human mesenchymal spheroid prototype to replace moderate severity animal procedures in leukaemia drug testing [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Patient derived xenograft (PDX) models are regarded as gold standard preclinical models in leukaemia research, especially in testing new drug combinations where typically 45-50 mice are used per assay. 9000 animal experiments are performed annually in the UK in leukaemia research with these expensive procedures being classed as moderate severity, meaning they cause significant pain, suffering and visible distress to animal’s state. Furthermore, not all clinical leukaemia samples engraft and when they do data turnaround time can be between 6-12 months. Heavy dependence on animal models is because clinical leukaemia samples do not proliferate in vitro. Alternative cell line models though popular for drug testing are not biomimetic – they are not dependent on the microenvironment for survival, growth and treatment response and being derived from relapse samples they do not capture the molecular complexity observed at disease presentation. Here we have developed an in vitro platform to rapidly establish co-cultures of patient-derived leukaemia cells with 3D bone marrow mesenchyme spheroids, BM-MSC-spheroids.  We optimise protocols for developing MSC-spheroid leukaemia co-culture using clinical samples and deliver drug response data within a week. Using three patient samples representing distinct cytogenetics we show that patient-derived-leukaemia cells show enhanced proliferation when co-cultured with MSC-spheroids. In addition, MSC-spheroids provided improved protection against treatment. This makes our spheroids suitable to model treatment resistance – a major hurdle in current day cancer management Given this 3Rs approach is 12 months faster (in delivering clinical data), is a human cell-based biomimetic model and uses 45-50 fewer animals/drug-response assay the anticipated target end-users would include academia and pharmaceutical industry. This animal replacement prototype would facilitate clinically translatable research to be performed with greater ethical, social and financial sustainability.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The conditional effect of family resilience on family quality of life during the Covid-19 pandemic [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction This study examines how the Covid-19 economic impact and parental stress are moderated by family resilience to relate to the family quality of life (FQOL). Methods We modify the measure of FQOL, developed by Beach Center on Disability, by including only four domains (i.e., family interaction, parenting, emotional well-being, and material well-being) to adjust to our research context. Results Based on 169 participants, our CFA displays that all employed measures in the study are valid and reliable. Our regression analysis shows that there are significant direct relations of parental stress & family resilience with family quality of life. However, we find that family resilience only positively moderates the relation between the Covid-19 economic impact and family quality of life. Discussion This study presents a view on how the Covid-19 pandemic affects the way families live and hence, their quality of life.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Mechanisms of Axon Growth and Regeneration: Moving between Development and Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>Axons differ in their growth potential: whereas during development, axons rapidly grow to their targets, in the adult mammalian, CNS axons have lost their ability to grow and therefore fail to regenerate. Recent progress has enabled a better understanding of how developmental mechanisms direct axon regeneration. Focusing on neuronal polarization, where one neurite is singled out to become the axon, has uncovered the mechanisms initiating axon growth and growth restraint. This has helped to define the processes that need to be reactivated to induce axon regeneration: microtubule stabilization and actin dynamics. The molecular machinery underlying axon growth and axon regeneration is remarkably similar and includes the Rho-GTPases Cdc42, Rac-1, and RhoA, as well as the actin regulators cofilin and Myosin II. Importantly, neuron-intrinsic growth inhibitors in the adult nervous system, including the voltage-gated calcium channel subunit &alpha;22 and the presynaptic active zone protein Munc13, restrain dynamics while the components driving axon growth remain largely present. The identified molecules suggest that synaptic transmission and axon growth may be processes that exclude each other. As a result, axon regeneration may be hampered by synaptic transmission and, thus, by the maturation of the CNS. This research has led to several translational avenues to induce axon regeneration and functional recovery after spinal cord injury and stroke; these include the drugs epothilones, gabapentinoids, and baclofen. Thus, the investigation of axon growth and regeneration side by side has been instrumental to coax the regenerative potential of the CNS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cerebellar Contributions to the Basal Ganglia Influence Motor Coordination, Reward Processing, and Movement Vigor</a></h4>

              
                <p>Both the cerebellum and the basal ganglia are known for their roles in motor control and motivated behavior. These two systems have been classically considered as independent structures that coordinate their contributions to behavior via separate cortico-thalamic loops. However, recent evidence demonstrates the presence of a rich set of direct connections between these two regions. Although there is strong evidence for connections in both directions, for brevity we limit our discussion to the better-characterized connections from the cerebellum to the basal ganglia. We review two sets of such connections: disynaptic projections through the thalamus and direct monosynaptic projections to the midbrain dopaminergic nuclei, the VTA and the SNc. In each case, we review the evidence for these pathways from anatomic tracing and physiological recordings, and discuss their potential functional roles. We present evidence that the disynaptic pathway through the thalamus is involved in motor coordination, and that its dysfunction contributes to motor deficits, such as dystonia. We then discuss how cerebellar projections to the VTA and SNc influence dopamine release in the respective targets of these nuclei: the NAc and the dorsal striatum. We argue that the cerebellar projections to the VTA may play a role in reward-based learning and therefore contribute to addictive behavior, whereas the projection to the SNc may contribute to movement vigor. Finally, we speculate how these projections may explain many of the observations that indicate a role for the cerebellum in mental disorders, such as schizophrenia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Neurosurgical Functional Dissection of the Middle Precentral Gyrus during Speech Production</a></h4>

              
                <p>Classical models have traditionally focused on the left posterior inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area) as a key region for motor planning of speech production. However, converging evidence suggests that it is not critical for either speech motor planning or execution. Alternative cortical areas supporting high-level speech motor planning have yet to be defined. In this review, we focus on the precentral gyrus, whose role in speech production is often thought to be limited to lower-level articulatory muscle control. In particular, we highlight neurosurgical investigations that have shed light on a cortical region anatomically located near the midpoint of the precentral gyrus, hence called the middle precentral gyrus (midPrCG). The midPrCG is functionally located between dorsal hand and ventral orofacial cortical representations and exhibits unique sensorimotor and multisensory functions relevant for speech processing. This includes motor control of the larynx, auditory processing, as well as a role in reading and writing. Furthermore, direct electrical stimulation of midPrCG can evoke complex movements, such as vocalization, and selective injury can cause deficits in verbal fluency, such as pure apraxia of speech. Based on these findings, we propose that midPrCG is essential to phonological-motoric aspects of speech production, especially syllabic-level speech sequencing, a role traditionally ascribed to Broca's area. The midPrCG is a cortical brain area that should be included in contemporary models of speech production with a unique role in speech motor planning and execution.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Better Inference in Neuroscience: Test Less, Estimate More</a></h4>

              
                <p>Null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) has become the main tool of inference in neuroscience, and yet evidence suggests we do not use this tool well: tests are often planned poorly, conducted unfairly, and interpreted invalidly. This editorial makes the case that in addition to reforms to increase rigor we should test less, reserving NHST for clearly confirmatory contexts in which the researcher has derived a quantitative prediction, can provide the inputs needed to plan a quality test, and can specify the criteria not only for confirming their hypothesis but also for rejecting it. A reduction in testing would be accompanied by an expansion of the use of estimation [effect sizes and confidence intervals (CIs)]. Estimation is more suitable for exploratory research, provides the inputs needed to plan strong tests, and provides important contexts for properly interpreting tests.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neuroscience Needs to Test Both Statistical and Scientific Hypotheses</a></h4>

              
                <p>Experimental neuroscience typically uses "<I>p</I>-valued" statistical testing procedures (null hypothesis significance testing; NHST) in evaluating its results. The rote, often misguided, application of NHST (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B13">Gigerenzer, 2008</cross-ref>) has led to errors and "questionable research practices." Although the problems could be avoided with better statistics training (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B23">Lakens, 2021</cross-ref>), there have been calls to abandon NHST altogether. One suggestion is to replace NHST with "estimation statistics" (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B11">Cumming and Calin-Jageman, 2017</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B10">Calin-Jageman and Cumming, 2019</cross-ref>). Estimation statistics emphasizes the uncertainty inherent in scientific investigations and uses metrics, e.g., confidence intervals (CIs), that draw attention to uncertainty. Besides procedural steps and methods, the Estimation Approach prefers expressing "quantitative," rather than "qualitative" conclusions and making generalizations, rather than testing scientific hypotheses. The Estimation Approach embodies a philosophy of science&mdash;its ultimate goals, experimental mindset, and specific aims&mdash;that diverges unhelpfully from what laboratory-based neuroscience needs. The Estimation Approach meshes naturally with, e.g., clinical neuroscience, drug development, human psychology, and social sciences. It fits less well with much of the neuroscience published in the <I>Journal of Neuroscience</I>, for example. In contrast, the philosophy behind NHST fits naturally with traditional, evaluative testing of scientific hypotheses. Finally, some Estimation Approach remedies, e.g., replication, ideally with "preregistration," are incompatible with much experimental neuroscience. This Dual Perspective essay argues that, while neuroscience can benefit from practical aspects of estimation statistics, entirely replacing conventional methods with the Estimation Approach would be a mistake. NHST testing should be retained and improved.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Experimental neuroscience relies on statistical procedures to assess the meaning and importance of its research findings. Optimal scientific communication demands a common set of assumptions for expressing and evaluating results. Problems arising from misuse of conventional significance testing methods have led to a proposal to replace significance testing with an Estimation Statistics Approach. Practical elements of the Estimation Approach can usefully be incorporated into conventional methods. However, the prevailing philosophy of the Estimation Approach does not address certain important needs of much experimental neuroscience. Neuroscience should adopt beneficial elements of the Estimation Approach without giving up the advantages of significance testing.</p>

                <p>Psychedelic drugs have reemerged as tools to treat several brain disorders. Cultural attitudes toward them are changing, and scientists are once again investigating the neural mechanisms through which these drugs impact brain function. The significance of this research direction is reflected by recent work, including work presented by these authors at the 2022 meeting of the Society for Neuroscience. As of 2022, there were hundreds of clinical trials recruiting participants for testing the therapeutic effects of psychedelics. Emerging evidence suggests that psychedelic drugs may exert some of their long-lasting therapeutic effects by inducing structural and functional neural plasticity. Herein, basic and clinical research attempting to elucidate the mechanisms of these compounds is showcased. Topics covered include psychedelic receptor binding sites, effects of psychedelics on gene expression, and on dendrites, and psychedelic effects on microcircuitry and brain-wide circuits. We describe unmet clinical needs and the current state of translation to the clinic for psychedelics, as well as other unanswered basic neuroscience questions addressable with future studies.</p>

                <p>Since the discovery of conspicuously spatially tuned neurons in the hippocampal formation over 50 years ago, characterizing which, where, and how neurons encode navigationally relevant variables has been a major thrust of navigational neuroscience. While much of this effort has centered on the hippocampal formation and functionally-adjacent structures, recent work suggests that spatial codes, in some form or another, can be found throughout the brain, even in areas traditionally associated with sensation, movement, and executive function. In this review, we highlight these unexpected results, draw insights from comparison of these codes across contexts, regions, and species, and finally suggest an avenue for future work to make sense of these diverse and dynamic navigational codes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dendritic Mechanisms for In Vivo Neural Computations and Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dendrites receive the vast majority of a single neuron's inputs, and coordinate the transformation of these signals into neuronal output. <I>Ex vivo</I> and theoretical evidence has shown that dendrites possess powerful processing capabilities, yet little is known about how these mechanisms are engaged in the intact brain or how they influence circuit dynamics. New experimental and computational technologies have led to a surge in interest to unravel and harness their computational potential. This review highlights recent and emerging work that combines established and cutting-edge technologies to identify the role of dendrites in brain function. We discuss active dendritic mediation of sensory perception and learning in neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Complementing these physiological findings, we present theoretical work that provides new insights into the underlying computations of single neurons and networks by using biologically plausible implementations of dendritic processes. Finally, we present a novel brain&ndash;computer interface task, which assays somatodendritic coupling to study the mechanisms of biological credit assignment. Together, these findings present exciting progress in understanding how dendrites are critical for <I>in vivo</I> learning and behavior, and highlight how subcellular processes can contribute to our understanding of both biological and artificial neural computation.</p>

                <p>Prefrontal cortex (PFC) inhibitory microcircuits regulate the gain and timing of pyramidal neuron firing, coordinate neural ensemble interactions, and gate local and long-range neural communication to support adaptive cognition and contextually tuned behavior. Accordingly, perturbations of PFC inhibitory microcircuits are thought to underlie dysregulated cognition and behavior in numerous psychiatric diseases and relevant animal models. This review, based on a Mini-Symposium presented at the 2022 Society for Neuroscience Meeting, highlights recent studies providing novel insights into: (1) discrete medial PFC (mPFC) interneuron populations in the mouse brain; (2) mPFC interneuron connections with, and regulation of, long-range mPFC afferents; and (3) circuit-specific plasticity of mPFC interneurons. The contributions of such populations, pathways, and plasticity to rodent cognition are discussed in the context of stress, reward, motivational conflict, and genetic mutations relevant to psychiatric disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Mechanisms Mediating Sex Differences in Motivation for Reward: Cognitive Bias, Food, Gambling, and Drugs of Abuse</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sex differences in motivation for food rewards, gambling, and drugs of abuse are modulated by multiple factors, including sensory stimuli, gonadal hormones, and cognitive bias. Cues, drugs of abuse, and a high-fat diet can significantly impact neural signaling in the reward system and functioning of neural systems that regulate executive functions differentially in males and females. Additionally, sex differences in risky decision-making, cognitive bias, and motivation for food and drugs of abuse are mediated by gonadal hormones in both sexes. As neuroscientists analyze data from both sexes, it is becoming apparent that these differences are not simply mediated by hormones in females, but involve sex differences in the specific neural responses to stimuli, including both external stimuli and internal hormonal signals. Understanding sex differences in the mechanisms underlying reward-seeking behaviors and the development of substance use disorders will help uncover potential therapies and treatments that will benefit both men and women. Based on these observations, it is essential that females are included in neuroscience research.</p>

                <p>Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy holds tremendous potential for discovery in neuroscience. Much of the molecular machinery and anatomic specializations that give rise to the unique and bewildering electrochemical activity of neurons are nanoscale by design, ranging somewhere between 1 nm and 1 &mu;m. It is at this scale where most of the unknown and exciting action is and where cell biologists flock to in their dreams, but it was off limits for light microscopy until recently. While the optical principles of super-resolution microscopy are firmly established by now, the technology continues to advance rapidly in many crucial areas, enhancing its performance and reliability, and making it more accessible and user-friendly, which is sorely needed. Indeed, super-resolution microscopy techniques are nowadays widely used for visualizing immunolabeled protein distributions in fixed or living cells. However, a great potential of super-resolution microscopy for neuroscience lies in shining light on the nanoscale structures and biochemical activities in live-tissue settings, which should be developed and harnessed much more fully. In this review, we will present several vivid examples based on STED and RESOLFT super-resolution microscopy, illustrating the possibilities and challenges of nano-imaging <I>in vivo</I> to pique the interest of tech-developers and neurobiologists alike. We will cover recent technical progress that is facilitating <I>in vivo</I> applications, and share new biological insights into the nanoscale mechanisms of cellular communication between neurons and glia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Music and Brain Circuitry: Strategies for Strengthening Evidence-Based Research for Music-Based Interventions</a></h4>

              
                <p>The neuroscience of music and music-based interventions (MBIs) is a fascinating but challenging research field. While music is a ubiquitous component of every human society, MBIs may encompass listening to music, performing music, music-based movement, undergoing music education and training, or receiving treatment from music therapists. Unraveling the brain circuits activated and influenced by MBIs may help us gain better understanding of the therapeutic and educational values of MBIs by gathering strong research evidence. However, the complexity and variety of MBIs impose unique research challenges. This article reviews the recent endeavor led by the National Institutes of Health to support evidence-based research of MBIs and their impact on health and diseases. It also highlights fundamental challenges and strategies of MBI research with emphases on the utilization of animal models, human brain imaging and stimulation technologies, behavior and motion capturing tools, and computational approaches. It concludes with suggestions of basic requirements when studying MBIs and promising future directions to further strengthen evidence-based research on MBIs in connections with brain circuitry.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Music and music-based interventions (MBI) engage a wide range of brain circuits and hold promising therapeutic potentials for a variety of health conditions. Comparative studies using animal models have helped in uncovering brain circuit activities involved in rhythm perception, while human imaging, brain stimulation, and motion capture technologies have enabled neural circuit analysis underlying the effects of MBIs on motor, affective/reward, and cognitive function. Combining computational analysis, such as prediction method, with mechanistic studies in animal models and humans may unravel the complexity of MBIs and their effects on health and disease.</p>

                <p>Understanding the unique functions of different subregions of primate prefrontal cortex has been a longstanding goal in cognitive neuroscience. Yet, the anatomy and function of one of its largest subregions (the frontopolar cortex) remain enigmatic and underspecified. Our Society for Neuroscience minisymposium <I>Primate Frontopolar Cortex: From Circuits to Complex Behaviors</I> will comprise a range of new anatomic and functional approaches that have helped to clarify the basic circuit anatomy of the frontal pole, its functional involvement during performance of cognitively demanding behavioral paradigms in monkeys and humans, and its clinical potential as a target for noninvasive brain stimulation in patients with brain disorders. This review consolidates knowledge about the anatomy and connectivity of frontopolar cortex and provides an integrative summary of its function in primates. We aim to answer the question: what, if anything, does frontopolar cortex contribute to goal-directed cognition and action?</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Retrograde Axonal Autophagy and Endocytic Pathways Are Parallel and Separate in Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Autophagy and endocytic trafficking are two key pathways that regulate the composition and integrity of the neuronal proteome. Alterations in these pathways are sufficient to cause neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, defining how autophagy and endocytic pathways are organized in neurons remains a key area of investigation. These pathways share many features and converge on lysosomes for cargo degradation, but what remains unclear is the degree to which the identity of each pathway is preserved in each compartment of the neuron. Here, we elucidate the degree of intersection between autophagic and endocytic pathways in axons of primary mouse cortical neurons of both sexes. Using microfluidic chambers, we labeled newly-generated bulk endosomes and signaling endosomes in the distal axon, and systematically tracked their trajectories, molecular composition, and functional characteristics relative to autophagosomes. We find that newly-formed endosomes and autophagosomes both undergo retrograde transport in the axon, but as distinct organelle populations. Moreover, these pathways differ in their degree of acidification and association with molecular determinants of organelle maturation. These results suggest that the identity of autophagic and newly endocytosed organelles is preserved for the length of the axon. Lastly, we find that expression of a pathogenic form of &alpha;-synuclein, a protein enriched in presynaptic terminals, increases merging between autophagic and endocytic pathways. Thus, aberrant merging of these pathways may represent a mechanism contributing to neuronal dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) and related &alpha;-synucleinopathies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Autophagy and endocytic trafficking are retrograde pathways in neuronal axons that fulfill critical degradative and signaling functions. These pathways share many features and converge on lysosomes for cargo degradation, but the extent to which the identity of each pathway is preserved in axons is unclear. We find that autophagosomes and endosomes formed in the distal axon undergo retrograde transport to the soma in parallel and separate pathways. These pathways also have distinct maturation profiles along the mid-axon, further highlighting differences in the potential fate of transported cargo.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Olig2 Ablation in Immature Oligodendrocytes Does Not Enhance CNS Myelination and Remyelination</a></h4>

              
                <p>The oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage transcription factor Olig2 is expressed throughout oligodendroglial development and is essential for oligodendroglial progenitor specification and differentiation. It was previously reported that deletion of <I>Olig2</I> enhanced the maturation and myelination of immature OLs and accelerated the remyelination process. However, by analyzing multiple <I>Olig2</I> conditional KO mouse lines (male and female), we conclude that Olig2 has the opposite effect and is required for OL maturation and remyelination. We found that deletion of <I>Olig2</I> in immature OLs driven by an immature OL-expressing <I>Plp1</I> promoter resulted in defects in OL maturation and myelination, and did not enhance remyelination after demyelination. Similarly, <I>Olig2</I> deletion during premyelinating stages in immature OLs using <I>Mobp</I> or <I>Mog</I> promoter-driven Cre lines also did not enhance OL maturation in the CNS. Further, we found that Olig2 was not required for myelin maintenance in mature OLs but was critical for remyelination after lysolecithin-induced demyelinating injury. Analysis of genomic occupancy in immature and mature OLs revealed that Olig2 targets the enhancers of key myelination-related genes for OL maturation from immature OLs. Together, by leveraging multiple immature OL-expressing Cre lines, these studies indicate that Olig2 is essential for differentiation and myelination of immature OLs and myelin repair. Our findings raise fundamental questions about the previously proposed role of Olig2 in opposing OL myelination and highlight the importance of using Cre-dependent reporter(s) for lineage tracing in studying cell state progression.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Identification of the regulators that promote oligodendrocyte (OL) myelination and remyelination is important for promoting myelin repair in devastating demyelinating diseases. Olig2 is expressed throughout OL lineage development. Ablation of <I>Olig2</I> was reported to induce maturation, myelination, and remyelination from immature OLs. However, lineage-mapping analysis of <I>Olig2</I>-ablated cells was not conducted. Here, by leveraging multiple immature OL-expressing Cre lines, we observed no evidence that <I>Olig2</I> ablation promotes maturation or remyelination of immature OLs. Instead, we find that Olig2 is required for immature OL maturation, myelination, and myelin repair. These data raise fundamental questions about the proposed inhibitory role of Olig2 against OL maturation and remyelination. Our findings highlight the importance of validating genetic manipulation with cell lineage tracing in studying myelination.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Integrating Visual Information into the Auditory Cortex Promotes Sound Discrimination through Choice-Related Multisensory Integration</a></h4>

              
                <p>An increasing number of studies have shown that cross-modal interaction can occur in early sensory cortices. Yet, how neurons in sensory cortices integrate multisensory cues in perceptual tasks and to what extent this influences behavior is largely unclear. To investigate, we examined visual modulation of auditory responses in the primary auditory cortex (A1) in a two-alternative forced-choice task. During the task, male rats were required to make a behavioral choice based on the pure tone frequency (low vs high) of the self-triggered stimulus to get a water reward. The result showed that the presence of a noninformative visual cue did not uniformly influence auditory response, with frequently enhancing just one of them. Closely correlated with behavioral choice, the visual cue mainly enhanced responsiveness to the auditory cue indicating a movement direction contralateral to A1 being recorded. Operating in this fashion provided A1 neurons a superior capability to discriminate sound during multisensory trials. Concomitantly, behavioral data and decoding analysis revealed that visual cue presence could speed the process of sound discrimination. We also observed this differential multisensory integration effect in well-trained rats when tested with passive stimulation and under anesthesia, albeit to a much lesser extent. We did not see this differentially integrative effect while recording in A1 in another similar group of rats performing a free-choice task. These data suggest that auditory cortex can engage in meaningful audiovisual processing, and perceptual learning can modify its multisensory integration mechanism to meet task requirements.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In the natural environment, visual stimuli are frequently accompanied by auditory cues. Although multisensory integration has traditionally been seen as a feature of associational cortices, recent studies have shown that cross-modal inputs can also influence neuronal activity in primary sensory cortices. However, exactly how neurons in sensory cortices integrate multisensory cues to guide behavioral choice is still unclear. Here, we describe a novel model of multisensory integration used by A1 neurons to shape auditory representations when rats performed a cue-guided task. We found that a task-irrelevant visual cue could specifically enhance the response of neurons in sound guiding to the contralateral choice. This differentially integrative model facilitated sound discrimination and behavioral choice. This result indicates that task engagement can modulate multisensory integration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Theta Paradox: 4-8 Hz EEG Oscillations Reflect Both Sleep Pressure and Cognitive Control</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations characterize specific behavioral and vigilance states. The frequency of these oscillations is typically sufficient to distinguish a given state; however, theta oscillations (4&ndash;8 Hz) have instead been found in near-opposite conditions of drowsiness during sleep deprivation and alert cognitive control. While the latter has been extensively studied and is often referred to as "frontal midline theta," (fmTheta) the former has been investigated far less but is considered a marker for sleep pressure during wake. In this study we investigated to what extent theta oscillations differed during cognitive tasks and sleep deprivation. We measured high-density EEG in 18 young healthy adults (nine female) performing six tasks under three levels of sleep deprivation. We found both cognitive load and sleep deprivation increased theta power in medial prefrontal cortical areas; however, sleep deprivation caused additional increases in theta in many other, predominantly frontal, areas. The sources of sleep deprivation theta (sdTheta) were task dependent, with a visual-spatial task and short-term memory (STM) task showing the most widespread effects. Notably, theta was highest in supplementary motor areas during passive music listening, and highest in the inferior temporal cortex (responsible for object recognition) during a spatial game. Furthermore, while changes in task performance were correlated with increases in theta during sleep deprivation, this relationship was not specific to the EEG of the same task and did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. Altogether, these results suggest that both during sleep deprivation and cognition theta oscillations may preferentially occur in cortical areas not involved in ongoing behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Electroencephalographic (EEG) research in sleep has often remained separate from research in cognition. This has led to two incompatible interpretations of the function of theta brain oscillations (4&ndash;8 Hz): that they reflect local sleep events during sleep deprivation, or that they reflect cognitive processing during tasks. With this study, we found no fundamental differences between theta oscillations during cognition and theta during sleep deprivation that would suggest different functions. Instead, our results indicate that in both cases, theta oscillations are generated by cortical areas not required for ongoing behavior. Therefore, at least in humans, theta may reflect either cortical disengagement or inhibition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Integrity of Neuronal Size in the Entorhinal Cortex Is a Biological Substrate of Exceptional Cognitive Aging</a></h4>

              
                <p>Average aging is associated with a gradual decline of memory capacity. SuperAgers are humans &ge;80 years of age who show exceptional episodic memory at least as good as individuals 20&ndash;30 years their junior. This study investigated whether neuronal integrity in the entorhinal cortex (ERC), an area critical for memory and selectively vulnerable to neurofibrillary degeneration, differentiated SuperAgers from cognitively healthy younger individuals, cognitively average peers ("Normal Elderly"), and individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Postmortem sections of the ERC were stained with cresyl violet to visualize neurons and immunostained with mouse monoclonal antibody PHF-1 to visualize neurofibrillary tangles. The cross-sectional area (i.e., size) of layer II and layer III/V ERC neurons were quantified. Two-thirds of total participants were female. Unbiased stereology was used to quantitate tangles in a subgroup of SuperAgers and Normal Elderly. Linear mixed-effect models were used to determine differences across groups. Quantitative measurements found that the soma size of layer II ERC neurons in postmortem brain specimens were significantly larger in SuperAgers compared with all groups (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05)&mdash;including younger individuals 20&ndash;30 years their junior (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.005). SuperAgers had significantly fewer stereologically quantified Alzheimer's disease-related neurofibrillary tangles in layer II ERC than Normal Elderly (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05). This difference in tangle burden in layer II between SuperAgers and Normal Elderly suggests that tangle-bearing neurons may be prone to shrinkage during aging. The finding that SuperAgers show ERC layer II neurons that are substantially larger even compared with individuals 20&ndash;30 years younger is remarkable, suggesting that layer II ERC integrity is a biological substrate of exceptional memory in old age.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Average aging is associated with a gradual decline of memory. Previous research shows that an area critical for memory, the entorhinal cortex (ERC), is susceptible to the early formation of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology, even during average (or typical) trajectories of aging. The Northwestern University SuperAging Research Program studies unique individuals known as SuperAgers, individuals &ge;80 years old who show exceptional memory that is at least as good as individuals 20&ndash;30 years their junior. In this study, we show that SuperAgers harbor larger, healthier neurons in the ERC compared with their cognitively average same-aged peers, those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and &ndash; remarkably &ndash; even compared with individuals 20&ndash;30 years younger. We conclude that larger ERC neurons are a biological signature of the SuperAging trajectory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Distribution Features and Potential Effects of Serotonin in the Cerebrum of SOD1 G93A Transgenic Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Serotonin (5-HT) participates in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but its effects have not been completely clarified. Therefore, we observed the distribution features and potential effects of 5-HT in the cerebrum of G93A SOD1 transgenic (TG) and wild-type (WT) mice by fluorescence immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, ELISA, as well as motor function measurements. Both 5-HT and tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2) were mainly present in the limbic systems of the cerebrum, such as the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, nucleus accumbens, cingulate, fimbria of the hippocampus, mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, habenular nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamus nucleus, lateral hypothalamus area, dorsal raphe nucleus, and piriform cortex. TPH2 and 5-HT were expressed in cell bodies in the dorsal raphe nucleus and piriform cortex, while in other regions they were distributed as filaments and clump shapes in axons. The TPH2 distribution in the cerebrum of TG was significantly lower than that in WT in preset, onset, and progression stages. TPH2 expression in the fimbria of the hippocampus, mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, habenular nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamus nucleus and lateral hypothalamus area was increased in the onset stage and decreased in the progression stage, gradually decreased in the cingulate with disease progression and significantly decreased in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb and nucleus accumbens in the onset stage in TG. The number of mammalian achaete-scute homolog-1 in the subventricular zone (SVZ) in TG was significantly lower than that in WT, which was correlated with the TPH2 distribution. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that TPH2, mammalian achaete-scute homolog-1 and 5-HT were mainly expressed in neurons but rarely expressed in microglia or astrocytes in the piriform cortex. The relative fluorescence density of TPH2 in the cingulate region was negatively correlated with the disease severity. Our findings suggest that 5-HT plays a protective role in ALS, likely by regulating neural stem cells in the subventricular zone that might be involved in neuron development in the piriform cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Context Binding in Visual Working Memory Is Reflected in Bilateral Event-Related Potentials, But Not in Contralateral Delay Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Successful retrieval of a specific item from visual working memory (VWM) depends on the binding of that item to its unique context. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of VWM manipulating memory set homogeneity have identified an important role for the intraparietal sulcus in context binding, independent of any role in representing stimulus identity. The current study explored whether the contralateral delay activity (CDA), which is an event-related potential (ERP) component derived from posterior electrodes that tracks the amount of information held in VWM, might also be sensitive to context-binding demands. In experiment 1, human participants performed lateralized delayed recognition with memory sets containing one, three, or five items that were drawn from the same category (orientations: "homogeneous") or from different categories (orientation, color, and luminance: "heterogeneous"). Because the location and identity of the memory probe indicated the item to be retrieved, homogeneous trials placed higher context-binding demands. VWM capacity was higher in heterogeneous trials. ERPs contralateral (contra) and ipsilateral (ipsi) to the remembered stimuli were higher for homogeneous trials, but these differences were removed in the contra &ndash; ipsi subtraction that produced the CDA. In experiment 2, human participants performed lateralized delayed recall with memory sets of one or three items (homogeneous or heterogeneous). Behavior was superior for three-item heterogeneous trials than for homogeneous trials, with modeling revealing context-binding errors in the latter. Bilateral ERPs and CDA results replicated experiment 1. These results support that the CDA tracks the number of object files engaged by VWM and establish that it is not sensitive to context-binding demands.</p>

                Background: The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is used for diagnosis in inflammatory processes, including during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affecting our population. To determine the values of ESR in the evolution of patients with COVID-19 undergoing treatment at the CLAS Health Center in Nuevo Lurín. Methods: Our research applied a quantitative-observational, descriptive, and longitudinal approach. The sample consisted of 26 male and 19 female patients treated at the study site between February and June 2021, none of whom were in critical condition. To collect all the necessary information, the Capillary or Wintrobe method was used to determine the values of ESR in the evolution of the COVID-19 patients, obtaining different values for the 45 patients seen at the study site. The normal ESR value was 0 - 15mm/h for males and 0 - 20mm/h for females.  Results: The initial ESR test in patients positive for COVID-19 showed that only two cases (0.04%) had slightly elevated ESR ranges, while in the rest of the values (95.56%) remained within the normal range. Conclusions:  From the results of the capillary velocity of sedimentation method, it can be concluded that patients with COVID-19 in Peru showed no signs of inflammation within their bodies due to the virus.

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is the transfer of genes between species outside the transmission from parent to offspring. Due to their impact on the genome and biology of various species, HGTs have gained broader attention, but high-throughput methods to robustly identify them are lacking. One rapid method to identify HGT candidates is to calculate the difference in similarity between the most similar gene in closely related species and the most similar gene in distantly related species. Although metrics on similarity associated with taxonomic information can rapidly detect putative HGTs, these methods are hampered by false positives that are difficult to track. Furthermore, they do not inform on the evolutionary trajectory and events such as duplications. Hence, phylogenetic analysis is necessary to confirm HGT candidates and provide a more comprehensive view of their origin and evolutionary history. However, phylogenetic reconstruction requires several time-consuming manual steps to retrieve the homologous sequences, produce a multiple alignment, construct the phylogeny and analyze the topology to assess whether it supports the HGT hypothesis. Here, we present <i>AvP</i> which automatically performs all these steps and detects candidate HGTs within a phylogenetic framework.

Organoids have immense potential as <i>ex vivo</i> disease models for drug discovery and personalized drug screening. Dynamic changes in individual organoid morphology, number, and size can indicate important drug responses. However, these metrics are difficult and labor-intensive to obtain for high-throughput image datasets. Here, we present OrganoID, a robust image analysis platform that automatically recognizes, labels, and tracks single organoids, pixel-by-pixel, in brightfield and phase-contrast microscopy experiments. The platform was trained on images of pancreatic cancer organoids and validated on separate images of pancreatic, lung, colon, and adenoid cystic carcinoma organoids, which showed excellent agreement with manual measurements of organoid count (95%) and size (97%) without any parameter adjustments. Single-organoid tracking accuracy remained above 89% over a four-day time-lapse microscopy study. Automated single-organoid morphology analysis of a chemotherapy dose-response experiment identified strong dose effect sizes on organoid circularity, solidity, and eccentricity. OrganoID enables straightforward, detailed, and accurate image analysis to accelerate the use of organoids in high-throughput, data-intensive biomedical applications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Host circadian behaviors exert only weak selective pressure on the gut microbiome under stable conditions but are critical for recovery from antibiotic treatment</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chi Zhao, Kevin Kelly, Maria Luísa Jabbur, Marcell Paguaga, Megan Behringer, Carl Hirschie Johnson</p>

The circadian rhythms of hosts dictate an approximately 24 h transformation in the environment experienced by their gut microbiome. The consequences of this cyclic environment on the intestinal microbiota are barely understood and are likely to have medical ramifications. Can daily rhythmicity in the gut act as a selective pressure that shapes the microbial community? Moreover, given that several bacterial species have been reported to exhibit circadian rhythms themselves, we test here whether a rhythmic environment is a selective pressure that favors clock-harboring bacteria that can anticipate and prepare for consistent daily changes in the environment. We observed that the daily rhythmicity of the mouse gut environment is a stabilizing influence that facilitates microbiotal recovery from antibiotic perturbation. The composition of the microbiome recovers to pretreatment conditions when exposed to consistent daily rhythmicity, whereas in hosts whose feeding and activity patterns are temporally disrupted, microbiotal recovery is incomplete and allows potentially unhealthy opportunists to exploit the temporal disarray. Unexpectedly, we found that in the absence of antibiotic perturbation, the gut microbiome is stable to rhythmic versus disrupted feeding and activity patterns. Comparison of our results with those of other studies reveals an intriguing correlation that a stable microbiome may be resilient to one perturbation alone (e.g., disruption of the daily timing of host behavior and feeding), but not to multiple perturbations in combination. However, after a perturbation of the stable microbiome, a regular daily pattern of host behavior/feeding appears to be essential for the microbiome to recover to the original steady state. Given the inconsistency of daily rhythms in modern human life (e.g., shiftwork, social jet-lag, irregular eating habits), these results emphasize the importance of consistent daily rhythmicity to optimal health not only directly to the host, but also indirectly by preserving the host’s microbiome in the face of perturbations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Horizontal gene transfer and ecological interactions jointly control microbiome stability</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Katharine Z. Coyte, Cagla Stevenson, Christopher G. Knight, Ellie Harrison, James P. J. Hall, Michael A. Brockhurst</p>

Genes encoding resistance to stressors, such as antibiotics or environmental pollutants, are widespread across microbiomes, often encoded on mobile genetic elements. Yet, despite their prevalence, the impact of resistance genes and their mobility upon the dynamics of microbial communities remains largely unknown. Here we develop eco-evolutionary theory to explore how resistance genes alter the stability of diverse microbiomes in response to stressors. We show that adding resistance genes to a microbiome typically increases its overall stability, particularly for genes on mobile genetic elements with high transfer rates that efficiently spread resistance throughout the community. However, the impact of resistance genes upon the stability of individual taxa varies dramatically depending upon the identity of individual taxa, the mobility of the resistance gene, and the network of ecological interactions within the community. Nonmobile resistance genes can benefit susceptible taxa in cooperative communities yet damage those in competitive communities. Moreover, while the transfer of mobile resistance genes generally increases the stability of previously susceptible recipient taxa to perturbation, it can decrease the stability of the originally resistant donor taxon. We confirmed key theoretical predictions experimentally using competitive soil microcosm communities. Here the stability of a susceptible microbial community to perturbation was increased by adding mobile resistance genes encoded on conjugative plasmids but was decreased when these same genes were encoded on the chromosome. Together, these findings highlight the importance of the interplay between ecological interactions and horizontal gene transfer in driving the eco-evolutionary dynamics of diverse microbiomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Dental education during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany – cross-sectional  lecturer-side evaluation for the application of digital teaching concepts [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant restrictions on dental teaching. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the attitudes of faculty members towards digital teaching formats and the effort creating digital lectures. We hypothesized that on the lecturer side there is no difference between the various digital teaching concepts in terms of workload and effort and that there is no increase in workload and effort when switching to digital teaching concepts. Methods: All German dental faculties were invited to the online survey by an anonymous voluntary questionnaire from January to April 2021. The questionnaire consisted of 27 questions that could be answered with a visual analog scale, free text answers, or with fixed answer options. Data was analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and an exploratory data analysis (α=0.05). Results: Before the pandemic, 24.8% of the participating lecturers were using digital teaching and 64.4% had no previous experience. After the outbreak of the pandemic 100% of the dental teaching was initially held online. More than 80% of the lecturers stated that they offer online lectures (86.1%), online seminars (81.2%), and/or online bedside teaching (33.7%). 88.1% see face-to-face teaching as the preferred teaching format. The lecturers also see the greatest opportunities for interaction in the area of analog teaching and significantly worse in synchronous and asynchronous digital teaching. In the course of the pandemic, respondents' attitudes towards online teaching improved in the median of 24.0 to a median of 50.0. Conclusions: Faculty members have positively changed their attitudes towards online teaching formats over the course of the pandemic. Although they see the greatest learning success in conventional face-to-face teaching formats and the creation of digital lectures is associated with a higher effort, they want more online lessons in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Development and thermophysical analysis of binary eutectics phase change materials for solar drying application [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In the past 30–40 years, conflicts over limited conventional energy sources and the negative climate change caused by them have attracted researchers and analysts to new, clean, and green energy technologies. Thereby reducing the consumption of conventional fuel and the negative impact on the climate. The production of alternative energy in the form of thermal energy storage using phase change materials (PCMs) is one of the techniques that not only reduces the gap between the supply and demand of energy but also increases the stability of the energy supply. The tendency of PCMs to melt and solidify over a wide temperature range makes them more attractive for use in many applications. The effective and efficient storage of solar energy by PCM has the potential to significantly advance the use of renewable energy. Methods: Organic non-paraffin compound beeswax (BW) mixed with other non-paraffin compounds stearic acid (SA), Palmitic acid (PA), Myristic acid (MA), and Lauric acid (LA) in different compositions with the help of magnetic stirrer at 50–60°C for 3–4 hours to prepare BWSA, BWPA, BWMA, and BWLA eutectic PCM. Results: Prepared eutectics melt and solidify in the temperature range 36–56°C and with latent heat in the range of 155–211 kJ/Kg. Conclusions: Due to suitable temperature and good latent heat storage range, it is a good choice as thermal energy storage, for solar drying applications.

                <b>Background:</b> Associations between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and brain morphology have been reported, although with several inconsistencies. These may partly stem from confounding bias, which could distort associations and limit generalizability. We examined how associations between brain morphology and ADHD symptoms change with adjustments for potential confounders typically overlooked in the literature (aim 1), and for IQ and head motion, which are typically corrected for but play ambiguous roles (aim 2).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modeling single-cell phenotypes links yeast stress acclimation to transcriptional repression and pre-stress cellular states</a></h4>

              
                Stress defense and cell growth are inversely related in bulk culture analyses; however, these studies miss substantial cell-to-cell heterogeneity, thus obscuring true phenotypic relationships. Here, we devised a microfluidics system to characterize multiple phenotypes in single yeast cells over time before, during, and after salt stress. The system measured cell and colony size, growth rate, and cell-cycle phase along with nuclear trans-localization of two transcription factors: stress-activated Msn2 that regulates defense genes and Dot6 that represses ribosome biogenesis genes during an active stress response. By tracking cells dynamically, we discovered unexpected discordance between Msn2 and Dot6 behavior that revealed subpopulations of cells with distinct growth properties. Surprisingly, post-stress growth recovery was positively corelated with activation of the Dot6 repressor. In contrast, cells lacking Dot6 displayed slower growth acclimation, even though they grow normally in the absence of stress. We show that wild-type cells with a larger Dot6 response display faster production of Msn2-regulated Ctt1 protein, separable from the contribution of Msn2. These results are consistent with the model that transcriptional repression during acute stress in yeast provides a protective response, likely by redirecting translational capacity to induced transcripts.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Convergence of two global regulators to coordinate expression of essential virulence determinants of Mycobacterium tuberculosis</a></h4>

              
                Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is known to function as a global regulator of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> gene expression. Sequence-based transcriptomic profiling identified the mycobacterial regulon controlled by the cAMP receptor protein, CRP. In this study, we identified a new subset of CRP-associated genes including virulence determinants which are also under the control of a major regulator, PhoP. Our results suggest that PhoP as a DNA binding transcription factor, impacts expression of these genes, and phosphorylated PhoP promotes CRP recruitment at the target promoters. Further, we uncover a distinct regulatory mechanism showing that activation of these genes requires direct recruitment of both PhoP and CRP at their target promoters. The most fundamental biological insight is derived from the inhibition of CRP binding at the regulatory regions in a PhoP-deleted strain owing to CRP-PhoP protein-protein interactions. Based on these results, a model is proposed suggesting how CRP and PhoP function as co-activators of the essential pathogenic determinants. Taken together, these results uncover a novel mode of regulation where a complex of two interacting virulence factors impact expression of virulence determinants. These results have significant implications on TB pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Macroscopic control of cell electrophysiology through ion channel expression</a></h4>

              
                Cells convert electrical signals into chemical outputs to facilitate the active transport of information across larger distances. This electrical-to-chemical conversion requires a tightly regulated expression of ion channels. Alterations of ion channel expression provide landmarks of numerous pathological diseases, such as cardiac arrhythmia, epilepsy, or cancer. Although the activity of ion channels can be locally regulated by external light or chemical stimulus, it remains challenging to coordinate the expression of ion channels on extended spatial-temporal scales. Here, we engineered yeast <i>S. cerevisiae</i> to read and convert chemical concentrations into a dynamic potassium channel expression. A synthetic dual-feedback circuit controls the expression of engineered potassium channels through phytohormones auxin and salicylate to produce a macroscopically coordinated pulses of the plasma membrane potential (PMP). Our study provides a compact experimental model to control electrical activity through gene expression in eukaryotic cell populations setting grounds for various cellular engineering, synthetic biology, and potential therapeutic applications.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Phage resistance profiling identifies new genes required for biogenesis and modification of the corynebacterial cell envelope</a></h4>

              
                Bacteria of the order <i>Corynebacteriales</i> including pathogens such as <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosi </i> and <i>Corynebacterium diphtheriae</i> are characterized by their complex, multi-layered envelope. In addition to a peptidoglycan layer, these organisms possess an additional polysaccharide layer made of arabinogalactan and an outer membrane layer composed predominantly of long-chain fatty acids called mycolic acids. This so-called mycolata envelope structure is both a potent barrier against antibiotic entry into cells and a target of several antibacterial therapeutics. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying mycolata envelope assembly therefore promises to reveal new ways of disrupting this unique structure for the development of antibiotics and antibiotic potentiators. Because they engage with receptors on the cell surface during infection, bacteriophages have long been used as tools to uncover important aspects of host envelope assembly. However, surprisingly little is known about the interactions between <i>Corynebacteriales </i>phages and their hosts. We therefore made use of the phages Cog and CL31 that infect <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum</i> (<i>Cglu</i>), a model member of the <i>Corynebacteriales</i>, to discover host factors important for phage infection. A high-density transposon library of <i>Cglu</i> was challenged with these phages followed by transposon sequencing to identify resistance loci. The analysis identified an important role for mycomembrane proteins in phage infection as well as components of the arabinogalactan and mycolic acid synthesis pathways. Importantly, the approach also implicated a new gene (<i>cgp_0396</i>) in the process of arabinogalactan modification and identified a conserved new factor (AhfA, Cpg_0475) required for mycolic acid synthesis in <i>Cglu</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Learning-related contraction of grey matter in rodent sensorimotor cortex is associated with adaptive myelination</a></h4>

              
                From observations in rodents, it has been suggested that the cellular basis of learning-dependent changes, detected using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be increased dendritic spine density, alterations in astrocyte volume, and adaptations within intracortical myelin. Myelin plasticity is crucial for neurological function and active myelination is required for learning and memory. However, the dynamics of myelin plasticity and how it relates to morphometric-based measurements of structural plasticity remains unknown. We used a motor skill learning paradigm in male mice to evaluate experience-dependent brain plasticity by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in longitudinal MRI, combined with a cross-sectional immunohistochemical investigation. Whole brain VBM revealed non-linear decreases in grey matter volume (GMV) juxtaposed to non-linear increases in white matter volume (WMV) within GM that were best modelled by an asymptotic time course. Using an atlas-based cortical mask, we found non-linear changes with learning in primary and secondary motor areas and in somatosensory cortex. Analysis of cross-sectional myelin immunoreactivity in forelimb somatosensory cortex confirmed an increase in myelin immunoreactivity followed by a return towards baseline levels. Further investigations using quantitative confocal microscopy confirmed these changes specifically to the length density of myelinated axons. The absence of significant histological changes in cortical thickness suggests that non-linear morphometric changes are likely due to changes in intracortical myelin for which morphometric WMV in somatosensory cortex significantly correlated with myelin immunoreactivity. Together, these observations indicate a non-linear increase of intracortical myelin during learning and support the hypothesis that myelin is a component of structural changes observed by VBM during learning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">T cell receptor convergence is an indicator of antigen-specific T cell response in cancer immunotherapies</a></h4>

              
                T cells are potent at eliminating pathogens and playing a crucial role in the adaptive immune response. T cell receptor (TCR) convergence describes T cells that share identical TCRs with the same amino acid sequences but have different DNA sequences due to codon degeneracy. We conducted a systematic investigation of TCR convergence using single-cell immune profiling and bulk TCRβ-sequence (TCR-seq) data obtained from both mouse and human samples, and uncovered a strong link between antigen-specificity and convergence. This association was stronger than T cell expansion, a putative indicator of antigen-specific T cells. By using flow sorted tetramer<sup>+</sup> single T cell data, we discovered that convergent T cells were enriched for a neoantigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> effector phenotype in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, TCR convergence demonstrated better prediction accuracy for immunotherapy response than the existing TCR repertoire indexes. In conclusion, convergent T cells are likely to be antigen-specific and might be a novel prognostic biomarker for anti-cancer immunotherapy.

                The decision to approach or avoid a conspecific is fundamental for survival. Affiliative (prosocial) interactions favor approach behaviors, while antagonistic (aggressive) contacts trigger avoidance. Here we ask how the brain encodes the valence of social interaction. We focused on the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region implicated in social reward processing. We observed that social interactions activate D1-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) regardless of their valence. However, afferent D1- expressing neurons of the anterior insular cortex (AIC) exhibited distinct activity patterns coding for prosocial and aggressive social interaction, respectively. As a result, distinct forms of synaptic plasticity were elicited at the AIC to NAc synapses. Thus, the valence of social interaction induces distinct neural activity in the AIC, which teaches the animal to approach and avoid conspecifics in the future.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The locus coeruleus broadcasts prediction errors across the cortex to promote sensorimotor plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Prediction errors are differences between expected and actual sensory input and are thought to be key computational signals that drive learning related plasticity. One way that prediction errors could drive learning is by activating neuromodulatory systems to gate plasticity. The catecholaminergic locus coeruleus (LC) is a major neuromodulatory system involved in neuronal plasticity in the cortex. Using two-photon calcium imaging in mice exploring a virtual environment, we found that the activity of LC axons in the cortex correlated with the magnitude of unsigned visuomotor prediction errors. LC response profiles were similar in both motor and visual cortical areas, indicating that LC axons broadcast prediction errors throughout the dorsal cortex. While imaging calcium activity in layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex, we found that optogenetic stimulation of LC axons facilitated learning of a stimulus-specific suppression of visual responses during locomotion. This plasticity, induced by minutes of LC axon stimulation, recapitulated the effect of visuomotor learning on a scale that is normally observed during visuomotor development across days. We conclude that prediction errors drive LC activity, and that LC activity facilitates sensorimotor plasticity in the cortex, consistent with a role in modulating learning rates.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptic Connectivity of Afferent Inputs onto Projection Neurons in the Songbird HVC</a></h4>

              
                Birdsong is a complex and volitionally produced skilled behavior that, like speech and language, is dependent on forebrain circuits for its fluent production. The well delineated neural circuits associated with song provide a powerful system in which to study how synaptically linked networks of neurons control a natural and complex behavior. The premotor cortical analog HVC is necessary for song production and for song learning. Although the main input and output pathways of HVC have in most cases been known for decades, we still lack a detailed synaptic wiring diagram of this core circuit. Here we report our progress in building this wiring diagram. HVC has at least three non-overlapping classes of projection neurons and receives input from at least five song associated regions, totaling 15 potential synaptic pathways. Combining optogenetic stimulation of axon terminals from HVCs different afferent pathways with targeted whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of HVC projection neurons, we now provide an initial synaptic connectivity map of 12 of these potential pathways. We report on 435 whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from the 3 classes of HVC projection neurons, examining 4 different input pathways, from NIf, Uva, mMAN, Av, and mapping the polysynaptic and monosynaptic connections in each pathway. We find that the synaptic connectivity of HVCs input-output pathways is complex. Each class of projection neuron receives monosynaptic input from three of the four afferents and all in different combinations. At this stage, only one input pathway, NIf, appears to monosynaptically project onto all three classes of HVC projection neurons. We provide this initial synaptic mapping as an update for the field and will build on this wiring diagram, by updating this bioRxiv manuscript, as more data is collected, and additional pathways are characterized.

                Only some individuals using drugs recreationally eventually become addicted, and persist in drug seeking and taking despite adverse consequences. The neurobehavioral determinants of this individual vulnerability have not been fully elucidated. We report that in drug naive rats the future tendency to develop compulsive cocaine seeking is characterised by behavioral stickiness-related functional hypoconnectivity between the prefrontal cortex and posterior dorsomedial striatum in combination with impulsivity-related structural alterations in the infralimbic cortex, anterior insula and nucleus accumbens. These findings show that the vulnerability to develop compulsive cocaine seeking behavior stems from pre-existing structural or functional changes in two distinct cortico-striatal systems that underlie deficits in impulse control and goal-directed behavior.

                Background: Neurophysiological studies with awake monkeys typically require chronic cranial implants. Headpost and connector-chamber implants are used to allow head stabilization and to house connectors of chronically implanted electrodes, respectively. New Method: We present long-lasting, modular, cement-free headpost implants made of titanium that consist of two pieces: a baseplate and a top-part. The baseplate is implanted first, covered by muscle and skin and allowed to heal and osseointegrate for several weeks to months. The percutaneous part is added in a second, brief surgery. Using a punch tool, a perfectly round skin cut is achieved providing a tight fit around the implant without any sutures. We describe the design, planning and production of manually bent and CNC-milled baseplates. We also developed a remote headposting technique that increases handling safety. Finally, we present a modular, footless connector chamber that is implanted in a similar two-step approach and achieves a minimized footprint on the skull. Results: Twelve monkeys were successfully implanted with a headpost and one with the connector chamber. To date, we report no implant failure, great headpost stability and implant condition, in four cases even more than 9 years post-implantation. Comparison with Existing Methods: The methods presented here build on several related previous methods and provide additional refinements to further increase implant longevity and handling safety. Conclusions: Optimized implants can remain stable and healthy for at least 9 years and thereby exceed the typical experiment durations. This minimizes implant-related complications and corrective surgeries and thereby significantly improves animal welfare.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bell Jar: A Semi-Automated Registration and Cell Counting Tool for Mouse Neurohistology Analysis</a></h4>

              
                To investigate the anatomical organization of neural circuits across the whole brain, it is essential to register the experimental brain tissues to a reference atlas accurately. This procedure is also a prerequisite to quantify the locations and numbers of cells of interest in specific regions. However, it remains challenging to do registration on experimental tissue due to the intrinsic variation among the specimens, tissue deformation introduced by histological processing, and the potential inconsistency in the judgment of the experimenter during manual annotation. Here, we introduce Bell Jar, a multi-platform analysis tool with semi-automated affine warping of atlas maps onto microscopic images of brain slices and machine learning-based cell detection. Bell Jar's intuitive GUI and internal dependency management enable users of all skill levels to obtain accurate results without programming expertise. To compare the performance of Bell Jar with previously published methods, we labeled neurons in the mouse visual cortex with either an engineered rabies virus or an adeno-associated virus (AAV) for neural circuit tracing and quantified Bell Jar's performance at each step of the pipeline for image alignment, segmentation, and cell counting. We demonstrated that Bell Jar's output is as reliable as manual counting by an expert; it is more accurate than currently available techniques even with noisy data and takes less time with fewer user interventions. Bell Jar is an easy-to-navigate application that provides a reproducible, automated analysis workflow to facilitate the precise mapping of histological images of the mouse brain to the reference atlas and the quantification of cellular signals it is trained to recognize.

                Cortical activity patterns occupy a small subset of possible network states. If this is due to intrinsic network properties, microstimulation of cortex should evoke activity patterns resembling those observed during natural sensory input. Here, we use optical microstimulation of virally transfected layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in mouse primary vibrissal somatosensory cortex to compare artificially evoked activity with natural activity evoked by whisker touch and movement ('whisking'). We find that photostimulation engages touch but not whisking responsive neurons more than expected by chance. Neurons that respond to photostimulation and touch or to touch alone exhibit higher spontaneous pairwise correlations than purely photoresponsive neurons. Exposure to several days of simultaneous touch and optogenetic stimulation raises both overlap and spontaneous activity correlations among touch and photoresponsive neurons. We thus find that cortical microstimulation engages existing cortical representations and that repeated co-presentation of natural and artificial stimulation enhances this effect.

                Neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs) share genetic etiology and are frequently co-morbid with epilepsy, but the biological basis of this shared risk remains poorly understood. The 16p11.2 microduplication (16p11.2dup/+) is a highly pleiotropic copy number variant (CNV) conferring risk for multiple NPDs including autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia and intellectual disability, and is associated with a high prevalence of seizures. We used a mouse model of the 16p11.2 duplication (16p11.2dup/+) to uncover molecular and circuit properties associated with this broad phenotypic spectrum, and examined genes within the locus capable of phenotype reversal. Quantitative proteomics of cortical membranes revealed alterations to synaptic protein networks and products of diverse NPD risk genes in 16p11.2dup/+ mice. Network analysis identified an epilepsy-associated protein subnetwork, which was dysregulated in 16p11.2dup/+ mice and proteomic datasets from human NPDs. We investigated circuit properties in 16p11.2dup/+ mice and found they exhibited hypersynchronous activity and enhanced network glutamate release, which increased susceptibility to seizures. We hypothesized that a regulator of the synaptic and epilepsy-associated protein network could have an important impact on pathophysiology. Human brain co-expression and interactome analysis revealed PRRT2 as a major hub in the dysregulated epilepsy subnetwork. Remarkably, restoring Prrt2 copy number to wild-type levels rescued aberrant circuit properties, seizure susceptibility and social interaction deficits in 16p11.2dup/+ mice. We show that proteomics and network biology can identify important disease hubs in multigenic CNVs, and reveal molecular and circuit phenotypes which may be relevant to the complex symptomatology of 16p11.2 duplication carriers.

                Post-learning sleep plays an important role in hippocampal memory processing, including contextual fear memory (CFM) consolidation. Here, we used targeted recombination in activated populations (TRAP) to label context-encoding engram neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and assessed reactivation of these neurons during post-learning sleep. We find that post-learning sleep deprivation (SD), which impairs CFM consolidation, selectively disrupts reactivation in inferior blade DG engram neurons. This change was linked to more general suppression of neuronal activity markers in the inferior, but not superior, DG blade by SD. To further characterize how learning and subsequent sleep or SD affect these (and other) hippocampal subregions, we used subregion-specific spatial profiling of transcripts and proteins. We found that transcriptomic responses to sleep loss differed greatly between hippocampal regions CA1, CA3, and DG inferior blade, superior blade, and hilus. Critically, learning-driven transcriptomic changes, measured 6 h following contextual fear learning, were limited to the two DG blades, differed dramatically between the blades, and were absent from all other regions. Similarly, protein abundance in these hippocampal subregions were differentially impacted by sleep vs. SD and by prior learning, with the majority of alterations to protein expression restricted to DG. Together, these data suggest that the DG plays an essential role in the consolidation of hippocampal memories, and that the effects of sleep and sleep loss on the hippocampus are highly subregion-specific, even within the DG itself.

                Blind readers use a tactile reading systems consisting of raised dot arrays: braille. How does the human brain implement reading by touch? The current study looked for signatures of reading-specific orthographic processes in braille, separate from low-level somatosensory responses and semantic retrieval. Of specific interest were responses in posterior parietal cortices (PPC), because of their role in high-level tactile perception. Congenitally blind, proficient braille readers read real words and pseudowords by touch while undergoing fMRI. We leveraged the system of contractions in English braille, where one or more braille cells can represent combinations of English print letters (e.g., "ing" is represented with one braille cell, "one" with two), making it possible to separate physical and uncontracted letter-length. All words in the study consisted of 4 braille cells, but their corresponding Roman spellings varied from 4 to 7 letters (e.g., "concert" is represented with 4 cells: "con","c","er", and "t", so its contracted length is 4 cells, whereas the uncontracted length is 7 letters). We found that the bilateral supramarginal gyrus (SMG) in the PPC increased its activity as the uncontracted word length increased. By contrast, in the hand region of primary somatosensory cortex (S1), activity increased as a function of a low-level somatosensory feature: dot-number per word. The PPC also showed greater response to pseudowords than real words and distinguished between real and pseudowords in multi-voxel-pattern analysis. Parieto-occipital, early visual and ventral occipito-temporal, as well as prefrontal cortices also showed sensitivity to the real-vs-pseudoword distinction. We conclude that PPC is involved in sublexical orthographic processing for braille, possibly due to braille's tactile modality.

                Sulcal width, defined as the physical distance between opposing sulcal banks, has shown promise as a biomarker. We present the first method to obtain a vertex-wise representation of this metric directly on the brain's cortical surface. The algorithm samples the surface at different depths and estimates the distances between the opposing sulcal banks. The method is validated against a simulated sulcus and compared to other sulcal width tools based on regions of interest, showing solid correlations between the proposed algorithm and two widely-used reference methods. A vertex-wise assessment of the sulcal width is carried out by evaluating the correlation between sulcal width and age in a sample of an aging population, revealing clusters in the central, cingulate, and temporal sulcus regions associating wider sulci for older participants. The results confirm that the algorithm is reliable for obtaining sulcal width maps, allowing for vertex-wise analyses, and providing aggregated measures similar to the existing methods. The present algorithm is publicly available via https://github.com/HGGM-LIM/SWiM.

                It is well known that both the movement of the hand itself and the mental representation of it lead to event-related desynchronization (ERD) of EEG recorded over the corresponding motor areas of the cerebral cortex. Similarly, in somatosensory cortical areas, ERD occurs upon tactile stimulation of the hand, but whether this effect is caused by mental representation of sensations from tactile stimulation remains poorly understood. In the present study, the effects on the EEG of imaginary vibrotactile sensations on the right hand were compared with the effects of real vibrotactile stimulation. Both actual vibrotactile stimulation and mental representation of it have been found to elicit contralateral ERD patterns, particularly prominent in the -band and most pronounced in the C3 region. The paper discusses tactile imagery as a part of the complex sensorimotor mental image and its prospects for using EEG patterns of imagery-induced tactile sensations as control signals in BCI circuits independently and when combined with ERD based on movement imagination to improve the efficiency of neurointerface technologies in rehabilitation medicine, in particular, to restore movements after a stroke and neurotrauma.

                Goal-directed navigation requires integrating information from a variety of internal and external spatial cues, representing them internally, planning, and executing motor actions sequentially. However, a comprehensive computational account of how these processes interact in an ambiguous, uncertain, and noisy environment giving rise to biases and variability observed in navigation behavior is currently unavailable. In this paper, we introduce an optimal control under uncertainty model, which provides a computational-level explanation of how landmarks and path integration interact and are combined to reduce variability in navigation. We apply our model to trajectory and end-point data from three previously published studies that employ a variant of the triangle completion task with landmarks. Contrary to observer models, which attribute human endpoint variability to perceptual cue combination processes only, this dynamic Bayesian actor model provides a unifying account of a wide range of phenomena found in this task by considering variability in perception, action, and internal representations jointly. Taken together, these findings have wide-ranging implications for the analysis and interpretation of human navigation behavior, including resolution of seemingly contradictory results on cue integration in navigation.

                {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a primary inhibitory neurotransmitter that plays a significant role in the central nervous system. Studies on both animals and humans show it has the pharmacological potential for reducing the impact of cognitive disorders, as well as enhancing cognitive functions and mood. However, its specific effects on human attention and working memory have not yet been extensively studied. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and crossover trial, we tested whether the administration of 800 mg GABA, dissolved in a drink, acutely affected visual working memory maintenance, as well as temporal and spatial attention in healthy adults. The participants were 32 young adults (16 females and 16 males). Working memory recall precision, spatial attention and temporal attention were measured by a delayed match-to-sample task, a visual search task, and a speeded rapid serial visual presentation task, respectively. Participants completed two experimental sessions (GABA and Placebo) in randomized and counterbalanced order. In each session, forty-five minutes after administration of the drink, they completed the aforementioned cognitive tasks. Linear mixed model analysis results showed that GABA increased visual search time, compared to the placebo, but did not affect visual search accuracy, temporal attention, nor visual working memory precision. The results suggest that GABA increases visual search time but does not affect temporal attention and memory, and that previously reported effects on cognition might rely on other functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Recurrent predictive coding models for associative memory employing covariance learning</a></h4>

              
                The computational principles adopted by the hippocampus in associative memory (AM) tasks have been one of the mostly studied topics in computational and theoretical neuroscience. Classical models of the hippocampal network assume that AM is performed via a form of covariance learning, where associations between memorized items are represented by entries in the learned covariance matrix encoded in the recurrent connections in the hippocampal subfield CA3. On the other hand, it has been recently proposed that AM in the hippocampus is achieved through predictive coding. Hierarchical predictive coding models following this theory perform AM, but fail to capture the recurrent hippocampal structure that encodes the covariance in the classical models. Such a dichotomy pose potential difficulties for developing a unitary theory of how memory is formed and recalled in the hippocampus. Earlier predictive coding models that learn the covariance information of inputs explicitly seem to be a solution to this dichotomy. Here, we show that although these models can perform AM, they do it in an implausible and numerically unstable way. Instead, we propose alternatives to these earlier covariance-learning predictive coding networks, which learn the covariance information implicitly and plausibly, and can use dendritic structures to encode prediction errors. We show analytically that our proposed models are perfectly equivalent to the earlier predictive coding model learning covariance explicitly, and encounter no numerical issues when performing AM tasks in practice. We further show that our models can be combined with hierarchical predictive coding networks to model the hippocampo-neocortical interactions. Our models provide a biologically plausible approach to modelling the hippocampal network, pointing to a potential computational mechanism employed by the hippocampus during memory formation and recall, which unifies predictive coding and covariance learning based on the recurrent network structure.

                Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) promises to be a leading non-invasive neuroimaging method due to its portability and low cost. However, concerns are rising over its inclusivity of all skin tones and hair types (Parker and Ricard 2022, Webb et al 2022). Functional NIRS relies on direct contact of light-emitting optodes to the scalp, which can be blocked more by longer, darker, and especially curlier hair. Additionally, NIR light can be attenuated by melanin, which is accounted for in neither fNIRS hardware nor analysis methods. Recent work has shown that overlooking these considerations in other modalities like EEG leads to the disproportionate exclusion of individuals with these phenotypes - especially Black people - in both clinical and research literature (Bradford et al 2022, Choy 2020). In this article, we sought to determine if (1) biomedical optics developers and researchers report fNIRS performance variability between skin tones and hair textures, (2a) fNIRS neuroscience practitioners report phenotypic and demographic details in their articles, and thus, (2b) is a similar pattern of participant exclusion found in EEG also present in the fNIRS literature. We present a literature review of top Biomedical Optics and Human Neuroscience journals, showing that demographic and phenotypic reporting is unpopular in both fNIRS development and neuroscience applications. We conclude with a list of recommendations to the fNIRS community including examples of Black researchers addressing these issues head-on, inclusive best practices for fNIRS researchers, and recommendations to funding and regulatory bodies to achieve an inclusive neuroscience enterprise in fNIRS and beyond.

                Seamlessly extracting emotional information from voices is crucial for efficient interpersonal communication. However, it remains unclear how the brain categorizes vocal expressions of emotion beyond the processing of their acoustic features. In our study, we developed a new approach combining electroencephalographic recordings (EEG) in humans with an oddball frequency tagging paradigm to automatically tag neural responses to specific emotion expressions. Participants were presented with a periodic stream of heterogeneous non-verbal emotional vocalizations belonging to five emotion categories (Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sadness) at 2.5 Hz. Importantly, unbeknown to the participant, a specific emotion category appeared at an oddball presentation rate at 0.83 Hz that would elicit an additional response in the EEG spectrum only if the brain discriminates the target emotion category from other emotion categories and generalizes across heterogeneous exemplars of the target emotion category. Stimuli were matched across emotion categories for harmonicity-to-noise ratio, spectral center of gravity, pitch, envelope, and early auditory peripheral processing via the simulated output of the cochlea. Additionally, participants were presented with a scrambled version of the stimuli with identical spectral content and periodicity but disrupted intelligibility. We observed that in addition to the responses at the general presentation frequency (2.5 Hz) in both intact and scrambled sequences, a peak in the EEG spectrum at the oddball emotion presentation rate (0.83 Hz) and its harmonics emerged in the intact sequence only. The absence of response at the oddball frequency in the scrambled sequence in conjunction to our stimuli matching procedure suggests that the categorical brain response elicited by a specific emotion is at least partially independent from low-level acoustic features of the sounds. Further, different topographies were observed when fearful or happy sounds were presented as an oddball that supports the idea of different representations of distinct discrete emotions in the brain. Our paradigm revealed the ability of the brain to automatically categorize non-verbal vocal emotion expressions objectively (behavior-free), rapidly (in few minutes of recording time) and robustly (high signal-to-noise ratio), making it a useful tool to study vocal emotion processing and auditory categorization in general in populations where brain recordings are more challenging.

Current electrodes, however, are limited in their spatial resolution and ability to record from small populations of neurons, let alone individual neurons. Here, we report on a novel, reconfigurable, monolithically integrated human-grade flexible depth electrode capable of recording from up to 128 channels and able to record at a depth of 10 cm in brain tissue. This thin, stylet-guided depth electrode is capable of recording local field potentials and single unit neuronal activity (action potentials), validated across species. This device represents a major new advance in manufacturing and design approaches which extends the capabilities of a mainstay technology in clinical neurology.

                The growing population of older adults emphasizes the need to develop interventions that prevent or delay some of the cognitive decline that accompanies aging. In particular, as memory impairment is the foremost cognitive deficit affecting older adults, it is vital to develop interventions that improve memory function. This study addressed the problem of false memories in aging by training older adults to use details of past events during memory retrieval to distinguish targets from related lures. We examined the neural basis of a retrieval-based monitoring strategy by assessing changes in univariate BOLD activity and discriminability of targets and lures pre and post training. Results showed training-related decreases in false memory rates with no alterations to hit rates. Training and practice were associated with altered recruitment of a frontoparietal monitoring network as well as benefits to neural discriminability within network regions. Participants with lower baseline neural discriminability between target and lure items exhibited the largest changes in neural discriminability. Collectively, our results highlight the benefits of training for reductions of false memories in aging. They also provide an understanding of the neural mechanisms that support these reductions.

                Subsensory noise stimulation targeting sensory receptors has been shown to improve balance control in healthy and impaired individuals. However, the potential for application of this technique in other contexts is still unknown. Gait control and adaptation rely heavily on the input from proprioceptive organs in the muscles and joints. Here we investigated the use of subsensory noise stimulation as a means to influence motor control by boosting proprioception during locomotor adaptations to forces delivered by a robot. The forces increase step length unilaterally and trigger an adaptive response that restores the original symmetry. Healthy participants performed two adaptation experiments, one with stimulation applied to the hamstring muscles and one without. We found that participants adapted faster but to a lesser extent when undergoing subsensory stimulation. We argue that this behaviour is due to the dual effect that the stimulation has on the afferents encoding position and velocity that are present in the muscle spindles.

                Microglia are resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and play key roles in brain homeostasis. During anesthesia, microglia increase their dynamic process surveillance and interact more closely with neurons. However, the functional significance of microglial process dynamics and neuronal interaction has remained unclear. Using in vivo two-photon imaging in awake mice, we discover that microglia enhance neuronal activity after the cessation of general anesthesia. Hyperactive neuron somata are directly contacted by microglial processes, which specifically co-localize with GABAergic boutons. Electron microscopy-based synaptic reconstruction after two-photon imaging reveals that microglial processes enter into the synaptic cleft to shield GABAergic inputs. Microglial ablation or loss of microglial {beta}2- adrenergic receptors prevent post-anesthesia neuronal hyperactivity. Together, our study demonstrates a previously unappreciated function of microglial process dynamics, which allow microglia to transiently boost neuronal activity by physically shielding inhibitory inputs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Whole-Brain fMRI Functional Connectivity Signatures Predict Sustained Emotional Experience in Naturalistic Contexts</a></h4>

              
                Determining and decoding emotional brain processes under ecologically valid conditions remains a key challenge in affective neuroscience. The current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based emotion decoding studies are mainly based on brief and isolated episodes of emotion induction, while sustained emotional experience in naturalistic environments that mirror daily life experiences are scarce. Here we use 10-minute movie clips as ecologically valid emotion-evoking procedures in n=52 individuals to explore emotion-specific fMRI functional connectivity (FC) profiles on the whole-brain level at high spatial resolution (400 atlas based parcels). Employing machine-learning based decoding and cross validation procedures allowed to develop predictive FC profiles that can accurately distinguish sustained happiness and sadness and that generalize across movies and subjects. Both functional brain network-based and subnetwork-based emotion prediction results suggest that emotion manifests as distributed representation of multiple networks, rather than a single functional network or subnetwork. Further, the results show that the Visual Network (VN) and Default Mode Network (DMN) associated functional networks, especially VN-DMN, exhibit a strong contribution to emotion prediction. To further estimate the cumulative effect of naturalistic long-term movie-based video-evoking emotions, we divide the 10-min episode into three stages: early stimulation (1 ~ 200 s), middle stimulation (201 ~ 400 s), and late stimulation (401 ~ 600 s) and examine the emotion prediction performance at different stimulation stages. We found that the late stimulation has a stronger predictive ability (accuracy=85.32%, F1-score=85.62%) compared to early and middle stimulation stages, implying that continuous exposure to emotional stimulation can lead to more intense emotions and further enhance emotion-specific distinguishable representations. The present work demonstrates that sustained sadness and happiness under naturalistic conditions are presented in emotion-specific network profiles and these expressions may play different roles in the generation and modulation of emotions. These findings elucidate the importance of network level adaptations for sustained emotional experiences during naturalistic contexts and open new venues for imaging network level contributions under naturalistic conditions.

                Social memory between the same gender or even different gender is a complex and heavily modulated process in the nervous system. It is important for an individual to form social memory between the opposite sex to either increase mating opportunities with multiple partners or form monogamous pair bonding. Therefore, a specific neuronal circuit to regulate social sexual memory may enhance the mating opportunity for an individual. It has been shown that both the auditory and somatosensory systems could increase the activity of oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus to regulate social behaviors. Although light exposure could influence various forms of memory, such as fear and object memory, how luminance signals modulate social recognition memory remains unclear. Here, we show that acute light exposure could impair the socio-sexual recognition memory (SSRM) in male mice. Contrary to sound and touch, light stimulation could inhibit oxytocin neurons in the SON (SONOT) through M1 SON-projecting ipRGCs and GABAergic neurons in the peri-SON (pSONGABA). Optogenetic activation of SONOT neurons with channelrhodopsin is sufficient to enhance the SSRM performance in male mice, even under light conditions. Our results show that the visual system could modulate SSRM through a succinct ipRGCs-pSONGABA-SONOT neuronal circuitry. Together, we demonstrate a dedicated neuronal circuit of how luminance affects memory formation for an individual toward different sex through the oxytocin system, a powerful modulatory neurohormone in the central nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High sensitivity intrinsic optical signal imaging through flexible, low-cost adaptations of an upright microscope</a></h4>

              
                Intrinsic optical signal imaging (IOSI) is a staple technique in modern neuroscience. Pioneered over thirty years ago, IOSI allows macroscopic mapping of neuronal activity throughout the cortex. The technique has been used to study sensory processing and experience-dependent plasticity, and is often used as an adjunctive procedure to localize cortical areas for subsequent targeting by other imaging or physiology techniques. Despite the ubiquity of IOSI in neuroscience there are few commercially available IOSI systems. As a result, investigators have typically resorted to building their own imaging systems. Over the years, simplified systems built on existing microscope platforms have been proposed. Still, these often require additional, sometimes costly, custom-built hardware, which presents challenges for investigators without significant experience in optics or microscopy design. Here we present a straightforward set of adaptations that can be applied to any standard upright microscope, using readily available, inexpensive, commercial parts for illumination, optics, and signal detection, that enables high sensitivity IOSI. Using these adaptations, we are able to readily map sensory-evoked signals across the somatosensory and visual cortex, including single-whisker barrel cortical activity maps in mice. We show that these IOSI maps are highly reproducible across animals and can be used to study plasticity mechanisms in the somatosensory cortex. We also provide open-source applications to control illumination and analyze raw data to generate activity maps. We anticipate these resources will be particularly useful for neuroscience investigators from broad technical backgrounds looking to add IOSI capabilities to an existing microscope on a budget.

                Human cortical interneurons have been challenging to study due to high diversity and lack of mature brain tissue platforms and genetic targeting tools. We employed rapid GABAergic neuron viral labeling plus unbiased Patch-seq sampling in brain slices to define the signature morpho-electric properties of GABAergic neurons in the human neocortex. Viral targeting greatly facilitated sampling of the SST subclass, including primate specialized double bouquet cells which mapped to two SST transcriptomic types. Multimodal analysis uncovered an SST neuron type with properties inconsistent with original subclass assignment; we instead propose reclassification into PVALB subclass. Our findings provide novel insights about functional properties of human cortical GABAergic neuron subclasses and types and highlight the essential role of multimodal annotation for refinement of emerging transcriptomic cell type taxonomies.

                Astrocytes are the most populous cell type of the human central nervous system and are essential for physiological brain function. Increasing evidence suggests multiple roles for astrocytes in Parkinson's disease (PD), nudging a shift in the research focus, which historically pivoted around the ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons (vmDANs). Studying human astrocytes and other cell types in vivo remains technically and ethically challenging. However, in vitro reprogrammed human stem cell-based models provide a promising alternative. Here, we describe a novel protocol for astrocyte differentiation from human stem cell-derived vmDANs-generating progenitors. This protocol simulates the regionalization, gliogenic switch, radial migration, and final differentiation that occur in the developing human brain. We have characterized the morphological, molecular, and functional features of these ventral midbrain astrocytes with a broad palette of techniques. In addition, we have developed a new pipeline for calcium imaging data analysis called deCLUTTER2+ (deconvolution of Ca2+ fluorescent patterns) that can be used to discover spontaneous or cue-dependent patterns of Ca2+ transients. Altogether, our protocol enables the characterization of the functional properties of human ventral midbrain astrocytes under physiological conditions and in PD.

                In neurodegenerative proteinopathies, intracellular inclusions are histopathologically and ultrastructurally heterogeneous but the significance of this heterogeneity is unclear. Patient- derived iPSC models, while promising for disease modeling, do not form analogous inclusions in a reasonable timeframe and suffer from limited tractability and scalability. Here, we developed an iPSC toolbox that utilizes piggyBac-based or targeted transgenes to rapidly induce CNS cells with concomitant expression of misfolding-prone proteins. The system is scalable and amenable to screening and longitudinal tracking at single-cell and single-inclusion resolution. For proof-of- principle, cortical neuron alpha-synuclein inclusionopathy models were engineered to form inclusions spontaneously or through exogenous seeding by alpha-synuclein fibrils. These models recapitulated known fibril- and lipid-rich inclusion subtypes in human brain, shedding light on their formation and consequences. Genetic-modifier and protein-interaction screens identified sequestered proteins in these inclusions, including RhoA, that were deleterious to cells when lost. This new iPSC platform should facilitate biological and drug discovery for neurodegenerative proteinopathies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Freedom from habits: the capacity for autonomous behaviour</a></h4>

              
                The capacity for autonomous behaviour is key to human intelligence, and fundamental to modern social life. However, experimental investigations of the cognitive bases of human autonomy are challenging, because experimental paradigms typically constrain behaviour using controlled contexts, and elicit behaviour by external triggers. In contrast, the sources of human autonomy and freedom are assumed to be endogenous. Here we propose a new theoretical construct of adaptive autonomy, meaning the capacity to make behavioural choices that are free from constraints of both immediate triggers and habitual responding. Participants played a competitive game in which they had to choose the right time to act, in the face of an opponent who punished (in separate blocks) either choice biases, habitual sequences of action timing across trials, or habitual responses to the effects of reinforcement. Adaptive autonomy with respect to each habit was measured by the ability to maintain performance against the opponent even when the corresponding habit was punished. We found that participants were able, under pressure from their opponent, to become free from habitual choices of when to act, but were not able to free themselves from win-stay, lose-shift patterns of reinforcement, even when these resulted in punishment. These results propose a new testing ground of autonomous behaviour as a flexible adaptation of more or less habitual behaviours that co-exist with different classes of external constraint.

                Transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) has been proved to promote functional rehabilitation of brain lesions including ischemic stroke. However, the therapeutic effects of NSC transplantation is limited by the low survival and differentiation rates of NSCs due to the harsh environment in the brain after ischemic stroke. Here, we employed NSCs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) together with exosomes extracted from NSCs to treat cerebral ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) in mice. The results showed that NSC-derived exosomes significantly reduced the inflammatory response, alleviated oxidative stress after NSC transplantation, and facilitated NSCs differentiation in vivo. The combination of NSCs with exosomes ameliorated the injury of brain tissue including cerebral infarct, neuronal death and glial scarring, and promoted the motor function recovery. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we analyzed the miRNA profiles of NSC-derived exosomes and the potential downstream genes. Our study provided the rationale for the clinical application of NSC-derived exosomes as a supportive adjuvant for NSC transplantation after stroke.

                Mapping functional connectivity between neurons is an essential step towards probing the neural computations mediating behavior. The ability to consistently and robustly determine synaptic connectivity maps in large populations of interconnected neurons is a significant challenge in terms of yield, accuracy and experimental time. Here we developed a compressive sensing approach to reconstruct synaptic connectivity maps based on random two photon (2p) cell-targeted optogenetic stimulation and membrane voltage readout of many putative postsynaptic neurons. Using a biophysical network model of interconnected populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, we found that the mapping can be achieved with far fewer measurements than the standard pairwise sequential approach. We characterized the recall and precision probabilities as a function of network observability, sparsity, number of neurons stimulated per trial, off-target stimulation, synaptic reliability, propagation latency and network topology. We found that that network sparsity and synaptic reliability were primary determinants of the performance. In particular, in a network with 10% probability of neuronal connectivity, functional connections were recovered with >85% recall and >80% precision in half the trials that would be required for single cell stimulation. Our results suggest a rapid and efficient method to reconstruct functional connectivity of brain networks where sparsity is predominantly present.

                Olfaction is the primary sensory modality by which most vertebrate species interpret environmental cues for appropriate behavioral outputs. The olfactory system is subdivided into main (MOS) and accessory (AOS) components which process volatile and non-volatile cues. While much is known regarding the molecular diversity of neurons that comprise the MOS, less is known about the AOS. Here, focusing on the AOS which is largely comprised of the peripheral vomeronasal organ (VNO), the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) and the medial subnucleus of the amygdala (MeA), we studied the molecular diversity and neuronal subtype connectivity of this interconnected circuit. We show that populations of neurons of the AOS can be molecularly subdivided based on their current or prior expression of the transcription factors Foxp2 or Dbx1. We show that the majority of AOB neurons that project directly to the MeA are of the Foxp2-lineage. Using single cell patch clamp electrophysiology, we further reveal that in addition to sex-specific differences across lineage, the relative contributions of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to MeA Foxp2-lineage neurons differ between sexes. Together, this work uncovers a novel molecular diversity of AOS neurons and lineage- and sex-differences in patterns of connectivity.

                Mitochondria are the main suppliers of energy for cells and their bioenergetic function is regulated by mitochondrial dynamics: the constant changes in mitochondria size, shape, and cristae morphology to secure cell homeostasis. Although mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in a wide range of diseases, our understanding of mitochondrial function remains limited by the complexity of inferring these spatial features from 2D electron microscopical (EM) images of intact tissue. Here, we present a semi-automatic method for segmentation and 3D reconstruction of mitochondria, cristae, and intracristal spaces based on 2D EM images of the murine hippocampus. We show that our method provides a more accurate characterization of mitochondrial ultrastructure in 3D than common 2D approaches and propose an operational index of mitochondria's internal organization. We speculate that this tool may help increase our understanding of mitochondrial dynamics in health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Interpersonal alignment of neural evidence accumulation to social exchange of confidence</a></h4>

              
                Private, subjective beliefs about uncertainty have been found to have idiosyncratic computational and neural substrates yet, humans share such beliefs seamlessly and cooperate successfully. Bringing together decision making under uncertainty and interpersonal alignment in communication, in a discovery plus pre-registered replication design, we examined the neuro-computational basis of the relationship between privately-held and socially-shared uncertainty. Examining confidence-speed-accuracy trade-off in uncertainty-ridden perceptual decisions under social vs isolated context, we found that shared (i.e., reported confidence) and subjective (inferred from pupillometry) uncertainty dynamically followed social information. An attractor neural network model incorporating social information as top-down additive input captured the observed behaviour and spontaneously demonstrated the emergence of social alignment in virtual dyadic simulations. Electroencephalography showed that social exchange of confidence modulated the neural signature of perceptual evidence accumulation in the central parietal cortex and produced a sustained top-down flow of information from prefrontal to parietal cortex. Our findings offer a neural population model for interpersonal alignment of shared beliefs.

	<p>Schizophrenia is the subject of many studies. There have been reports of taste disturbances in mental disorders. We found a possible relationship between deficit symptoms of schizophrenia and the dysgeusia of monosodium glutamate (MSG). Dysgeusia is a disorder that distorts the sense of taste. People describe all foods as tasting sweet, sour, bitter, or metallic. We aimed to verify whether the level of MSG taste perception may be related to the severity of deficit symptoms. MSG detection threshold was assessed via sublingual administration of three fluid samples containing MSG or water. The MSG samples had different concentrations in each sample. The task was to indicate which of the samples contained MSG, determine the intensity of the taste, and assess the taste as pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. The study group included 200 patients diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia according to ICD-10. We found a significant negative correlation between mean intensity of taste and the number of deficit symptoms. The symptoms of taste disturbances reported by the patient should be monitored by clinicians and differentiated between the actual deficits in the field of taste perception and the taste hallucinations as a symptom of psychosis. It is important to continue research in this area.</p>

	<p>Background: The characteristics associated with having family members going out for work among persons with schizophrenia in rural China are unknown. This study aimed to explore the characteristics of families with members going out for work and the risk factors among persons with schizophrenia in a rural area of China. Methods: This study employed a cross-sectional dataset from a mental health survey, using the International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), conducted among 152,776 people aged 15 years and older in Xinjin District, Chengdu, China, in 2015. Results: A total of 598 persons with schizophrenia were included in this study, and 20.4% (n = 122) of them had at least one family member who went out for work. Compared with those without family going out for work, participants with family going out for work had significantly larger numbers of family members, higher monthly incomes and lower percentages of social low-income insurance. Participants with family going out for work were more likely to be females, married and with higher levels of subjective and instrumental support. The statuses of families with members going out for work were significantly associated with larger numbers of family members and higher levels of instrumental support. Conclusions: Our findings indicate specific characteristics of families with members going out for work and factors associated with having family going out for work among persons with schizophrenia (number of family members and instrumental support). Culture-specific mental health policies and community-based services should be developed for persons with schizophrenia who have family going out for work in rural China.</p>

	<p>Globally, there are nearly three million people living with multiple sclerosis (PLW-MS). Many PLW-MS experience vertigo and have signs of vestibular dysfunction, e.g., low vestibulo&amp;amp;ndash;ocular reflex (VOR) gains or the presence of compensatory saccades (CSs), on video head impulse testing (vHIT). We examined whether the vestibular function and compensatory oculomotor behaviors in PLW-MS differed based on the level of MS-related disability. The VOR gain, CS frequency and latency, and gaze position error (GPE) were calculated from the individual traces obtained during six-canal vHIT for 37 PLW-MS (mean age 53.4 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12.4 years-old, 28 females) with vertigo and/or an imbalance. The subjects were grouped by their Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores: PLW-min-MS (EDSS = 1.0&amp;amp;ndash;2.5, n = 8), PLW-mild-MS (EDSS = 3.0&amp;amp;ndash;4.5, n = 23), and PLW-moderate-MS (EDSS = 5.0&amp;amp;ndash;6.0, n = 6). The between-group differences were assessed with Kruskal&amp;amp;ndash;Wallis tests. The VOR gains for most of the canals were higher for PLW-min-MS compared to PLW-mild- and mod-MS, respectively. CS occurred less often in PLW-min-MS versus PLW-mild- and mod-MS, respectively. No clear trend in CS latency was found. The GPE was often lower for PLW-min-MS compared to PLW-mild- and mod-MS, respectively. Thus, our data demonstrate that worse VOR and compensatory oculomotor functions are associated with a greater MS-related disability. PLW-MS may benefit from personalized vestibular physical therapy.</p>

	<p>The relationship between age and the central nervous system (CNS) in humans has been a classical issue that has aroused extensive attention. Especially for individuals, it is of far greater importance to clarify the mechanisms between CNS and age. The primary goal of existing methods is to use MR images to derive high-accuracy predictions for age or degenerative diseases. However, the associated mechanisms between the images and the age have rarely been investigated. In this paper, we address the correlation between gray matter volume (GMV) and age, both in terms of gray matter themselves and their interaction network, using interpretable machine learning models for individuals. Our goal is not only to predict age accurately but more importantly, to explore the relationship between GMV and age. In addition to targeting each individual, we also investigate the dynamic properties of gray matter and their interaction network with individual age. The results show that the mean absolute error (MAE) of age prediction is 7.95 years. More notably, specific locations of gray matter and their interactions play different roles in age, and these roles change dynamically with age. The proposed method is a data-driven approach, which provides a new way to study aging mechanisms and even to diagnose degenerative brain diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Granite classification using machine learning and edge computing [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The outlook and the aura of any place are highly dependent on how a place is decorated and what materials are used in designing it. Granite is such a kind of rock which is vastly used for this purpose. Granite flooring and counters have a major influence on the interior d ́ecor which is essential to set the mood and ambience of a house. A system is needed to help the end users differentiate between granites, which enhance the grandeur of their house and also check the frauds of different color granite being sent by the merchant as compared to what was selected by the end user. Several models have been developed for this cause using CNN and other image processing techniques. However, a solution for this purpose must be precise and computationally efficient. Methods: For this purpose,researchers in this work developed a machine learning based granite classifier using Edge Computing and a website to help users in choosing which granite would go well with their d ́ecor is also built. The developed system consists of a color sensor [TCS3200] integrated with an ESP8266 board. The data pertaining to RGB contrasts of different rocks is acquired by using the color sensor from a dealership.This data is used to train a Machine Learning algorithm to classify the rock into different granite types from a granite dealer and yield the category prediction. Results: The proposed system yields a result of 94% accuracy when classified using Random Forest Algorithm. Conclusion: Thus, this system provides an upper hand for the end users in differentiating between different types of granites.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Intraoral repair of fractured ceramics: a literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Fracture or chipping of veneering ceramic resulting in aesthetic and functional issues is a frequent technical complication encountered with fixed dental prostheses. Treatment options include extraoral or intraoral repair of the ceramic restoration; the latter being minimally invasive and cost-effective. We reviewed the various intraoral repair techniques for ceramic fractures and their efficiency in the last decade. Methods: A literature search was carried out between 2017 and 2022 using the PubMed database with keywords: intraoral, repair, ceramics, porcelain, and ‘porcelain fused to metal’. Screening of abstracts and full texts was carried out to determine the final list of eligible studies. Results:  Twenty-one eligible studies were included in the review which consisted of 17 in vitro studies, three case reports, and one prospective clinical study. Researchers and dentists preferred repairing cracked veneered zirconia-based restorations intraorally if the restoration is in acceptable condition. However, successful intraoral repair of veneering fractures relies on the bond between the previous restoration and the new repair material, the right adhesive resin, and adequate surface conditioning. The review indicated that the best technique to fix chipping in a complex made of zirconia core and veneering ceramic is to treat the veneering ceramic with hydrofluoric acid before covering the core ceramic with silica. Conclusion: Intraoral repair is an efficient and economic procedure without the need for repeated sessions. However, the success and longevity of the restoration rely on the technical skills of the clinicians and adherence to prescribed protocols.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Peruvian children toothbrushing during the COVID-19 pandemic [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Toothbrushing is a convenient, inexpensive, widespread and culturally accepted method, resulting in an ideal public health outcome. This study aimed to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on toothbrushing in Peruvian children. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted using a database of children aged 0 to 11 years, with a final sample of 39,124 participants, 15,974 in 2019 (62.03%) and 7088 in 2020 (55.54%). General toothbrushing, daily toothbrushing and minimum frequency of two times a day were dependent variables; the year was considered as the independent variable. In addition, other covariates such as geographical landscape, area of residence, place of residence, altitude, wealth index, health insurance cover, sex and age. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses were applied. Results: General toothbrushing was 96.19% (n=51 013), daily toothbrushing was 87.47% (n=42 246) and minimum toothbrushing two times a day was 84.53% (n=33 957). In multivariate form, the year presented a negative association with daily toothbrushing (RPa: 0.97; CI95%: 0.96-0.98; p<0.001) and minimum toothbrushing two times a day (RPa: 0.97; CI95%: 0.95-0.98; p<0.001), adjusted for the previously associated co-variables. Conclusions: The year 2020 of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted daily toothbrushing and minimum twice-daily toothbrushing of Peruvian children.

                Background: Propolis is a natural resinous mixture produced by bees. It provides beneficial effects on human health in the treatment/management of many diseases. The present study was performed to demonstrate the anti-Acanthamoeba activity of ethanolic extracts of Propolis samples from Iran. The interactions of the compounds and essential proteins of Acanthamoeba were also visualized through docking simulation. Methods: The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of Propolis extract against Acanthamoeba trophozoites and cysts was determined in vitro. In addition, two-fold dilutions of each of the agents were tested for encystment, excystment and adhesion inhibitions. Three major compounds of Propolis extract such as chrysin, tectochrysin and pinocembrin have been selected in molecular docking approach to predict the compounds that might be responsible for encystment, excystment and adhesion inhibitions of A. castellanii. Furthermore, to confirm the docking results, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were also carried out for the most promising two ligand-pocket complexes from docking studies. Results: The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) 62.5 and 125 µg/mL of the most active Propolis extract were assessed in trophozoites stage of Acanthamoeba castellanii ATCC30010 and ATCC50739, respectively. At concentrations lower than their MICs values (1/16 MIC), Propolis extract revealed inhibition of encystation. However, at 1/2 MIC, it showed a potential inhibition of excystation and anti-adhesion. The molecular docking and dynamic simulation revealed the potential capability of Pinocembrin to form hydrogen bonds with A. castellanii Sir2 family protein (AcSir2), an encystation protein of high relevance for this process in Acanthamoeba. Conclusions: The results obtained provided a candidate for the development of therapeutic drugs against Acanthamoeba infection. In vivo experiments and clinical trials are necessary to support this claim.

                Background: The aim of this paper is to find evidence of a changing pattern in cover songs by 21st-century artists. To this end, over 76,000 covers performed by artists who grew up in the 2000s were quantitatively analyzed. Methods: SecondHandSongs.com was crawled to extract the cover relationships, and Allmusic.com to obtain the genre and starting decade of each performer. Results: The results show that the current music panorama is dominated by Pop/Rock music and, for the first time since the 1960s, artists from the 2010s generation prefer to cover more songs by contemporary artists than by classic figures from the 1960s. Pop and Dance are the emerging sub-genres with the largest proportion of covered musicians, while Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber and Ed Sheeran are responsible for this changing trend. Conclusions: These results provide an interesting opportunity to introduce quantitative studies in cultural studies about music, cinema and arts.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Network topology metrics explaining enrichment of hybrid epithelial mesenchymal phenotypes in metastasis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mubasher Rashid, Kishore Hari, John Thampi, Nived Krishnan Santhosh, Mohit Kumar Jolly</p>

Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and its reverse—Mesenchymal to Epithelial Transition (MET) are hallmarks of metastasis. Cancer cells use this reversible cellular programming to switch among Epithelial (E), Mesenchymal (M), and hybrid Epithelial/Mesenchymal (hybrid E/M) state(s) and seed tumors at distant sites. Hybrid E/M cells are often more aggressive and metastatic than the “pure” E and M cells. Thus, identifying mechanisms to inhibit hybrid E/M cells can be promising in curtailing metastasis. While multiple gene regulatory networks (GRNs) based mathematical models for EMT/MET have been developed recently, identifying topological signatures enriching hybrid E/M phenotypes remains to be done. Here, we investigate the dynamics of 13 different GRNs and report an interesting association between “hybridness” and the number of negative/positive feedback loops across the networks. While networks having more negative feedback loops favor hybrid phenotype(s), networks having more positive feedback loops (PFLs) or many <i>HiLoops–</i>specific combinations of PFLs, support terminal (E and M) phenotypes. We also establish a connection between “hybridness” and network-frustration by showing that hybrid phenotypes likely result from non-reinforcing interactions among network nodes (genes) and therefore tend to be more frustrated (less stable). Our analysis, thus, identifies network topology-based signatures that can give rise to, as well as prevent, the emergence of hybrid E/M phenotype in GRNs underlying EMP. Our results can have implications in terms of targeting specific interactions in GRNs as a potent way to restrict switching to the hybrid E/M phenotype(s) to curtail metastasis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A structural dynamics model for how CPEB3 binding to SUMO2 can regulate translational control in dendritic spines</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xinyu Gu, Nicholas P. Schafer, Carlos Bueno, Wei Lu, Peter G. Wolynes</p>

A prion-like RNA-binding protein, CPEB3, can regulate local translation in dendritic spines. CPEB3 monomers repress translation, whereas CPEB3 aggregates activate translation of its target mRNAs. However, the CPEB3 aggregates, as long-lasting prions, may raise the problem of unregulated translational activation. Here, we propose a computational model of the complex structure between CPEB3 RNA-binding domain (CPEB3-RBD) and small ubiquitin-like modifier protein 2 (SUMO2). Free energy calculations suggest that the allosteric effect of CPEB3-RBD/SUMO2 interaction can amplify the RNA-binding affinity of CPEB3. Combining with previous experimental observations on the SUMOylation mode of CPEB3, this model suggests an equilibrium shift of mRNA from binding to deSUMOylated CPEB3 aggregates to binding to SUMOylated CPEB3 monomers in basal synapses. This work shows how a burst of local translation in synapses can be silenced following a stimulation pulse, and explores the CPEB3/SUMO2 interplay underlying the structural change of synapses and the formation of long-term memories.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Kleptoplasty: Getting away with stolen chloroplasts</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sónia Cruz, Paulo Cartaxana</p>

Kleptoplasty, the process by which a host organism sequesters and retains algal chloroplasts, is relatively common in protists. The origin of the plastid varies, as do the length of time it is retained in the host and the functionality of the association. In metazoa, the capacity for long-term (several weeks to months) maintenance of photosynthetically active chloroplasts is a unique characteristic of a handful of sacoglossan sea slugs. This capability has earned these slugs the epithets “crawling leaves” and “solar-powered sea slugs.” This Unsolved Mystery explores the basis of chloroplast maintenance and function and attempts to clarify contradictory results in the published literature. We address some of the mysteries of this remarkable association. Why are functional chloroplasts retained? And how is the function of stolen chloroplasts maintained without the support of the algal nucleus?

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, causes respiratory failure and damage to multiple organ systems. The emergence of viral variants poses a risk of vaccine failures and prolongation of the pandemic. However, our understanding of the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent COVID-19 pathophysiology is limited. In this study, we have uncovered a critical role for the evolutionarily conserved Hippo signaling pathway in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Given the complexity of COVID-19-associated cell injury and immunopathogenesis processes, we investigated Hippo pathway dynamics in SARS-CoV-2 infection by utilizing COVID-19 lung samples and human cell models based on pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (PSC-CMs) and human primary lung air–liquid interface (ALI) cultures. SARS-CoV-2 infection caused activation of the Hippo signaling pathway in COVID-19 lung and in vitro cultures. Both parental and Delta variant of concern (VOC) strains induced Hippo pathway. The chemical inhibition and gene knockdown of upstream kinases MST1/2 and LATS1 resulted in significantly enhanced SARS-CoV-2 replication, indicating antiviral roles. Verteporfin, a pharmacological inhibitor of the Hippo pathway downstream transactivator, YAP, significantly reduced virus replication. These results delineate a direct antiviral role for Hippo signaling in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the potential for this pathway to be pharmacologically targeted to treat COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparative analysis of computed tomography severity indices in predicting the severity and clinical outcome in patients with acute pancreatitis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Acute pancreatitis (AP) has unpredictable severity. Its management is based on initial assessment of disease severity. It ranges from mild interstitial to severe necrotic form; the latter is associated with poor prognosis. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen is the gold standard in early detection of pancreatic necrosis and in assessing the severity of AP. Two CT grading systems exist to assess severity of AP: CT severity Index (CSI) and modified CSI (MCSI). This study compares the usefulness of these two systems in predicting severity and clinical outcome in AP in comparison with Ranson’s criteria and clinical outcome parameters. Methods: This is a prospective hospital-based screening study of 80 patients aged >12 years with clinical diagnosis of AP who underwent contrast-enhanced CT study of the abdomen. Comparative analysis between MCSI and CSI with Ranson’s criteria and clinical outcome parameters was assessed by Chi-Squared test. Results: The accuracy of CSI and MSCI in predicting the requirement of critical care, superadded infection, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and requirement of intervention were 73.0%, 64.5%, 69.8% 60.9% and 77.2%, 76.0%, 74.4% & 56.6%, respectively. Area under the curve for MCSI score was significantly higher (AUC : 0.861; 95% CI: 0.736-0.986) than CSI score (AUC:0.815;95% CI:0.749-0.941). MCSI and CSI showed significant correlation with Ranson’s criteria; however, MCSI correlation was better (r:0.53; p<0.01) than CSI (r:0.35;p:0.04). Conclusion: CSI and MCSI are better predictors of severity, clinical outcome and mortality compared with Ranson’s criteria, with MCSI being more accurate and better predictor than CSI.  The accuracy of MCSI is better than CSI for prediction of requirement of critical care, development of superadded infection and development of MODS in AP. However, CSI and MCSI have low accuracy in predicting intervention in AP.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Inference of a genome-wide protein-coding gene set of the inshore hagfish Eptatretus burgeri [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The hagfishes (Myxiniformes) arose from agnathan (jawless vertebrate) lineages and they are one of only two extant cyclostome taxa, together with lampreys (Petromyzontiformes). Even though whole genome sequencing has been achieved for diverse vertebrate taxa, genome-wide sequence information has been highly limited for cyclostomes. Here we sequenced the genome of the inshore hagfish Eptatretus burgeri using DNA extracted from the testis, with a short-read sequencing platform, aiming to reconstruct a high-coverage protein-coding gene catalogue. The obtained genome assembly, scaffolded with mate-pair reads and paired RNA-seq reads, exhibited an N50 scaffold length of 293 Kbp, which allowed the genome-wide prediction of coding genes. This computation resulted in the gene models whose completeness was estimated at the complete coverage of more than 83 % and the partial coverage of more than 93 % by referring to evolutionarily conserved single-copy orthologs. The high contiguity of the assembly and completeness of the gene models promise a high utility in various comparative analyses including phylogenomics and phylome exploration.

                Background: In language learning, reading is a skill that enables interaction with a text in whatever field of knowledge the learner is pursuing. Readers tend to use strategies such as comprehension, interpretation and conception of decoding written language and texts to enhance their reading capacity. This research explores the reading strategies applied by Saudi English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners and compares the reading abilities of male and female EFL students. Methods: The study interviewed three EFL students about the reading strategies they applied while reading passages and texts. Then an International English Language Testing System (IELTS) reading test was handed over to 26 randomly selected students. Results: The study found that the reading strategies used by the students interviewed involved skimming, scanning, guessing the meaning from context, identifying the mean idea, and summarizing the body of the text in question. Moreover, the study revealed that both male and female students scored low in the IELTS tests that the researchers conducted. The average mean score they reached was 7.15 out of 20. However, even in the low scoring ratio, female students (M=7.69) outperformed male students (M= 6.62) and the difference between them remained significant, P=.000. Conclusions: The study recommends that the language instructors help EFL learners in developing their reading strategies and applying them every time they read any text.

                Background: The world economy was broken by the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected the coffee industry. The COVID-19 pandemic's financial effects might influence equity markets and personal lives. This includes financial commodities like coffee, which the pandemic is predicted to damage. Coffee tourism is an emerging new kind of tourism in Thailand, formed in response to growing demand from visitors with a particular affinity for the beverage. Coffee tourism may contribute considerably to the expansion of Thai tourism if given the proper guidance and assistance. Methods: As part of a coffee tourism experience focusing on first-hand activities and information, tourists can visit neighbouring sites while on a coffee plantation. This research uses a stochastic neuro-fuzzy decision tree (SNF-DT) to analyse coffee tourism in Thailand. The research surveys 400 international and Thai coffee tourists. According to studies, Thai visitors mostly visit coffee tourism locations in Thailand for enjoyment. They also wanted to visit coffee fields in order to get personal knowledge of coffee production and marketing. Based on the comments of Thai visitors, coffee tourism in northern Thailand looks to be highly and effectively handled. Due to the same factor, responses from foreign coffee tourists indicated that many of their journeys to coffee tourism destinations were made entirely for enjoyment rather than the business. They also wanted to meet local tour guides and acquire handmade and locally produced things to understand more about coffee tourism.  Result: According to study results, coffee tourism management in northern Thailand looks well-received by international tourists. We also compare the suggested model to the traditional one to demonstrate its efficacy. The performance metrics are prediction rate, prediction error, and accuracy. The estimated results for our proposed technique are prediction rate (95%), prediction error (97%), and accuracy (94%).

                Vaccine rollouts have been underway to combat the COVID-19 pandemic globally. Based on ongoing interviews with ten primary care physicians ‘in the field’, this paper elucidates how in practice the vaccinations were carried out in Japan in 2021. We examine what the primary care physicians did to prepare for the rollouts, what problems they faced, and how they responded to these problems. Large-scale vaccination projects are supposed to proceed smoothly and quickly, or to have what Anna Tsing calls ‘scalability’. In practice, however, they required a variety of tasks for coordination, information sharing, and promotion. Despite feeling stressed by the lack of information and exhausted by the work overload, the primary care physicians carried out the vaccinations as an important service to their patients and communities. The findings of this paper will provide valuable materials for improving future vaccine rollouts.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Seizures are a frequent symptom of unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs). However, the brain regions responsible for these seizures remain unclear. To identify the brain regions causally involved in bAVM-related seizures, we retrospectively reviewed 220 patients with unruptured bAVMs. Using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) analyses, we tested whether individual brain regions were associated with unruptured bAVM-related seizures. The result revealed that unruptured bAVMs causing seizures are anatomically heterogeneous at the voxel level. Subsequently, lesion network mapping (LNM) analyses was performed to determine whether bAVMs causing seizures belonged to a distributed brain network. LNM analyses indicated that these lesions were located in a functional network characterized by connectivity to the left caudate and precuneus. Moreover, the discrimination performance of the identified seizure network was evaluated in discovery set by calculating the individualized network damage score and was tested in validation set. Based on the calculated network damage scores, patients were divided into low-, medium-, and high-risk groups. The prevalence of seizures significantly differed among the three risk categories in both discovery (<i>p</i> = .003) and validation set (<i>p</i> = .004). Finally, we calculated the percentage of voxels in the canonical resting-state networks that overlapped with the seizure-susceptible brain regions to investigate the involvement of resting-state networks. With an involvement percentage over 50%, the frontoparietal control (82.9%), limbic function (76.7%), and default mode network (69.3%) were considered to be impacted in bAVM-related seizures. Our study identified the seizure-susceptible brain regions for unruptured bAVMs, which could be a plausible neuroimaging biomarker in predicting possible seizures.</p>

                Schizophrenia remains a major health burden, highlighting the need for new treatment approaches. We consider the potential for targeting the trace amine (TA) system. We first review genetic, preclinical, and clinical evidence for the role of TAs in the aetiopathology of schizophrenia. We then consider how the localisation and function of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) position it to modulate key brain circuits for the disorder. Studies in rodents using Taar1 knockout (TAAR1-KO) and overexpression models show that TAAR1 agonism inhibits midbrain dopaminergic and serotonergic activity, and enhances prefrontal glutamatergic function.

                This article is an in-depth investigation of molecular alterations underlying chiasmatic misrouting in the albino binocular circuit. During development, in a specialized retinal niche—the ciliary margin—fewer cells express the cell-cycle regulator CyclinD2. Consequently, the cell cycle is elongated, resulting in fewer ipsilaterally projecting RGCs and perturbed binocular vision.

Tet2-mediated neuronal hydroxymethylation and transcriptional changes negatively regulate adult hippocampal synaptic processes. Increasing neuronal Tet2 impairs hippocampal-dependent memory, while loss of neuronal Tet2 enhances memory.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Toll-like receptor 2 orchestrates a tumor suppressor response in non-small cell lung cancer</a></h4>

              
                Millar et al. show that TLR2 is expressed in early lung cancer, where it is associated with improved survival and clinical regression. Using mouse models, they show that Tlr2 regulates growth arrest pathways and anti-tumoral immune surveillance. Targeting Tlr2 activity with an agonist significantly reduces early lung tumor growth.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Large-scale all-optical dissection of motor cortex connectivity shows a segregated organization of mouse forelimb representations</a></h4>

              
                The intrinsic connections and functional structure of areas in the forelimb motor cortex are unclear. Here, Resta et al. develop an all-optical system to causally dissect cortical activation during movement execution, providing evidence for a segregated organization of RFA and CFA networks and identifying a second grasping representation area.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">New insights into anatomical connectivity along the anterior–posterior axis of the human hippocampus using in vivo quantitative fibre tracking</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus supports multiple cognitive functions including episodic memory. Recent work has highlighted functional differences along the anterior–posterior axis of the human hippocampus, but the neuroanatomical underpinnings of these differences remain unclear. We leveraged track-density imaging to systematically examine anatomical connectivity between the cortical mantle and the anterior–posterior axis of the <i>in vivo</i> human hippocampus. We first identified the most highly connected cortical areas and detailed the degree to which they preferentially connect along the anterior–posterior axis of the hippocampus. Then, using a tractography pipeline specifically tailored to measure the location and density of streamline endpoints within the hippocampus, we characterised where these cortical areas preferentially connect within the hippocampus. Our results provide new and detailed insights into how specific regions along the anterior–posterior axis of the hippocampus are associated with different cortical inputs/outputs and provide evidence that both gradients and circumscribed areas of dense extrinsic anatomical connectivity exist within the human hippocampus. These findings inform conceptual debates in the field and emphasise the importance of considering the hippocampus as a heterogeneous structure. Overall, our results represent a major advance in our ability to map the anatomical connectivity of the human hippocampus <i>in vivo</i> and inform our understanding of the neural architecture of hippocampal-dependent memory systems in the human brain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Glutathione in the nucleus accumbens regulates motivation to exert reward-incentivized effort</a></h4>

              
                Emerging evidence is implicating mitochondrial function and metabolism in the nucleus accumbens in motivated performance. However, the brain is vulnerable to excessive oxidative insults resulting from neurometabolic processes, and whether antioxidant levels in the nucleus accumbens contribute to motivated performance is not known. Here, we identify a critical role for glutathione (GSH), the most important endogenous antioxidant in the brain, in motivation. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy at ultra-high field in both male humans and rodent populations, we establish that higher accumbal GSH levels are highly predictive of better, and particularly, steady performance over time in effort-related tasks. Causality was established in <i>in vivo</i> experiments in rats that, first, showed that downregulating GSH levels through micro-injections of the GSH synthesis inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine in the nucleus accumbens impaired effort-based reward-incentivized performance. In addition, systemic treatment with the GSH precursor N-acetyl-cysteine increased accumbal GSH levels in rats and led to improved performance, potentially mediated by a cell-type-specific shift in glutamatergic inputs to accumbal medium spiny neurons. Our data indicate a close association between accumbal GSH levels and an individual’s capacity to exert reward-incentivized effort over time. They also suggest that improvement of accumbal antioxidant function may be a feasible approach to boost motivation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Gene interaction perturbation network deciphers a high-resolution taxonomy in colorectal cancer</a></h4>

              
                Molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer (CRC) are currently identified via the snapshot transcriptional profiles, largely ignoring the dynamic changes of gene expressions. Conversely, biological networks remain relatively stable irrespective of time and condition. Here, we introduce an individual-specific gene interaction perturbation network-based (GIN) approach and identify six GIN subtypes (GINS1-6) with distinguishing features: (i) GINS1 (proliferative, 24%~34%), elevated proliferative activity, high tumor purity, immune-desert, <i>PIK3CA</i> mutations, and immunotherapeutic resistance; (ii) GINS2 (stromal-rich, 14%~22%), abundant fibroblasts, immune-suppressed, stem-cell-like, <i>SMAD4</i> mutations, unfavorable prognosis, high potential of recurrence and metastasis, immunotherapeutic resistance, and sensitive to fluorouracil-based chemotherapy; (iii) GINS3 (<i>KRAS</i>-inactivated, 13%~20%), high tumor purity, immune-desert, activation of <i>EGFR</i> and ephrin receptors, chromosomal instability (CIN), fewer <i>KRAS</i> mutations, <i>SMOC1</i> methylation, immunotherapeutic resistance, and sensitive to cetuximab and bevacizumab; (iv) GINS4 (mixed, 10%~19%), moderate level of stromal and immune activities, transit-amplifying-like, and <i>TMEM106A</i> methylation; (v) GINS5 (immune-activated, 12%~24%), stronger immune activation, plentiful tumor mutation and neoantigen burden, microsatellite instability and high CpG island methylator phenotype, <i>BRAF</i> mutations, favorable prognosis, and sensitive to immunotherapy and <i>PARP</i> inhibitors; (vi) GINS6, (metabolic, 5%~8%), accumulated fatty acids, enterocyte-like, and <i>BMP</i> activity. Overall, the novel high-resolution taxonomy derived from an interactome perspective could facilitate more effective management of CRC patients.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Alternative splicing downstream of EMT enhances phenotypic plasticity and malignant behaviour in colon cancer</a></h4>

              
                Phenotypic plasticity allows carcinoma cells to transiently acquire the quasi-mesenchymal features necessary to detach from the primary mass and proceed along the invasion-metastasis cascade. A broad spectrum of epigenetic mechanisms is likely to cause the epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) and mesenchymal-to-epithelial (MET) transitions necessary to allow local dissemination and distant metastasis. Here, we report on the role played by alternative splicing (AS) in eliciting phenotypic plasticity in epithelial malignancies with focus on colon cancer. By taking advantage of the coexistence of subpopulations of fully epithelial (EpCAM<sup>hi</sup>) and quasi-mesenchymal and highly metastatic (EpCAM<sup>lo</sup>) cells in conventional human cancer cell lines, we here show that the differential expression of <i>ESRP1</i> and other RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) downstream of the EMT master regulator <i>ZEB1</i>, alters the AS pattern of a broad spectrum of targets including <i>CD44</i> and <i>NUMB</i>, thus resulting in the generation of specific isoforms functionally associated with increased invasion and metastasis. Additional functional and clinical validation studies indicate that both the newly identified RBPs and the CD44s and NUMB2/4 splicing isoforms promote local invasion and distant metastasis and are associated with poor survival in colon cancer. The systematic elucidation of the spectrum of EMT-related RBPs and AS targets in epithelial cancers, apart from the insights in the mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity, will lead to the identification of novel and tumor-specific therapeutic targets.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A prebiotic diet modulates microglial states and motor deficits in α-synuclein overexpressing mice</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement disorder characterized by neuroinflammation, α-synuclein pathology, and neurodegeneration. Most cases of PD are non-hereditary, suggesting a strong role for environmental factors, and it has been speculated that disease may originate in peripheral tissues such as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract before affecting the brain. The gut microbiome is altered in PD and may impact motor and GI symptoms as indicated by animal studies, though mechanisms of gut-brain interactions remain incompletely defined. Intestinal bacteria ferment dietary fibers into short-chain fatty acids, with fecal levels of these molecules differing between PD and healthy controls and in mouse models. Among other effects, dietary microbial metabolites can modulate activation of microglia, brain-resident immune cells implicated in PD. We therefore investigated whether a fiber-rich diet influences microglial function in α-synuclein overexpressing (ASO) mice, a preclinical model with PD-like symptoms and pathology. Feeding a prebiotic high-fiber diet attenuates motor deficits and reduces α-synuclein aggregation in the substantia nigra of mice. Concomitantly, the gut microbiome of ASO mice adopts a profile correlated with health upon prebiotic treatment, which also reduces microglial activation. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of microglia from the substantia nigra and striatum uncovers increased pro-inflammatory signaling and reduced homeostatic responses in ASO mice compared to wild-type counterparts on standard diets. However, prebiotic feeding reverses pathogenic microglial states in ASO mice and promotes expansion of protective disease-associated macrophage (DAM) subsets of microglia. Notably, depletion of microglia using a CSF1R inhibitor eliminates the beneficial effects of prebiotics by restoring motor deficits to ASO mice despite feeding a prebiotic diet. These studies uncover a novel microglia-dependent interaction between diet and motor symptoms in mice, findings that may have implications for neuroinflammation and PD.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Gastrointestinal helminths increase Bordetella bronchiseptica shedding and host variation in supershedding</a></h4>

              
                Co-infected hosts, individuals that carry more than one infectious agent at any one time, have been suggested to facilitate pathogen transmission, including the emergence of supershedding events. However, how the host immune response mediates the interactions between co-infecting pathogens and how these affect the dynamics of shedding remains largely unclear. We used laboratory experiments and a modeling approach to examine temporal changes in the shedding of the respiratory bacterium <i>Bordetella bronchiseptica</i> in rabbits with one or two gastrointestinal helminth species. Experimental data showed that rabbits co-infected with one or both helminths shed significantly more <i>B. bronchiseptica</i>, by direct contact with an agar petri dish, than rabbits with bacteria alone. Co-infected hosts generated supershedding events of higher intensity and more frequently than hosts with no helminths. To explain this variation in shedding an infection-immune model was developed and fitted to rabbits of each group. Simulations suggested that differences in the magnitude and duration of shedding could be explained by the effect of the two helminths on the relative contribution of neutrophils and specific IgA and IgG to <i>B. bronchiseptica</i> neutralization in the respiratory tract. However, the interactions between infection and immune response at the scale of analysis that we used could not capture the rapid variation in the intensity of shedding of every rabbit. We suggest that fast and local changes at the level of respiratory tissue probably played a more important role. This study indicates that co-infected hosts are important source of variation in shedding, and provides a quantitative explanation into the role of helminths to the dynamics of respiratory bacterial infections.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The molecular basis of socially induced egg size plasticity in honey bees</a></h4>

              
                Reproduction involves the investment of resources into offspring. Although variation in reproductive effort often affects the number of offspring, adjustments of propagule size are also found in numerous species, including the Western honey bee, <i>Apis mellifera</i>. However, the proximate causes of these adjustments are insufficiently understood, especially in oviparous species with complex social organization in which adaptive evolution is shaped by kin selection. Here, we show in a series of experiments that queens predictably and reversibly increase egg size in small colonies and decrease egg size in large colonies, while their ovary size changes in the opposite direction. Additional results suggest that these effects cannot solely explained by egg laying rate and are due to the queens' perception of colony size. Egg size plasticity is associated with quantitative changes of 290 ovarian proteins, most of which relate to energy metabolism, protein transport, and cytoskeleton. Based on functional and network analyses, we further study the small GTPase Rho1 as a candidate regulator of egg size. Spatio-temporal expression analysis via RNAscope® and qPCR supports an important role of <i>Rho1</i> in egg size determination, and subsequent RNAi-mediated gene knock-down confirmed that <i>Rho1</i> has a major effect on egg size in honey bees. These results elucidate how the social environment of the honey bee colony may be translated into a specific cellular process to adjust maternal investment into eggs. It remains to be studied how widespread this mechanism is and whether it has consequences for population dynamics and epigenetic influences on offspring phenotype in honey bees and other species.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Spatiotemporal properties of glutamate input support direction selectivity in the dendrites of retinal starburst amacrine cells</a></h4>

              
                The asymmetric summation of kinetically distinct glutamate inputs across the dendrites of retinal 'starburst' amacrine cells is one of the several mechanisms that have been proposed to underlie their direction-selective properties, but experimentally verifying input kinetics has been a challenge. Here, we used two-photon glutamate sensor (iGluSnFR) imaging to directly measure the input kinetics across individual starburst dendrites. We found that signals measured from proximal dendrites were relatively sustained compared to those measured from distal dendrites. These differences were observed across a range of stimulus sizes and appeared to be shaped mainly by excitatory rather than inhibitory network interactions. Temporal deconvolution analysis suggests that the steady-state vesicle release rate was ~ 3 times larger at proximal sites compared to distal sites. Using a connectomics-inspired computational model, we demonstrate that input kinetics play an important role in shaping direction selectivity at low stimulus velocities. Together, these results provide direct support for the 'space-time wiring' model for direction selectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modeling and mechanical perturbations reveal how spatially regulated anchorage gives rise to spatially distinct mechanics across the mammalian spindle</a></h4>

              
                During cell division, the spindle generates force to move chromosomes. In mammals, microtubule bundles called kinetochore-fibers (k-fibers) attach to and segregate chromosomes. To do so, k-fibers must be robustly anchored to the dynamic spindle. We previously developed microneedle manipulation to mechanically challenge k-fiber anchorage, and observed spatially distinct response features revealing the presence of heterogeneous anchorage (Suresh et al., 2020). How anchorage is precisely spatially regulated, and what forces are necessary and sufficient to recapitulate the k-fiber’s response to force remain unclear. Here, we develop a coarse-grained k-fiber model and combine with manipulation experiments to infer underlying anchorage using shape analysis. By systematically testing different anchorage schemes, we find that forces solely at k-fiber ends are sufficient to recapitulate unmanipulated k-fiber shapes, but not manipulated ones for which lateral anchorage over a 3 μm length scale near chromosomes is also essential. Such anchorage robustly preserves k-fiber orientation near chromosomes while allowing pivoting around poles. Anchorage over a shorter length scale cannot robustly restrict pivoting near chromosomes, while anchorage throughout the spindle obstructs pivoting at poles. Together, this work reveals how spatially regulated anchorage gives rise to spatially distinct mechanics in the mammalian spindle, which we propose are key for function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sampling motion trajectories during hippocampal theta sequences</a></h4>

              
                Efficient planning in complex environments requires that uncertainty associated with current inferences and possible consequences of forthcoming actions is represented. Representation of uncertainty has been established in sensory systems during simple perceptual decision making tasks but it remains unclear if complex cognitive computations such as planning and navigation are also supported by probabilistic neural representations. Here, we capitalized on gradually changing uncertainty along planned motion trajectories during hippocampal theta sequences to capture signatures of uncertainty representation in population responses. In contrast with prominent theories, we found no evidence of encoding parameters of probability distributions in the momentary population activity recorded in an open-field navigation task in rats. Instead, uncertainty was encoded sequentially by sampling motion trajectories randomly and efficiently in subsequent theta cycles from the distribution of potential trajectories. Our analysis is the first to demonstrate that the hippocampus is well equipped to contribute to optimal planning by representing uncertainty.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Targeted genomic sequencing with probe capture for discovery and surveillance of coronaviruses in bats</a></h4>

              
                Public health emergencies like SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 have prioritized surveillance of zoonotic coronaviruses, resulting in extensive genomic characterization of coronavirus diversity in bats. Sequencing viral genomes directly from animal specimens remains a laboratory challenge, however, and most bat coronaviruses have been characterized solely by PCR amplification of small regions from the best-conserved gene. This has resulted in limited phylogenetic resolution and left viral genetic factors relevant to threat assessment undescribed. In this study, we evaluated whether a technique called hybridization probe capture can achieve more extensive genome recovery from surveillance specimens. Using a custom panel of 20,000 probes, we captured and sequenced coronavirus genomic material in 21 swab specimens collected from bats in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. For 15 of these specimens, probe capture recovered more genome sequence than had been previously generated with standard amplicon sequencing protocols, providing a median 6.1-fold improvement (ranging up to 69.1-fold). Probe capture data also identified five novel <i>alpha-</i> and <i>betacoronaviruses</i> in these specimens, and their full genomes were recovered with additional deep sequencing. Based on these experiences, we discuss how probe capture could be effectively operationalized alongside other sequencing technologies for high-throughput, genomics-based discovery and surveillance of bat coronaviruses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Two neuronal peptides encoded from a single transcript regulate mitochondrial complex III in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Naturally produced peptides (&lt;100 amino acids) are important regulators of physiology, development, and metabolism. Recent studies have predicted that thousands of peptides may be translated from transcripts containing small open reading frames (smORFs). Here, we describe two peptides in <i>Drosophila</i> encoded by conserved smORFs, Sloth1 and Sloth2. These peptides are translated from the same bicistronic transcript and share sequence similarities, suggesting that they encode paralogs. Yet, Sloth1 and Sloth2 are not functionally redundant, and loss of either peptide causes animal lethality, reduced neuronal function, impaired mitochondrial function, and neurodegeneration. We provide evidence that Sloth1/2 are highly expressed in neurons, imported to mitochondria, and regulate mitochondrial complex III assembly. These results suggest that phenotypic analysis of smORF genes in <i>Drosophila</i> can provide a wealth of information on the biological functions of this poorly characterized class of genes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Connexin 43 hemichannels regulate mitochondrial ATP generation, mobilization, and mitochondrial homeostasis against oxidative stress</a></h4>

              
                Oxidative stress is a major risk factor that causes osteocyte cell death and bone loss. Prior studies primarily focus on the function of cell surface expressed Cx43 channels. Here, we reported a new role of mitochondrial Cx43 (mtCx43) and hemichannels (HCs) in modulating mitochondria homeostasis and function in bone osteocytes under oxidative stress. In murine long bone osteocyte-Y4 cells, the translocation of Cx43 to mitochondria was increased under H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increased the mtCx43 level accompanied by elevated mtCx43 HC activity, determined by dye uptake assay. Cx43 knockdown (KD) by the CRISPR-Cas9 lentivirus system resulted in impairment of mitochondrial function, primarily manifested as decreased ATP production. Cx43 KD had reduced intracellular reactive oxidative species levels and mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, live-cell imaging results demonstrated that the proton flux was dependent on mtCx43 HCs because its activity was specifically inhibited by an antibody targeting Cx43 C-terminus. The co-localization and interaction of mtCx43 and ATP synthase subunit F (ATP5J2) were confirmed by Förster resonance energy transfer and a protein pull-down assay. Together, our study suggests that mtCx43 HCs regulate mitochondrial ATP generation by mediating K<sup>+</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>, and ATP transfer across the mitochondrial inner membrane and the interaction with mitochondrial ATP synthase, contributing to the maintenance of mitochondrial redox levels in response to oxidative stress.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">LRG1 is an adipokine that promotes insulin sensitivity and suppresses inflammation</a></h4>

              
                While dysregulation of adipocyte endocrine function plays a central role in obesity and its complications, the vast majority of adipokines remain uncharacterized. We employed bio-orthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) and mass spectrometry to comprehensively characterize the secretome of murine visceral and subcutaneous white and interscapular brown adipocytes. Over 600 proteins were identified, the majority of which showed cell type-specific enrichment. We here describe a metabolic role for leucine-rich α-2 glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) as an obesity-regulated adipokine secreted by mature adipocytes. LRG1 overexpression significantly improved glucose homeostasis in diet-induced and genetically obese mice. This was associated with markedly reduced white adipose tissue macrophage accumulation and systemic inflammation. Mechanistically, we found LRG1 binds cytochrome <i>c</i> in circulation to dampen its pro-inflammatory effect. These data support a new role for LRG1 as an insulin sensitizer with therapeutic potential given its immunomodulatory function at the nexus of obesity, inflammation, and associated pathology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Integrative modeling reveals the molecular architecture of the intraflagellar transport A (IFT-A) complex</a></h4>

              
                Intraflagellar transport (IFT) is a conserved process of cargo transport in cilia that is essential for development and homeostasis in organisms ranging from algae to vertebrates. In humans, variants in genes encoding subunits of the cargo-adapting IFT-A and IFT-B protein complexes are a common cause of genetic diseases known as ciliopathies. While recent progress has been made in determining the atomic structure of IFT-B, little is known of the structural biology of IFT-A. Here, we combined chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry and cryo-electron tomography with AlphaFold2-based prediction of both protein structures and interaction interfaces to model the overall architecture of the monomeric six-subunit IFT-A complex, as well as its polymeric assembly within cilia. We define monomer-monomer contacts and membrane-associated regions available for association with transported cargo, and we also use this model to provide insights into the pleiotropic nature of human ciliopathy-associated genetic variants in genes encoding IFT-A subunits. Our work demonstrates the power of integration of experimental and computational strategies both for multi-protein structure determination and for understanding the etiology of human genetic disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An essential periplasmic protein coordinates lipid trafficking and is required for asymmetric polar growth in mycobacteria</a></h4>

              
                Mycobacteria, including the human pathogen <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, grow by inserting new cell wall material at their poles. This process and that of division are asymmetric, producing a phenotypically heterogeneous population of cells that respond non-uniformly to stress (Aldridge et al., 2012; Rego et al., 2017; Richardson et al., 2016). Surprisingly, deletion of a single gene - <i>lamA</i> - leads to more symmetry, and to a population of cells that is more uniformly killed by antibiotics (Rego et al., 2017). How does LamA create asymmetry? Here, using a combination of quantitative time-lapse imaging, bacterial genetics, and lipid profiling, we find that LamA recruits essential proteins involved in cell wall synthesis to one side of the cell - the old pole. One of these proteins, MSMEG_0317, here renamed PgfA, was of unknown function. We show that PgfA is a periplasmic protein that interacts with MmpL3, an essential transporter that flips mycolic acids in the form of trehalose monomycolate (TMM), across the plasma membrane. PgfA interacts with a TMM analog suggesting a direct role in TMM transport. Yet our data point to a broader function as well, as cells with altered PgfA levels have differences in the abundance of other lipids and are differentially reliant on those lipids for survival. Overexpression of PgfA, but not MmpL3, restores growth at the old poles in cells missing <i>lamA</i>. Together, our results suggest that PgfA is a key determinant of polar growth and cell envelope composition in mycobacteria, and that the LamA-mediated recruitment of this protein to one side of the cell is a required step in the establishment of cellular asymmetry.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Selective oxytocin receptor activation prevents prefrontal circuit dysfunction and social behavioral alterations in response to chronic prefrontal cortex activation in rats</a></h4>

              
                Social behavioral changes are a hallmark of several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions, nevertheless the underlying neural substrates of such dysfunction remain poorly understood. Building evidence points to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as one of the key brain regions that orchestrates social behavior. We used this concept with the aim to develop a translational rat model of social-circuit dysfunction, the chronic PFC activation model (CPA). Chemogenetic designer receptor hM3Dq was used to induce chronic activation of the PFC over 10 days, and the behavioral and electrophysiological signatures of prolonged PFC hyperactivity were evaluated. To test the sensitivity of this model to pharmacological interventions on longer timescales, and validate its translational potential, the rats were treated with our novel highly selective oxytocin receptor (OXTR) agonist RO6958375, which has a significantly improved pharmacokinetic profile over oxytocin. CPA rats showed reduced sociability in the three-chamber sociability test, and a concomitant decrease in neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission within the PFC as measured by electrophysiological recordings in acute slice preparation. Sub-chronic treatment with a low dose of the novel OXTR agonist following CPA interferes with the emergence of PFC circuit dysfunction, abnormal social behavior and specific transcriptomic changes. These results demonstrate that sustained PFC hyperactivity modifies circuit characteristics and social behaviors in ways that can be modulated by selective oxytocin receptor activation and that this model may be used to understand the circuit recruitment of prosocial therapies in drug discovery.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">On why we lack confidence in signal-detection-based analyses of confidence</a></h4>

              
                Signal detection theory (SDT) is one of the most popular frameworks for analysing data from studies of human behaviour, including investigations of confidence. SDT based analyses of confidence deliver both standard estimates of sensitivity (d prime), and a second estimate based only on high confidence decisions, meta d prime. The extent to which meta d prime estimates fall short of d prime estimates is regarded as a measure of metacognitive inefficiency, quantifying the contamination of confidence by additional noise. These analyses rely on a key but questionable assumption, that repeated exposures to an input will evoke a normally shaped distribution of perceptual experiences (the normality assumption). Here we show, via analyses inspired by an experiment and modelling, that when distributions of experiences do not conform with the normality assumption, meta d prime can be systematically underestimated relative to d prime. Our data highlight that SDT based analyses of confidence do not provide a ground truth measure of human metacognitive inefficiency.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptional control of motor pool formation and motor circuit connectivity by the LIM-HD protein Isl2</a></h4>

              
                The fidelity of motor control requires the precise positional arrangement of motor pools and the establishment of synaptic connections between these pools. In the developing spinal cord, motor nerves project to specific target muscles and receive proprioceptive input from the muscles via the sensorimotor circuit. LIM-homeodomain transcription factors are known to successively restrict specific motor neuronal fates during neural development; however, it remains unclear to what extent they contribute to limb-based motor pools and locomotor circuits. Here, we showed in mice that deletion of Isl2 resulted in scattered motor pools, primarily in the median motor column and lateral LMC (LMCl) populations, and lacked Pea3 expression in the hindlimb motor pools, accompanied by reduced terminal axon branching and disorganized neuromuscular junctions. Transcriptomic analysis of Isl2-deficient spinal cords revealed that a variety of genes involved in motor neuron differentiation, axon development, and synapse organization were downregulated in hindlimb motor pools. Moreover, the loss of Isl2 impaired sensorimotor connectivity and hindlimb locomotion. Together, our studies indicate that Isl2 plays a critical role in organizing motor pool position and sensorimotor circuits in hindlimb motor pools.

                Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is the most common cause of failure of retinal reattachment surgery and the molecular changes leading to this aberrant wound healing process is currently unknown. We aimed to study PVR pathogenesis using single-cell transcriptomics to dissect cellular heterogeneity in a rabbit PVR model. PVR was induced unilaterally in Dutch Belted rabbits. At different timepoints following PVR induction, retinas were dissociated into either cells or nuclei suspension and processed for single-cell or single-nucleus RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq or snRNA-seq). ScRNA-Seq and snRNA-Seq were conducted on retinas at 4 hours and 14 days after disease induction. While the capture rate of unique molecular identifiers (UMI) and genes were greater in scRNA-seq samples, overall gene expression profiles of individual cell types were highly correlated between scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq. A major disparity between the two sequencing modalities is the cell type capture rate, however, with glial cell types over-represented in scRNA-seq, and inner retinal neurons were enriched by snRNA-seq. Furthermore, fibrotic Muller glia were over-represented in snRNA-seq samples, while reactive Muller glia were in scRNA-seq samples. Trajectory analyses were similar between the two methods, allowing for the combined analysis of the scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq datasets. These findings highlight limitations of both scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq analysis and imply that use of both techniques can more accurately identify transcriptional networks critical for aberrant fibrogenesis in PVR.

	<p>Previous research has shown that changes in the scenarios in which something is learned and recalled, respectively, may result in a subpar performance in memory recollection. The current study aimed to evaluate how changes in the visuo-perceptual environmental learning context impact incidental vocabulary learning. To this end, a highly immersive virtual reality setting was created, and participants were required to read eight distinct stories visually presented to them. A novel word was delivered twice in every paragraph and embedded in each story. Stories could be displayed either in a high variability condition, where each paragraph was shown in a new environment context (four different classrooms) or in a low variability condition, where each paragraph was shown in the same context. The findings obtained across four assessment tasks (free recall, recognition, picture matching, and sentence completion) demonstrated that significant visuo-perceptual variability did not bring about any disadvantages in word learning. Thus, perceptual information from a physically diverse environment could provide a variety of instructional and educational beneficial possibilities in the absence of a learning disadvantage.</p>

	<p>Apelin is a 77-amino-acid peptide that is an endogenous ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor APJ (Apelin receptor, APJ). Apelin-13, as the most bioactive affinity fragment of apelin, plays a role in energy metabolism, myocardial ischemia&amp;amp;#8210;reperfusion injury, and the regulation of the inflammatory response during oxidative stress, but its role in spinal cord injury is still unclear. This research identified and verified the differential expression of apelin in rat spinal cord injured tissues and normal spinal cord tissues by transcriptome sequencing in vivo and proved that apelin-13 protects neurons by strengthening autophagy and attenuating early-stage postspinal cord injury apoptosis in vitro. After constructing the model concerning a rat spinal cord hemisection damage, transcriptome sequencing was performed on the injured and normal spinal cord tissues of rats, which identified the differentially expressed gene apelin, with qRT-PCR detecting the representative level of apelin. The oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model of PC12 cells was constructed in vitro to simulate spinal cord injury. The OGD injury times were 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, and 12 h, and the non-OGD injury group was used as the control. The expression of apelin at each time point was observed by Western blotting. The expression of apelin was the lowest in the 6 h OGD injury group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Therefore, the OGD injury time of 6 h was used in subsequent experiments. The noncytotoxic drug concentration of apelin-13 was determined with a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. An appropriate dose of apelin-13 (1 &amp;amp;mu;M) significantly improved cell survival (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Thus, subsequent experiments selected a concentration of 1 &amp;amp;mu;M apelin-13 as it significantly increased cell viability. Finally, we divided the experimental groups into four groups according to whether they received drugs (1 &amp;amp;mu;M apelin-13, 24 h) or OGD (6 h): (1) control group: without apelin-13 or OGD injury; (2) apelin-13 group: with apelin-13 but no OGD injury; (3) OGD group: with OGD injury but without apelin-13; and (4) OGD + apelin-13 group: with apelin-13 and OGD injury. The TUNEL assay and flow cytometry results showed that compared with the OGD group, apoptosis in the OGD+Apelin-13 group was significantly reduced (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Determination of cell viability under different conditions by CCK-8 assay results displays that Apelin-13 can significantly improve the cell viability percentage under OGD conditions (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Western blotting results showed that apelin-13 decreased the expression ratios of apoptosis-related proteins Bax/Bcl-2 and cleaved-caspase3/caspase3 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), increasing the key to Beclin1-dependent autophagy pathway expression of the protein Beclin1. This finding indicates that apelin-13 protects neurons by strengthening autophagy and attenuating early-stage postspinal cord injury apoptosis in vitro.</p>

	<p>This study explored the effect of electroencephalographic infraslow neurofeedback (EEG ISF-NF) training on effective connectivity and tested whether such effective connectivity changes are correlated with changes in pain and disability in people with chronic low back pain. This involved secondary analysis of a pilot double-blinded randomised placebo-controlled study. Participants (n = 60) were randomised to receive ISF-NF targeting either the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), dorsal anterior cingulate and somatosensory cortex (dACC + S1), ratio of pgACC*2/dACC + S1, or Sham-NF. Resting-state EEG and clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline, immediately after intervention, and at one-week and one-month follow-up. Kruskal&amp;amp;ndash;Wallis tests demonstrated significant between-group differences in effective connectivity from pgACC to S1L at one-month follow up and marginal significant changes from S1L to pgACC at one-week and one-month follow up. Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U tests demonstrated significant increases in effective connectivity in the ISF-NF up-training pgACC group when compared to the Sham-NF group (pgACC to S1L at one-month (p = 0.013), and S1L to pgACC at one-week (p = 0.008) and one-month follow up (p = 0.016)). Correlational analyses demonstrated a significant negative correlation (&amp;amp;rho; = &amp;amp;minus;0.630, p = 0.038) between effective connectivity changes from pgACC to S1L and changes in pain severity at one-month follow-up. The ISF-NF training pgACC can reduce pain via influencing effective connectivity between pgACC and S1L.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Approximately one-third of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) do not experience sustained remission with current treatments. Presently, astrocytes, i.e., glial cells that act as key regulators of neuroinflammation, have been a target for therapeutic development. Research regarding their role in the neuropathology of BD is limited. We conducted a scoping review on evidence linking astrocytes to the pathology of BD. (2) Methods: The search was conducted in MEDLINE for studies published from inception to August 2022. Studies of interest were data-extracted and reported based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Protocols. (3) Results: Overall, 650 publications were identified, of which 122 full texts were evaluated and 12 included. Four were in vitro, seven were ex vivo, and one study was both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro investigations focused on plasma levels of neuroinflammatory biomarkers S100B and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Ex vivo investigations were post-mortem brain studies assessing astrocytes in regions of interest (i.e., anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) using phosphorylated GFAP and ASCT-1. The in vivo and in vitro study evaluated morphological and chemical variations of YKL-40 between cohorts. (4) Conclusions: Reports indicate an association between astrocyte dysfunction and BD although larger studies are required to validate this association.</p>

	<p>Background: Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by impulsivity, affect instability, dysregulation, low self-image, and interpersonal difficulties. There are many instruments to measure traits of BPD, however, few can be administered quickly. The Screening Instrument for Borderline Personality Disorder (SI-Bord) is an instrument offering a brief administration time with comparable psychometric properties to more comprehensive measures. The present study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the SI-Bord in a healthy community-based sample and its relatedness to measures of social cognition. Methods: A community-based sample of participants completed an online survey consisting of measures of BPD traits and social cognition including: the Screening Instrument for Borderline Personality Disorder (SI-Bord), the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI), the Florida Affect Battery (FAB), the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), and the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI). Reliability was assessed using Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s alpha and inter-item correlations. Validity was assessed using factor analysis, examining associations with other measures of BPD traits, and examining associations with measures not measuring BPD traits. Results: 151 participants were included in the study. Participants&amp;amp;rsquo; age ranged from 20&amp;amp;ndash;76 (mean age of 38.79 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12.37) and comprised 76 females (50.33%) and 75 males (49.67%). Good internal consistency was found with a Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s alpha of 0.71. Good inter-item reliability was found with a mean inter-item cross correlation of 0.25, with each item of the SI-Bord showing an inter-item correlation coefficient of &amp;amp;gt;.5. Factor analysis identified good construct validity with a strong singular dimension explaining a large proportion of variance (Question 1). The SI-Bord showed good concurrent validity with significantly strong positive correlations with the subscales of the PAI borderline scale measuring affect instability (r = 0.60; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), identity problems (r = 0.67; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), negative relationships (r = 0.61; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), total score (r = 0.76; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and to a moderately strong positive correlation with self-harm (r = 0.39; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). The SI-Bord was not correlated with the NPI-16 (r = 0.131; p = 0.11), showing good divergent validity. Conclusions: These findings support the SI-Bord as a quick and useful screening tool for traits associated with BPD. Further clinical validation is warranted.</p>

                Background: The identification of differentially expressed genes and their associated biological processes, molecular function, and cellular components are important for genetic diseases studies because they present potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Methods: In this study, we developed an o²S²PARC template representing an interactive pipeline for the gene expression data visualization and ontologies data analysis and visualization.  To demonstrate the usefulness of the tool, we performed a case study on a publicly available dataset. Results: The tool enables users to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and visualize them in a volcano plot format. The ontologies associated with the DEGs are determined and visualized in barplots. Conclusions: The “Expression data visualization” template is publicly available on the o²S²PARC platform.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Professional qualifications of medical affairs pharmaceutical physicians and other internal stakeholders in the pharmaceutical industry [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Medical affairs pharmaceutical physicians (MAPPs) have unique value to pharmaceutical companies due to their accountability for activities that benefit regulators, payors, prescribers and patients. This study assessed whether MAPPs’ specialist training and education in pharmaceutical medicine could account for this level of value by determining whether there was significant variation in education and training between MAPPs and other internal stakeholders of pharmaceutical companies. Methods: A systematic search of LinkedIn profiles from the 10 pharmaceutical companies by revenue was conducted between June and October 2021. Job title and type and year of undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications were extracted. A one-sided Mann-Whitney test assessed for differences in the total number of qualifications between MAPPs and other internal stakeholders involved in medical affairs using MAPPs as the reference group. Other internal stakeholders included medical affairs pharmacists (MAPharm), other medical affairs professionals (MAOth), and market access (MAcc), commercial (COmm) and sales professionals. Sub-group analysis determined differences in undergraduate and postgraduate education. Results: In total, 524 profiles were included. Compared to all other internal stakeholders, MAPPs had a significantly higher number of undergraduate (p < 0.001) and postgraduate (MAPharm, p = 0.003; MAOth, p = 0.004; MAcc, COmm and Sales, p < 0.001) qualifications. Additionally, MAPPs had a significantly longer time to industry than other internal stakeholders apart from MAPharm. Of those with clinical qualifications, MAPPs were almost twice as likely to have business qualifications. Conclusions: Of all internal stakeholders, MAPPs had the highest number of qualifications and the best match between expertise and the contextual demands of decision-makers in the pharmaceutical industry. Pharmaceutical companies in the UK can use these findings to clarify role boundaries and decision-making power based on the nature and level of expertise of each internal stakeholder.
