              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dinosaur bonebed amber from an original swamp forest soil</a></h4>

              
                Dinosaur bonebeds with amber content, yet scarce, offer a superior wealth and quality of data on ancient terrestrial ecosystems. However, the preserved palaeodiversity and/or taphonomic characteristics of these exceptional localities had hitherto limited their palaeobiological potential. Here, we describe the amber from the Lower Cretaceous dinosaur bonebed of Ariño (Teruel, Spain) using a multidisciplinary approach. Amber is found in both a root layer with amber strictly in situ and a litter layer mainly composed of aerial pieces unusually rich in bioinclusions, encompassing 11 insect orders, arachnids, and a few plant and vertebrate remains, including a feather. Additional palaeontological data—charophytes, palynomorphs, ostracods— are provided. Ariño arguably represents the most prolific and palaeobiologically diverse locality in which fossiliferous amber and a dinosaur bonebed have been found in association, and the only one known where the vast majority of the palaeontological assemblage suffered no or low-grade pre-burial transport. This has unlocked unprecedentedly complete and reliable palaeoecological data out of two complementary windows of preservation—the bonebed and the amber—from the same site.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ovipositor and mouthparts in a fossil insect support a novel ecological role for early orthopterans in 300 million years old forests</a></h4>

              
                A high portion of the earliest known insect fauna is composed of the so-called ‘lobeattid insects’, whose systematic affinities and role as foliage feeders remain debated. We investigated hundreds of samples of a new lobeattid species from the Xiaheyan locality using a combination of photographic techniques, including reflectance transforming imaging, geometric morphometrics, and biomechanics to document its morphology, and infer its phylogenetic position and ecological role. <i>Ctenoptilus frequens</i> sp. nov. possessed a sword-shaped ovipositor with valves interlocked by two ball-and-socket mechanisms, lacked jumping hind-legs, and certain wing venation features. This combination of characters unambiguously supports lobeattids as stem relatives of all living Orthoptera (crickets, grasshoppers, katydids). Given the herein presented and other remains, it follows that this group experienced an early diversification and, additionally, occurred in high individual numbers. The ovipositor shape indicates that ground was the preferred substrate for eggs. Visible mouthparts made it possible to assess the efficiency of the mandibular food uptake system in comparison to a wide array of extant species. The new species was likely omnivorous which explains the paucity of external damage on contemporaneous plant foliage.

	<p>The aim of this study is to verify the conditions under which a series of visual stimuli (line segments) will be subjectively perceived as visual lines or surfaces employing four experiments. Two experiments were conducted with the method of subjective evaluation of the line segments, and the other two with the Osgood semantic differential. We analysed five variables (thickness, type, orientation, and colour) potentially responsible for the lines&amp;amp;rsquo; categorisation. The four experiments gave similar results: higher importance of the variables thickness and type; general lower significance of the variable colour; and general insignificance of the variable orientation. Interestingly, for the variable type, straight lines are evaluated as surfaces more frequently than curved lines and perceived as geometrical, flat, hard, static, rough, sharp, bound, sour, frigid, masculine, cold and passive. Curved lines are prevalently evaluated as lines, and categorised as organic, rounded, soft, dynamic, fluffy, blunt, free, sweet, sensual, feminine, warm and active. These results highlight the specificity of perceptual characteristics for the considered variables and confirm the relevance of the characteristics of variables such as thickness and type.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The primary olfactory centres of metazoans as diverse as arthropods and mammals consist of an array of fields of dense synaptic neuropil, the olfactory glomeruli. However, the neurochemical structure of crustacean olfactory glomeruli is largely understudied when compared to the insects. We analysed the glomerular architecture in selected species of hermit crabs using immunohistochemistry against presynaptic proteins, the neuropeptides orcokinin, RFamide and allatostatin, and the biogenic amine serotonin. Our study reveals an unexpected level of structural complexity, unmatched by what is found in the insect olfactory glomeruli. Peptidergic and aminergic interneurons provide the structural basis for a regionalization of the crustacean glomeruli into longitudinal and concentric compartments. Our data suggest that local olfactory interneurons take a central computational role in modulating the information transfer from olfactory sensory neurons to projection neurons within the glomeruli. Furthermore, we found yet unknown neuronal elements mediating lateral inhibitory interactions across the glomerular array that may play a central role in modulating the transfer of sensory input to the output neurons through presynaptic inhibition. Our study is another step in understanding the function of crustacean olfactory glomeruli as highly complex units of local olfactory processing.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Simulation software for spiking neuronal network models matured in the past decades regarding performance and flexibility. But the entry barrier remains high for students and early career scientists in computational neuroscience since these simulators typically require programming skills and a complex installation. Here, we describe an installation-free Graphical User Interface (GUI) running in the web browser, which is distinct from the simulation engine running anywhere, on the student&rsquo;s laptop or on a supercomputer. This architecture provides robustness against technological changes in the software stack and simplifies deployment for self-education and for teachers. Our new open-source tool, NEST Desktop, comprises graphical elements for creating and configuring network models, running simulations, and visualizing and analyzing the results. NEST Desktop allows students to explore important concepts in computational neuroscience without the need to learn a simulator control language before. Our experiences so far highlight that NEST Desktop helps advancing both quality and intensity of teaching in computational neuroscience in regular university courses. We view the availability of the tool on public resources like the European ICT infrastructure for neuroscience EBRAINS as a contribution to equal opportunities.</p>

                Background : This research aimed to examine and analyze risk factors for death, hematologic parameters and coagulation in COVID-19 patients at RSUD Dr. Soetomo Surabaya, one of the referral centers for probable COVID-19 patient cases in East Java. Method : This was a retrospective analytical study by taking secondary data on patients with probable COVID-19 cases who were treated in hospital isolation rooms from May to September, 2020. Result : Of 538 probable COVID-19 patients, 217 were tested positive, with an average age of 52.11±13.12 years, and there were 38 death cases. Hematologic parameters, such as white blood cell, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, showed significantly different result in the deceased group. On the other hand, coagulation parameters, consisting of D-dimer, CRP, PT, and aPTT showed significantly similar value in the deceased group. Univariate analysis concluded that chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, WBC, NLR, and PPT counts could predict the mortality, while multivariate analysis revealed that coronary heart disease was the only significant independent predictor of mortality. Conclusion : This research shows that hematologic and coagulation parameters increased in the majority of COVID-19 patients and the deceased group.  While the number of neutrophils and WBC increases, the number of lymphocytes decreases significantly as the disease gets more severe.. Coronary heart disease is an independent predictor of mortality.

                Introduction: Self-management (SM) interventions are complex interventions and one of the main components of high-quality chronic disease care for which the incorporation of the perspectives of patients and their informal caregivers is crucial. We aim to identify, appraise and synthesise the evidence exploring patients’ and caregivers’ perspectives on SM interventions. More precisely, we aim to 1) describe how they value the importance of outcomes of SM interventions, and 2) identify the factors that might impact on acceptability and feasibility of SM interventions based on their preferences and experiences. Methods and analysis: We will conduct four mixed-methods overviews as part of COMPAR-EU, a European Union (EU) funded project aimed to identify the most effective and cost-effective SM interventions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure (HF), obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We will search in MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO for systematic reviews of studies addressing patients’ preferences on outcomes, or their experiences with SM alongside their disease trajectory or with SM interventions, published in English. Selection of studies and data extraction will be conducted in pairs. We will assess the overlap of studies and methodological quality. We will follow a three-step synthesis process: 1) narrative synthesis for quantitative evidence, 2) thematic synthesis for qualitative evidence, and 3) integration of findings in the interpretation phase. Additionally, we will consult on the relevance of findings with patients and their caregivers. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO CRD42019117867

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dissecting cascade computational components in spiking neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shanshan Jia, Dajun Xing, Zhaofei Yu, Jian K. Liu</p>

Finding out the physical structure of neuronal circuits that governs neuronal responses is an important goal for brain research. With fast advances for large-scale recording techniques, identification of a neuronal circuit with multiple neurons and stages or layers becomes possible and highly demanding. Although methods for mapping the connection structure of circuits have been greatly developed in recent years, they are mostly limited to simple scenarios of a few neurons in a pairwise fashion; and dissecting dynamical circuits, particularly mapping out a complete functional circuit that converges to a single neuron, is still a challenging question. Here, we show that a recent method, termed spike-triggered non-negative matrix factorization (STNMF), can address these issues. By simulating different scenarios of spiking neural networks with various connections between neurons and stages, we demonstrate that STNMF is a persuasive method to dissect functional connections within a circuit. Using spiking activities recorded at neurons of the output layer, STNMF can obtain a complete circuit consisting of all cascade computational components of presynaptic neurons, as well as their spiking activities. For simulated simple and complex cells of the primary visual cortex, STNMF allows us to dissect the pathway of visual computation. Taken together, these results suggest that STNMF could provide a useful approach for investigating neuronal systems leveraging recorded functional neuronal activity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Binding induced functional domain motions in the argonaute characterized by adaptive advanced sampling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Danial Pourjafar-Dehkordi, Martin Zacharias</p>

Argonaute proteins in combination with short microRNA (miRNAs) can target mRNA molecules for translation inhibition or degradation and play a key role in many regulatory processes. The miRNAs act as guide RNAs that associate with Argonaute and the complementary mRNA target region. The complex formation results in activation of Argonaute and specific cleavage of the target mRNA. Both the binding and activation processes involve essential domain rearrangements of functional importance. For the <i>Thermus Thermophilus</i> Argonaute (TtAgo) system guide-bound (binary) and guide/target-bound (ternary) complexes are known but how the binding of guide and target mediate domain movements is still not understood. We have studied the Argonaute domain motion in apo and guide/target bound states using Molecular Dynamics simulations and a Hamiltonian replica exchange (H-REMD) method that employs a specific biasing potential to accelerate domain motions. The H-REMD technique indicates sampling of a much broader distribution of domain arrangements both in the apo as well as binary and ternary complexes compared to regular MD simulations. In the apo state domain arrangements corresponding to more compact (closed) states are mainly sampled which undergo an opening upon guide and guide/target binding. Whereas only limited overlap in domain geometry between apo and bound states was found, a larger similarity in the domain distribution is observed for the simulations of binary and ternary complexes. Comparative simulations on ternary complexes with 15 or 16 base pairs (bp) formed between guide and target strands (instead of 14) resulted in dissociation of the 3’-guide strand from the PAZ domain and domain rearrangement. This agrees with the experimental observation that guide-target pairing beyond 14 bps is required for activation and gives a mechanistic explanation for the experimentally observed activation process.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">HillTau: A fast, compact abstraction for model reduction in biochemical signaling networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Upinder S. Bhalla</p>

Signaling networks mediate many aspects of cellular function. The conventional, mechanistically motivated approach to modeling such networks is through mass-action chemistry, which maps directly to biological entities and facilitates experimental tests and predictions. However such models are complex, need many parameters, and are computationally costly. Here we introduce the HillTau form for signaling models. HillTau retains the direct mapping to biological observables, but it uses far fewer parameters, and is 100 to over 1000 times faster than ODE-based methods. In the HillTau formalism, the steady-state concentration of signaling molecules is approximated by the Hill equation, and the dynamics by a time-course <i>tau</i>. We demonstrate its use in implementing several biochemical motifs, including association, inhibition, feedforward and feedback inhibition, bistability, oscillations, and a synaptic switch obeying the BCM rule. The major use-cases for HillTau are system abstraction, model reduction, scaffolds for data-driven optimization, and fast approximations to complex cellular signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Crowd control: Reducing individual estimation bias by sharing biased social information</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bertrand Jayles, Clément Sire, Ralf H. J. M. Kurvers</p>

Cognitive biases are widespread in humans and animals alike, and can sometimes be reinforced by social interactions. One prime bias in judgment and decision-making is the human tendency to underestimate large quantities. Previous research on social influence in estimation tasks has generally focused on the impact of single estimates on individual and collective accuracy, showing that randomly sharing estimates does not reduce the underestimation bias. Here, we test a method of social information sharing that exploits the known relationship between the true value and the level of underestimation, and study if it can counteract the underestimation bias. We performed estimation experiments in which participants had to estimate a series of quantities twice, before and after receiving estimates from one or several group members. Our purpose was threefold: to study (i) whether restructuring the sharing of social information can reduce the underestimation bias, (ii) how the number of estimates received affects the sensitivity to social influence and estimation accuracy, and (iii) the mechanisms underlying the integration of multiple estimates. Our restructuring of social interactions successfully countered the underestimation bias. Moreover, we find that sharing more than one estimate also reduces the underestimation bias. Underlying our results are a human tendency to herd, to trust larger estimates than one’s own more than smaller estimates, and to follow disparate social information less. Using a computational modeling approach, we demonstrate that these effects are indeed key to explain the experimental results. Overall, our results show that existing knowledge on biases can be used to dampen their negative effects and boost judgment accuracy, paving the way for combating other cognitive biases threatening collective systems.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Sensory coding and contrast invariance emerge from the control of plastic inhibition over emergent selectivity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by René Larisch, Lorenz Gönner, Michael Teichmann, Fred H. Hamker</p>

Visual stimuli are represented by a highly efficient code in the primary visual cortex, but the development of this code is still unclear. Two distinct factors control coding efficiency: Representational efficiency, which is determined by neuronal tuning diversity, and metabolic efficiency, which is influenced by neuronal gain. How these determinants of coding efficiency are shaped during development, supported by excitatory and inhibitory plasticity, is only partially understood. We investigate a fully plastic spiking network of the primary visual cortex, building on phenomenological plasticity rules. Our results suggest that inhibitory plasticity is key to the emergence of tuning diversity and accurate input encoding. We show that inhibitory feedback (random and specific) increases the metabolic efficiency by implementing a gain control mechanism. Interestingly, this led to the spontaneous emergence of contrast-invariant tuning curves. Our findings highlight that (1) interneuron plasticity is key to the development of tuning diversity and (2) that efficient sensory representations are an emergent property of the resulting network.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A confirmation bias in perceptual decision-making due to hierarchical approximate inference</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Richard D. Lange, Ankani Chattoraj, Jeffrey M. Beck, Jacob L. Yates, Ralf M. Haefner</p>

Making good decisions requires updating beliefs according to new evidence. This is a dynamical process that is prone to biases: in some cases, beliefs become entrenched and resistant to new evidence (leading to primacy effects), while in other cases, beliefs fade over time and rely primarily on later evidence (leading to recency effects). How and why either type of bias dominates in a given context is an important open question. Here, we study this question in classic perceptual decision-making tasks, where, puzzlingly, previous empirical studies differ in the kinds of biases they observe, ranging from primacy to recency, despite seemingly equivalent tasks. We present a new model, based on hierarchical approximate inference and derived from normative principles, that not only explains both primacy and recency effects in existing studies, but also predicts how the type of bias should depend on the statistics of stimuli in a given task. We verify this prediction in a novel visual discrimination task with human observers, finding that each observer’s temporal bias changed as the result of changing the key stimulus statistics identified by our model. The key dynamic that leads to a primacy bias in our model is an overweighting of new sensory information that agrees with the observer’s existing belief—a type of ‘confirmation bias’. By fitting an extended drift-diffusion model to our data we rule out an alternative explanation for primacy effects due to bounded integration. Taken together, our results resolve a major discrepancy among existing perceptual decision-making studies, and suggest that a key source of bias in human decision-making is approximate hierarchical inference.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Protein domain-based prediction of drug/compound–target interactions and experimental validation on LIM kinases</a></h4>

Predictive approaches such as virtual screening have been used in drug discovery with the objective of reducing developmental time and costs. Current machine learning and network-based approaches have issues related to generalization, usability, or model interpretability, especially due to the complexity of target proteins’ structure/function, and bias in system training datasets. Here, we propose a new method “DRUIDom” (DRUg Interacting Domain prediction) to identify bio-interactions between drug candidate compounds and targets by utilizing the domain modularity of proteins, to overcome problems associated with current approaches. DRUIDom is composed of two methodological steps. First, ligands/compounds are statistically mapped to structural domains of their target proteins, with the aim of identifying their interactions. As such, other proteins containing the same mapped domain or domain pair become new candidate targets for the corresponding compounds. Next, a million-scale dataset of small molecule compounds, including those mapped to domains in the previous step, are clustered based on their molecular similarities, and their domain associations are propagated to other compounds within the same clusters. Experimentally verified bioactivity data points, obtained from public databases, are meticulously filtered to construct datasets of active/interacting and inactive/non-interacting drug/compound–target pairs (~2.9M data points), and used as training data for calculating parameters of compound–domain mappings, which led to 27,032 high-confidence associations between 250 domains and 8,165 compounds, and a finalized output of ~5 million new compound–protein interactions. DRUIDom is experimentally validated by syntheses and bioactivity analyses of compounds predicted to target LIM-kinase proteins, which play critical roles in the regulation of cell motility, cell cycle progression, and differentiation through actin filament dynamics. We showed that LIMK-inhibitor-2 and its derivatives significantly block the cancer cell migration through inhibition of LIMK phosphorylation and the downstream protein cofilin. One of the derivative compounds (LIMKi-2d) was identified as a promising candidate due to its action on resistant Mahlavu liver cancer cells. The results demonstrated that DRUIDom can be exploited to identify drug candidate compounds for intended targets and to predict new target proteins based on the defined compound–domain relationships. Datasets, results, and the source code of DRUIDom are fully-available at: https://github.com/cansyl/DRUIDom.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Integrating deep learning with microfluidics for biophysical classification of sickle red blood cells adhered to laminin</a></h4>

Sickle cell disease, a genetic disorder affecting a sizeable global demographic, manifests in sickle red blood cells (sRBCs) with altered shape and biomechanics. sRBCs show heightened adhesive interactions with inflamed endothelium, triggering painful vascular occlusion events. Numerous studies employ microfluidic-assay-based monitoring tools to quantify characteristics of adhered sRBCs from high resolution channel images. The current image analysis workflow relies on detailed morphological characterization and cell counting by a specially trained worker. This is time and labor intensive, and prone to user bias artifacts. Here we establish a morphology based classification scheme to identify two naturally arising sRBC subpopulations—deformable and non-deformable sRBCs—utilizing novel visual markers that link to underlying cell biomechanical properties and hold promise for clinically relevant insights. We then set up a standardized, reproducible, and fully automated image analysis workflow designed to carry out this classification. This relies on a two part deep neural network architecture that works in tandem for segmentation of channel images and classification of adhered cells into subtypes. Network training utilized an extensive data set of images generated by the SCD BioChip, a microfluidic assay which injects clinical whole blood samples into protein-functionalized microchannels, mimicking physiological conditions in the microvasculature. Here we carried out the assay with the sub-endothelial protein laminin. The machine learning approach segmented the resulting channel images with 99.1±0.3% mean IoU on the validation set across 5 <i>k</i>-folds, classified detected sRBCs with 96.0±0.3% mean accuracy on the validation set across 5 <i>k</i>-folds, and matched trained personnel in overall characterization of whole channel images with <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.992, 0.987 and 0.834 for total, deformable and non-deformable sRBC counts respectively. Average analysis time per channel image was also improved by two orders of magnitude (∼ 2 minutes vs ∼ 2-3 hours) over manual characterization. Finally, the network results show an order of magnitude less variance in counts on repeat trials than humans. This kind of standardization is a prerequisite for the viability of any diagnostic technology, making our system suitable for affordable and high throughput disease monitoring.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bayesian calibration of a stochastic, multiscale agent-based model for predicting in vitro tumor growth</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ernesto A. B. F. Lima, Danial Faghihi, Russell Philley, Jianchen Yang, John Virostko, Caleb M. Phillips, Thomas E. Yankeelov</p>

Hybrid multiscale agent-based models (ABMs) are unique in their ability to simulate individual cell interactions and microenvironmental dynamics. Unfortunately, the high computational cost of modeling individual cells, the inherent stochasticity of cell dynamics, and numerous model parameters are fundamental limitations of applying such models to predict tumor dynamics. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a coarse-grained two-scale ABM (cgABM) with a reduced parameter space that allows for an accurate and efficient calibration using a set of time-resolved microscopy measurements of cancer cells grown with different initial conditions. The multiscale model consists of a reaction-diffusion type model capturing the spatio-temporal evolution of glucose and growth factors in the tumor microenvironment (at tissue scale), coupled with a lattice-free ABM to simulate individual cell dynamics (at cellular scale). The experimental data consists of BT474 human breast carcinoma cells initialized with different glucose concentrations and tumor cell confluences. The confluence of live and dead cells was measured every three hours over four days. Given this model, we perform a time-dependent global sensitivity analysis to identify the relative importance of the model parameters. The subsequent cgABM is calibrated within a Bayesian framework to the experimental data to estimate model parameters, which are then used to predict the temporal evolution of the living and dead cell populations. To this end, a moment-based Bayesian inference is proposed to account for the stochasticity of the cgABM while quantifying uncertainties due to limited temporal observational data. The cgABM reduces the computational time of ABM simulations by 93% to 97% while staying within a 3% difference in prediction compared to ABM. Additionally, the cgABM can reliably predict the temporal evolution of breast cancer cells observed by the microscopy data with an average error and standard deviation for live and dead cells being 7.61±2.01 and 5.78±1.13, respectively.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Estimating the dimensionality of the manifold underlying multi-electrode neural recordings</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ege Altan, Sara A. Solla, Lee E. Miller, Eric J. Perreault</p>

It is generally accepted that the number of neurons in a given brain area far exceeds the number of neurons needed to carry any specific function controlled by that area. For example, motor areas of the human brain contain tens of millions of neurons that control the activation of tens or at most hundreds of muscles. This massive redundancy implies the covariation of many neurons, which constrains the population activity to a low-dimensional manifold within the space of all possible patterns of neural activity. To gain a conceptual understanding of the complexity of the neural activity within a manifold, it is useful to estimate its dimensionality, which quantifies the number of degrees of freedom required to describe the observed population activity without significant information loss. While there are many algorithms for dimensionality estimation, we do not know which are well suited for analyzing neural activity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of several representative algorithms for estimating the dimensionality of linearly and nonlinearly embedded data. We generated synthetic neural recordings with known intrinsic dimensionality and used them to test the algorithms’ accuracy and robustness. We emulated some of the important challenges associated with experimental data by adding noise, altering the nature of the embedding of the low-dimensional manifold within the high-dimensional recordings, varying the dimensionality of the manifold, and limiting the amount of available data. We demonstrated that linear algorithms overestimate the dimensionality of nonlinear, noise-free data. In cases of high noise, most algorithms overestimated the dimensionality. We thus developed a denoising algorithm based on deep learning, the “Joint Autoencoder”, which significantly improved subsequent dimensionality estimation. Critically, we found that all algorithms failed when the intrinsic dimensionality was high (above 20) or when the amount of data used for estimation was low. Based on the challenges we observed, we formulated a pipeline for estimating the dimensionality of experimental neural data.

                Quality control of genomic data is an essential but complicated multi-step procedure, often requiring separate installation and expert familiarity with a combination of different bioinformatics tools. Software incompatibilities, and inconsistencies across computing environments, are recurrent challenges, leading to poor reproducibility. Existing semi-automated or automated solutions lack comprehensive quality checks, flexible workflow architecture, and user control. To address these challenges, we have developed snpQT: a scalable, stand-alone software pipeline using nextflow and BioContainers, for comprehensive, reproducible and interactive quality control of human genomic data. snpQT offers some 36 discrete quality filters or correction steps in a complete standardised pipeline, producing graphical reports to demonstrate the state of data before and after each quality control procedure. This includes human genome build conversion, population stratification against data from the 1,000 Genomes Project, automated population outlier removal, and built-in imputation with its own pre- and post- quality controls. Common input formats are used, and a synthetic dataset and comprehensive online tutorial are provided for testing, educational purposes, and demonstration. The snpQT pipeline is designed to run with minimal user input and coding experience; quality control steps are implemented with numerous user-modifiable thresholds, and workflows can be flexibly combined in custom combinations. snpQT is open source and freely available at https://github.com/nebfield/snpQT. A comprehensive online tutorial and installation guide is provided through to GWAS (https://snpqt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), introducing snpQT using a synthetic demonstration dataset and a real-world Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis SNP-array dataset.

                Background: Plant products, including seeds are an important source of vitamins, minerals, proteins, and energy. This study aimed to assess parasitic contaminations in roasted groundnuts, nabag, and tasali (watermelon seeds) sold by street vendors in Khartoum State, Sudan. Methods: The frequency of parasitic contaminations among all crop products was detected by washing the plants with saline, and then conducting an examination using a formal ether concentration technique (FECT), followed by a saturated sugar floatation technique. Results: The detected parasites belonged to two species: Entamoeba histolytica (33.3%) and Giardia lamblia (15.6%). No helminthic parasites were detected. Mixed contamination of the mentioned parasites was also observed (11.1%). The most contaminated crop was nabag, followed by groundnut, and finally tasali. Conclusion: No relation was established between the positivity of samples for parasites and crop type, Khartoum State city, or  seller sex. FECT was more sensitive than the saturated sugar floatation technique as a detection method.

                Background: This qualitative study investigates the experiences of international students’ exchange who faced difficulties in adjusting to their new environment. They experienced awkwardness in the use of advanced equipment from technology and in various cultural aspects. This study investigates two Indonesian students who participated for a semester at a Taiwanese university. It aims to explore the Indonesian student exchange program awardees’ experiences by examining both the obstacles and benefits of attending the Taiwanese university. Methods: This study used qualitative data analysis. Data were collected through a semi-structured interview, informal participant observations, and a set of open and closed-ended questions. Two Indonesian undergraduate students who belonged to the same major, year, and university were recruited to participate in this study. Results: Challenges and Benefits are the two major themes in this research. Challenges include: (1) Departure and journey; (2) Difficulties in settling in; (3) Inability to use technology facilities. Benefits include: (1) Meeting new people and exploring new places; and (2) 21st-century classroom environments. Conclusions: Despite the challenges that are associated with being students exchange awardee, there are vast opportunities for self-development and learning that is associated with teaching from the 21st-century classroom pedagogy.

                Background: Osteoporosis is the most prevalent metabolic disease affecting bones. Objective: To investigate the long-term effect of pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) combined with exercise protocol on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone markers in men with osteopenia or osteoporosis. Methods: Ninety-five males with osteopenia or osteoporosis (mean age, 51.26 ± 2.41 years; mean height, 176 ± 2.02 cm; mean weight, 83.08 ± 2.60 kg; mean body–mass index (BMI), 26.08 ± 1.09 kg/m2) participated in the study, and they were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Group 1 received a full-body PEMF and exercise protocol (PEMF +EX), Group 2 received a placebo full-body PEMF and exercise protocol (PPEMF +EX), and Group 3 received a full-body PEMF alone (PEMF). PEMF was applied for the whole body using a full-body mat three times per week for 12 weeks, with an exercise protocol that includes flexibility, aerobic exercise, strengthening, weight-bearing, and balance exercises followed by whole-body vibration (WBV) training. Outcome measures include BMD of total hip and lumbar spine and bone markers [serum osteocalcin (s-OC), Serum amino-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (s-NTX), Serum carboxy-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (s-CTX), Parathyroid hormones (PTH), Bone-specific Alkaline Phosphatase (BSAP), and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (Vit D)]. Results: The BMD of total hip and lumbar spine was significantly increased post-treatment in all groups, and more so in Group 1 and Group 2 than Group 3. There was a significant difference in bone markers in all groups, more so in Group 1 and Group 2 than in Group 3. Conclusion: PEMF combined with exercise protocol exerts a potent role for treating OP, is more effective than exercise and PEMF alone for increasing BMD and enhancing bone formation, and suppresses bone-resorption markers after 12-weeks of treatment with the impact lasting up to 6 months.

                Knowledge graph (KG) publishes machine-readable representation of knowledge on the Web. Structured data in the knowledge graph is published using Resource Description Framework (RDF) where knowledge is represented as a triple (subject, predicate, object). Due to the presence of erroneous, outdated or conflicting data in the knowledge graph, the quality of facts cannot be guaranteed. Trustworthiness of facts in knowledge graph can be enhanced by the addition of metadata like the source of information, location and time of the fact occurrence. Since RDF does not support metadata for providing provenance and contextualization, an alternate method, RDF reification is employed by most of the knowledge graphs. RDF reification increases the magnitude of data as several statements are required to represent a single fact. Another limitation for applications that uses provenance data like in the medical domain and in cyber security is that not all facts in these knowledge graphs are annotated with provenance data. In this paper, we have provided an overview of prominent reification approaches together with the analysis of popular, general knowledge graphs Wikidata and YAGO4 with regard to the representation of provenance and context data. Wikidata employs qualifiers to include metadata to facts, while YAGO4 collects metadata from Wikidata qualifiers. However, facts in Wikidata and YAGO4 can be fetched without using reification to cater for applications that do not require metadata. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that investigates the method and the extent of metadata covered by two prominent KGs, Wikidata and YAGO4.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although the presymptomatic stages of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) provide a unique chance to delay or even prevent neurodegeneration by early intervention, they remain poorly defined. Leveraging a large multicenter cohort of genetic FTD mutation carriers, we provide a biomarker-based stratification and biomarker cascade of the likely most treatment-relevant stage within the presymptomatic phase: the conversion stage.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We longitudinally assessed serum levels of neurofilament light (NfL) and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy (pNfH) in the Genetic FTD Initiative (GENFI) cohort (n = 444), using single-molecule array technique. Subjects comprised 91 symptomatic and 179 presymptomatic subjects with mutations in the FTD genes <i>C9orf72</i>, <i>GRN</i>, or <i>MAPT</i>, and 174 mutation-negative within-family controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In a biomarker cascade, NfL increase preceded the hypothetical clinical onset by 15 years and concurred with brain atrophy onset, whereas pNfH increase started close to clinical onset. The conversion stage was marked by increased NfL, but still normal pNfH levels, while both were increased at the symptomatic stage. Intra-individual change rates were increased for NfL at the conversion stage and for pNfH at the symptomatic stage, highlighting their respective potential as stage-dependent dynamic biomarkers within the biomarker cascade. Increased NfL levels and NfL change rates allowed identification of presymptomatic subjects converting to symptomatic disease and capture of proximity-to-onset. We estimate stage-dependent sample sizes for trials aiming to decrease neurofilament levels or change rates.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Blood NfL and pNfH provide dynamic stage-dependent stratification and, potentially, treatment response biomarkers in presymptomatic FTD, allowing demarcation of the conversion stage. The proposed biomarker cascade might pave the way towards a biomarker-based precision medicine approach to genetic FTD. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the safety and effectiveness of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) versus vitamin K antagonists (VKA) after recent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) aged ≥85 years.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Individual patient data analysis from seven prospective stroke cohorts. We compared DOAC versus VKA treatment among patients with AF and recent stroke (&lt;3 months) aged ≥85 versus &lt;85 years. Primary outcome was the composite of recurrent stroke, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and all-cause death. We used simple, adjusted, and weighted Cox regression to account for confounders. We calculated the net benefit of DOAC versus VKA by balancing stroke reduction against the weighted ICH risk.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In total, 5,984 of 6,267 (95.5%) patients were eligible for analysis. Of those, 1,380 (23%) were aged ≥85 years and 3,688 (62%) received a DOAC. During 6,874 patient-years follow-up, the impact of anticoagulant type (DOAC versus VKA) on the hazard for the composite outcome did not differ between patients aged ≥85 (HR<sub>≥85y</sub> = 0.65, 95%-CI [0.52, 0.81]) and &lt; 85 years (HR<sub>&lt;85y</sub> = 0.79, 95%-CI [0.66, 0.95]) in simple (p<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.129), adjusted (p<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.094) or weighted (p<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.512) models. Analyses on recurrent stroke, ICH and death separately were consistent with the primary analysis, as were sensitivity analyses using age dichotomized at 90 years and as a continuous variable. DOAC had a similar net clinical benefit in patients aged ≥85 (+1.73 to +2.66) and &lt; 85 years (+1.90 to +3.36 events/100 patient-years for ICH-weights 1.5 to 3.1).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The favorable profile of DOAC over VKA in patients with AF and recent stroke was maintained in the oldest old. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                Background Gura-Ferda forest is one of the Afromontane rainforests in the southwestern region of Ethiopia. However, since 1984, large parts of this forest have become increasingly disturbed and fragmented due to forest conversion into forest farm interface and farmlands. The study was conducted to assess changes of woody species diversity and carbon stock in association with the conversion of natural forest to forest farm interface and farmlands. Methods Data were collected from natural forest, forest farm interface and farmland which are historically forest lands before 1984. A total of 90 nested plots (20m×20m for natural forest and forest farm interface; 50m*100m for farmland)) were established for inventory of woody species. Three 1m×1m subplots were established to collect litter and soil samples. A total of 180 soil samples were collected. The total carbon stocks were estimated by summing carbon stock in the biomass and soil (0-60 cm depth). Results Results showed that Shannon-Wiener diversity (H’) in forest farm interface (H’ = 1.42±0.49) is significantly lower than that of natural forest (H’ = 2.72±0.31) but significantly higher than farmland (H’ = 1.08±0.57). The total carbon stocks of natural forest (388.54±161.63 Mg C ha-1) were approximately 1.53 and 2.67 times higher than that of forest farm interface (252.95±41.86 Mg C ha-1) and farmland (145.58±25.94 Mg C ha-1). Conclusion Our study revealed that along the conversion gradient of natural forest to forest farm interface and farmland there was a significant change of woody species diversity and carbon stocks.

                Mitochondrial failure has long been associated with programmed axon death (Wallerian degeneration, WD), a widespread and potentially preventable mechanism of axon degeneration. While early findings in axotomised axons indicated that mitochondria are involved during the execution steps of this pathway, recent studies suggest that in addition, mitochondrial dysfunction can initiate programmed axon death without physical injury. As mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with disorders involving early axon loss, including Parkinson’s disease, peripheral neuropathies, and multiple sclerosis, the findings that programmed axon death is activated by mitochondrial impairment could indicate the involvement of druggable mechanisms whose disruption may protect axons in such diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Expression of a CO2-permeable aquaporin enhances mesophyll conductance in the C4 species Setaria viridis</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental limitation of photosynthetic carbon fixation is the availability of CO<sub>2</sub>. In C<sub>4</sub> plants, primary carboxylation occurs in mesophyll cytosol, and little is known about the role of CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion in facilitating C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. We have examined the expression, localization, and functional role of selected plasma membrane intrinsic aquaporins (PIPs) from <i>Setaria italica </i>(foxtail millet) and discovered that <i>SiPIP2;7 </i>is CO<sub>2</sub>-permeable. When ectopically expressed in mesophyll cells of <i>S. viridis</i> (green foxtail), SiPIP2;7 was localized to the plasma membrane and caused no marked changes in leaf biochemistry. Gas-exchange and C<sup>18</sup>O<sup>16</sup>O discrimination measurements revealed that targeted expression of SiPIP2;7 enhanced the conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion from the intercellular airspace to the mesophyll cytosol. Our results demonstrate that mesophyll conductance limits C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis at low <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> and that SiPIP2;7 is a functional CO<sub>2</sub> permeable aquaporin that can improve CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion at the airspace/mesophyll interface and enhance C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Effects of arousal and movement on secondary somatosensory and visual thalamus</a></h4>

              
                Neocortical sensory areas have associated primary and secondary thalamic nuclei. While primary nuclei transmit sensory information to cortex, secondary nuclei remain poorly understood. We recorded juxtasomally from secondary somatosensory (POm) and visual (LP) nuclei of awake mice while tracking whisking and pupil size. POm activity correlated with whisking, but not precise whisker kinematics. This coarse movement modulation persisted after facial paralysis and thus was not due to sensory reafference. This phenomenon also continued during optogenetic silencing of somatosensory and motor cortex and after lesion of superior colliculus, ruling out a motor efference copy mechanism. Whisking and pupil dilation were strongly correlated, possibly reflecting arousal. Indeed LP, which is not part of the whisker system, tracked whisking equally well, further indicating that POm activity does not encode whisker movement per se. The semblance of movement-related activity is likely instead a global effect of arousal on both nuclei. We conclude that secondary thalamus monitors behavioral state, rather than movement, and may exist to alter cortical activity accordingly.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">RNase III-mediated processing of a trans-acting bacterial sRNA and its cis-encoded antagonist</a></h4>

              
                Bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators in stress responses and virulence. They can be derived from an expanding list of genomic contexts, such as processing from parental transcripts by RNase E. The role of RNase III in sRNA biogenesis is less well understood despite its well-known roles in rRNA processing, RNA decay, and cleavage of sRNA-mRNA duplexes. Here, we show that RNase III processes a pair of <i>cis</i>-encoded sRNAs (CJnc190 and CJnc180) of the foodborne pathogen <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i>. While CJnc180 processing by RNase III requires CJnc190, In contrast, RNase III processes CJnc190 independent of CJnc180 via cleavage of an intramolecular duplex. We also show that CJnc190 directly represses translation of the colonization factor PtmG by targeting a G-rich ribosome binding site, and uncover that CJnc180 is a <i>cis</i>-acting antagonist of CJnc190, indirectly affecting <i>ptmG </i>regulation. Our study highlights a role for RNase III in sRNA biogenesis and adds <i>cis</i>-encoded RNAs to the expanding diversity of transcripts that antagonize bacterial sRNAs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Remote immune processes revealed by immune-derived circulating cell-free DNA</a></h4>

              
                Blood cell counts often fail to report on immune processes occurring in remote tissues. Here we use immune cell type-specific methylation patterns in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) for studying human immune cell dynamics. We characterized cfDNA released from specific immune cell types in healthy individuals (N=242), cross sectionally and longitudinally. Immune cfDNA levels had no individual steady state as opposed to blood cell counts, suggesting that cfDNA concentration reflects adjustment of cell survival to maintain homeostatic cell numbers. We also observed selective elevation of immune-derived cfDNA upon perturbations of immune homeostasis. Following influenza vaccination (N=92), B-cell-derived cfDNA levels increased prior to elevated B-cell counts and predicted efficacy of antibody production. Patients with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (N=21) and B-cell lymphoma (N=27) showed selective elevation of eosinophil and B-cell cfDNA respectively, which were undetectable by cell counts in blood. Immune-derived cfDNA provides a novel biomarker for monitoring immune responses to physiological and pathological processes that are not accessible using conventional methods.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Quantitative analysis of tumour spheroid structure</a></h4>

              
                Tumour spheroids are common in vitro experimental models of avascular tumour growth. Compared with traditional two-dimensional culture, tumour spheroids more closely mimic the avascular tumour microenvironment where spatial differences in nutrient availability strongly influence growth. We show that spheroids initiated using significantly different numbers of cells grow to similar limiting sizes, suggesting that avascular tumours have a limiting structure; in agreement with untested predictions of classical mathematical models of tumour spheroids. We develop a novel mathematical and statistical framework to study the structure of tumour spheroids seeded from cells transduced with fluorescent cell cycle indicators, enabling us to discriminate between arrested and cycling cells and identify an arrested region. Our analysis shows that transient spheroid structure is independent of initial spheroid size, and the limiting structure can be independent of seeding density. Standard experimental protocols compare spheroid size as a function of time; however, our analysis suggests that comparing spheroid structure as a function of overall size produces results that are relatively insensitive to variability in spheroid size. Our experimental observations are made using two melanoma cell lines, but our modelling framework applies across a wide range of spheroid culture conditions and cell lines.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Altered temporal sequence of transcriptional regulators in the generation of human cerebellar granule cells</a></h4>

              
                Brain development is regulated by conserved transcriptional programs across species, but little is known about divergent mechanisms that create species-specific characteristics. Among brain regions, human cerebellar histogenesis differs in complexity compared with non-human primates and rodents, making it important to develop methods to generate human cerebellar neurons that closely resemble those in the developing human cerebellum. We report a rapid protocol for the derivation of the human ATOH1 lineage, the precursor of excitatory cerebellar neurons, from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC). Upon transplantation into juvenile mice, hPSC-derived cerebellar granule cells migrated along glial fibers and integrated into the cerebellar cortex. By Translational Ribosome Affinity Purification-seq, we identified an unexpected temporal shift in the expression of RBFOX3 (NeuN) and NEUROD1, which are classically associated with differentiated neurons, in the human outer external granule layer. This molecular divergence may enable the protracted development of the human cerebellum compared to mice.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Supracellular organization confers directionality and mechanical potency to migrating pairs of cardiopharyngeal progenitor cells</a></h4>

              
                Physiological and pathological morphogenetic events involve a wide array of collective movements, suggesting that multicellular arrangements confer biochemical and biomechanical properties contributing to tissue scale organization. The Ciona cardiopharyngeal progenitors provide the simplest model of collective cell migration, with cohesive bilateral cell pairs polarized along the leader-trailer migration path while moving between the ventral epidermis and trunk endoderm. We use the Cellular Potts Model to computationally probe the distributions of forces consistent with shapes and collective polarity of migrating cell pairs. Combining computational modeling, confocal microscopy, and molecular perturbations, we identify cardiopharyngeal progenitors as the simplest cell collective maintaining supracellular polarity with differential distributions of protrusive forces, cell-matrix adhesion, and myosin-based retraction forces along the leader-trailer axis. 4D simulations and experimental observations suggest that cell-cell communication helps establish a hierarchy to align collective polarity with the direction of migration, as observed with three or more cells <i>in silico</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Our approach reveals emerging properties of the migrating collective: cell pairs are more persistent, migrating longer distances, and presumably with higher accuracy. Simulations suggest that cell pairs can overcome mechanical resistance of the trunk endoderm more effectively when they are polarized collectively. We propose that polarized supracellular organization of cardiopharyngeal progenitors confers emergent physical properties that determine mechanical interactions with their environment during morphogenesis.

                UbiA prenyltransferase domain-containing protein-1 (UBIAD1) utilizes geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGpp) to synthesize the vitamin K<sub>2 </sub>subtype menaquinone-4. The prenyltransferase has emerged as a key regulator of sterol-accelerated, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) of HMG CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in synthesis of cholesterol and nonsterol isoprenoids including GGpp. Sterols induce binding of UBIAD1 to reductase, inhibiting its ERAD. Geranylgeraniol (GGOH), the alcohol derivative of GGpp, disrupts this binding and thereby stimulates ERAD of reductase and translocation of UBIAD1 to Golgi. We now show that overexpression of Type 1 polyisoprenoid diphosphate phosphatase (PDP1), which dephosphorylates GGpp and other isoprenyl pyrophosphates to corresponding isoprenols, abolishes protein geranylgeranylation as well as GGOH-induced ERAD of reductase and Golgi transport of UBIAD1. Conversely, these reactions are enhanced in the absence of PDP1. Our findings indicate PDP1-mediated hydrolysis of GGpp significantly contributes to a feedback mechanism that maintains optimal intracellular levels of the nonsterol isoprenoid.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Membrane estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) participates in flow-mediated dilation in a ligand-independent manner</a></h4>

              
                Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) activation by estrogens prevents atheroma through its nuclear action whereas plasma membrane-located ERα accelerates endothelial healing. The genetic deficiency of ERα was associated with a reduction in flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in one man. Here, we evaluated <i>ex vivo</i> the role of ERα on FMD of resistance arteries. FMD, but not agonist (acetylcholine, insulin)-mediated dilation, was reduced in male and female mice lacking ERα (<i>Esr1</i>-/- mice) compared to wild-type mice and was not dependent on the presence of estrogens. In C451A-ERα mice lacking membrane ERα, not in mice lacking AF2-dependent nuclear ERα actions, FMD was reduced, and restored by antioxidant treatments. Compared to wild-type mice, isolated perfused kidneys of C451A-ERα mice revealed a decreased flow-mediated nitrate production and an increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>production. Thus, endothelial membrane ERα promotes NO bioavailability through inhibition of oxidative stress and thereby participates in FMD in a ligand-independent manner.

                Learning which stimuli in our environment co-occur with painful or pleasurable events is critical for survival. Previous research has established the basic neural and behavioural mechanisms of aversive and appetitive conditioning; however, it is unclear what precisely is learned. Here we examined what aspects of the unconditioned stimulus (US), sensory and hedonic, are transferred to the conditioned stimulus (CS). To decode the content of brain activation patterns elicited during appetitive (soft touch) and aversive (painful touch) conditioning of faces, a novel variation of representational similarity analysis (RSA) based on theoretically driven representational patterns of interest (POIs) was applied to fMRI data. Once face associations were learned through conditioning, globally the CS reactivated US representational patterns showing conditioning dependent reactivation. More specifically, in higher order brain regions, the CS only reactivated hedonic but not sensory aspects of the US, suggesting that affective conditioning primarily carries forward the valence of the experience rather than its sensory origins.

                Brain activity during rest has been demonstrated to evolve through a repertoire of functional connectivity (FC) patterns, whose alterations may provide biomarkers of schizophrenia - a psychotic disorder characterized by dysfunctional brain connectivity. In this study, differences between the dynamic exploration of resting-state networks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 71 schizophrenia patients and 74 healthy controls were investigated using a method focusing on the dominant fMRI signal phase coherence pattern at each time point. Through the lens of dynamical systems theory, brain activity in the form of temporal FC state trajectories was examined for intergroup differences by calculating the fractional occupancy, dwell time, limiting probability of each state and the transition probabilities between states. Results showed reduced fractional occupancy of a globally synchronized state in schizophrenia. Conversely, FC states overlapping with canonical functional subsystems exhibited increased fractional occupancy and limiting probability in schizophrenia. Furthermore, state-to-state transition probabilities were altered in schizophrenia. This revealed a reduced probability of remaining in a global integrative state, increased probability of switching from this state to functionally meaningful networks and reduced probability of remaining in a state related to the Default Mode network. These results revealed medium to large effect sizes. Finally, this study showed that using K-medoids clustering did not influence the observed intergroup differences - highlighting the utility of dynamical systems theory to better understand brain activity. Combined, these findings expose pronounced differences between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls - supporting and extending current knowledge regarding disrupted brain dynamics in schizophrenia.

                The current opioid epidemic has dramatically increased the number of children who are prenatally exposed to opioids, including oxycodone. However, little is know about the mechanisms by which prenatal opioid exposure leads to long term changes in reward circuit function and behavior. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, are known to respond to perinatal opioid exposure and to sculpt neural circuits during development. Indeed, we recently found that microglial phagocytosis of dopamine D1 receptors in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is required for the natural development decline in NAc-D1R that occurs between adolescence and adulthood. Morever, this microglial pruning occurs only in males, and is required for the normal developmental trajectory of social play behavior. Here, we show that maternal oxycodone self-administration during pregnancy leads to higher D1R density within the NAc in adult male, but not female, offspring in rats. Furthermore, adolescent microglial phagocytosis of D1R is reduced following prenatal oxycodone exposure. Ths work demonstrates for the first time that microglia play a key role in translating prenatal opioid exposure to long-term changes in neural systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The computational benefits of episodic memory in spatial learning</a></h4>

              
                Episodic memory has been studied extensively in the past few decades, but so far little is understood about how it is used to affect behavior. Here we postulate three learning paradigms: one-shot learning, replay learning, and online learning, where in the first two paradigms episodic memory is retrieved for decision-making or replayed to the neocortex for extracting semantic knowledge, respectively. In the third paradigm, the neocortex directly extracts information from online experiences as they occur, but does not have access to these experiences afterwards. By using visually-driven reinforcement learning in simulations, we found that whether an agent is able to solve a task by relying on the three learning paradigms depends differently on the number of learning trials and the complexity of the task. Episodic memory can, but does not always, have a major benefit for spatial learning, and its effect differs for the two modes of accessing episodic information. One-shot learning is initially faster than replay learning, but the latter reaches a better asymptotic performance. We believe that understanding how episodic memory drives behavior will be an important step towards elucidating the nature of episodic memory.

                Remembering life episodes is a complex process that requires the interaction between multiple brain areas. It is thought that contextual information provided by the hippocampus (HPC) can trigger the recall of a past event through the activation of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neuronal ensembles, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Indeed, little is known about how the vHPC and mPFC are coordinated during a contextual-guided recall of an object recognition memory. To address this, we performed electrophysiological recordings in behaving rats during the retrieval phase of the object-in-context memory task (OIC). Coherence, phase locking and theta amplitude correlation analysis showed an increase in vHPC-mPFC LFP synchronization in the theta range when animals explore contextually mismatched objects. Moreover, we identified ensembles of putative pyramidal cells in the mPFC that encode specific object-context associations. Interestingly, the increase of vHPC-mPFC synchronization during exploration of the contextually mismatched object and the preference of mPFC incongruent object neurons predicts the animal's performance during the resolution of the OIC task. Altogether, these results identify changes in vHPC-mPFC synchronization and mPFC ensembles encoding specific object-context associations likely involved in the recall of past events.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Asymmetric and adaptive reward coding via normalized reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                Learning is widely modeled in psychology, neuroscience, and computer science by prediction error-guided reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. While standard RL assumes linear reward functions, reward-related neural activity is a saturating, nonlinear function of reward; however, the computational and behavioral implications of nonlinear RL are unknown. Here, we show that nonlinear RL incorporating the canonical divisive normalization computation introduces an intrinsic and tunable asymmetry in prediction error coding. At the behavioral level, this asymmetry explains empirical variability in risk preferences typically attributed to asymmetric learning rates. At the neural level, diversity in asymmetries provides a computational mechanism for recently proposed theories of distributional RL, allowing the brain to learn the full probability distribution of future rewards. This behavioral and computational flexibility argues for an incorporation of biologically valid value functions in computational models of learning and decision-making.

                Emotional events are often easier to recall, and comprise our most valuable memories. Here, as subjects performed a memory task in which they recalled emotional stimuli more readily than neutral stimuli, we used direct brain recording and stimulation in the hippocampus and amygdala to identify how the brain prioritizes emotional information for memory encoding. High-frequency activity (HFA), a correlate of local neuronal spiking, increased in both hippocampus and amygdala when subjects successfully encoded emotionally arousing stimuli. Direct electrical stimulation applied to these regions during encoding decreased HFA and selectively impaired retrieval for emotional stimuli. Finally, depressed subjects' memory was biased more by valence than arousal, and they exhibited a congruent increase in HFA as a function of valence. Our findings thus provide evidence that emotional stimuli up-regulate activity in the amygdala--hippocampus circuit to enhance memory for emotional information, and suggest that targeted modulation of this circuit alters emotional memory processes.

	<p>Patients with post-stroke impairments present often significant variation in response to therapeutic interventions. Recent studies have shown that daily music listening can aid post-stroke recovery of language and memory, but reliable predictors of treatment response are unknown. Utilizing data from the music intervention arms of a single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) on stroke patients (N = 31), we built regression models to predict the treatment response of a two-month music listening intervention on language skills and verbal memory with baseline demographic, clinical and musical data as well as fMRI data from a music listening task. Clinically, greater improvement in verbal memory and language skills after the music listening intervention were predicted by the severity of the initial deficit and educational level. Neurally, greater baseline fMRI activation during vocal music listening in the left parietal cortical and medial frontal areas predicted greater treatment-induced improvement in language skills and greater baseline engagement of the auditory network during instrumental music listening predicted improvement in both verbal memory and language skills. Our results suggest that clinical, demographic, and neuroimaging data predicts music listening treatment response. This data could be used clinically to target music-based treatments.</p>

	<p>Several cortical and sub-cortical regions in the right hemisphere, particularly in the parietal and frontal lobes, but also in the temporal lobe and thalamus, are part of neural networks critically implicated in spatial and attentional functions. Damage to different sites within these networks can cause hemispatial neglect. The aim of this study was to identify the neural substrates of different spatial processing components that are known to contribute to neglect symptoms. Firstly, three different spatial tasks (visual search, bisection, and visual memory) were tested in 26 healthy controls. The fMRI results showed a differential activation of regions in the parietal and frontal lobes during bisection and visual search, respectively. Secondly, fMRI was used in 27 patients with focal right brain damage. Voxel-based lesion&amp;amp;ndash;symptom mapping was used to determine the relationships between specific sites of damage and the severity of deficits in these three spatial tasks. In the patients, we confirmed a critical role of the right lateral parietal cortex in bisection, but lesions in the frontal and temporal lobes were critical for visual search. These data support the existence of distinct components in spatial attentional processes that might be damaged to different degrees in neglect patients.</p>

	<p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a serious autoimmune disease. The patient in an advanced state of the disease has restrained mobility and remains handicapped. It is therefore understandable that there is a great need for novel drugs and vaccines for the treatment of MS. Herein we summarise two major approaches applied for the treatment of the disease using peptide molecules alone or conjugated with mannan. The first approach focuses on selective myelin epitope peptide or peptide mimetic therapy alone or conjugated with mannan, and the second on immune-therapy by preventing or controlling disease through the release of appropriate cytokines. In both approaches the use of cyclic peptides offers the advantage of increased stability from proteolytic enzymes. In these approaches, the synthesis of myelin epitope peptides conjugated to mannan is of particular interest as this was found to protect mice against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of MS, in prophylactic and therapeutic protocols. Protection was peptide-specific and associated with reduced antigen-specific T cell proliferation. The aim of the studies of these peptide epitope analogs is to understand their molecular basis of interactions with human autoimmune T-cell receptor and a MS-associated human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR2b. This knowledge will lead the rational design to new beneficial non-peptide mimetic analogs for the treatment of MS. Some issues of the use of nanotechnology will also be addressed as a future trend to tackle the disease. We highlight novel immunomodulation and vaccine-based research against MS based on myelin epitope peptides and strategies developed in our laboratories.</p>

	<p>Despite the high prevalence of headache in developmental age, current reports about its neuropsychological effects are still lacking. The aim of the present pilot study is to assess the neuropsychological skills among children affected by migraine without aura (MwoA). Fifteen children (7M/8F) (mean age 10.73 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.13) with MwoA, consecutively referred to the Center for Childhood Headache at Universit&amp;amp;agrave; degli Studi della Campania &amp;amp;ldquo;Luigi Vanvitelli&amp;amp;rdquo;, underwent the Italian version of the NEPSY-2 after cognitive evaluation. Moreover, to assess the pain level and disability grade during daily activity, the VAS and PedMIDAS scales were used. MwoA children were comparable with the control group of 38 children with respect to age, gender, language, and education level. Written informed consent was obtained from all parents and from children directly, when appropriate. MwoA children differed from controls significantly among the NEPSY-2 subscales, with a relevant relationship between the frequency and intensity of the attacks. In conclusion, the results of the present pilot study may suggest that MwoA could impact significantly neuropsychological functioning in children.</p>

	<p>Motivational and perceptual disturbances co-occur in psychosis and have been linked to aberrations in reward learning and sensory gating, respectively. Although traditionally studied independently, when viewed through a predictive coding framework, these processes can both be linked to dysfunction in striatal dopaminergic prediction error signaling. This study examined whether reward learning and sensory gating are correlated in individuals with psychotic disorders, and whether nicotine&amp;amp;mdash;a psychostimulant that amplifies phasic striatal dopamine firing&amp;amp;mdash;is a common modulator of these two processes. We recruited 183 patients with psychotic disorders (79 schizophrenia, 104 psychotic bipolar disorder) and 129 controls and assessed reward learning (behavioral probabilistic reward task), sensory gating (P50 event-related potential), and smoking history. Reward learning and sensory gating were correlated across the sample. Smoking influenced reward learning and sensory gating in both patient groups; however, the effects were in opposite directions. Specifically, smoking was associated with improved performance in individuals with schizophrenia but impaired performance in individuals with psychotic bipolar disorder. These findings suggest that reward learning and sensory gating are linked and modulated by smoking. However, disorder-specific associations with smoking suggest that nicotine may expose pathophysiological differences in the architecture and function of prediction error circuitry in these overlapping yet distinct psychotic disorders.</p>

	<p>Somatization, defined as the presence of multiple somatic symptoms, frequently occurs in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and may constitute the clinical manifestation of a neurobiological sensitization process. Brain imaging data was acquired with T1 weighted 3 tesla MRI, and gray matter morphometry were analyzed using FreeSurfer. We investigated differences in networks of structural covariance, based on graph analysis, between regional gray matter volumes in IBS-related brain regions between IBS patients with high and low somatization levels, and compared them to healthy controls (HCs). When comparing IBS low somatization (N = 31), IBS high somatization (N = 35), and HCs (N = 31), we found: (1) higher centrality and neighbourhood connectivity of prefrontal cortex subregions in IBS high somatization compared to healthy controls; (2) higher centrality of left cerebellum in IBS low somatization compared to both IBS high somatization and healthy controls; (3) higher centrality of the anterior insula in healthy controls compared to both IBS groups, and in IBS low compared to IBS high somatization. The altered structural covariance of prefrontal cortex and anterior insula in IBS high somatization implicates that prefrontal processes may be more important than insular in the neurobiological sensitization process associated with IBS high somatization.</p>

	<p>Introduction: mental health has been one of the most important issues surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic; mental disorders can be exacerbated by isolation during lockdowns or online learning. The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between non-clinical (early) symptoms of depressed moods, personality traits, and coping strategies, as well as whether the learning mode (online versus hybrid) differentiates the experiences of these early symptoms and coping strategies. Methods: 114 university students aged 19 to 34, whose education model was changed from stationary to hybrid or online due to COVID-19 restrictions, participated in the study. The participants completed the online questionnaire, which consisted of two sections: (1) demographic questions to characterize the subjects and 44 questions based on the literature review. (2) Mini-COPE Inventory. Results: the study showed that the fully online study mode has a negative impact on the mental health of students; hybrid students are more likely to use active and positive coping strategies, which effectively help to control negative thoughts and/or reduce negative mental states. Conclusions: the COVID-19 pandemic has had significant psychological effects that will extend to coming years; therefore, implementing systemic psychological care is of utmost importance.</p>

	<p>Paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes (PNSs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders caused by the remote effects of cancer with immune-mediated pathogenesis. Anti-Ma2 antibody was defined as one of the well-characterized onconeural antibodies that could help establish a definite PNS diagnosis. We aimed to report and explore patients with anti-Ma2 antibody-associated paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome (Ma2-PNS) who frequently exhibit sensorimotor neuropathy (SMN) using a new method of factor analysis of mixed data (FAMD). Clinical data from a case series of eight patients with definite diagnoses were retrospectively reviewed. FAMD conducted further analyses with a comprehensive visualization in R software. Our cohort, with a predominance of females (5/8), presented more frequently with SMN (4/8), followed by limbic encephalitis (LE) (3/8). Two patients with LE were found to have a testicular germ-cell tumor and a thymoma, respectively. In addition, a patient who developed chronic SMN was diagnosed with multiple myeloma (MM) involving multiple organs. FAMD exhibited the overall features into a two-dimensional coordinate and located each individual into their corresponding position with high relevance. It provided a clue for determining their potential relationships and predictors. Our findings indicated that Ma2-PNS could frequently involve the peripheral nervous system, MM might be one of its associated cancers with a presentation of chronic SMN, and FAMD might be a clinically valuable tool.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex differences in choice-based thermal nociceptive tasks in adult rats</a></h4>

              
                Interest in the role of sex as a biological variable continues to increase, including a mandate for the study of both sexes in NIH-funded research. Choice-based thermal nociceptive tests allow for the study of a more spontaneous response to thermal stimuli and avoidance behavior compared to traditional nociceptive assays, and their usage has been increasing in recent years. However, to date no comparison of naive male and female responses to such tests has been published. As sex differences are known to exist in both human chronic pain conditions and rodent models of nociception, it is critical to understand the impact of sex on any nociceptive assay. Herein, we examined the effect of sex on two choice-based thermal nociceptive tests, the thermal gradient test and the temperature place preference test, in adult rats. We report that marked sex differences exist in responses to these tests. Namely, the activation of a 10 C-to-47 C thermal gradient results in an increase in time spent in the 10 C zone in females, compared to a reduction in males. In a temperature place preference test pairing a surface temperature of 22 C with either 5 C, 10 C, 47 C, or 50 C, males spent less than 50% of their time in every non-22 C zone, but in females this was only observed when testing 50 C. Together, these results suggest that male rats show more avoidance behavior to non-ambient temperatures when given free access to multiple zones, including at temperatures which are milder than those typically used to evoke a nociceptive response in traditional hot and cold plate tests.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The gradient model of brain organization in decisions involving 'empathy for pain'</a></h4>

              
                Recent meta-analytic studies of social cognition and the functional imaging of empathy have exposed the overlap between their neural substrates and heteromodal association areas. The 'gradient model' of cortical organization proposes a close relationship between these areas and highly connected hubs in the default mode network, a set of cortical areas deactivated by demanding tasks. Here, we used a decision-making task and representational similarity analysis with classic 'empathy for pain' visual stimuli to probe the relationship between high-level representations of imminent pain in others and the high end of the gradient of this model. High-level representations were found to co-localize with task deactivations or the transitions from activations to deactivations. These loci belonged to two groups: those that loaded on the high end of the principal cortical gradient and were associated by meta-analytic decoding with the default mode network, and those that appeared to accompany functional repurposing of somatosensory cortex in the presence of visual stimuli. In contrast to the nonspecific meta-analytic decoding of these loci, low-level representations, such as those of body parts involved in pain or of pain itself, were decoded with matching topics terms. These findings suggest that that task deactivations may set out cortical areas that host high-level representations, but whose functional characterization in terms of simple mappings is unlikely. We anticipate that an increased understanding of the cortical correlates of high-level representations may improve neurobiological models of social interactions and psychopathology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Joint Learning of Full-structure Noise in Hierarchical Bayesian Regression Models</a></h4>

              
                We consider the reconstruction of brain activity from electroencephalography (EEG). This inverse problem can be formulated as a linear regression with independent Gaussian scale mixture priors for both the source and noise components. Crucial factors influencing accuracy of source estimation are not only the noise level but also its correlation structure, but existing approaches have not addressed estimation of noise covariance matrices with full structure. To address this shortcoming, we develop hierarchical Bayesian (type-II maximum likelihood) models for observations with latent variables for source and noise, which are estimated jointly from data. As an extension to classical sparse Bayesian learning (SBL), where across-sensor observations are assumed to be independent and identically distributed, we consider Gaussian noise with full covariance structure. Using the majorization-maximization framework and Riemannian geometry, we derive an efficient algorithm for updating the noise covariance along the manifold of positive definite matrices. We demonstrate that our algorithm has guaranteed and fast convergence and validate it in simulations and with real MEG data. Our results demonstrate that the novel framework significantly improves upon state-of-the-art techniques in the real-world scenario where the noise is indeed non-diagonal and fully-structured. Our method has applications in many domains beyond biomagnetic inverse problems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Does the brain care about averages? A simple test.</a></h4>

              
                Trial-averaged metrics, e.g. in the form of tuning curves and population response vectors, are a basic and widely accepted way of characterizing neuronal activity. But how relevant are such trial-averaged responses to neuronal computation itself? Here we present a simple test to estimate whether average responses reflect aspects of neuronal activity that contribute to neuronal processing in a specific context. The test probes two assumptions inherent in the usage of average neuronal metrics: 1) Reliability: Neuronal responses repeat consistently enough across single stimulus instances that the average response template they relate to remains recognizable to downstream regions. 2) Behavioural relevance: If a single-trial response is more similar to the average template, this should make it easier for the animal to identify the correct stimulus or action. We apply this test to a large publicly available data set featuring electrophysiological recordings from 42 cortical areas in behaving mice. In this data set, we show that single-trial responses were less correlated to the average response template than one would expect if they simply represented discrete versions of the template, down-sampled to a finite number of spikes. Moreover, single-trial responses were barely stimulus-specific -- they could not be clearly assigned to the average response template of one stimulus. Most importantly, better-matched single-trial responses did not predict accurate behaviour for any of the recorded cortical areas. We conclude that in this data set, average responses do not seem particularly relevant to neuronal computation in a majority of brain areas, and we encourage other researchers to apply similar tests when using trial-averaged neuronal metrics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Graph Ricci Curvatures Reveal Disease-related Changes in Autism Spectrum Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a set of neurodevelopmental disorders that pose a significant global health burden. Measures from graph theory have been used to characterise ASD-related changes in resting-state fMRI functional connectivity networks (FCNs), but recently developed geometry-inspired measures have not been applied so far. In this study, we applied geometry-inspired graph Ricci curvatures to investigate ASD-related changes in resting-state fMRI FCNs. To do this, we applied Forman-Ricci and Ollivier-Ricci curvatures to compare networks of ASD and healthy controls (N = 1112) from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I (ABIDE-I) dataset. We performed these comparisons at the brain-wide level as well as at the level of individual brain regions, and further, determined the behavioral relevance of region-specific differences with Neurosynth meta-analysis decoding. We found brain-wide ASD-related differences for both Forman-Ricci and Ollivier-Ricci curvatures. For Forman-Ricci curvature, these differences were distributed across 83 of the 200 brain regions studied, and concentrated within the Default Mode, Somatomotor and Ventral Attention Network. Meta-analysis decoding identified the brain regions showing curvature differences as involved in social cognition, memory, language and movement. Notably, comparison with results from previous non-invasive stimulation (TMS/tDCS) experiments revealed that the set of brain regions showing curvature differences overlapped with the set of brain regions whose stimulation resulted in positive cognitive or behavioural outcomes in ASD patients. These results underscore the utility of geometry-inspired graph Ricci curvatures in characterising disease-related changes in ASD, and possibly, other neurodevelopmental disorders.

	<p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a common and pivotal non-motor symptom in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). It is necessary to use the appropriate tools to characterize the cognitive profiles and identify the subjects at risk of MCI in clinical practice. A cohort of 207 non-demented patients with PD and 52 age- and gender-matched cognitively normal controls (NCs) underwent the Chinese Version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Basic (MoCA-BC) evaluation. Patients with PD also received detailed motor and non-motor evaluation by serial scales. Cognitive profiles were investigated in patients with PD-MCI, relative to patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) and cognitively NCs. In addition, differences in demography, major motor and non-motor symptoms were compared between patients with PD-MCI and PD-NC. There were 70 patients with PD-MCI, occupying 33.8% of the total patients. Patients with PD-MCI had impairment in multiple cognitive domains, especially in executive function, memory and visuospatial function on MoCA-BC, relative to cognitively NCs or PD-NC. Compared with PD-NC patients, PD-MCI patients were older (p = 0.002) and had a later onset age (p = 0.007) and higher score of the Unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III (p = 0.001). The positive rate of clinical possible rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (cpRBD) in the PD-MCI group was significantly increased relative to the PD-NC group (p = 0.003). Multivariate logistic analysis showed that older age (OR = 1.06; p = 0.012), higher score of UPDRS-III (OR = 1.03; p = 0.018) and the presence of cpRBD (OR = 2.10; p = 0.037) were independently associated factors of MCI in patients with PD. In conclusion, executive function, memory and visuospatial function are the main impaired cognitive profiles in PD-MCI via MoCA-BC. Aging, motor severity and RBD may be independently related factors of MCI in PD.</p>

	<p>Currently, there are no pharmacological treatments able to reverse nigral degeneration in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), hence the unmet need for the provision of neuroprotective agents. Cannabis-derived phytocannabinoids (CDCs) and resveratrol (RSV) may be useful neuroprotective agents for PD due to their anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. To evaluate this, we undertook a systematic review of the scientific literature to assess the neuroprotective effects of CDCs and RSV treatments in pre-clinical in vivo animal models of PD. The literature databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science core collection were systematically searched to cover relevant studies. A total of 1034 publications were analyzed, of which 18 met the eligibility criteria for this review. Collectively, the majority of PD rodent studies demonstrated that treatment with CDCs or RSV produced a significant improvement in motor function and mitigated the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Biochemical analysis of rodent brain tissue suggested that neuroprotection was mediated by anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. This review highlights the neuroprotective potential of CDCs and RSV for in vivo models of PD and therefore suggests their potential translation to human clinical trials to either ameliorate PD progression and/or be implemented as a prophylactic means to reduce the risk of development of PD.</p>

	<p>The objectives of this study were: (1) to identify subjects with hyperprolactinemia in a clinical sample of patients; (2) to compare the neurologic, psychiatric, and sleep conditions found in patients subgrouped by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and hyperprolactinemia; and (3) to identify patients with hyperprolactinemia and EDS not supported by the presence of any other neurologic, psychiatric, or sleep disorder, or substance/medication use. A retrospective chart review of inpatients was carried out in order to identify all patients in whom the prolactin (PRL) serum levels were determined. A total of 130 subjects were retrieved: 55 had increased levels of PRL, while the remaining 75 participants had normal PRL levels. EDS was reported by 32 (58.2%) participants with increased PRL and 34 (45.3%) with normal PRL. Obstructive sleep apnea or other sleep or neurologic/psychiatric conditions could explain EDS in all participants with normal PRL. Among subjects with increased PRL, eight had no other neurologic/psychiatric or sleep disorder (or drug) potentially causing EDS; these participants, at polysomnography, had time in bed, sleep period time, and total sleep time longer than those with EDS associated to another condition. These findings can be considered as a preliminary indication of a role of hyperprolactinemia in EDS and represent a basis for future controlled studies able to test this hypothesis in a reliable, objective, and methodologically more appropriate way.</p>

	<p>Background: There is an increasing body of research supporting the idea that cardiac interoceptive accuracy (IAc) can be improved by training. Findings concerning the effects of a single yoga session on IAc and the related construct emotional experience are sparse. The aim of this study was to examine if a single yoga session increases IAc and improves emotional experience. Methods: 137 students were randomly assigned to a 20-min yoga session (n = 47), an endurance session (n = 46), or an inactive control condition (n = 44). IAc and emotional experience were assessed before and after the sessions. Results: There were no significant changes in IAc, or positive and negative affect. IAc at baseline and the change in positive effect were found as predictors for IAc after the yoga session. Conclusion: A 20-min yoga session seems to be not applicable to improve IAc and emotional experience. Future studies should investigate long-term interventions and diverse healthy and clinical populations.</p>

     alt="Effects of place of stimulation on the interaural time difference sensitivity in bilateral electrical intracochlear stimulations: Neurophysiological study in a rat model"/>
<p>The effects of the intracochlear location of electrical stimulation on the sensitivity to interaural time difference (ITD) were determined by using a single-unit recording in the rat inferior colliculus. The ability to discriminate the ITD differences of apical stimulation, determined by the just noticeable difference, are better than those of basal stimulation.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We examined the sensitivity of the neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) in male and female rats to the interaural time differences (ITDs) conveyed in electrical pulse trains. Using bipolar pairs of electrodes that selectively activate the auditory nerve fibers at different intracochlear locations, we assessed whether the responses to electrical stimulation with ITDs in different frequency regions were processed differently. Most well-isolated single units responded to the electrical stimulation in only one of the apical or basal cochlear regions, and they were classified as either apical or basal units. Regardless of the cochlear stimulating location, more than 70% of both apical and basal units were sensitive to ITDs of electrical stimulation. However, the pulse rate dependence of neural ITD sensitivity differed significantly depending on the location of the stimulation. Moreover, ITD discrimination thresholds and the relative incidence of ITD tuning type markedly differed between units activated by apical and basal stimulations. With apical stimulation, IC neurons had a higher incidence of peak-type ITD function, which mostly exhibited the steepest position of the tuning curve within the rat's physiological ITD range of ±160 μs and, accordingly, had better ITD discrimination thresholds than those with basal stimulation. These results support the idea that ITD processing in the IC might be determined by functionally segregated frequency-specific pathways from the cochlea to the auditory midbrain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Organization of sympathetic innervation of interscapular brown adipose tissue in the mouse</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) is under sympathetic control, and recent studies emphasized the importance of efferent sympathetic and afferent sensory or humoral feedback systems to regulate adipose tissue function and overall metabolic health. However, functional studies of the sympathetic nervous system in the mouse are limited, because details of anatomy and fine structure are lacking. Here, we used reporter mice for tyrosine hydroxylase expressing neurons (TH:tomato mice), iDISCO tissue clearance, confocal, light sheet, and electron microscopy to clarify that <b>a)</b> iBAT receives sympathetic input via dorsal rami (instead of often cited intercostal nerves); <b>b)</b> dorsal rami T1-T5 correspond to the post-ganglionic input from sympathetic chain ganglia (stellate/T1-T5); <b>c)</b> dorsal rami serve as conduits for sympathetic axons that branch off in finer nerve bundles to enter iBAT; <b>d)</b> axonal varicosities show strong differential innervation of brown (dense innervation) versus white (sparse innervation) adipocytes, that surround the core iBAT in the mouse and are intermingled in human adipose tissues, <b>e)</b> axonal varicosities can form neuro-adipocyte junctions with brown adipocytes. Taken together, we demonstrate that sympathetic iBAT innervation is organized by specific nerves and terminal structures that can be surgically and genetically accessed for neuromodulatory purposes.</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>In the premature newborn, perinatal inflammation mediated by microglia contributes significantly to neurodevelopmental injuries including white matter injury (WMI). Brain inflammation alters development through neuroinflammatory processes mediated by activation of homeostatic microglia toward a pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic phenotype. Investigating immune regulators of microglial activation is crucial to find effective strategies to prevent and treat WMI.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ex vivo microglial cultures and a mouse model of WMI induced by perinatal inflammation (interleukin-1-beta [IL-1β] and postnatal days 1–5) were used to uncover and elucidate the role of microRNA-146b-5p in microglial activation and WMI.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A specific reduction in vivo in microglia of <i>Dicer</i>, a protein required for microRNAs maturation, reduces pro-inflammatory activation of microglia and prevents hypomyelination in our model of WMI. Microglial miRNome analysis in the WMI model identified miRNA-146b-5p as a candidate modulator of microglial activation. Ex vivo microglial cell culture treated with the pro-inflammatory stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) led to overexpression of immunomodulatory miRNA-146b-5p but its drastic reduction in the microglial extracellular vesicles (EVs). To increase miRNA-146b-5p expression, we used a 3DNA nanocarrier to deliver synthetic miRNA-146b-5p specifically to microglia. Enhancing microglial miRNA-146b-5p overexpression significantly decreased LPS-induced activation, downregulated IRAK1, and restored miRNA-146b-5p levels in EVs. In our WMI model, 3DNA miRNA-146b-5p treatment significantly prevented microglial activation, hypomyelination, and cognitive defect induced by perinatal inflammation.</p>
<h2>Interpretations</h2>
<p>These findings support that miRNA-146b-5p is a major regulator of microglia phenotype and could be targeted to reduce the incidence and the severity of perinatal brain injuries and their long-term consequences. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Time course of EEG power during creative problem-solving with insight or remote thinking</a></h4>

              
                Problem-solving often requires creativity and is critical in everyday life. However, the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying creative problem-solving remain poorly understood. Two mechanisms have been highlighted: forming new connections from and between the problem elements and insight solving (with a sudden realization of a solution). We examined EEG activity during an adapted version of a classical insight problem task, the Remote Associates Test, that requires finding a word connecting three words. It allowed us to explore remoteness in semantic connections (by varying the remoteness of the solution word across trials) and insight solving (identified as a "Eureka" moment reported by the participants). Semantic remoteness was associated with a power increase in alpha band (8-12Hz) in a left parieto-temporal cluster, beta band (13-30Hz) in a right fronto-temporal cluster in the early phase of the task, and theta band (3-7Hz) in frontal cluster before the participants responded. Insight solving was associated with power increase preceding the response in alpha and gamma band (31-60Hz) in left temporal clusters and theta band in a frontal cluster. Source reconstructions show the brain regions associated with these clusters. Overall, our findings shed new light on the dynamic of some of the mechanisms involved in creative problem-solving.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dopamine release in nucleus accumbens is under tonic inhibition by adenosine A1 receptors regulated by astrocytic ENT1 and dysregulated by ethanol</a></h4>

              
                Striatal adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) activation can inhibit dopamine release. A1Rs on other striatal neurons are activated by an adenosine tone that is limited by equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) that is enriched on astrocytes and is ethanol-sensitive. We explored whether dopamine release in nucleus accumbens core is under tonic inhibition by A1Rs, and is regulated by astrocytic ENT1 and ethanol. In ex vivo striatal slices from male and female mice, A1R agonists inhibited dopamine release evoked electrically or optogenetically and detected using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, most strongly for lower stimulation frequencies and pulse numbers, thereby enhancing the activity-dependent contrast of dopamine release. Conversely, A1R antagonists reduced activity-dependent contrast but enhanced evoked dopamine release levels, even for single optogenetic pulses indicating an underlying tonic inhibition. The ENT1 inhibitor NBTI reduced dopamine release and promoted A1R-mediated inhibition, and conversely, virally-mediated astrocytic overexpression of ENT1 enhanced dopamine release and relieved A1R-mediated inhibition. By imaging the genetically encoded fluorescent adenosine sensor GRAB-Ado, we identified a striatal extracellular adenosine tone that was elevated by the ENT1 inhibitor and sensitive to gliotoxin fluorocitrate. Finally, we identified that ethanol (50 mM) promoted A1R-mediated inhibition of dopamine release, through diminishing adenosine uptake via ENT1. Together, these data reveal that dopamine output dynamics are gated by a striatal adenosine tone, limiting amplitude but promoting contrast, regulated by ENT1, and promoted by ethanol. These data add to the diverse mechanisms through which ethanol modulates striatal dopamine, and to emerging datasets supporting astrocytic transporters as important regulators of striatal function.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTDopamine axons in the mammalian striatum are emerging as strategic sites where neuromodulators can powerfully influence dopamine output in health and disease. We found that ambient levels of the neuromodulator adenosine tonically inhibit dopamine release in nucleus accumbens core via adenosine A1 receptors (A1Rs), to a variable level that promotes the contrast in dopamine signals released by different frequencies of activity. We reveal that the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) on astrocytes limits this tonic inhibition, and that ethanol promotes it by diminishing adenosine uptake via ENT1. These findings support the hypotheses that A1Rs on dopamine axons inhibit DA release and, furthermore, that astrocytes perform important roles in setting the level of striatal dopamine output, in health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Similarity in evoked responses does not imply similarity in macroscopic network states across tasks</a></h4>

              
                There is an ongoing debate as to whether cognitive processes arise from a group of functionally specialized brain modules (modularism) or as the result of a distributed nonlinear process (dynamical systems theory). The former predicts that tasks that recruit similar brain areas should have an equivalent degree of similarity in their connectivity. The latter allows for differential connectivity, even when the areas recruited are largely the same. Here we evaluated both views by comparing activation and connectivity patterns from a large sample of healthy subjects (N=242) that performed two executive control tasks, color-word Stroop task and Multi-Source Interference Task (MSIT), known to recruit similar brain areas. Using a measure of instantaneous connectivity based on edge time series as outcome variables, we estimated task-related network profiles as connectivity changes between incongruent and congruent information conditions. The degree of similarity of such profiles at the group level between both tasks was substantially smaller than their overlapping activation responses. A similar finding was observed at the subject level and when employing a different method for defining task-related connectivity. Our results are consistent with the perspective of the brain as a dynamical system, suggesting that task representations should be understood at both node and edge (connectivity) levels.

Significance StatementThere exist two contrasting views of the brain that yield different predictions of how cognition is represented. In the modular view, similar cognitive processes should have similar connectivity profiles. In contrast, a dynamical systems view allows for multiple network configurations in these situations. Here we tested both views using two tasks, color-word Stroop and Multi-Source Interference Task (MSIT), that evoke a similar brain response. Using a novel approach of instantaneous connectivity we first estimated the connectivity changes during both tasks and subsequently found that their similarity was substantially smaller than the patterns of brain activation. These findings reinforce the view of brain as a dynamical system and shed light onto how cognitive processes may be quantitatively modeled.

                There is a fundamental discord between the foundational theories underpinning motor learning and how we currently apply transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS). The former is dependent on tight coupling of events; the latter is conducted with very low temporal resolution, typically being applied for 10-20 minutes, prior to or during performance of a particular motor or cognitive task. Here we show that when short duration stimulation epochs (< 3 seconds) are yoked to movement, only the reaching movements repeatedly performed simultaneously with stimulation are selectively enhanced. We propose that mechanisms of Hebbian-like learning are potentiated within neural circuits that are active during movement and concurrently stimulated, thus driving improved adaptation.

                Various physical stimulation methods are developed to minimize the invasiveness of deep brain stimulation (DBS)1-3. Among them, only magnetic field can penetrate into the biological tissues without scattering or absorption4, which makes it ideal for untethered DBS. Recently developed magnetogenetics have shown the potential of developing treatments for neurological disorders5. However, magnetogenetic approaches have potential side effects from overexpression of exogenous ion channels and gene delivery with viral vectors6,7. Here, we demonstrated that the iron oxide magnetic nanodiscs (~270 nm) can be used as transducers to trigger calcium responses in the wild-type cultured neurons during the application of slow varying weak magnetic fields (50 mT at 10 Hz). Moreover, we identified that the intrinsic mechanosensitive ion channel transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC), which were widely expressed in the brain8, plays the main roles in this magnetomechanical stimulation. Finally, when we applied magnetic fields to the awake mice with magnetic nanodiscs injecting into subthalamic nucleus, the magnetomechanical stimulation triggered neuronal activities in the targeted region and the downstream region. Overall, this research demonstrated a magnetomechanical approach that can be used for wireless neuronal stimulation in vitro and untethered DBS in awake mice in vivo without implants or genetic manipulation.

                IntroductionWhite matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are common magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in the aging population in general, as well as in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. They are known to exacerbate the cognitive deficits and worsen the clinical outcomes in the patients. However, it is not well-understood whether there are disease-specific differences in prevalence and distribution of WMHs in different neurodegenerative disorders.

MethodsData included 976 participants with cross-sectional T1-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRIs from the Comprehensive Assessment of Neurodegeneration and Dementia (COMPASS-ND) cohort of the Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging (CCNA) with eleven distinct diagnostic groups: cognitively intact elderly (CIE), subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), vascular MCI (V-MCI), Alzheimers dementia (AD), vascular AD (V-AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), cognitively intact elderly with Parkinsons disease (PD-CIE), cognitively impaired Parkinsons disease (PD-CI), and mixed dementias. WMHs were segmented using a previously validated automated technique. WMH volumes in each lobe and hemisphere were compared against matched CIE individuals, as well as each other, and between men and women.

ResultsAll cognitively impaired diagnostic groups had significantly greater overall WMH volumes than the CIE group. Vascular groups (i.e. V-MCI, V-AD, and mixed dementia) had significantly greater WMH volumes than all other groups, except for FTD, which also had significantly greater WMH volumes than all non-vascular groups. Women tended to have lower WMH burden than men in most groups and regions, controlling for age. The left frontal lobe tended to have a lower WMH burden than the right in all groups. In contrast, the right occipital lobe tended to have greater WMH loads than the left.

ConclusionsThere were distinct differences in WMH prevalence and distribution across diagnostic groups, sexes, and in terms of asymmetry. WMH burden was significantly greater in all neurodegenerative dementia groups, likely encompassing areas exclusively impacted by neurodegeneration as well as areas related to cerebrovascular disease pathology.

                Dynamic protein S-palmitoylation is critical for neuronal function, development, and synaptic plasticity. Activity-dependent changes in palmitoylation have been observed for several neuronal substrates, however a full characterization of the activity-regulated palmitoylome is lacking. Here, we use an unbiased approach to identify differentially palmitoylated proteins in the mouse hippocampus following context-dependent fear conditioning. Of the 121 differentially palmitoylated proteins identified 63 were synaptic proteins, while others were associated with metabolic functions, cytoskeletal organization, and signal transduction. The vast majority of synaptic proteins exhibited increased palmitoylation following fear conditioning, whereas proteins that exhibited decreased palmitoylation were predominantly associated with metabolic processes. We show a link between dynamic palmitoylation and synapse plasticity by demonstrating that the palmitoylation of one of our identified proteins, PRG-1/LPPR4, is essential for activity-induced insertion of AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane. Together, this study identifies networks of synaptic proteins whose dynamic palmitoylation may play a central role in learning and memory.

SUMMARYThis study identifies networks of proteins that undergo dynamic post-translational palmitoylation in response to fear conditioning and demonstrates that palmitoylation of one of these proteins is essential for synapse plasticity. Together, this illustrates the importance of palmitoylation in learning/memory and synapse plasticity.

                Kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus generate GnRH pulses, and act as critical initiators of functional gonadotrophin secretion, and reproductive competency. However, kisspeptin in other brain regions, most notably the posterodorsal subnucleus of the medial amygdala (MePD), plays a significant modulatory role over the hypothalamic kisspeptin population; our recent studies using optogenetics have shown that low frequency light stimulation of MePD kisspeptin results in increased LH pulse frequency. Nonetheless, the neurochemical pathways that underpin this regulatory function remain unknown. To study this, we have utilised an optofluid technology, precisely combining optogenetic stimulation with pharmacological receptor antagonism, to investigate the neurotransmission involved in this circuitry. We have shown that functional neurotransmission of both GABAA and glutamate is a requirement for effective modulation of the GnRH pulse generator by amygdala kisspeptin neurons.

                Glutamate is an essential neurotransmitter for signal processing in the vertical pathway of the mammalian retina, where it is involved in the distribution of visual information into several parallel channels. The excitatory effects of glutamate are mediated by AMPA-, kainate-, and NMDA-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs). The expression patterns of these receptors in the vertebrate retina have been investigated so far with mainly immunocytochemical, in-situ hybridization, and electrophysiological/pharmacological techniques. Here, we have used scRNA sequencing data from chicken, mouse, macaque, and human retina to describe and compare the profile of iGluR expression in major retinal cell types across species. Our results suggest that major retinal cell types each express a unique set of iGluRs with substantial differences between non-mammalian and mammalian retinae. Expression of iGluRs has been investigated in more detail for amacrine and bipolar cell types of the human retina, each showing minor variations of a common pattern. The differential expression of iGluRs is likely to convey unique signal processing properties to individual elements of the retinal circuitry.

                Recent political polarization has highlighted the extent to which individuals with opposing views experience ongoing events in markedly different ways. In this study, we explored the neural mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon. We conducted functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI) scanning right- and left-wing participants watching political videos just before the 2019 elections in Israel. Behavioral results demonstrated significant differences between left- and right-wing participants in their interpretation of the videos content. Neuroimaging results revealed partisanship-dependent differences in both high-order regions and early-motor and somato-sensory regions, although no such differences were found with regard to neutral content. Moreover, we found that most of the political content was more potent in synchronizing participants with right-wing views, and that this synchronization was observed already in early visual and auditory cortices. These results suggest that political polarization is not limited to higher-order processes as previously thought, but rather emerges already in motor and sensory regions.

                Neuropathic pain is a leading cause of high impact pain, is often disabling and is poorly managed by current therapeutics. Here we focused on a unique group of neuropathic pain patients undergoing thoracic vertebrectomy where the DRG is removed as part of the surgery allowing for molecular characterization and identification of mechanistic drivers of neuropathic pain independently of preclinical models. Our goal was to quantify whole transcriptome RNA abundances using RNA-seq in pain-associated human DRGs from these patients, allowing comprehensive identification of molecular changes in these samples by contrasting them with non-pain associated DRGs. We sequenced 70 human DRGs, including over 50 having mRNA libraries with neuronal mRNA. Our expression analysis revealed profound sex differences in differentially expressed genes including increase of IL1B, TNF, CXCL14, and OSM in male and including CCL1, CCL21, PENK and TLR3 in female DRGs associated with neuropathic pain. Co-expression modules revealed enrichment in members of JUN-FOS signaling in males, and centromere protein coding genes in females. Neuro-immune signaling pathways revealed distinct cytokine signaling pathways associated with neuropathic pain in males (OSM, LIF, SOCS1) and females (CCL1, CCL19, CCL21). We validated cellular expression profiles of a subset of these findings using RNAscope in situ hybridization. Our findings give direct support for sex differences in underlying mechanisms of neuropathic pain in patient populations.

                Advances in applied machine learning techniques to neuroimaging have encouraged scientists to implement models to early diagnose brain disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease. Predicting various stages of Alzheimer's disease is challenging; however, existing deep learning complex techniques could perform such a prediction. Therefore, using novel architectures with less complexity but efficient pattern extraction capabilities such as transformers has been of interest to neuroscientists. This study introduced an optimized vision transformer architecture to predict the aging effect in healthy adults (>75 years), mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's' brains within the same age group using resting-state functional and anatomical magnetic resonance imaging data. Our optimized architecture known as OViTAD, which is currently the sole vision transformer-based end-to-end pipeline, outperformed the existing transformer models and most state-of-the-art solutions with F1-scores of 97%{+/-}0.0 and 99.55%{+/-}0.39[plusmn] achieved from the testing sets for the two modalities in the triple-class prediction experiments where the number of trainable parameters decreased by 30% compared to a vanilla transformer. To ensure the robustness and reproducibility of our optimized vision transformer, we repeated the modeling process three times for all the experiments and reported the averaged evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we implemented a visualization technique to illustrate the effect of global attention on brain images. Also, we exhaustively implemented models to explore the impact of combining healthy brains with two other groups in the two modalities. This study could open a new avenue of adopting and optimizing vision transformers for neuroimaging applications, especially for Alzheimer's Disease prediction.

                Acquisition of high quality manual annotations is vital for the development of segmentation algorithms. However, to create them we require a substantial amount of expert time and knowledge. Large numbers of labels are required to train convolutional neural networks due to the vast number of parameters that must be learned in the optimisation process. Here, we develop the STAMP algorithm to allow the simultaneous training and pruning of a UNet architecture for medical image segmentation with targeted channelwise dropout to make the network robust to the pruning. We demonstrate the technique across segmentation tasks and imaging modalities. It is then shown that, through online pruning, we are able to train networks to have much higher performance than the equivalent standard UNet models while reducing their size by more than 85% in terms of parameters. This has the potential to allow networks to be directly trained on datasets where very low numbers of labels are available.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification of transcription factors involved in the specification of photoreceptor subtypes</a></h4>

              
                During development, retinal progenitors navigate a complex landscape of fate decisions that culminates with an array of unique cell types that are required for proper vision. Here, we aim to identify factors that are required for fate decisions in photoreceptors. These factors help create a diversity of photoreceptor subtypes that sustain vision in day and night, enable the detection of colors, of prey and predators, and other aspects of vision. To identify these factors, we generate a high-quality and deep transcriptomic profile of each photoreceptor subtype in zebrafish. From these profiles, we focus on transcription factors--key players in cell-fate decisions. We apply CRISPR-FO screening as a versatile platform to explore the involvement of transcription factors in photoreceptor subtype-specification. We find that three differentially-expressed transcription factors (Foxq2, Tbx2a and Tbx2b) play unique roles in controling the identity of photoreceptor subtypes within the retina. Our results provide novel insights into the function of these factors and how photoreceptors acquire their final identities. Furthermore, we have made our transcriptomic dataset openly available and easy to explore. This dataset and the screening method will be valuable to the scientific community and will enable the exploration of genes involved in many essential aspects of photoreceptor biology.

                Word reading includes a series of cognitive processes that convert low-level visual characteristics to neural representations. However, the consistency of the neural mechanisms for processing these cognitive components across different writing systems in bilinguals remains inconclusive. Here, we explored this question by employing representational similarity analysis with a semantic access task involving Chinese words, English words and Chinese pinyin. Divergent spatial distribution patterns were detected for each type of brain representation across ideographic and alphabetic languages, resulting in 100% classification accuracy. Meanwhile, convergent cognitive components processing was found in the core language-related regions in left hemisphere, including the inferior frontal gyrus, temporal pole, superior and middle temporal gyrus, precentral gyrus and supplementary motor areas. Broadly, our findings indicated that the neural basis for word recognition of different writing systems in bilinguals was divergent in spatial locations of neural representations but convergent in functions, which supported and enriched the assimilation-accommodation hypothesis.

TeaserCortical encoding of processing components across languages was divergent in fine spatial locations but convergent in cognitive functions.

                Nociceptive signals interact with various regions of the brain, including those involved in physical sensation, reward, cognition, and emotion. Emerging evidence points to a role of nociception in the modulation of the mesolimbic reward system. The mechanism by which nociception affects dopamine (DA) signaling and reward is unclear. The lateral hypothalamus (LH) and the lateral habenula (LHb) receive somatosensory inputs and are structurally connected with the mesolimbic DA system. Here we show that the LH-LHb pathway is necessary for nociceptive modulation of this system. Our extracellular single-unit recordings and head-mounted microendoscopic calcium imaging revealed that nociceptive stimulation by tail-pinch excited LHb and LH neurons, which was inhibited by chemical lesion of the LH. Tail-pinch decreased extracellular DA release in the nucleus accumbens ventrolateral shell, which was blocked by disruption of the LH. Furthermore, tail-pinch attenuated cocaine-induced locomotor activity, 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations and reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior, which was inhibited by chemogenetic silencing of the LH-LHb pathway. Our findings suggest that nociceptive stimulation recruits the LH-LHb pathway to inhibit mesolimbic DA system and drug reinstatement.

                Here we investigate how the extent of spatial attention affects center-surround interaction in visual motion processing. To do so, we measured motion direction discrimination thresholds in humans using drifting gratings and two attention conditions. Under the narrow attention condition, attention was limited to the central part of the visual stimulus, whereas under the wide attention condition, it was directed to both the center and surround of the stimulus. We found stronger surround suppression under the wide attention condition. The magnitude of the attention effect increased with the size of the surround when the stimulus had low contrast, but did not change when it had high contrast. Results also showed that attention had a weaker effect when the center and surround gratings drifted in opposite directions. Next, to establish a link between the behavioral results and the neuronal response characteristics, we performed computer simulations using the divisive normalization model. Our simulations showed that the model can successfully predict the observed behavioral results using parameters derived from the medial temporal (MT) area of the cortex. These findings reveal the critical role of spatial attention on surround suppression and establish a link between neuronal activity and behavior. Further, these results also suggest that the reduced surround suppression found in certain clinical disorders (e.g., schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder) may be caused by abnormal attention mechanisms.

                Selective vulnerability is an enigmatic feature of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), whereby a widely expressed protein causes lesions in specific brain regions and cell types. This selectivity may arise from cells possessing varying capacities to regain proteostasis when stressed by cytotoxic protein conformers. Using the RiboTag method in mice, translational responses of five neural subtypes to acquired prion disease (PrD) were measured. Pre-onset and disease onset timepoints were chosen based on longitudinal electroencephalography (EEG) that revealed a gradual increase in theta power between 10- and 18-weeks after prion injection, resembling a clinical feature of human PrD. At disease onset, marked by significantly increased theta power and histopathological lesions, mice had pronounced translatome changes in all five cell types despite having a normal outward appearance. Remarkably, at a pre-onset stage, prior to EEG and neuropathological changes, we found that 1) translatomes of astrocytes indicated a sharply reduced synthesis of ribosomal and mitochondrial components, 2) excitatory neurons showed increased expression of cytoskeletal genes, and 3) inhibitory neurons revealed reduced expression of circadian rhythm network genes. Further assessment for the role of circadian rhythms using a jet lag paradigm modestly exacerbated disease. These data demonstrate that early translatome responses to neurodegeneration emerge prior to other signs of disease and are unique to different cell types. Therapeutic strategies may need to target multiple pathways, each in specific populations of cells, early in the disease process.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-term consequences of alcohol use in early adolescent mice: focus on neuroadaptations in GR, CRF and BDNF</a></h4>

              
                Our aim was to assess the cognitive and emotional state, as well as related-changes in Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR), Corticotropin-Releasing Factor (CRF) and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) expression of adolescent C57BL/6J male mice after a 5-week two-bottle choice protocol (postnatal day (pd) 21 to pd52). Additionally, we wanted to analyze whether the behavioral and neurobiological effects observed in the late adolescence (pd62) lasted until the adulthood (pd84). Behavioral testing revealed that alcohol during early adolescence increased anxiety-like and compulsive-related behaviors and it was maintained in the adulthood. Concerning cognition, working memory was only altered in late adolescent mice, whereas object location test performance was impaired in both ages. In contrast, novel object recognition remained unaltered. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that alcohol during adolescence diminished BDNF+ cells in the cingulate cortex, the hippocampal CA1 layer and the central amygdala. Regarding hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) functioning, alcohol abuse increased the GR and CRF expression in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and the central amygdala. Besides, GR density was also higher in the prelimbic cortex and the basolateral amygdala regardless of animals age. Our findings suggest that adolescent alcohol exposure led to long-term behavioral alterations along with changes in BDNF, GR and CRF expression in limbic brain areas involved in stress response, emotional regulation, and cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Layer-specific developmentally precise axon targeting of transient suppressed-by-contrast retinal ganglion cells (tSbC RGCs)</a></h4>

              
                The mouse retina encodes diverse visual features in the spike trains of more than 40 retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types. Each RGC type innervates a specific subset of the more than 50 retinorecipient brain areas. Our catalog of RGC types and feature representations is nearing completion. Yet, we know little about where specific RGC types send their information. Furthermore, the developmental strategies by which RGC axons choose their targets and pattern their terminal arbors remain obscure. Here we identify a genetic intersection (Cck-Cre and Brn3cCKOAP) that selectively labels transient Suppressed-by-Contrast (tSbC) RGCs, a member of an evolutionarily conserved functionally mysterious RGC subclass. We find that tSbC RGCs selectively innervate the dorsolateral and ventrolateral geniculate nuclei of the thalamus (dLGN and vLGN), the superior colliculus (SC), and the nucleus of the optic tract (NOT). They binocularly innervate dLGN and vLGN but project only contralaterally to SC and NOT. In each target, tSbC RGC axons occupy a specific sublayer, suggesting that they restrict their input to specific circuits. The tSbC RGC axons span the length of the optic tract by birth and remain poised there until they simultaneously innervate their four targets around postnatal day five. The tSbC RGC axons make no errors in choosing their targets and establish mature stratification patterns from the outset. This precision is maintained in the absence of Brn3c. Our results provide the first map of SbC inputs to the brain, revealing a narrow target set, unexpected laminar organization, target-specific binocularity, and developmental precision.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural tracking as an objective measure of auditory perception and speech intelligibility</a></h4>

              
                The neural tracking framework enables the analysis of neural responses (EEG) to continuous natural speech, e.g., a story or a podcast. This allows for objective investigation of a range of auditory and linguistic processes in the brain during natural speech perception. This approach is more ecologically valid than traditional auditory evoked responses and has great potential for both research and clinical applications. In this article, we review the neural tracking framework and highlight three prominent examples of neural tracking analyses. This includes the neural tracking of the fundamental frequency of the voice (f0), the speech envelope and linguistic features. Each of these analyses provides a unique point of view into the hierarchical stages of speech processing in the human brain. f0-tracking assesses the encoding of fine temporal information in the early stages of the auditory pathway, i.e. from the auditory periphery up to early processing in the primary auditory cortex. This fundamental processing in (mostly) subcortical stages forms the foundation of speech perception in the cortex. Envelope tracking reflects bottom-up and top-down speech-related processes in the auditory cortex, and is likely necessary but not sufficient for speech intelligibility. To study neural processes more directly related to speech intelligibility, neural tracking of linguistic features can be used. This analysis focuses on the encoding of linguistic features (e.g. word or phoneme surprisal) in the brain. Together these analyses form a multi-faceted and time-effective objective assessment of the auditory and linguistic processing of an individual.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A brainstem integrator for self-localization and positional homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                To accurately track self-location, animals need to integrate their movements through space. In amniotes, representations of self-location have been found in regions such as the hippocampus. It is unknown whether more ancient brain regions contain such representations and by which pathways they may drive locomotion. Fish displaced by water currents must prevent uncontrolled drift to potentially dangerous areas. We found that larval zebrafish track such movements and can later swim back to their earlier location. Whole-brain functional imaging revealed the circuit enabling this process of positional homeostasis. Position-encoding brainstem neurons integrate optic flow, then bias future swimming to correct for past displacements by modulating inferior olive and cerebellar activity. Manipulation of position-encoding or olivary neurons abolished positional homeostasis or evoked behavior as if animals had experienced positional shifts. These results reveal a multiregional hindbrain circuit in vertebrates for optic flow integration, memory of self-location, and its neural pathway to behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural crest-related NXPH1/α-NRXN signaling opposes neuroblastoma malignancy by inhibiting metastasis</a></h4>

              
                Neuroblastoma is a pediatric cancer that can present as low- or high-risk tumors (LR-NBs and HR-NBs), the latter group showing poor prognosis due to metastasis and strong resistance to current therapy. NBs are known to originate from alterations to cells in the sympatho-adrenal lineage derived from the neural crest, but whether LR-NBs and HR-NBs differ in the way they exploit the transcriptional program underlying their developmental origin remains unclear. Here, we compared the transcriptional landscapes of primary samples of LR-NBs, HR-NBs and human fetal adrenal gland, and thereby identified the transcriptional signature associated to NB formation that further distinguishes LR-NBs from HR-NBs. The majority of the genes comprising this signature belong to the core sympatho-adrenal developmental program, are associated with favorable patient prognosis and with diminished disease progression. The top candidate gene of this list, Neurexophilin-1 (NXPH1), encodes a ligand of the transmembrane receptors -Neurexins (-NRXNs). Our functional in vivo and in vitro assays reveal that NXPH1/-NRXN signaling has a dual impact on NB behavior: whereas NXPH1 and -NRXN1 promote NB tumor growth by stimulating cell proliferation, they conversely inhibit the ability of NB cells to form metastases. Our findings uncover a module of the neural crest-derived sympatho-adrenal developmental program that opposes neuroblastoma malignancy by impeding metastasis, and pinpoint NXPH1/-NRXN signaling as a promising target to treat HR-NBs.

	<p>Although sleep problems are common in children with ADHD, their extent, preceding risk factors, and the association between neurocognitive performance and neurobiological processes in sleep and ADHD, are still largely unknown. We examined sleep variables in school-aged children with ADHD, addressing their intra-individual variability (IIV) and considering potential precursor symptoms as well as the chronotype. Additionally, in a subgroup of our sample, we investigated associations with neurobehavioral functioning (n = 44). A total of 57 children (6&amp;amp;ndash;12 years) with (n = 24) and without ADHD (n = 33) were recruited in one center of the large ESCAlife study to wear actigraphs for two weeks. Actigraphy-derived dependent variables, including IIV, were analyzed using linear mixed models in order to find differences between the groups. A stepwise regression model was used to investigate neuropsychological function. Overall, children with ADHD showed longer sleep onset latency (SOL), higher IIV in SOL, more movements during sleep, lower sleep efficiency, and a slightly larger sleep deficit on school days compared with free days. No group differences were observed for chronotype or sleep onset time. Sleep problems in infancy predicted later SOL and the total number of movements during sleep in children with and without ADHD. No additional effect of sleep problems, beyond ADHD symptom severity, on neuropsychological functioning was found. This study highlights the importance of screening children with ADHD for current and early childhood sleep disturbances in order to prevent long-term sleep problems and offer individualized treatments. Future studies with larger sample sizes should examine possible biological markers to improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: The King-Devick (KD) rapid number naming test is sensitive for concussion diagnosis, with increased test time from baseline as the outcome measure. Eye tracking during KD performance in concussed individuals shows an association between inter-saccadic interval (ISI) (the time between saccades) prolongation and prolonged testing time. This pilot study retrospectively assesses the relation between ISI prolongation during KD testing and cognitive performance in persistently-symptomatic individuals post-concussion. (2) Results: Fourteen participants (median age 34 years; 6 women) with prior neuropsychological assessment and KD testing with eye tracking were included. KD test times (72.6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 20.7 s) and median ISI (379.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 199.1 msec) were prolonged compared to published normative values. Greater ISI prolongation was associated with lower scores for processing speed (WAIS-IV Coding, r = 0.72, p = 0.0017), attention/working memory (Trails Making A, r = &amp;amp;minus;0.65, p = 0.006) (Digit Span Forward, r = 0.57, p = &amp;amp;minus;0.017) (Digit Span Backward, r= &amp;amp;minus;0.55, p = 0.021) (Digit Span Total, r = &amp;amp;minus;0.74, p = 0.001), and executive function (Stroop Color Word Interference, r = &amp;amp;minus;0.8, p = 0.0003). (3) Conclusions: This pilot study provides preliminary evidence suggesting that cognitive dysfunction may be associated with prolonged ISI and KD test times in concussion.</p>

	<p>Aim: To develop a microsimulation model to assess the potential health economic impact of software-assisted MRI in detecting disease activity or progression in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients. Methods: We develop a simulated decision analytical model based on a hypothetical cohort of RRMS patients to compare a baseline decision-making strategy in which only clinical evolution (relapses and disability progression) factors are used for therapy decisions in MS follow-up, with decision-making strategies involving MRI. In this context, we include comparisons with a visual radiologic assessment of lesion evolution, software-assisted lesion detection, and software-assisted brain volume loss estimation. The model simulates clinical (EDSS transitions, number of relapses) and subclinical (new lesions and brain volume loss) disease progression and activity, modulated by the efficacy profiles of different disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). The simulated decision-making process includes the possibility to escalate from a low efficacy DMT to a high efficacy DMT or to switch between high efficacy DMTs when disease activity is detected. We also consider potential error factors that may occur during decision making, such as incomplete detection of new lesions, or inexact computation of brain volume loss. Finally, differences between strategies in terms of the time spent on treatment while having undetected disease progression/activity, the impact on the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s quality of life, and costs associated with health status from a US perspective, are reported. Results: The average time with undetected disease progression while on low efficacy treatment is shortened significantly when using MRI, from around 3 years based on clinical criteria alone, to 2 when adding visual examination of MRI, and down to only 1 year with assistive software. Hence, faster escalation to a high efficacy DMT can be performed when MRI software is added to the radiological reading, which has positive effects in terms of health outcomes. The incremental utility shows average gains of 0.23 to 0.37 QALYs over 10 and 15 years, respectively, when using software-assisted MRI compared to clinical parameters only. Due to long-term health benefits, the average annual costs associated with health status are lower by $1500&amp;amp;ndash;$2200 per patient when employing MRI and assistive software. Conclusions: The health economic burden of MS is high. Using assistive MRI software to detect and quantify lesions and/or brain atrophy has a significant impact on the detection of disease activity, treatment decisions, health outcomes, utilities, and costs in patients with MS.</p>

	<p>Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), despite being a hepatotropic virus, is the causative agent of many systemic disorders, such as vasculitis, autoimmune diseases, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a broad spectrum of neurological and psychiatric manifestations. Although symptoms have been misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed, only recently, evidence of direct (inflammatory) or indirect (immune-mediated) HCV-dependent cerebral effects has been established. HCV infection can promote acute inflammatory response, pro-coagulative status and ischemic disorders, and neurodegeneration. These effects rely on cerebral HCV replication, possibly mediated by blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier alterations. Further study is needed to better understand the HCV-related mechanisms of brain damage.</p>

	<p>Recent evidence underlines the importance of seeing learning disorders in terms of their partial association (comorbidity). The present concept paper presents a model of reading that aims to account for performance on a naturalistic reading task within a comorbidity perspective. The model capitalizes on the distinction between three independent levels of analysis: competence, performance, and acquisition: Competence denotes the ability to master orthographic&amp;amp;ndash;phonological binding skills; performance refers to the ability to read following specific task requirements, such as scanning the text from left to right. Both competence and performance are acquired through practice. Practice is also essential for the consolidation of item-specific memory traces (or instances), a process which favors automatic processing. It is proposed that this perspective might help in understanding surface dyslexia, a reading profile that has provoked a prolonged debate among advocates of traditional models of reading. The proposed reading model proposes that surface dyslexia is due to a defective ability to consolidate specific traces or instances. In this vein, it is a &amp;amp;ldquo;real&amp;amp;rdquo; deficit, in the sense that it is not due to an artifact (such as limited exposure to print); however, as it is a cross-domain defect extending to other learning behaviors, such as spelling and math, it does not represent a difficulty specific to reading. Recent evidence providing initial support for this hypothesis is provided. Overall, it is proposed that viewing reading in a comorbidity perspective might help better understand surface dyslexia and might encourage research on the association between surface dyslexia and other learning disorders.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Mirror therapy is one of the promising interventions for the upper limb rehabilitation of stroke patients. Postural asymmetry during mirror therapy was pointed out as a possibility to influence stroke patients&amp;amp;rsquo; rehabilitation negatively. However, it is still difficult to find studies on the postural changes in mirror therapy concept interventions. This study compared three methods of postural differences as follows: traditional mirror therapy (mirror); displaying the real-time movement of the unaffected side on the screen above the affected side (screen); and playing a pre-recorded movement of the unaffected side on a tablet placed on a movable box where the affected hand is put inside (movable). (2) Methods: to observe a kinematic difference, we recruited 16 healthy volunteers to go through three different interventions (mirror, screen, movable). The motion capture system made observations on the postures before and during interventions, then compared and analyzed. (3) Results: while using the mirror, the sitting posture was observed to become asymmetric, and the following unique posture was observed where the target hand went further from the trunk while performing tasks. In addition, the shoulder of the target side came forward, and the difference between both elbow flexion angles was also observed. On the other hand, the screen or movable device did not cause a significant change in the sitting posture, and no additional postural differences were observed either. (4) Conclusions: mirror therapy showed a tendency to cause lateral flexion opposite the target hand, thus, creating additional postural change. However, developed methods controlled spine tilt, and enabled the keeping of the midline while sitting during the intervention.</p>

	<p>The aim of the COmedication Study assessing Mono- and cOmbination therapy with levodopa-carbidopa inteStinal gel (COSMOS) was to assess the use of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) as monotherapy in patients with advanced Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (APD) in routine clinical practice. COSMOS was an international observational study with one cross-sectional visit and retrospective data collection. In Romania, 95 adult patients with APD on LCIG treatment for at least 12 months were enrolled and stratified according to their LCIG therapy after 12 months: monotherapy (without any add-on PD medication), monotherapy with night PD medication and LCIG + add-on medication. Compared to the moment of LCIG initiation, the percentage of patients on monotherapy increased at three months after LCIG initiation and remained constant up to 12 months, when 30.5% of the patients were on LCIG monotherapy and 11.6% were on monotherapy with night medication. &amp;amp;ldquo;Off&amp;amp;rdquo; time and &amp;amp;ldquo;On&amp;amp;rdquo; time with dyskinesia decreased from LCIG initiation to patient visit in all groups. LCIG monotherapy with or without night medication may provide a simplified treatment option for selected APD patients, with long-term efficacy similar to that of LCIG plus add-on medication.</p>

	<p>While significant progress has been achieved in studying resting-state functional networks in a healthy human brain and in a wide range of clinical conditions, many questions related to their relationship to the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s cellular constituents remain. Here, we use quantitative Gradient-Recalled Echo (qGRE) MRI for mapping the human brain cellular composition and BOLD (blood&amp;amp;ndash;oxygen level-dependent) MRI to explore how the brain cellular constituents relate to resting-state functional networks. Results show that the BOLD signal-defined synchrony of connections between cellular circuits in network-defined individual functional units is mainly associated with the regional neuronal density, while the between-functional units&amp;amp;rsquo; connectivity strength is also influenced by the glia and synaptic components of brain tissue cellular constituents. These mechanisms lead to a rather broad distribution of resting-state functional network properties. Visual networks with the highest neuronal density (but lowest density of glial cells and synapses) exhibit the strongest coherence of the BOLD signal as well as the strongest intra-network connectivity. The Default Mode Network (DMN) is positioned near the opposite part of the spectrum with relatively low coherence of the BOLD signal but with a remarkably balanced cellular contents, enabling DMN to have a prominent role in the overall organization of the brain and hierarchy of functional networks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical students’ future careers [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted medical education on multiple levels, and medical students have been forced to adjust to distance learning, altered clinical opportunities, and standardized testing inconsistencies. We sought to identify the effects of these dramatic deviations on medical students’ career plans. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of medical students between July 13, 2020, and September 9, 2020 in order to assess the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on students’ career decisions. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables. Results: Of the 585 eligible medical students, we had a final sample of 76 responses (n=76) (13% response rate). Students felt neutral regarding having more time to explore research projects (Mean ± SD; 3.06 ± 1.18) and hobbies (3.43 ± 1.28). Most survey respondents somewhat disagreed that they considered quitting medical school during the pandemic (1.55 ± 1.10). Students somewhat agreed that they view the field of medicine more positively since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (3.60 ± 1.09). Respondents somewhat agreed that they would be unable to explore other specialties and find their best fit (3.55 ± 1.32). We found that the minority (4/66, 6%) of students had considered changing their specialty. Students felt neutral in terms of their Step 1 (3.25 ± 1.05) or Step 2 (2.81 ± 1.02) score deterring them from future career opportunities. Conclusions:  Most medical students have experienced barriers in their career pathway as a direct cause of COVID-19 restrictions on medical education, including the ability to explore different specialties to discover their best fit or find a chance to network with mentors. However, despite these obstacles, most students remain committed to medicine.

                Background: This study investigated how the inclusion of Boesenbergia pandurata extract (BPE) in goldfish feed affects fish growth, immunity, and resistance to infection by Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens.   Methods: Four fish feeds, were prepared by adding BPE at the concentrations of 0 (control), 2, 4, and 6 g kg-1, respectively, and 120 goldfish (Cyprinus carpio; initial weight 5 g) were separated into 12 boxes and fed with specific pellets and examined thrice. The experiment lasted 12 weeks, beginning with the different feeds, fish growth was measured at Weeks 4 and 8 after the feeding period. Moreover, a challenge test with pathogen bacteria to assay disease resistance was administered at Week 8 after the feeding period, and the survival rate and relative percentage of survival were quantified at Week 12.   Results: At Week 8, the goldfish that were fed BPE-containing feeds were significantly heavier than the fish that received the control feed (pellet without BPE), and the highest weight gain, reaching 72.44 g, was obtained with Pellet 3; accordingly, the specific growth rate after BPE treatment (5.7%) was higher than that after control treatment. Conversely, the feed conversion ratio in the control group, 2.03, was higher than the ratios in the BPE groups, which were decreased to 0.55–0.90. Lastly, BPE treatment consistently enhanced the immunity parameters of goldfish (relative to control treatment) at weeks 4 and 8, and following BPE treatment, the rate of resistance against bacterial infection, 68.3%–77.0%, was higher than that after control treatment.   Conclusions: BPE addition in goldfish feed clearly produces a positive effect by enhancing fish growth, immunity, and resistance to infection by pathogenic bacteria, and 4 g kg-1 is the optimal BPE concentration in feed prepared for goldfish.

                Background Poor communication at the time of patient handover is recognized as a root cause of a considerable proportion of preventable deaths. Despite several advantages, the Patient Care Report (PCR) implementation may include insufficient details for demonstrating the functional status of the patients during the actual response which can further prolong the response time. Healthcare entities have been emphasizing the need to implement e-PCR systems. This systematic review aimed to examine the impact of e-PCR systems on reducing response time of prehospital care. Methods Literature search was carried out using the relevant search terms and keywords with inclusion and exclusion criteria. N=6 researchers that focused on the impact of e-PCR systems on reducing response time of prehospital medical care were included within this review. Results The findings indicated that ePCR implementation led to prominent improvements in the quality of the care services provided by the healthcare organisation. Additionally, ePCR reduces the response rate by data standardization.   Conclusion The implementation of e-PCR systems ensures the availability of records and automates reporting on given quality metrics. Moreover, the implementation of e-PCR systems also improved response time and increased the out of hospital rates of survival. However, fear of increasing the ambulance run time, compromise on the availability of ambulance, and challenges in integration with the existing information systems implemented within the hospitals, were some of the most common challenging situations associated with implementing e-PCR systems.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Inequality and migration in Kenya: Investigating the subnational associations using census data [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Since the early 2000s, there has been an extensive debate on whether migration and inequality are interlinked, with varying conclusions arising from methodological as well as theoretical dispositions. The aim of this study is to contribute to this debate by exploring the nexus between several dimensions of inequalities and migration in Kenya. Methods: This study used the subnational(county) data on inequalities and migration in Kenya obtained from several reports. Four explanatory variables including access to water, electricity, composite index of County Human Development Index (County HDI) and County Gini were used. Our dependent variable was migration intensity, measured by the Revised Weighted Net Migration Rate. Correlation and spatial regression analysis were performed to model the relationship between migration and inequality.   Results: Findings revealed that migration had a non-linear relationship with income inequality, such that a change in one unit of migration intensity results in a 567 negative change in County Gini. The County Gini had the highest explanatory power in our model, although counties with high HDI tend to have higher migration intensities. Migration intensities in the country were not randomly distributed as we found evidence of spatial clustering with two key emergent hotspots, a high-high in the lake region and a low-low in the coastal region. Regions with low migration intensities correspond with higher poverty, implying that structural factors may explain the migration intensities in the country.   Conclusions: The study highlights that the subnational income inequality reduces as migration intensifies. We conclude that migration has an equalizing effect on inequality as observed in some studies. Regions with high poverty tend to have lower migration intensity, implying that structural factors are important in influencing migration. Use of migration intensity and application of spatial analysis have improved our understanding of migration and inequality, and should be applied in future research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Developing assessment criteria for operation control of local security health fund in the upper central area, Thailand [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The government's support for public health care in Thailand is very important and necessary. Therefore, there must be a supervisory process for budgeting to create the most equality and fairness to all people. At present, the instruments used to monitor health fund performance cannot be comprehensively assessed for effectiveness such as planning, organizing, leading and controlling. To address this gap, we created the Assessment Criteria for Operation control of Local security health Fund (ACOLF) which evaluates old assessment criteria, review literature and experience as separate constructs. Methods: The ACOLF is a 42-item survey with 12 old assessment criteria, 26 review literature and four experience items rated on scale from 0-9. In an observational analytical study, the survey was administered to 406 general population participants working in a provincial office for local administration. Validity and reliability were evaluated by testing construct validity. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to confirm the item of old assessment criteria, review literature and experience. Reliability of the questionnaires was tested using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. Results: The ACOLF demonstrated convergent construct validity (KMO = 0.88 and Bartlett's Test; p value <0.001) and explaining 88.95% of the variance of this construct. There were seven factors involved and all  factors consisted of a total of 41 variables observed by the weight of the composition of the observed variables ranged from 0.780 to 0.972 at the significance level of 0.05. The reliability of the assessment criteria was tested using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, the total results was at 0.889. Conclusions: The ACOLF is a short, cover activity, valid, and reliable instrument for assessment operation control of local security health fund. Based on research findings the tool can be used to comprehensively assess the performance of local security health fund.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The job applicant reactions towards Patterned Behavior Description Interview (PBDI) and Mixed Situational and Patterned Behavior Description Interview (Mixed SPBDI) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: When applying for a job, applicant reactions are defined as the amount to which the applicants of the job regard the process of selection as impartial or unbiased. The questions for the structured interview can be future-oriented (Situational Interview) or past-oriented (Patterned Behaviour Description Interview). Past research on using SI or PBDI in selection process and their effects on applicant reactions showed that applicant reactions are highest towards PBDI. Methods: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of combining PBDI and SI (mixed SPBDI) as interview questions, and to differentiate its effect with PBDI. This study involved 46 lecturers from the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). This study used (a) mixed SPBDI, and PBDI as interview questions, and (b) Applicant Reaction Questionnaires which was based on the Organizational Justice theory. The interview was conducted in a transcript form. After the participants answered the interview transcripts, they answered the applicant reactions questionnaires. The data was then analysed and presented. Results: The results showed a significant difference between mixed SPBDI and PBDI, with the PBDI’s mean (M = 13.61; SD = 1.57) is significantly higher than the mixed SPBDI’s mean (M = 10.89; SD 1.91), t (46) = 7.22; p < 0.01. Specifically, applicants reacted more positively to PBDI interview content compared to the mixed SPBDI. Conclusion: This research had few limitations such as the interview being conducted in the form of transcript and not verbally as in real workplace context. It is also limited to studying the reactions in terms of only perceived fairness and no other elements such as organizational effectiveness or the decision making of the applicants. Nevertheless, this study has contributed to the theoretical and research development in applicant reactions, and to the practical application for organizations in Malaysia.

<p>Electroconvulsive therapy relieves pain by decreasing brain local function and global network patterns, while increasing structure in pain-related circuit.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Approximately two-thirds of major depressive disorder (MDD) patients have pain, which exacerbates the severity of depression. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an efficacious treatment that can alleviate depressive symptoms; however, treatment for pain and the underlying neural substrate is elusive. We enrolled 34 patients with MDD and 33 matched healthy controls to complete clinical assessments and neuroimaging scans. MDD patients underwent second assessments and scans after ECT. We defined a pain-related network with a published meta-analysis and calculated topological patterns to reveal topologic alterations induced by ECT. Using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFFs), we probed local function aberrations of pain-related circuits in MDD patients. Subsequently, we applied gray matter volume (GMV) to reveal structural alterations of ECT relieving pain. The relationships between functional and structural aberrations and pain were determined. ECT significantly alleviated pain. The neural mechanism based on pain-related circuits indicated that ECT weakened the circuit function (ALFF: left amygdala and right supplementary motor area), while augmenting the structure (GMV: bilateral amygdala/insula/hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex). The topologic patterns became less efficient after ECT. Correlation analysis between the change in pain and GMV had negative results in bilateral amygdala/insula/hippocampus. Similarity, there was a positive correlation between a change in ALFF in the left amygdala and improved clinical symptoms. ECT improved pain by decreasing brain local function and global network patterns, while increasing structure in pain-related circuits. Functional and structural alterations were associated with improvement in pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Attention network modulation via tRNS correlates with attention gain</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) can enhance vision in the healthy and diseased brain. Yet, the impact of multi-day tRNS on large-scale cortical networks is still unknown. We investigated the impact of tRNS coupled with behavioral training on resting-state functional connectivity and attention. We trained human subjects for 4 consecutive days on two attention tasks, while receiving tRNS over the intraparietal sulci, the middle temporal areas, or Sham stimulation. We measured resting-state functional connectivity of nodes of the dorsal and ventral attention network (DVAN) before and after training. We found a strong behavioral improvement and increased connectivity within the DVAN after parietal stimulation only. Crucially, behavioral improvement positively correlated with connectivity measures. We conclude changes in connectivity are a marker for the enduring effect of tRNS upon behavior. Our results suggest that tRNS has strong potential to augment cognitive capacity in healthy individuals and promote recovery in the neurological population.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis of human dorsal root ganglion neurons</a></h4>

              
                Somatosensory neurons with cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) project to the skin, muscles, bones, and viscera to detect touch and temperature as well as to mediate proprioception and many types of interoception. In addition, the somatosensory system conveys the clinically relevant noxious sensations of pain and itch. Here, we used single nuclear transcriptomics to characterize transcriptomic classes of human DRG neurons that detect these diverse types of stimuli. Notably, multiple types of human DRG neurons have transcriptomic features that resemble their mouse counterparts although expression of genes considered important for sensory function often differed between species. More unexpectedly, we identified several transcriptomic classes with no clear equivalent in the other species. This dataset should serve as a valuable resource for the community, for example as means of focusing translational efforts on molecules with conserved expression across species.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Metabolomic profiling reveals a differential role for hippocampal glutathione reductase in infantile memory formation</a></h4>

              
                The metabolic mechanisms underlying the formation of early-life episodic memories remain poorly characterized. Here, we assessed the metabolomic profile of the rat hippocampus at different developmental ages both at baseline and following episodic learning. We report that the hippocampal metabolome significantly changes over developmental ages and that learning regulates differential arrays of metabolites according to age. The infant hippocampus had the largest number of significant changes following learning, with downregulation of 54 metabolites. Of those, a large proportion was associated with the glutathione-mediated cellular defenses against oxidative stress. Further biochemical, molecular, and behavioral assessments revealed that infantile learning evokes a rapid and persistent increase in the activity of neuronal glutathione reductase, the enzyme that regenerates reduced glutathione from its oxidized form. Inhibition of glutathione reductase selectively impaired long-term memory formation in infant but not in juvenile and adult rats, confirming its age-specific role. Thus, metabolomic profiling revealed that the hippocampal glutathione-mediated antioxidant pathway is differentially required for the formation of infantile memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inhibitory co-transmission from midbrain dopamine neurons relies on presynaptic GABA uptake</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine (DA)-releasing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNcDA) inhibit target cells in the striatum through postsynaptic activation of {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for GABAergic signaling remain unclear, as SNcDA neurons lack enzymes typically required to produce GABA or package it into synaptic vesicles. Here we show that aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a1 (Aldh1a1), an enzyme proposed to function as a GABA synthetic enzyme in SNcDA neurons does not produce GABA for synaptic transmission. Instead, we demonstrate that SNcDA axons obtain GABA exclusively through presynaptic uptake using the membrane GABA transporter Gat1 (encoded by Slc6a1). GABA is then packaged for vesicular release using the vesicular monoamine transporter Vmat2. Our data therefore show that presynaptic transmitter recycling can substitute for de novo GABA synthesis and that Vmat2 contributes to vesicular GABA transport, expanding the range of molecular mechanisms available to neurons to support inhibitory synaptic communication.

                The anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-37 (IL-37) is a member of the IL-1 family but not expressed in mice. We used a human IL 37 (hIL-37tg) expressing mouse, which has been subjected to various models of local and systemic inflammation as well as immunological challenges. Those studies demonstrate an immune-modulatory role of IL-37 which can be characterized as an important suppressor of innate immunity. We investigated the functions of IL-37 in the CNS and explored the effects of IL-37 on neuronal architecture and function, microglia phenotype, cytokine production and behavior after inflammatory challenge by intraperitoneal LPS-injection. Reduced spine density, activated microglia phenotype and impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) were observed in wild-type mice after LPS injection, whereas hIL-37tg mice showed no impairment. In addition, we crossed the hIL-37tg mouse with an animal model of Alzheimer's disease (APP/PS1) to investigate the anti-inflammatory properties of IL-37 under chronic neuroinflammatory conditions. Our results show that IL-37 is able to limit inflammation in the brain after acute inflammatory events and prevent the loss of cognitive abilities in a mouse model of AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Input to layer 1 of somatosensory cortex: Local input outweighs long-range and can modulate the activity of layer 1 interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Neocortical layer (L) 1 is a locus for interactions between long-range inputs, L1 interneurons and apical tuft dendrites of pyramidal neurons. Even though we have a wealth of information about L1, the level and effect of local input to this layer have not been quantified. Here we characterized the input to L1 of mouse somatosensory cortex with fast blue, monosynaptic rabies and optogenetics. Our work shows that most of the input to L1 is local, and that both local and long-range inputs to this layer arise predominantly from L2/3 and L5 neurons. Subtypes of L5 and L6b neurons project to the overlying L1 with different probabilities. VIP and SST interneurons in L2/3 and L5 also innervate L1. A subset of local L5, the intratelencephalic, pyramidal neurons, drive L1 interneurons but have no effect on L5 apical tuft dendrites. Monosynaptic rabies-based retrograde labelling reveals presynaptic boutons covering the entire somato-dendritic axis of pyramidal neurons, including in L1. When fast blue application was combined with rabies virus, we found that only a fraction of local and long-range neurons was both presynaptic to L5 neurons and projected to L1. These results demonstrate that L1 receives a large proportion of its input from local neurons, and that some of these inputs specifically target interneurons. We conclude that L1 is not just a site for interaction between long-range feedback and apical tuft dendrites of pyramidal cells, it is also a site for complex modulation of pyramidal neurons and interneurons by local inputs.

                Brain swelling occurs in cerebral malaria (CM) and may either reverse or result in fatal outcome. It is currently unknown how brain swelling in CM reverses, as investigations have been hampered by inadequate animal models. In this study, we show that reversible brain swelling in experimental murine cerebral malaria (ECM) can be induced reliably after single vaccination with radiation-attenuated sporozoites as revealed by in vivo high-field (9.4T) magnetic resonance imaging. Our results provide evidence that parenchymal fluid increase and consecutive brain swelling results from transcellular blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD), as revealed by electron microscopy. This mechanism enables reversal of brain swelling but does not prevent persistent focal brain damage, evidenced by microhemorrhages, in areas of most severe BBBD. In a cohort of 27 pediatric and adult CM patients (n=4 fatal, n=23 non-fatal) two out of four fatal CM patients (50%) and 8 out of 23 non-fatal CM patients (35%) showed microhemorrhages on MRI at clinical field strength of 1.5T, emphasizing the translational potential of the experimental model.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Supplementary motor area contributions to rhythm perception</a></h4>

              
                Timing is everything, but our understanding of the neural mechanisms of timing remains limited, particularly for timing of sequences. Temporal sequences can be represented relative to a recurrent beat (beat-based or relative timing), or as a series of absolute durations (non-beat-based or absolute timing). Neuroimaging work suggests involvement of the basal ganglia, supplementary motor area (SMA), the premotor cortices, and the cerebellum in both beat- and non-beat-based timing. Here we examined how beat-based timing and non-beat-based sequence timing were affected by modulating excitability of the supplementary motor area, the right cerebellum, and the bilateral dorsal premotor cortices, using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Participants were subjected to a sham stimulation session, followed an active stimulation session where anodal or cathodal 2mA tDCS was applied to the SMA, right premotor cortex, left premotor cortex, or the cerebellum. During both sessions, participants discriminated changes in rhythms which differentially engage beat-based or non-beat-based timing. Rhythm discrimination performance was improved by increasing SMA excitability, and impaired by decreasing SMA excitability. This polarity-dependent effect on rhythm discrimination was absent for cerebellar or premotor cortex stimulation, suggesting a crucial role of the SMA and/or its functionally connected networks in rhythmic timing mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Couching the brain's multiple-demand and language-specific systems within a macroscale gradient of cortical connectivity</a></h4>

              
                The cerebrum comprises a set of specialised systems that tile across the cortical sheet, forming a tapestry-like configuration. For example, the multiple-demand and language-specific systems occupy largely separate neural estates and exhibit disparate functional profiles. Although delimiting the boundary between systems informs where cortical sheet functionally fractionates, it remains unclear why different systems' topographical placements are spatially configured in typical manners and how a macroscale architecture arises from this topography. Novel approaches have tackled this challenge by condensing the topography into a principal gradient, which represents the workflow of information processing from sensory-motoric to abstract-cognitive. To understand how the multiple-demand and language-specific systems are accommodated in the gradient framework, here we used fMRI to probe cognitive operations in semantic vs. visuospatial domains and projected functional activities onto the principal gradient. We found that the two systems showed distinct trajectories of distribution along gradient tiers, suggesting different roles in the transition from sensation to cognition. Critically, when semantic processing became difficult, the brain recruited a specialised 'semantic-control' system that was a functional and anatomical 'hybrid' juxtaposed between the multi-demand and language systems. We discuss how the brain's modular division can be better understood through the lens of a dimensionality-reduced gradient-like architecture.

	<p>The present study demonstrates that synaptamide (N-docosahexaenoylethanolamine), an endogenous metabolite of docosahexaenoic acid, when administered subcutaneously (4 mg/kg/day, 14 days), exhibits analgesic activity and promotes cognitive recovery in the rat sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury (CCI) model. We analyzed the dynamics of GFAP-positive astroglia and S100&amp;amp;beta;-positive astroglia activity, the expression of nerve growth factor (NGF), and two subunits of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR1 and NMDAR2A) in the hippocampi of the experimental animals. Hippocampal neurogenesis was evaluated by immunohistochemical detection of DCX. Analysis of N-acylethanolamines in plasma and in the brain was performed using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry technique. In vitro and in vivo experiments show that synaptamide (1) reduces cold allodynia, (2) improves working memory and locomotor activity, (3) stabilizes neurogenesis and astroglial activity, (4) enhances the expression of NGF and NMDAR1, (5) increases the concentration of Ca2+ in astrocytes, and (6) increases the production of N-acylethanolamines. The results of the present study demonstrate that synaptamide affects the activity of hippocampal astroglia, resulting in faster recovery after CCI.</p>

	<p>Robotic-assisted therapy (RAT) is a task-specific approach for treating gait disorders in individuals with neurological impairments. However, the effectiveness of RAT is not clear for different severities of involvement, pathologies, and ages. This study aimed to assess the functional and clinical status outcomes after RAT in individuals with cerebral palsy (CP). Twenty-eight individuals with bilateral spastic CP were enrolled (female = 10; male = 18; age = 15.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.0 years). The RAT program consisted of 30 sessions: five sessions weekly for six weeks. Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) and clinical physical examinations were evaluated before and after RAT. Our results suggested that the RAT program with the described protocol can improve the general gross motor functions of individuals with CP in Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels I and II, and primarily improves performance on less complex GMFM items for those in GMFCS levels III and IV. The lower baseline functional level was related to a greater functional improvement. Older individuals were noticed to improve more in GMFM dimension D. Regarding impairments evaluated by clinical examinations, no change was found after RAT intervention. It is worth mentioning that the strength of knee muscles was not affected either.</p>

	<p>Although many musical intervention studies exist in the wider framework of neuroscience and psychology, the preliminary importance of feasibility studies is rarely discussed. Adding to this fact the limited research existing on the therapeutic and restorative potential of music exposure during early developmental periods, pushed us to concentrate on investigating newborns&amp;amp;rsquo; perception of music and its impact on the brain. Here, we explore the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) approach when measuring and comparing the neurophysiological perception of music versus language on the brainstem of newborns using auditory brainstem response (ABR). Twenty-five healthy full-term infants were recruited, eight of which were measured within their first 10 days postpartum. The evaluation of the study&amp;amp;rsquo;s feasibility appealed to five main objectives that essentially answer the question: Can our protocol work? Each objective proposes questions based on Orsmond and Cohn&amp;amp;rsquo;s guiding framework, designed to assess, and assist feasibility in understanding barriers toward a study&amp;amp;rsquo;s success. Our results justify that newborns are well capable of undergoing the study and given meticulous considerations and improvements on the intervention resources. The procedure&amp;amp;rsquo;s communication and technical obstacles are resoluble. Moreover, assimilation of external factors to adapt, such as the culture variation and the ABR protocol implementation are necessary. The study was well received in the selected region (Middle East), and the recording procedure showed potential outcomes for a comprehensive RCT.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Sex differences in early language delay and in developmental language disorder</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Developmental language disorder (DLD) is a neurodevelopmental condition, occurring in about 3% to 7% of preschoolers, that can impair communication and negatively impact educational and social attainments, in spite of adequate neurological, cognitive, emotional, social development, and educational opportunities for language learning. Significant risk factors for DLD are male sex, familial history of early language delay, low parental education, and various perinatal factors. A strong sex effect with a higher prevalence of language delay and DLD in males than in females has been consistently reported. Neurobiological and environmental risk factors, interacting with each other, are probably responsible for the phenotypic expression of DLD. The aim of this brief review is to further the knowledge of the role of sex in early language delay and DLD by analyzing the evidence from four significant sources: epidemiological studies, studies on twins, family aggregation studies, and studies on sex chromosome trisomies. Data pertaining only to sex differences (biological and physiological characteristics of females and males) will be analyzed. Studies on family aggregations and twins confirm the role of genetic factors and of sex in determining language abilities and disabilities, but genes alone do not determine outcomes. Sex chromosome trisomies represent a unique example of the relationship between a genetic alteration and a language disorder. Clarification of how sex acts in determining DLD could provide new information on early risk factors and, thus, contribute to improve diagnosis and clinical management.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Portal cavernoma related to multiple liver hydatidosis: A rare case of fatal cataclysmic haemorrhage. [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Clinical presentation of liver hydatidosis can vary from asymptomatic forms to lethal complications. We report herein a rare case of a 27-year-old male from a rural Tunisian region who presented with large-abundance haematemesis, haemodynamic instability, and marked biological data of hypersplenism. Endoscopy showed bleeding esophageal varicose veins that were ligated. Abdominal ultrasound concluded the presence of three type CE2 hydatic liver cysts causing portal cavernoma with signs of portal hypertension. Despite resuscitation, the patient died of massive rebleeding leading to haemorrhagic shock. Hepatic hydatid cyst should be considered as an indirect cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in endemic countries. Early abdominal ultrasound in varicose haemorrhage is essential in orienting the diagnosis.

     alt="Timing of treatment with an endogenous opioid alters immune response and spinal cord pathology in female mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis"/>
<p>Adult female C57BL/6 mice inoculated with myelin oligodendrocytic glycoprotein (MOG<sub>35–55</sub>) emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant followed by pertussis toxin resulted in a behavioral profile consistent with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a rodent model of multiple sclerosis. EAE mice displayed a wide range of behaviors which could be effectively reduced by treatment with naltrexone at low dosages (0.1 mg/kg; LDN) or opioid growth factor (10 mg/kg; OGF) initiated at the time of disease induction (prophylactic) or at the onset of EAE. The efficacy of treatment as measured by cytokine levels, behavior, sensitivity, and OGF serum values were dependent on the timing of therapy.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that primarily affects women during the second or third decade of life. The mechanism is hypothesized to involve unregulated peripheral inflammation resulting in blood–brain barrier damage, and eventual axonal damage and demyelination. Based on this understanding, the animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), often is utilized to study lymphocyte activation. Therapeutic paradigms of exogenous opioid growth factor (OGF) or low-dose naltrexone (LDN) treatment can modulate EAE, but little is reported regarding OGF or LDN effects on peripheral inflammation, microglia activation, and/or macrophage proliferation. Moreover, little is known about differential responses to LDN or OGF relative to the duration and timing of treatment. Utilizing a female mouse model of EAE, two treatment regimens were established to investigate differences between prophylactic treatment and traditional therapy initiated at the time of disease presentation. Prophylactic OGF or LDN treatment delayed the onset of behavior, suppressed neutrophil replication, and curtailed lymphocyte proliferation which ultimately improved behavioral outcome. Traditional therapy with OGF or LDN reversed behavioral deficits, restored OGF and IL-17 serum levels, and inhibited microglial activation within 8 days. Reduced serum OGF levels in untreated EAE mice correlated with increased microglia activation within lumbar spinal cords. Both treatment regimens of OGF or LDN reduced activated microglia, whereas only prophylactic treatment prevented CNS macrophage aggregation. These data demonstrate that the timing of LDN or OGF treatment initiation alters outcomes and can prevent or reverse behavioral deficits, cytokine activation, and spinal cord pathology.</p>
