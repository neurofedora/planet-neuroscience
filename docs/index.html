              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16861">Arbor-TVB: A Novel Multi-Scale Co-Simulation Framework with a Case Study on Neural-Level Seizure Generation and Whole-Brain Propagation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.16861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational neuroscience has traditionally focused on isolated scales, limiting understanding of brain function across multiple levels. While microscopic models capture biophysical details of neurons, macroscopic models describe large-scale network dynamics. Integrating these scales, however, remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a novel co-simulation framework that bridges these levels by integrating the neural simulator Arbor with The Virtual Brain (TVB) platform. Arbor enables detailed simulations from single-compartment neurons to populations of such cell, while TVB models whole-brain dynamics based on anatomical features and the mean neural activity of a brain region. By linking these simulators for the first time, we provide an example of how to model and investigate the onset of seizures in specific areas and their propagation to the full brain. This framework employs an MPI intercommunicator for real-time bidirectional interaction, translating between discrete spikes from Arbor and continuous TVB activity. The novel Arbor-TVB co-simulator allows replacement of TVB nodes with biologically realistic neuron populations, offering insights into seizure propagation and potential intervention strategies. The integration of Arbor and TVB marks a significant advancement in multi-scale modeling, providing a comprehensive computational framework for studying neural disorders and optimizing treatments.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03198">SimSort: A Data-Driven Framework for Spike Sorting by Large-Scale Electrophysiology Simulation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.03198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spike sorting is an essential process in neural recording, which identifies and separates electrical signals from individual neurons recorded by electrodes in the brain, enabling researchers to study how specific neurons communicate and process information. Although there exist a number of spike sorting methods which have contributed to significant neuroscientific breakthroughs, many are heuristically designed, making it challenging to verify their correctness due to the difficulty of obtaining ground truth labels from real-world neural recordings. In this work, we explore a data-driven, deep learning-based approach. We begin by creating a large-scale dataset through electrophysiology simulations using biologically realistic computational models. We then present SimSort, a pretraining framework for spike sorting. Trained solely on simulated data, SimSort demonstrates zero-shot generalizability to real-world spike sorting tasks, yielding consistent improvements over existing methods across multiple benchmarks. These results highlight the potential of simulation-driven pretraining to enhance the robustness and scalability of spike sorting in experimental neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14806">Place Cells as Position Embeddings of Multi-Time Random Walk Transition Kernels for Path Planning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.14806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hippocampus orchestrates spatial navigation through collective place cell encodings that form cognitive maps. We reconceptualize the population of place cells as position embeddings approximating multi-scale symmetric random walk transition kernels: the inner product $\langle h(x, t), h(y, t) \rangle = q(y|x, t)$ represents normalized transition probabilities, where $h(x, t)$ is the embedding at location $ x $, and $q(y|x, t)$ is the normalized symmetric transition probability over time $t$. The time parameter $\sqrt{t}$ defines a spatial scale hierarchy, mirroring the hippocampal dorsoventral axis. $q(y|x, t)$ defines spatial adjacency between $x$ and $y$ at scale or resolution $\sqrt{t}$, and the pairwise adjacency relationships $(q(y|x, t), \forall x, y)$ are reduced into individual embeddings $(h(x, t), \forall x)$ that collectively form a map of the environment at sale $\sqrt{t}$. Our framework employs gradient ascent on $q(y|x, t) = \langle h(x, t), h(y, t)\rangle$ with adaptive scale selection, choosing the time scale with maximal gradient at each step for trap-free, smooth trajectories. Efficient matrix squaring $P_{2t} = P_t^2$ builds global representations from local transitions $P_1$ without memorizing past trajectories, enabling hippocampal preplay-like path planning. This produces robust navigation through complex environments, aligning with hippocampal navigation. Experimental results show that our model captures place cell properties -- field size distribution, adaptability, and remapping -- while achieving computational efficiency. By modeling collective transition probabilities rather than individual place fields, we offer a biologically plausible, scalable framework for spatial navigation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17003">Sufficient conditions for offline reactivation in recurrent neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.17003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During periods of quiescence, such as sleep, neural activity in many brain circuits resembles that observed during periods of task engagement. However, the precise conditions under which task-optimized networks can autonomously reactivate the same network states responsible for online behavior is poorly understood. In this study, we develop a mathematical framework that outlines sufficient conditions for the emergence of neural reactivation in circuits that encode features of smoothly varying stimuli. We demonstrate mathematically that noisy recurrent networks optimized to track environmental state variables using change-based sensory information naturally develop denoising dynamics, which, in the absence of input, cause the network to revisit state configurations observed during periods of online activity. We validate our findings using numerical experiments on two canonical neuroscience tasks: spatial position estimation based on self-motion cues, and head direction estimation based on angular velocity cues. Overall, our work provides theoretical support for modeling offline reactivation as an emergent consequence of task optimization in noisy neural circuits.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15889">Combining SNNs with Filtering for Efficient Neural Decoding in Implantable Brain-Machine Interfaces</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2312.15889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While it is important to make implantable brain-machine interfaces (iBMI) wireless to increase patient comfort and safety, the trend of increased channel count in recent neural probes poses a challenge due to the concomitant increase in the data rate. Extracting information from raw data at the source by using edge computing is a promising solution to this problem, with integrated intention decoders providing the best compression ratio. Recent benchmarking efforts have shown recurrent neural networks to be the best solution. Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) emerge as a promising solution for resource efficient neural decoding while Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks achieve the best accuracy. In this work, we show that combining traditional signal processing techniques, namely signal filtering, with SNNs improve their decoding performance significantly for regression tasks, closing the gap with LSTMs, at little added cost. Results with different filters are shown with Bessel filters providing best performance. Two block-bidirectional Bessel filters have been used--one for low latency and another for high accuracy. Adding the high accuracy variant of the Bessel filters to the output of ANN, SNN and variants provided statistically significant benefits with maximum gains of $\approx 5\%$ and $8\%$ in $R^2$ for two SNN topologies (SNN\_Streaming and SNN\_3D). Our work presents state of the art results for this dataset and paves the way for decoder-integrated-implants of the future.

                arXiv:2505.15823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing technology continues to advance, various sectors, including industry, government, academia, and research, have increasingly focused on its future applications. With the integration of artificial intelligence techniques, multiple Quantum Neural Network (QNN) models have been proposed, including quantum convolutional neural networks, quantum long short-term memory networks, and quantum generative adversarial networks. Furthermore, optimization methods such as constrained optimization by linear approximation and simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation have been explored. Therefore, this study proposes Hybrid Quantum Swarm Intelligence (HQSI), which constructs a QNN model as a forward propagation neural network. After measuring quantum states and obtaining prediction results, a classical computer-based swarm intelligence algorithm is employed for weight optimization. The training process iterates between quantum and classical computing environments. During the experimental phase, the proposed HQSI method is evaluated using an online certificate status protocol request traffic prediction task. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art quantum optimization algorithms demonstrates that the proposed HQSI approach achieves more than a 50% reduction in error.

                arXiv:2505.15832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the network performance using zero-cost (ZC) metrics has proven both its efficiency and efficacy in Neural Architecture Search (NAS). However, a notable limitation of most ZC proxies is their inconsistency, as reflected by the substantial variation in their performance across different problems. Furthermore, the design of existing ZC metrics is manual, involving a time-consuming trial-and-error process that requires substantial domain expertise. These challenges raise two critical questions: (1) Can we automate the design of ZC metrics? and (2) Can we utilize the existing hand-crafted ZC metrics to synthesize a more generalizable one? In this study, we propose a framework based on Symbolic Regression via Genetic Programming to automate the design of ZC metrics. Our framework is not only highly extensible but also capable of quickly producing a ZC metric with a strong positive rank correlation to true network performance across diverse NAS search spaces and tasks. Extensive experiments on 13 problems from NAS-Bench-Suite-Zero demonstrate that our automatically generated proxies consistently outperform hand-crafted alternatives. Using our evolved proxy metric as the search objective in an evolutionary algorithm, we could identify network architectures with competitive performance within 15 minutes using a single consumer GPU.

                arXiv:2505.15833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deployment of deep neural networks in resource-constrained embedded systems requires innovative algorithmic solutions to facilitate their energy and memory efficiency. To further ensure the reliability of these systems against malicious actors, recent works have extensively studied adversarial robustness of existing architectures. Our work focuses on the intersection of adversarial robustness, memory- and energy-efficiency in neural networks. We introduce a neural network conversion algorithm designed to produce sparse and adversarially robust spiking neural networks (SNNs) by leveraging the sparse connectivity and weights from a robustly pretrained artificial neural network (ANN). Our approach combines the energy-efficient architecture of SNNs with a novel conversion algorithm, leading to state-of-the-art performance with enhanced energy and memory efficiency through sparse connectivity and activations. Our models are shown to achieve up to 100x reduction in the number of weights to be stored in memory, with an estimated 8.6x increase in energy efficiency compared to dense SNNs, while maintaining high performance and robustness against adversarial threats.

                arXiv:2505.15836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence continues to drive innovation in complex, decentralized environments, the need for scalable, adaptive, and privacy-preserving decision-making systems has become critical. This paper introduces a novel framework combining quantum-inspired neural networks with evolutionary algorithms to optimize real-time decision-making in multi-agent systems (MAS). The proposed Quantum-Evolutionary Neural Network (QE-NN) leverages quantum computing principles -- such as quantum superposition and entanglement -- to enhance learning speed and decision accuracy, while integrating evolutionary optimization to continually refine agent behaviors in dynamic, uncertain environments. By utilizing federated learning, QE-NN ensures privacy preservation, enabling decentralized agents to collaborate without sharing sensitive data. The framework is designed to allow agents to adapt in real-time to their environments, optimizing decision-making processes for applications in areas such as autonomous systems, smart cities, and healthcare. This research represents a breakthrough in merging quantum computing, evolutionary optimization, and privacy-preserving techniques to solve complex problems in multi-agent decision-making systems, pushing the boundaries of AI in real-world, privacy-sensitive applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15839">Curriculum Learning in Genetic Programming Guided Local Search for Large-scale Vehicle Routing Problems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.15839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manually designing (meta-)heuristics for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a challenging task that requires significant domain expertise. Recently, data-driven approaches have emerged as a promising solution, automatically learning heuristics that perform well on training instances and generalize to unseen test cases. Such an approach learns (meta-)heuristics that can perform well on the training instances, expecting it to generalize well on the unseen test instances. A recent method, named GPGLS, uses Genetic Programming (GP) to learn the utility function in Guided Local Search (GLS) and solved large scale VRP effectively. However, the selection of appropriate training instances during the learning process remains an open question, with most existing studies including GPGLS relying on random instance selection. To address this, we propose a novel method, CL-GPGLS, which integrates Curriculum Learning (CL) into GPGLS. Our approach leverages a predefined curriculum to introduce training instances progressively, starting with simpler tasks and gradually increasing complexity, enabling the model to better adapt and optimize for large-scale VRP (LSVRP). Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of CL-GPGLS, demonstrating significant performance improvements over three baseline methods.

                arXiv:2505.15840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional spiking neural networks (SNNs) can be viewed as a combination of multiple subnetworks with each running for one time step, where the parameters are shared, and the membrane potential serves as the only information link between them. However, the implicit nature of the membrane potential limits its ability to effectively represent temporal information. As a result, each time step cannot fully leverage information from previous time steps, seriously limiting the model's performance. Inspired by the top-down mechanism in the brain, we introduce TDFormer, a novel model with a top-down feedback structure that functions hierarchically and leverages high-order representations from earlier time steps to modulate the processing of low-order information at later stages. The feedback structure plays a role from two perspectives: 1) During forward propagation, our model increases the mutual information across time steps, indicating that richer temporal information is being transmitted and integrated in different time steps. 2) During backward propagation, we theoretically prove that the feedback structure alleviates the problem of vanishing gradients along the time dimension. We find that these mechanisms together significantly and consistently improve the model performance on multiple datasets. In particular, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet with an accuracy of 86.83%.

                arXiv:2505.16127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary optimization algorithms often face defects and limitations that complicate the evolution processes or even prevent them from reaching the global optimum. A notable constraint pertains to the considerable quantity of function evaluations required to achieve the intended solution. This concern assumes heightened significance when addressing costly optimization problems. However, recent research has shown that integrating machine learning methods, specifically surrogate models, with evolutionary optimization can enhance various aspects of these algorithms. Among the evolutionary algorithms, the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES) is particularly favored. This preference is due to its use of Gaussian distribution for calculating evolution and its ability to adapt optimization parameters, which reduces the need for user intervention in adjusting initial parameters. In this research endeavor, we propose the adoption of surrogate models within the CMA-ES framework called CMA-SAO to develop an initial surrogate model that facilitates the adaptation of optimization parameters through the acquisition of pertinent information derived from the associated surrogate model. Empirical validation reveals that CMA-SAO algorithm markedly diminishes the number of function evaluations in comparison to prevailing algorithms, thereby providing a significant enhancement in operational efficiency.

                arXiv:2505.16362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing (NC) introduces a novel algorithmic paradigm representing a major shift from traditional digital computing of Von Neumann architectures. NC emulates or simulates the neural dynamics of brains in the form of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Much of the research in NC has concentrated on machine learning applications and neuroscience simulations. This paper investigates the modelling and implementation of optimization algorithms and particularly metaheuristics using the NC paradigm as an alternative to Von Neumann architectures, leading to breakthroughs in solving optimization problems.
  Neuromorphic-based metaheuristics (Nheuristics) are supposed to be characterized by low power, low latency and small footprint. Since NC systems are fundamentally different from conventional Von Neumann computers, several challenges are posed to the design and implementation of Nheuristics. A guideline based on a classification and critical analysis is conducted on the different families of metaheuristics and optimization problems they address. We also discuss future directions that need to be addressed to expand both the development and application of Nheuristics.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely used for dynamic algorithm configuration, particularly in evolutionary computation, which benefits from the adaptive update of parameters during the algorithmic execution. However, applying DRL to algorithm configuration for multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problems remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents a novel graph neural network (GNN) based DRL to configure multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. We model the dynamic algorithm configuration as a Markov decision process, representing the convergence of solutions in the objective space by a graph, with their embeddings learned by a GNN to enhance the state representation. Experiments on diverse MOCO challenges indicate that our method outperforms traditional and DRL-based algorithm configuration methods in terms of efficacy and adaptability. It also exhibits advantageous generalizability across objective types and problem sizes, and applicability to different evolutionary computation methods.

                arXiv:2505.16482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) that leveraged the advantage of wireless energy transfer technology have opened a promising opportunity in solving the limited energy issue. However, an ineffective charging strategy may reduce the charging performance. Although many practical charging algorithms have been introduced, these studies mainly focus on optimizing the charging path with a fully charging approach. This approach may lead to the death of a series of sensors due to their extended charging latency. This paper introduces a novel partial charging approach that follows a bi-level optimized scheme to minimize energy depletion in WRSNs. We aim at optimizing simultaneously two factors: the charging path and time. To accomplish this, we first formulate a mathematical model of the investigated problem. We then propose two approximate algorithms in which the optimization of the charging path and the charging time are considered as the upper and lower level, respectively. The first algorithm combines a Multi-start Local Search method and a Genetic Algorithm to find a solution. The second algorithm adopts a nested approach that utilizes the advantages of the Multitasking and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategies. Experimental validations on various network scenarios demonstrate that our proposed algorithms outperform the existing works.

                arXiv:2505.16649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm provides a bottom-up alternative to backpropagation (BP) for training neural networks, relying on a layer-wise "goodness" function to guide learning. Existing goodness functions, inspired by energy-based learning (EBL), are typically defined as the sum of squared post-synaptic activations, neglecting the correlations between neurons. In this work, we propose a novel goodness function termed dimensionality compression that uses the effective dimensionality (ED) of fluctuating neural responses to incorporate second-order statistical structure. Our objective minimizes ED for clamped inputs when noise is considered while maximizing it across the sample distribution, promoting structured representations without the need to prepare negative samples. We demonstrate that this formulation achieves competitive performance compared to other non-BP methods. Moreover, we show that noise plays a constructive role that can enhance generalization and improve inference when predictions are derived from the mean of squared outputs, which is equivalent to making predictions based on the energy term. Our findings contribute to the development of more biologically plausible learning algorithms and suggest a natural fit for neuromorphic computing, where stochasticity is a computational resource rather than a nuisance.

Abstract: An established measure of the expressive power of a given ReLU neural network is the number of linear regions into which it partitions the input space. There exist many different, non-equivalent definitions of what a linear region actually is. We systematically assess which papers use which definitions and discuss how they relate to each other. We then analyze the computational complexity of counting the number of such regions for the various definitions. Generally, this turns out to be an intractable problem. We prove NP- and #P-hardness results already for networks with one hidden layer and strong hardness of approximation results for two or more hidden layers. Finally, on the algorithmic side, we demonstrate that counting linear regions can at least be achieved in polynomial space for some common definitions.

                arXiv:2308.14012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time solutions to the influence blocking maximization (IBM) problems are crucial for promptly containing the spread of misinformation. However, achieving this goal is non-trivial, mainly because assessing the blocked influence of an IBM problem solution typically requires plenty of expensive Monte Carlo simulations (MCSs). This work presents a novel approach that enables solving IBM problems with hundreds of thousands of nodes and edges in seconds. The key idea is to construct a fast-to-evaluate surrogate model called neural influence estimator (NIE) offline as a substitute for the time-intensive MCSs, and then combine it with optimization algorithms to address IBM problems online. To this end, a learning problem is formulated to build the NIE that takes the false-and-true information instance as input, extracts features describing the topology and inter-relationship between two seed sets, and predicts the blocked influence. A well-trained NIE can generalize across different IBM problems given a social network, and can be readily combined with existing IBM optimization algorithms. The experiments on 25 IBM problems with up to millions of edges show that the NIE-based optimization method can be up to four orders of magnitude faster than MCSs-based optimization method to achieve the same optimization quality. Moreover, given a one-minute limit, the NIE-based method can solve IBM problems with up to hundreds of thousands of nodes, which is at least one order of magnitude larger than what can be solved by existing methods.

                arXiv:2505.11037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discovering novel 3D molecular structures that simultaneously satisfy multiple property targets remains a central challenge in materials and drug design. Although recent diffusion-based models can generate 3D conformations, they require expensive retraining for each new property or property-combination and lack flexibility in enforcing structural constraints. We introduce EGD (Evolutionary Guidance in Diffusion), a training-free framework that embeds evolutionary operators directly into the diffusion sampling process. By performing crossover on noise-perturbed samples and then denoising them with a pretrained Unconditional diffusion model, EGD seamlessly blends structural fragments and steers generation toward user-specified objectives without any additional model updates. On both single- and multi-target 3D conditional generation tasks-and on multi-objective optimization of quantum properties EGD outperforms state-of-the-art conditional diffusion methods in accuracy and runs up to five times faster per generation. In the single-objective optimization of protein ligands, EGD enables customized ligand generation. Moreover, EGD can embed arbitrary 3D fragments into the generated molecules while optimizing multiple conflicting properties in one unified process. This combination of efficiency, flexibility, and controllable structure makes EGD a powerful tool for rapid, guided exploration of chemical space.

Abstract: Cognitive Computing (COC) aims to build highly cognitive machines with low computational resources that respond in real-time. However, scholarly literature shows varying research areas and various interpretations of COC. This calls for a cohesive architecture that delineates the nature of COC. We argue that if Herbert Simon considered the design science is the science of artificial, cognitive systems are the products of cognitive science or 'the newest science of the artificial'. Therefore, building a conceptual basis for COC is an essential step into prospective cognitive computing-based systems. This paper proposes an architecture of COC through analyzing the literature on COC using a myriad of statistical analysis methods. Then, we compare the statistical analysis results with previous qualitative analysis results to confirm our findings. The study also comprehensively surveys the recent research on COC to identify the state of the art and connect the advances in varied research disciplines in COC. The study found that there are three underlaying computing paradigms, Von-Neuman, Neuromorphic Engineering and Quantum Computing, that comprehensively complement the structure of cognitive computation. The research discuss possible applications and open research directions under the COC umbrella.

Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities of text-to-audio music generation models in producing long-form music with prompts that change over time, focusing on soundtrack generation for Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TRPGs). We introduce Babel Bardo, a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform speech transcriptions into music descriptions for controlling a text-to-music model. Four versions of Babel Bardo were compared in two TRPG campaigns: a baseline using direct speech transcriptions, and three LLM-based versions with varying approaches to music description generation. Evaluations considered audio quality, story alignment, and transition smoothness. Results indicate that detailed music descriptions improve audio quality while maintaining consistency across consecutive descriptions enhances story alignment and transition smoothness.

                Most of the food produced globally is consumed in urban centres, and urban populations rely heavily on purchasing the foods they consume in place of growing, catching, or producing food themselves. Urban populations are thus highly dependent on the types of foods available to them and their relative prices. Rapid urbanization is catalysing changes across the food system and in turn, shaping urban diets. Traditionally viewed as a problem predominantly faced by rural areas, food insecurity and malnutrition (both undernutrition and overweight and obesity) are on the rise in urban areas globally. Likewise, urban environments can foster unsafe food environments, increasing the risk of foodborne illnesses and death. Considering an increasingly urbanized world, this paper describes critical links between food systems and urban health. It identifies housing development, digitalization, labour transitions and dietary transitions as emerging and interrelated trends that are changing the way people access, purchase and consume food in urban areas. This paper proposes potential interventions and tools for holistic, city-led policies and actions that make healthier and safer food more available and affordable for everyone, to inspire and encourage practitioners and policymakers at the city, regional, national and international levels to increase their ambition and act urgently.

                Pain and inflammation are the consequences of sore throat, dental and oral procedures, infections, ulcers and head and neck chemotherapy/radiotherapy, and their management is of fundamental importance to avoid distress in patients. Benzydamine hydrochloride (HCl) is a topical indolic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, endowed with analgesic and anesthetic activity, and with antimicrobial (including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria) and antifungal properties (targeting Candida albicans and non-albicans strains), used in odontostomatology, otorhinolaryngology, and gynecology for its properties. This molecule has a lipophilic nature, showing high affinity with cell membranes and exhibiting membrane stabilization properties, resulting in local anesthesia, an effect related also to the interaction of the drug with cationic channels. Unlike other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, benzydamine HCl is a weak inhibitor of cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase and consequently its primary mechanisms of action are not related to arachidonic acid metabolism and do not affect the biosynthesis of the inflammation mediators prostanoids, prostacyclin, thromboxane and leukotrienes. Benzydamine HCl is able to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, with consequent analgesia. Moreover, benzydamine HCl is able to inhibit leukocyte-endothelial interactions and platelet aggregation. Here we review the most updated clinical data available on benzydamine HCl local application as spray, mouthwash or gargling and evidence of its effectiveness in inflammatory and/or septic conditions in the otorhinolaryngology and odontostomatology settings, with particular reference to sore throat, oral inflammation, dental plaque, tonsillitis/tonsillectomy and chemo- or radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis. Novel formulations for oral and oromucosal/buccal/intraoral administration of benzydamine HCl are also reviewed, including in situ gelling formulations to be sprayed onto the damaged oral mucosa. Finally, novel data on the potential role of benzydamine HCl in nociceptor excitability are introduced.

                Background Schizophrenia (SCZD) is a mental disorder characterized by cognitive dysfunction, impaired decision-making abilities, abnormalities in brain functioning, and specific genetic markers. Ethnic and racial factors influence the development and presentation of schizophrenia, with different groups experiencing different levels of risk and exhibiting different patterns of mental disorders. Objective We sought to investigate the executive function and decision-making profile of Schizophrenia participants from Barranquilla, Colombia, which have a high genetic mixture and significant ethnic and racial diversity. Methods The sample consists of 40 individuals, 20 diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and 20 controls. We use the BANFE neuropsychological battery and the Iowa Gambling task to measure executive function and decision-making processes. Results The study found differences in cognitive performance, measured by the Neuropsychological Battery of Executive Functions and Frontal Lobes, in the medial orbit, anterior prefrontal, dorsolateral, and total executive function measures. In decision-making, as measured by the Iowa Gambling Test, there were also differences between the two groups, with those with schizophrenia performing worse and showing a preference for disadvantageous options. The study also found that there were no significant differences in socio-demographic characteristics between the two groups but that there were differences in terms of socio-economic status and educational level. Conclusion This study found that individuals with paranoid schizophrenia had significant differences in their prefrontal cortex compared to those without the condition, specifically in the dorsolateral and orbital-prefrontal cortex. These differences may be linked to difficulties adjusting to their environment and processing reinforcement, leading to impaired learning and arousal disturbances.

                Background Hitherto, BDNF levels in humans have been primarily measured in serum and/or plasma where these levels are readily measurable, but primarily reflect the content of BDNF in blood platelets. By contrast, previous attempts to measure BDNF levels in readily accessible human body fluids such as saliva have been complicated by a lack of sensitivity and/or specificity of BDNF ELISAs (see Discussion). Recently, the suitability of a highly sensitive BDNF ELISA assay was validated using mouse plasma and serum where conventional BDNF ELISA fail to detect BDNF. In this report, we demonstrate that BDNF levels in human saliva are extremely low, in the low pg/mL range, yet detectable in all saliva samples tested. Methods Saliva samples were collected from healthy volunteers by a passive drool method. All samples were aliquoted and immediately frozen to keep at -80°C until use. At the time of use, the samples were thawed, centrifuged to remove any remaining particles and BDNF measurement conducted by using a previously validated BDNF ELISA assay (see below). Recombinant mature BDNF was used as a reference. Results The intra-assay variability was in the range of CV = 1.8 to 4.9%. Saliva samples could be kept frozen at -80°C for 2 months until use for measurements, but more than 4 freeze and thaw cycles caused BDNF losses presumably due to structural change of the antigen. The measurements were not affected by the method of collection provided the samples were diluted at least 2-fold. Conclusions The results indicate that human saliva samples collected in a non-invasive fashion can be used as a source of material to try and correlate BDNF levels with human conditions of interest. These results also confirm those of an independent study published recently using the same BDNF ELISA kit to measure BDNF levels in human saliva samples.

Under <i>in vivo</i> conditions, CA1 pyramidal cells from the hippocampus display transitions from single spikes to bursts. It is believed that subthreshold hyperpolarization and depolarization, also known as down and up-states, play a pivotal role in these transitions. Nevertheless, a central impediment to correlating suprathreshold (spiking) and subthreshold activity has been the technical difficulties of this type of recordings, even with widely used calcium imaging or multielectrode recordings. Recent work using voltage imaging with genetically encoded voltage indicators has been able to correlate spiking patterns with subthreshold activity in a variety of CA1 neurons, and recent computational models have been able to capture these transitions. In this work, we used a computational model of a CA1 pyramidal cell to investigate the role of intrinsic conductances and oscillatory patterns in generating down and up-states and their modulation in the transition from single spiking to bursting. Specifically, the emergence of distinct spiking resonances between these two spiking modes that share the same voltage traces in the presence of theta or gamma oscillatory inputs, a phenomenon we call interleaved single and bursting spiking resonance. We noticed that these resonances do not necessarily overlap in frequency or amplitude, underscoring their relevance for providing flexibility to neural processing. We studied the conductance values of three current types that are thought to be critical for the bursting behavior: persistent sodium current (<i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub>) and its conductance <i>G</i><sub>NaP</sub>, delayed rectifier potassium (<i>I</i><sub>KDR</sub>) and its conductance <i>G</i><sub>KDR</sub>, and hyperpolarization-activated current (<i>I</i><sub>h</sub>) and its conductance <i>G</i><sub>h</sub>. We conclude that the intricate interplay of ionic currents significantly influences the neuronal firing patterns, transitioning from single to burst firing during sustained depolarization. Specifically, the intermediate levels of <i>G</i><sub>NaP</sub> and <i>G</i><sub>KDR</sub> facilitate spiking resonance at gamma frequency inputs. The resonance characteristics vary between single and burst firing modes, each displaying distinct amplitudes and resonant frequencies. Furthermore, low <i>G</i><sub>NaP</sub> and high <i>G</i><sub>KDR</sub> values lock bursting to theta frequencies, while high <i>G</i><sub>NaP</sub> and low <i>G</i><sub>KDR</sub> values lock single spiking to gamma frequencies. Lastly, the duration of quiet intervals plays a crucial role in determining the likelihood of transitioning to either bursting or single spiking modes. We confirmed that the same features were present in previously recorded in vivo voltage-imaging data. Understanding these dynamics provides valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying neuronal excitability under <i>in vivo</i> conditions.

Bayesian accounts of perception, such as predictive processing, suggest that perceptions integrate expectations and sensory experience, and thus assimilate to expected values. Furthermore, more precise expectations should have stronger influences on perception. We tested these hypotheses using a within-subject paradigm that independently manipulated the mean, variance (precision), and skewness of cues presented as ratings from 10 prior participants. Forty-five participants reported their expectations regarding the painfulness of thermal stimuli or the visual contrast of flickering checkerboards. In a second session, similar (sham) cues were each followed by either a noxious thermal or a visual stimulus. Perceptions assimilated to cue-based expectations in both modalities, but precision effects were modality-specific: more precise cues enhanced assimilation in visual perception only, while higher uncertainty slightly increased reported pain. fMRI analysis revealed that the cues affected higher-level affective and cognitive systems–including assimilation to the cue mean in a neuromarker of endogenous pain processing and in the nucleus accumbens, and activity consistent with aversive prediction-error-like encoding in the periaqueductal gray during pain perception–but not early perceptual processing systems. Furthermore, behavioral and computational models of the expectation session revealed that expectations were biased towards extreme values in both modalities, and towards low-pain cues specifically. These findings suggest that predictive processing theories should be extended with mechanisms such as selective attention to outliers, and that expectation generation and its perceptual effects are mostly modality-specific and primarily influence higher-level processes rather than early perception, at least when cues are not reinforced.

Fungi can cause devastating invasive infections, typically in immunocompromised patients. Treatment is complicated both by the evolutionary similarity between humans and fungi and by the frequent emergence of drug resistance. Studies in fungal pathogens have long been slowed by a lack of high-throughput tools and community resources that are common in model organisms. Here we demonstrate a high-throughput transposon mutagenesis and sequencing (TN-seq) system in <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> that enables genome-wide determination of gene essentiality. We employed a random forest machine learning approach to classify the <i>C. neoformans</i> genome as essential or nonessential, predicting 1,465 essential genes, including 302 that lack human orthologs. These genes are ideal targets for new antifungal drug development. TN-seq also enables genome-wide measurement of the fitness contribution of genes to phenotypes of interest. As proof of principle, we demonstrate the genome-wide contribution of genes to growth in fluconazole, a clinically used antifungal. We show a novel role for the well-studied <i>RIM101</i> pathway in fluconazole susceptibility. We also show that insertions of transposons into the 5′ upstream region can drive sensitization of essential genes, enabling screenlike assays of both essential and nonessential components of the genome. Using this approach, we demonstrate a role for mitochondrial function in fluconazole sensitivity, such that tuning down many essential mitochondrial genes via 5′ insertions can drive resistance to fluconazole. Our assay system will be valuable in future studies of <i>C. neoformans</i>, particularly in examining the consequences of genotypic diversity.

     alt="Resting-State Brain Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations: A Comparative Study Across Different Frequency Bands in Student Pilots"/>
<p>In our study, we selected pilot trainees as subjects and utilized resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to analyze the impact of flight training on their brains. After examining the correlations between classical and sub-band brain regions and behavioral tests, we discovered that flight training induced changes in the superior frontal gyrus, posterior central gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and middle occipital gyrus of the pilot trainees' brains.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In this study, we aimed to investigate changes in the mean amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (mALFF) in different frequency bands in flight trainees using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) technology to explore the impact of flight training on brain functional changes. The study included 39 flight trainees and 37 well-matched healthy controls. MATLAB software was used to perform two-sample <i>t</i>-tests on the mALFF values of the subjects in different frequency bands to identify intergroup differences. SPSS software was used to perform correlation analysis between the different brain areas and the results of the Berg Card Sorting Test (BCST). The results revealed significant differences in mALFF values in multiple brain areas, including the left medial superior frontal gyrus and the left postcentral gyrus, between the two groups. Sub-bands revealed more differential brain areas compared to the classical band, and these differential brain areas were significantly correlated with the total accuracy of the BCST. Under resting conditions, flight trainees who underwent flight training showed significant differences from the control group in brain regions related to cognitive executive control, somatosensory function, memory function, and other functions. This may be related to the learning of critical flight skills, such as emergency operations, maneuvering the aircraft for takeoff, landing, and re-flight during executive flight training. Meanwhile, the sub-band is more sensitive to information about brain functional activities than the classical band, which provides a new perspective for further exploring the changes in pilot brain functional mechanisms in the future.</p>

                Shen et al. identify GADD45G as an astrocytic sensor of diverse pathological stimuli and show that it drives reactive gliosis, neuroinflammation, and synapse loss through cell-autonomous and -nonautonomous mechanisms. Conversely, GADD45G inhibition mitigates histological and behavioral pathology in an Alzheimer’s disease model, highlighting it as a potential therapeutic target.

                Htet et al. used single-molecule and biochemical measurements to elucidate how the Rpn11 deubiquitinase subunit of the 26S proteasome functions as an allosteric sensor for ubiquitin chains. Ubiquitin binding to Rpn11 slows the spontaneous conformational transitions of the proteasome, aids substrate engagement by the ATPase motor, and thereby accelerates degradation.

USP37 protects cells during DNA replication stress by counteracting two replisome-coupled ubiquitin ligases. USP37 counteracts CUL2LRR1 during DNA synthesis defects and opposes TRAIP in response to topological stress.

What is the consequence of this microglial response on white matter pathology in aging? Groh et al. show that a maladaptive white matter-associated microglia state that emerges in aging recruits peripheral T cells to the CNS, which leads to degeneration of myelinated axons and loss of function.

                <p>Nature Physics, Published online: 22 May 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-025-02886-w">doi:10.1038/s41567-025-02886-w</a></p>Photon interactions in materials typically create a gaseous bosonic state, which is prone to turbulent behaviour that disrupts coherence. But it is now shown that, using fast-gain processes in a modulated semiconductor laser, light can be stabilized in a liquid-like state, enhancing the coherence of its flow.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98520">Food-washing monkeys recognize the law of diminishing returns</a></h4>

              
                Few animals have the cognitive faculties or prehensile abilities needed to eliminate tooth-damaging grit from food surfaces. Some populations of monkeys wash sand from foods when standing water is readily accessible, but this propensity varies within groups for reasons unknown. Spontaneous food-washing emerged recently in a group of long-tailed macaques (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>) inhabiting Koram Island, Thailand, and it motivated us to explore the factors that drive individual variability. We measured the mineral and physical properties of contaminant sands and conducted a field experiment, eliciting 1282 food-handling bouts by 42 monkeys. Our results verify two long-standing presumptions: monkeys have a strong aversion to sand and removing it is intentional. Reinforcing this result, we found that monkeys clean foods beyond the point of diminishing returns, a suboptimal behavior that varied with social rank. Dominant monkeys abstained from washing, a choice consistent with the impulses of dominant monkeys elsewhere: to prioritize rapid food intake and greater reproductive fitness over the long-term benefits of prolonging tooth function.

                Subcortical brain structures such as the subthalamic nucleus or the thalamus are involved in regulating motor and cognitive behavior. However, their contribution to perceptual consciousness remains unclear, due to the inherent difficulties of recording subcortical neuronal activity in humans. Here, we asked neurological patients undergoing surgery for deep brain stimulation to detect weak vibrotactile stimuli applied on their hand while recording single neuron activity from the tip of a microelectrode. We isolated putative single neurons in the subthalamic nucleus and thalamus. A significant proportion of neurons modulated their activity while participants were expecting a stimulus. We found that the firing rate of 23% of these neurons differed between detected and undetected stimuli. Our results provide direct neurophysiological evidence of the involvement of the subthalamic nucleus and the thalamus for the detection of vibrotactile stimuli, thereby calling for a less cortico-centric view of the neural correlates of consciousness.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104268">Wag31, a membrane tether, is crucial for lipid homeostasis in mycobacteria</a></h4>

              
                The mycobacterial cytoskeletal protein Wag31 is necessary for maintaining cell shape and directing cellular growth and elongation. Wag31 has a characteristic N-terminal DivIVA-domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. While the role of Wag31 in polar elongation is known, there is limited mechanistic insight on how it orchestrates growth and elongation. In this report, we delineate roles of the N- and C-terminal domains of Wag31 using genetics, state-of-the-art multi-omics, biochemical, and imaging approaches. We show that Wag31 predominantly interacts with several membrane-associated proteins involved in lipid metabolism, cell wall synthesis, and division. Native levels of Wag31 are critical for the maintenance and distribution of membrane lipids. Both depletion and overexpression of Wag31 perturb lipid homeostasis, leading to the formation of intracellular lipid inclusions (ILIs). Protein–lipid crosslinking and imaging studies reveal that purified Wag31 can bind and effectively tether cardiolipin (CL)-containing liposomes. We further show that the tethering activity lies in the DivIVA-domain containing N-terminal of Wag31 while the C-terminal mediates protein–protein interactions of Wag31. Despite retaining its ability to interact with partner proteins, the DivIVA-domain-deleted Wag31 mutant shows defects in liposome tethering in vitro and non-polar localization of CL in vivo, which eventually causes lethality. Our study suggests that membrane tethering ‘licenses’ Wag31 to form scaffolds that help orchestrate protein–lipid and protein–protein interactions necessary for mycobacterial growth and survival.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104934">A comprehensive antigen-antibody complex database unlocking insights into interaction interface</a></h4>

              
                Antibodies are critical components of the vertebrate immune system and possess a wide array of biomedical applications. Elucidating the complex interactions between antibodies and antigens is an important step in drug development. However, the complex and vast nature of the data presents significant challenges in accurately identifying and comprehending these interactions. To overcome these challenges and deepen our understanding of the antibody-antigen interface, we developed the Antigen-Antibody Complex Database (AACDB). The current version provides a comprehensive collection of 7498 manually processed antigen-antibody complexes, ensuring accuracy and detail. This database provides extensive metadata and rectifies annotation errors found in the PDB database. Furthermore, it integrates data on antibody developability and antigen-drug target relationships, making it valuable for assisting new antibody therapies development. Notably, the database includes comprehensive paratope and epitope annotation information, thereby serving as a valuable benchmark for immunoinformatics research. The AACDB interface is designed to be user-friendly, providing researchers with powerful search and visualization tools that enable effortless querying, manipulation, and visualization of complex data. Researchers can access AACDB completely online at <a href="http://i.uestc.edu.cn/AACDB">http://i.uestc.edu.cn/AACDB</a>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98462">T-follicular helper cell profiles differ by malaria antigen and for children compared to adults</a></h4>

              
                Circulating T-follicular helper (cT<sub>FH</sub>) cells have the potential to provide an additional correlate of protection against <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (<i>Pf</i>) as they are essential to promote B-cell production of long-lasting antibodies. Assessing the specificity of cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets to individual malaria antigens is vital to understanding the variation observed in antibody responses and identifying promising malaria vaccine candidates. Using spectral flow cytometry and unbiased clustering analysis, we assessed antigen-specific cT<sub>FH</sub> cell recall responses in vitro to malaria vaccine candidates <i>Pf-</i>schizont egress antigen-1 (<i>Pf</i>SEA-1A) and <i>Pf</i>-glutamic acid-rich protein (<i>Pf</i>GARP) within a cross-section of children and adults living in a malaria-holoendemic region of western Kenya. In children, a broad array of cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets (defined by cytokine and transcription factor expression) were reactive to both malaria antigens, <i>Pf</i>SEA-1A and <i>Pf</i>GARP, while adults had a narrow profile centering on cT<sub>FH</sub>17- and cT<sub>FH</sub>1/17-like subsets following stimulation with <i>Pf</i>GARP only. Because T<sub>FH</sub>17 cells are involved in the maintenance of memory antibody responses within the context of parasitic infections, our results suggest that <i>Pf</i>GARP might generate longer-lived antibody responses compared to <i>Pf</i>SEA-1A. These findings have intriguing implications for evaluating malaria vaccine candidates as they highlight the importance of including cT<sub>FH</sub> profiles when assessing interdependent correlates of protective immunity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101714">Periosteal skeletal stem cells can migrate into the bone marrow and support hematopoiesis after injury</a></h4>

              
                Skeletal stem cells (SSCs) have been isolated from various tissues, including periosteum and bone marrow, where they exhibit key functions in bone biology and hematopoiesis, respectively. The role of periosteal SSCs (P-SSCs) in bone regeneration and healing has been extensively studied, but their ability to contribute to the bone marrow stroma is still under debate. In the present study, we characterized a mouse whole bone transplantation model that mimics the initial bone marrow necrosis and fatty infiltration seen after injury. Using this model and a lineage tracing approach, we observed the migration of P-SSCs into the bone marrow after transplantation. Once in the bone marrow, P-SSCs are phenotypically and functionally reprogrammed into bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) that express high levels of hematopoietic stem cell niche factors such as Cxcl12 and Kitl. In addition, using ex vivo and in vivo approaches, we found that P-SSCs are more resistant to acute stress than BM-MSCs. These results highlight the plasticity of P-SSCs and their potential role in bone marrow regeneration after bone marrow injury.

">Meta-analytic evidence for distinct neural correlates of conditioned vs. verbally induced placebo analgesia</a></h4>

              
                Placebo analgesia demonstrates that belief and expectation can significantly alter pain, even without active treatment. Placebo analgesia can be induced through verbal suggestion, classical conditioning, or their combination, though the role of conditioned neural responses above and beyond effects of verbal instructions remains unclear. We conducted a systematic meta-analysis of individual participant data from 16 within-participant placebo neuroimaging studies (n = 409), employing univariate and multivariate analyses to identify shared and distinct mechanisms of placebo analgesia induced by suggestions alone versus suggestions combined with conditioning. Both techniques increased activity during pain in the dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior parietal cortices and decreased activation in the insula, putamen, and primary sensory areas. Adding conditioning enhanced engagement of regions associated with context representation and pain modulation (e.g., dorsolateral/dorsomedial prefrontal cortices) and decreases in nociceptive regions (e.g., primary sensory and insular areas). Conditioning also strengthened the association between analgesia and nociceptive activity, as reflected in the Neurologic Pain Signature. Combining conditioning with instructions yielded greater analgesia, mediated by increased ventromedial prefrontal and dorsal caudate activity, alongside decreased sensory-nociceptive and cerebellar activity. These findings suggest the two strategies rely on partially distinct mechanisms, which could be combined to optimize placebo analgesia's clinical application.

">Mechanisms of Output Gating for visual working memory</a></h4>

              
                Working memory tasks often require comparing remembered visual arrays to test displays, yet little is known about how people edit the contents of working memory at test. Across three experiments, we used contralateral delay activity (CDA) as a neural index of working memory load to examine how memory representations are selectively accessed at test. In Experiment 1, when a single test item was probed, CDA amplitudes increased with larger set sizes, indicating that untested items were still actively maintained, suggesting minimal editing based on spatial location. To test whether this was due to spatial grouping, Experiment 2 presented memory items sequentially in different temporal frames but identical spatial locations. The continued maintenance of all items at test suggested that simple spatial grouping could not explain the lack of editing effect seen in Experiment 1. In Experiment 3, however, when items belonged to distinct mnemonic categories, CDA amplitudes at test were reduced, consistent with selective editing based on category relevance. These findings suggest that working memory editing during retrieval is guided by categorical structure rather than spatial position. Supporting this, analysis of the P3 old-new effect revealed that decision speed and strength were influenced by the number of items maintained at test. Together, our results show that while people do not edit their working memory load based on spatial cues, they edit their working memory based on categorical relevance, allowing for more efficient retrieval of task-relevant information.

">The Modulation of the Blood-Brain Barrier by Focused Ultrasound Stimulates Oligodendrogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Objective: The current study aims to fill a gap in knowledge on the effects of focused ultrasound (FUS)-mediated blood-brain-barrier (BBB) modulation on the proliferation and development of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Researchers established that FUS combined with intravenous microbubbles can modulate BBB in a controlled, reversible, localized, and non-invasive manner to facilitate the delivery of intravenous therapeutics to the brain. Over a decade ago, we discovered that, even without intravenous therapeutics, FUS-BBB modulation stimulates elements of brain repair, including hippocampal neurogenesis. Methods: In adult mice, FUS-BBB modulation was targeted unilaterally to the hippocampus and proliferation of OPCs was quantified at 1, 4, 7, and 10 days post-FUS. Mature oligodendrocytes were quantified at 30 days post-FUS. OPC proliferation was assessed at 7 days post-FUS, and mature oligodendrocytes at 30 days. Results: The proliferation of hippocampal OPCs was increased by 6.8-fold and 2.3-fold between 1 and 4 days post-sonication, respectively, resulting in a 5.3-fold increase in mature oligodendrocytes one month later. To test the robustness of oligodendrogenesis following FUS-BBB modulation, the striatum was targeted as a second brain regions with an independent experimental design. In line with hippocampal results, striatal FUS-BBB modulation promoted the generation of OPCs by 3.9-fold during the first week, leading to a 5.2-fold increase in oligodendrogenesis 30 days post-treatment. Interpretation: We conclude that FUS-BBB modulation in the hippocampus and striatum promotes oligodendrogenesis by stimulating the proliferation of OPCs and being permissive to their maturation.

                Music is widely recognised as being able to evoke images in the mind's eye. However, the neural basis of visual imagery experiences during music listening remains poorly understood. Here, we combined probe-caught experience sampling methodology with 32-channel electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in order to investigate the neuro-oscillatory correlates of music-evoked visual imagery and examine how spontaneously generated imagery compares to more deliberately generated forms. Thirty participants listened with closed eyes to four blocks of music, differing in their familiarity and relaxation potential and spanning a range of genres. In response to probes sent throughout listening, participants indicated whether or not they had been experiencing visual imagery and, if they had, whether the experienced visual imagery had been spontaneous or deliberate. Cluster permutation analyses on the time-frequency decomposed EEG data revealed alpha power suppression during visual imagery that was more reliable during spontaneous than deliberate imagery. Further, while theta and delta bands did not discriminate the presence or absence of the visual imagery experience or its intentionality subtypes, we observed that gamma power suppression in fronto-central areas was present during visual imagery experiences. Our results extend prior findings of a role of posterior alpha suppression in visual imagery to show its reliability in music-evoked spontaneous imagery specifically. We consider plausible interpretations of the presence and absence of other oscillatory signatures in relation to the listening conditions used in the current study.

">Enhanced anti-nociception by novel dual antagonists for 5HT2aR and mGluR5 in preclinical models of pain</a></h4>

              
                Significant research has focused on developing anti-nociceptive pain treatments by targeting specific molecular candidates. The serotonin 2a receptor (5-HT2aR) and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) are recognized as key mediators in neuropathic pain. However, the combined effects of simultaneous inhibition of these targets remain unexplored. This current study investigated the therapeutic potential of concurrently antagonizing 5-HT2aR and mGluR5. Using spinal nerve ligation (SNL) and formalin-induced pain models in male Sprague-Dawley rats, we demonstrated that the simultaneous administration of both antagonists significantly enhanced anti-allodynic and anti-nociceptive effects, resulting in increased allodynia thresholds and reduced pain-related behaviors. This dual antagonism provided pain relief comparable to that of gabapentin and morphine. Furthermore, novel small molecules designed to simultaneously antagonize 5-HT2aR and mGluR5 exerted anti-nociceptive effects by suppressing excitatory postsynaptic responses and inhibiting the phosphorylation of ERK and AKT signaling molecules. Notably, the dual antagonist maintained anti-allodynic efficacy with repeated administration, unlike morphine, which exhibited clear tolerance development with daily use. Moreover, when administered intravenously, the dual antagonist demonstrated a low potential for abuse. These findings indicate that the simultaneous antagonism of 5-HT2aR and mGluR5 represents a promising pharmacological target for the management of chronic pain. This approach may offer enhanced analgesic outcomes while reducing the risk of undesirable side effects, such as tolerance and the potential for abuse.

">Brain State Convergence and Divergence as Resting State FMRI Biomarkers: A Large-Scale Study of Continuous, Overlapping, Time-resolved States Differentiates Four Psychiatric Disorders</a></h4>

              
                Identifying biomarkers- objective, quantifiable biologically-based measures to complement traditional clinical assessments- is critical for studying the links between brain and disorders. Recent advances in neuroimaging have shifted biomarker discovery from traditional univariate brain mapping techniques, which analyze individual brain regions separately, to multivariate predictive models that consider complex patterns across multiple regions, with dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) emerging as a key approach offering a dynamic view of the temporal coupling between different brain networks. Here, we introduce an innovative approach to estimate dynamic double functional independent primitives (ddFIP) by first applying a spatially constrained independent component analysis (ICA) to derive intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs), followed by a second ICA applied to dFNC matrices. This procedure provides a set of states that reflect dynamic connectivity patterns. To characterize these states, we propose several dynamic measures: (1) amplitude convergence, which quantifies the extent to which multiple states contribute similarly to the connectivity profile at a given time (indicating more uniform state contributions); (2) amplitude divergence, quantifying the tendency for states to contribute at varying levels which does not assume dominance but rather reflects a spread of amplitudes across states; as well as (3) dynamic state density which shows the number of strongly occupied states, reflecting the brains preference for spending time in a smaller or larger set of dominant states. We apply this approach to uncover ddFIP-based biomarkers from seven resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) clinical datasets, which include four neuropsychiatric disorders- schizophrenia (SCZ), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and bipolar disorder (BPD)- comprising a total of 5,805 participants. Our results revealed disorder-specific patterns in dynamic connectivity measures. SCZ exhibited widespread disruptions with high variability and increased divergence, suggesting a tendency for states to contribute at varying levels rather than uniformly. ASD, in contrast, showed significantly reduced divergence and increased convergence, indicating more uniform contributions across states and atypical stability in dynamic connectivity. BPD demonstrated heightened variability, particularly in mood regulation networks, while MDD displayed moderate disruptions, especially in self-referential processing networks. Notably, ASDs increased state convergence reflects a pattern where state weights are more similar, was sharply distinct from SCZs increased divergence, as indicated by state occupancy measures. In sum, our findings highlight the potential of continuous dFNC as a FNC-based biomarker to capture disorder-specific connectivity signatures. Moreover, by analyzing both the convergence and divergence of dynamic states, we capture a detailed view of connectivity, reflecting the brains adaptability and resilience within each disorder.

                Background Tuberculosis remains a significant global public health concern. Genetic variants influence the distribution of vitamin D in circulation, leading to vitamin D deficiency. The two extensively studied non-synonymous D-binding protein nucleotide polymorphisms rs7041 and rs4588 were found in different populations. These polymorphisms result into three different genotypes, Gc1F (rs7041(A)- rs4588(G)), Gc1S (rs7041(C)- rs4588(G)) and Gc2 (rs7041(A)- rs4588(T)). These genotypes have configurational changes that differ and therefore cause variation in the binding affinity of the vitamin D metabolite. This study aimed to compare the frequency distribution of vitamin D binding protein gene polymorphisms in patients with active Ugandan tuberculosis, individuals with latent tuberculosis infection, and those with no tuberculosis infection. Methods This pilot studyselected 102 samples, including 52 active tuberculosis patients, 23 latent tuberculosis individuals, and 27 individuals without tuberculosis infection, from a previous cross-sectional study. Vitamin D binding protein rs7041 and rs4588 SNPs were genotyped using Polymerase Chain Reaction and Sanger sequencing. Vitamin D binding protein gene polymorphisms were identified using BioEdit software. 7.2 (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html) Results This study revealed no significant differences in DBP genetic polymorphisms among the study groups. The frequency distribution of the DBP gene has been reported to be 97% Gc1F, 2% Gc2, and 1% Gc1S. The frequency distribution among patients with TB was 96.2% for Gc1F, 0% for Gc1F, and 3.8% for Gc2. Among the LTBI cases, 95.7% were Gc1F, 4.3% were Gc1S, and 0%were Gc2. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium analysis was in equilibrium, D’= 0. P=0.2 Conclusions The Gc1F genotype was predominantly found in the study population, with no difference in the frequency distribution according to TB status.

                <p>All available antiseizure medications aim at symptomatic control of epilepsy, but there is no strategy to stop the development of the disease. The main reason is the lack of understanding of the epileptogenic mechanisms. Closing this knowledge gap is an essential prerequisite for developing disease-modifying therapies that can prevent the onset of epilepsy. Using primary cocultures of hippocampal neurons and glial cells derived from rat pups of either sex, we show that epileptiform paroxysmal depolarization shifts (PDS) induce neuronal glucose hypometabolism which is compensated for by increased glutaminolysis. Glutaminolysis not only provides sufficient ATP to support electrical activity but also leads to decreased vesicular glutamate release, thereby promoting neuronal hypersynchrony. Moreover, prolonged promotion of PDS increased neuronal arborization and synaptic density, which in combination with spontaneous recovery of neuronal glucose metabolism led to seizure-like discharge activity. Since inhibition of glutaminolysis did not prevent the PDS-induced morphogenesis but eliminated seizure-like activity, we propose that glutaminolysis is a causative process linking neuronal metabolism with electrical activity thereby driving epileptogenesis.</p>

                <p>Intracortical circuits, including long-range callosal projections, are crucial for information processing. The development of neuronal connectivity in the cerebral cortex is contingent on ordered emergence of neuronal classes followed by the formation of class-specific axon projections. However, the genetic determinants of intracortical axon targeting are still unclear. We find that the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2-c (Mef2c) directs the development of somatosensory cortical (S1) Layer 4 and 5 identity in murine postmitotic pyramidal neurons during embryogenesis. During postnatal development, <I>Mef2c</I> expression shifts to Layer 2/3 callosal projection neurons (L2/3 CPNs). At this later developmental stage, we identify a novel function for <I>Mef2c</I> in contralateral homotopic domain targeting by S1-L2/3 CPN axons. We employ functional manipulation of EphrinA&ndash;EphA signaling in <I>Mef2c</I> mutant CPNs and demonstrate that Mef2c represses <I>EphA</I>6 to desensitize S1-L2/3 CPN axons to EphrinA5 repulsion at their contralateral targets.

                <p>The cerebellar vermis plays an essential role in maintaining posture and balance by integrating sensory inputs from multiple modalities to effectively coordinate movement. By transforming convergent sensory information into precise motor commands, it ensures smooth, adaptive motor control, enabling the body to maintain stability in dynamic environments. This review examines recent findings that investigate the distinct neural computations performed by the anterior vermis and posterior vermis (nodulus/uvula). Specifically, we examine how Purkinje cells in these regions integrate vestibular and proprioceptive signals to convert self-motion information from a head-centered to a body-centered reference frame, which is essential for maintaining precise postural control in response to unexpected movements. Additionally, we consider recent findings showing that, during voluntary self-motion, Purkinje cells in the anterior vermis selectively suppress responses in the vestibulospinal pathway by integrating motor inputs with sensory signals. Given the anterior vermis's role in maintaining balance during voluntary behaviors such as locomotion, its suppression prevents counterproductive stabilizing reflexes, enabling goal-directed movement through space. In contrast, the posterior vermis, encompassing the nodulus and uvula, integrates vestibular inputs from both the otoliths and semicircular canals to maintain equilibrium relative to gravitational forces. We thus hypothesize that Purkinje cells in the nodulus/uvula do not generate suppression signals like those observed in the anterior vermis but instead continuously compute our orientation in space, regardless of whether movement is voluntarily generated or unexpected. If our hypothesis is correct, the nodulus/uvula would effectively provide consistent "ground truth" information about self-motion relative to gravity.</p>

                <p>Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are impaired at incremental reward-based learning. It is typically assumed that this impairment reflects a loss of striatal dopamine. However, many open questions remain about the nature of reward-based learning deficits in PD. Recent studies have found that even simple reward-based learning tasks rely on a combination of cognitive and computational strategies, including one-shot episodic memory. These findings raise questions about how incremental learning and episodic memory contribute to decision-making in PD. We tested healthy participants (<I>n</I> = 26; 14 males and 12 females) and patients with PD (<I>n</I> = 26; 16 males and 10 females), both on- and off-dopamine replacement medication, on a task designed to differentiate between the contributions of incremental learning and episodic memory to reward-based learning and decision-making. We found that PD patients performed equally well as healthy controls when using episodic memory but were impaired at incremental reward-based learning. Dopamine replacement medication remediated this deficit and enhanced subsequent episodic memory for the value of motivationally relevant stimuli. These results demonstrate that while PD patients are impaired at learning about reward from trial-and-error, their ability to encode memories for the value of one-shot experiences is intact.</p>

                <p>Sleep spindles, transient bursts of rhythmic activity during non-rapid eye movement sleep, are generated by the thalamocortical network through an intricate interplay between the thalamus and the cortex. Emerging research has shed light on the role of sleep spindles in cognitive function, memory consolidation, and overall brain health. Using a behavioral genetics approach in female and male adolescent humans, this study examined the degree to which sleep spindles (measured via high-density sleep electroencephalography) and thalamic volume (measured via magnetic resonance imaging) are driven by common genetic and environmental factors. Here we show a strong correlation between thalamic volume and sleep spindle amplitude and density. Bayesian structural equation modeling estimated that over posterior regions, genetic factors accounted for approximately half of the covariance between sleep spindle activity and thalamic volume. Our findings demonstrate that genetic factors play a role in shaping the structural and functional integrity of the thalamocortical network, with implications for understanding how these processes contribute to neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p>

                <p>Serotonin critically modulates the activity of many brain networks, including circuits that control motivation and responses to rewarding and aversive stimuli. Furthermore, the serotonin system is targeted by first-line pharmacological treatments for several psychiatric disorders, including obsessive&ndash;compulsive disorder. However, understanding the behavioral function of serotonin is hampered by methodological limitations: the (brainstem) location of serotonergic neuron cell-bodies is difficult to access, their innervation of the brain is diffuse, and they release serotonin in relatively low concentrations. Here, we advance this effort by developing novel Tph2-Cre rats, which we utilized to study serotonin in the context of motor, compulsive, and reinforced behaviors using optogenetics in both male and female rats. Specificity and sensitivity of Cre recombinase expression and Cre-dependent processes were validated immunohistochemically, and optogenetic induction of in vivo serotonin release was validated with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. Optogenetic stimulation of serotonin neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus did not initiate locomotion or alter aversion-induced locomotion, nor did it elicit (real-time) place preference, and it had no measurable effect on compulsive behavior in the schedule-induced polydipsia task. In contrast, this optogenetic stimulation moderately sustained ongoing spontaneous locomotion and robustly reinforced operant lever pressing for self-stimulation of serotonin neurons, which was exacerbated by food restriction. Together, this work both introduces a novel rat Cre line to study serotonin and advances our understanding of serotonin's behavioral functions. Complementing previous findings, we find that brainwide serotonin release has an overall relatively mild effect on behavior, which manifested only in the absence of natural reinforcers and was modulated by physiological state.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/21/e1504242025?rss=1">Macroscale Traveling Waves Evoked by Single-Pulse Stimulation of the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural signal propagation is fundamental to unraveling the complexities of brain function. Emerging evidence suggests that corticocortical-evoked potentials (CCEPs) resulting from single-pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) may be used to characterize the patterns of information flow between and within brain networks. At present, the basic spatiotemporal dynamics of CCEP propagation cortically and subcortically are incompletely understood. We hypothesized that SPES evokes neural traveling waves detectable in the three-dimensional space sampled by intracranial stereoelectroencephalography. Across a cohort of 21 adult males and females with intractable epilepsy, we delivered 17,631 stimulation pulses and recorded CCEP responses in 1,019 electrode contacts. The distance between each pair of electrode contacts was approximated using three different metrics (Euclidean distance, path length, and geodesic distance), representing direct, tractographic, and transcortical propagation, respectively. For each robust CCEP, we extracted amplitude-, spectral-, and phase-based features to identify traveling waves emanating from the site of stimulation. Many evoked responses to stimulation appear to propagate as traveling waves (~14&ndash;28%, ~5&ndash;19% with false discovery rate correction), despite sparse sampling throughout the brain. These stimulation-evoked traveling waves exhibited biologically plausible propagation velocities (range, 0.1&ndash;9.6&nbsp;m/s). Our results reveal that direct electrical stimulation elicits neural activity with variable spatiotemporal dynamics that can be modeled as a traveling wave.</p>

                <p>Adipose-derived leptin contributes to energy homeostasis by balancing food intake and motor output, but how leptin acts in brain motor centers remains poorly understood. We investigated the influence of leptin on neuronal activity in two basal ganglia nuclei involved in motor control: the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and pars reticulata (SNr). Using a mouse reporter line to identify cells expressing leptin receptors (LepRs), we found that in both sexes, a majority of SNc dopamine neurons express a high level of LepR. Whole-cell recording in ex vivo midbrain slices from male wild-type mice showed that leptin activates SNc dopamine neurons directly and increases somatodendritic dopamine release. Although LepR expression in SNr GABA output neurons was low, leptin also activated these cells. Additional experiments showed that the influence of leptin on SNr neurons is indirect and involves D1 dopamine receptors and TRPC3 channels. Systemic administration of leptin to male mice increased locomotor activity, consistent with activation of dopamine neurons in the SNc coupled to previously reported amplification of axonal dopamine release by leptin in striatal slices. These findings indicate that in addition to managing energy homeostasis through its actions as a satiety hormone, leptin also promotes axonal and somatodendritic dopamine release that can influence motor output.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/21/e1649242025?rss=1">Impact of Rod-Dominant Mesopic Conditions on Spatial Summation and Surround Suppression in Early Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mesopic (dim light) conditions are prevalent in everyday environments, yet most human vision research is conducted under idealized, photopic (bright) conditions. Electrophysiological studies suggest that under mesopic conditions, contrast-encoding retinal ganglion cell receptive fields expand their center width while diminishing surround inhibition. These retinal modifications enhance light capture by increasing the summation area but they limit spatial resolution. However, the impact of mesopic conditions on human cortical spatial integration mechanisms remains unclear. To address this, we investigate how mesopic conditions affect early visuocortical processing, specifically spatial summation and surround suppression. Across two experiments, we acquired fMRI BOLD responses from 11 normally sighted participants of both sexes under photopic and mesopic conditions in visual areas V1&ndash;V3. The first experiment estimated population receptive field (pRF) properties while the second experiment assessed cortical surround suppression. Photopic and mesopic psychophysical surround suppression, contrast sensitivity function (CSF), and visual acuity were also measured. At the cortical level, mesopic conditions were associated with smaller pRF sizes, while surround suppression remained robust. At the perceptual level, mesopic conditions led to reduced acuity, lower CSF, and weaker suppression, diverging from the observed cortical effects. Importantly, individual differences linked these findings: participants who exhibited greater mesopic reductions in visual acuity also showed larger decreases in early visuocortical surround suppression, underscoring its role in contrast coding and spatial resolution. Altogether, our fMRI findings contrast with retinal electrophysiology and suggest that early visual cortex may employ distinct, perhaps compensatory, mechanisms in response to reduced retinal input under mesopic conditions.</p>

                <p>"Are you talkin&rsquo; to me?!" If you ever watched the masterpiece "Taxi Driver" directed by Martin Scorsese, you certainly recall the monologue during which Travis Bickle rehearses an imaginary confrontation in front of a mirror. While remembering this scene, you recollect a myriad of speech features across visual and auditory senses with a smooth sensation of unified memory. The aim of this study was to investigate how the fine-grained synchrony between coinciding visual and auditory features impacts brain oscillations when forming multisensory speech memories. We developed a memory task presenting participants with short synchronous or asynchronous movie clips focused on the face of speakers in real interviews, all the while undergoing magnetoencephalography recording. In the synchronous condition, the natural alignment between visual and auditory onsets was kept intact. In the asynchronous condition, auditory onsets were delayed to present lip movements and speech sounds in antiphase specifically with respect to the theta oscillation synchronizing them in the original movie. Our results first showed that theta oscillations in the neocortex and hippocampus were modulated by the level of synchrony between lip movements and syllables during audiovisual speech perception. Second, theta asynchrony between the lip movements and auditory envelope during audiovisual speech perception reduced the accuracy of subsequent theta oscillation reinstatement during memory recollection. We conclude that neural theta oscillations play a pivotal role in both audiovisual integration and memory replay of speech.</p>

                <p>Through experience, humans can learn to suppress locations that frequently contain distracting stimuli. However, the neural mechanism underlying learned suppression remains largely unknown. In this study, we combined steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) with event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the mechanism behind statistically learned spatial suppression. Twenty-four male and female human participants performed a version of the additional singleton search task in which one location contained a distractor stimulus frequently. The search stimuli constantly flickered on-and-off the screen, resulting in steady-state entrainment. Prior to search onset, no differences in the SSVEP response were found, though a post hoc analysis did reveal proactive alpha lateralization. Following search onset, clear evoked differences in both the SSVEP and ERP signals emerged at the suppressed location relative to all other locations. Crucially, the early timing of these evoked modulations suggests that learned distractor suppression occurs at the initial stages of visual processing.</p>

                <p>We investigate how respiration influences cognition by examining the interaction between respiratory phase and task-related brain activity during two visual categorization tasks. While prior research shows that cognitive performance varies along the respiratory cycle, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Though some studies have shown that large-scale neural activity reflecting for example changes in the excitation&ndash;inhibition balance is comodulated with the respiratory cycle, it remains unclear whether respiration directly shapes the neural signatures reflecting the encoding of task-specific external signals. We address this gap by applying single-trial multivariate analyses to EEG data obtained in humans (<I>n</I> = 25, any gender), allowing us to track how respiration relates to the sensory evidence reflected in this neurophysiological signal. Confirming previous studies, our data show that participant's performance varies with the respiratory phase prior and during a trial. Importantly, they suggest that respiration may directly influence the sensory evidence carried by neurophysiological processes emerging ~300&ndash;200&nbsp;ms prior to participant's responses. Hence, respiration and sensory-cognitive processes are not only highly intertwined but respiration may directly facilitate the representation of behaviorally relevant signals in the brain.</p>

                <p>To learn complex motor skills, an organism must be able to assign sensory feedback events to the actions that caused them. This matching problem would be simple if motor neuron output led to sensory feedback with a fixed, predictable lag. However, nonlinear dynamics in the brain and the body's periphery can decouple the timing of critical events from that of the motor output which caused them. During human speech production, for example, phonation from the glottis (a sound source for speech) begins suddenly when subglottal pressure and laryngeal tension cross a sharp threshold (i.e., a bifurcation). Only if the brain can predict the timing of these discrete peripheral events resulting from motor output, then, would it be possible to match sensory feedback to movements based on temporal coherence. We show that event onsets in the (male and female) human glottal waveform, measured using electroglottography, are reflected in the electroencephalogram during speech production, leading up to the time of the event itself. Conversely, glottal event times can be decoded from the electroencephalogram. After prolonged exposure to delayed auditory feedback, subjects recalibrate their behavioral threshold for detecting temporal auditory&ndash;motor mismatches and decoded event times decouple from actual movements. This suggests decoding performance is driven by plastic predictions of peripheral timing, providing a missing component for hindsight credit assignment, in which specific feedback events are associated with the neural activity that gave rise to movements. We discuss parallel findings from the birdsong system suggesting that results may generalize across vocal learning species.</p>

                <p>Real-world social cognition requires processing and adapting to multiple dynamic information streams. Interpreting neural activity in such ecological conditions remains a key challenge for neuroscience. This study leverages advancements in denoising techniques and multivariate modeling to extract interpretable EEG signals from pairs of (male and/or female) participants engaged in spontaneous dyadic dance. Using multivariate temporal response functions (mTRFs), we investigated how music acoustics, self-generated kinematics, other-generated kinematics, and social coordination uniquely contributed to EEG activity. Electromyogram recordings from ocular, face, and neck muscles were also modeled to control for artifacts. The mTRFs effectively disentangled neural signals associated with four processes: (I) auditory tracking of music, (II) control of self-generated movements, (III) visual monitoring of partner movements, and (IV) visual tracking of social coordination. We show that the first three neural signals are driven by event-related potentials: the P50-N100-P200 triggered by acoustic events, the central lateralized movement-related cortical potentials triggered by movement initiation, and the occipital N170 triggered by movement observation. Notably, the (previously unknown) neural marker of social coordination encodes the spatiotemporal alignment between dancers, surpassing the encoding of self- or partner-related kinematics taken alone. This marker emerges when partners can see each other, exhibits a topographical distribution over occipital areas, and is specifically driven by movement observation rather than initiation. Using data-driven kinematic decomposition, we further show that vertical bounce movements best drive observers&rsquo; EEG activity. These findings highlight the potential of real-world neuroimaging, combined with multivariate modeling, to uncover the mechanisms underlying complex yet natural social behaviors.</p>

                <p>Optogenetic neuromodulation combined with functional MRI (opto-fMRI) enables noninvasive monitoring of brain-wide activity and probes causal connections. In this study, we focused on the secondary somatosensory (S2) cortex, a hub for integrating tactile and nociceptive information. By selectively stimulating excitatory neurons in the S2 cortex of monkeys using optogenetics, we observed widespread opto-fMRI activity in regions beyond the somatosensory system, as well as a strong spatial correspondence between opto-fMRI activity map and anatomical connections of the S2 cortex. Locally, optogenetically evoked fMRI BOLD signals from putative excitatory neurons exhibited standard hemodynamic response function. At low laser power, graded opto-fMRI signal changes are closely correlated with increases in local field potential (LFP) signals, but not with spiking activity. This indicates that LFP changes in excitatory neurons more accurately reflect the opto-fMRI signals than spikes. In summary, our optogenetic fMRI and anatomical findings provide causal functional and anatomical evidence supporting the role of the S2 cortex as a critical hub connecting sensory regions to higher-order cortical and subcortical regions involved in cognition and emotion. The electrophysiological basis of the opto-fMRI signals uncovered in this study offers novel insights into interpreting opto-fMRI results. Nonhuman primates are an invaluable intermediate model for translating optogenetic preclinical findings to humans.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/21/e2430242025?rss=1">Functional Heterogeneity within the Primate Ventral Striatum for Motivational Regulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ventral striatum (VS) is a key brain region for reward processing and motivation, and its dysfunctions have been implicated in psychiatric disorders such as apathy and obsessive&ndash;compulsive disorder. Although functional heterogeneity within the VS has been well established in rodents, its relevance and mechanisms in primates remain unclear. To address this issue, we performed bilateral pharmacological inactivation of the VS in two male macaque monkeys using muscimol, a GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor agonist. Precise targeting was achieved through computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Behavioral effects were evaluated using two methods: a goal-directed task with variable rewards and analysis of spontaneous behavior. Our results demonstrated that anterior (a)VS inactivation induced a hypoactivity state that we termed "resting," whereas posterior (p)VS inactivation elicited compulsive-like "checking" behaviors. Notably, neither the aVS nor the pVS inactivation affected reward value or drive processing, thus differentiating aVS and pVS from those involved in incentive motivation, such as the rostromedial caudate and ventral pallidum. Retrograde tracing demonstrated distinct anatomical projection patterns for the aVS and pVS, supporting their functional segregation. Together, the present results suggest the functional heterogeneity of the primate VS along its anterior&ndash;posterior axis, with the aVS and pVS participating in distinct motivational control circuits. Our findings may have important implications for understanding the neural mechanisms of psychiatric disorders and for the development of new therapeutic approaches.</p>

                Background Tuberculosis remains a significant public health issue in Tunisia. This study aimed to describe the epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic characteristics of cervical lymph node tuberculosis and identify factors influencing outcomes. Methods A retrospective study was conducted over a 3-year period in the ENT department at La Rabta Hospital, Tunis. Diagnosis was based on histopathological evidence, and disease progression was categorized as favorable (treatment <9 months, no additional surgery) or unfavorable (treatment >9 months and/or supplementary surgery). The study population was divided into two groups based on the outcome nature, and analytical analysis was performed to assess factors influencing outcomes Results The study included 102 patients (32 men and 70 women), with a median age of 34.5 years (range: 8-83 years). Most patients (78.4%) had no significant medical history or known HIV infection. Thirty-nine patients (38.2%) had a history of consuming raw milk. In 65 cases (63.7%), lymph node size exceeded 3 cm. Hypoechogenicity (53.9%) and necrosis (40.1%) were the most common findings on ultrasound and CT scan, respectively. The initial diagnostic approach included adenectomy (56.8%), lymph node dissection (8.9%), and drainage of cold abscesses (34.3%). All patients received an initial four-drug antituberculosis regimen. Ethambutol treatment was extended beyond 2 months in 65 cases (63.7%). Fifty-six patients (54.9%) had a favorable outcome. Factors associated with a favorable outcome included intact skin, complete initial lymph node dissection, favorable progress at 2 months, and prolonged ethambutol therapy. Conclusions The management of lymph node tuberculosis remains challenging, especially with insufficient bacteriological confirmation. Regional epidemiological factors should be considered. The role of surgery is crucial; however, further standardization is needed to optimize patient outcomes.

                Introduction Traumatic ulcers are among the most prevalent injuries with a reported incidence of up to 95%. This study aims to evaluate Stem Cells from Human Exfoliated Deciduous Teeth Spent Medium (SHED-SM) nanoemulgel on the cytotoxicity of NIH-3T3 and buccal mucosal ulcer wounds. Materials and methods The cytotoxicity test of SHED-SM was analyzed on NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells using MTT. Thirty male Wistar rats, 2-3 months, were used as experimental subjects. Traumatic ulcer models were created by excising the right buccal mucosa with a 3 mm punch biopsy. Subjects were divided into 2 groups @15 rats for the treatment (SHED-SM) and control. The gel was applied on the surface once a day for 4 days. Evaluation was conducted on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14. Hematoxylin Eosin (HE) and immunohistochemical were stained to evaluate a number of neutrophils and the expression of COX-2, VEGF, and Col-1. Results The ANOVA results showed significant differences in the cytotoxicity test, the number of neutrophils, and the expression of COX-2, Col-1, and VEGF. The number of neutrophils and the expression of COX-2, Col-1, and VEGF were higher in the treatment group compared to the control. Conclusion SHED-SM demonstrates potential to accelerate the healing of traumatic buccal mucosal ulcers.

                Background Postoperative infection and rejection of miniplates in maxillofacial surgery are linked to surface irregularities and bacterial adhesion. This study investigated the physical and microbiological characteristics of patient-rejected miniplates to elucidate factors contributing to implant failure. Methods Forty miniplates, including straight-type BSSO and L-shaped designs, were collected from patients. Macro photography documented surface deformities. Contact angle measurements assessed surface wettability. Bacterial adhesion for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis was quantified via the crystal violet assay. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to visualize microbial colonization. Results Macro images showed visible deformations, especially in the bridge areas of straight-type BSSO plates. Contact angle analysis revealed significantly greater hydrophobicity in rejected plates than controls (mean: 89.6° vs. 72.3°, p < 0.01). Rejected plates demonstrated significantly increased adhesion of S. aureus and S. mutans (p < 0.001), particularly on mandibular plates. P. aeruginosa adhered more to control plates (p < 0.05), while E. faecalis showed no significant difference between groups. SEM confirmed dense bacterial clusters, with S. aureus forming cocci aggregates and S. mutans forming chains, particularly in regions of surface distortion. Conclusion Rejected miniplates exhibit increased surface roughness and hydrophobicity, correlating with elevated bacterial adhesion. These findings highlight the need for improved surface design or coating technologies to reduce biofilm formation and enhance clinical outcomes in maxillofacial surgery.

                <p>by Elnaz Nemati, David B. Grayden, Anthony N. Burkitt, Parvin Zarei Eskikand</p>

This study introduces a neurobiologically inspired computational model based on the predictive coding algorithm, providing insights into coherent motion detection processes. The model is designed to reflect key principles observed in the visual system, particularly MT neurons and their surround suppression mechanisms, which play a critical role in detecting global motion. By integrating these principles, the model simulates how motion structures are decomposed into individual and shared sources, mirroring the brain’s strategy for extracting coherent motion patterns. The results obtained from random dot stimuli underscore the delicate balance between sensory data and prior knowledge in motion detection. Model testing across varying noise levels reveals that, as noise increases, the model takes longer to stabilize its motion estimates, consistent with psychophysical experiments showing that response duration (e.g., reaction time or decision-making time) also increases under higher noise conditions. The model suggests that an excessive emphasis on prior knowledge prolongs the stabilization time for motion detection, whereas an optimal integration of prior expectations enhances detection accuracy and efficiency by preventing excessive disturbances due to noise. These findings contribute to potential explanations for motion detection deficiencies observed in schizophrenia.

African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, is a life-threatening disease caused by the protozoan parasite <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>. The bloodstream form of <i>T. brucei</i> has a slender body with a relatively long active flagellum, which makes it an excellent swimmer. We develop a realistic trypanosome model and perform mesoscale hydrodynamic simulations to study the importance of various mechanical characteristics for trypanosome swimming behavior. The membrane of the cell body is represented by an elastic triangulated network, while the attached flagellum consists of four interconnected running-in-parallel filaments with an active travelling bending wave, which permits a good control of the flagellum beating plane. Our simulation results are validated against experimental observations, and highlight the crucial role of body elasticity, non-uniform actuation along the flagellum length, and the orientation of flagellum-beating plane with respect to the body surface for trypanosome locomotion. These results offer a framework for exploring parasite behavior in complex environments.

                <p>by Zoë Lange, Franziska Matthäus, Mingfeng Qiu</p>

Vertex models provide a robust theoretical framework for studying epithelial tissues as a network of cell boundaries. They have been pivotal in exploring properties such as cell packing geometry and rigidity transitions. Recently, extended vertex models have become instrumental in bridging the subcellular scales to the tissue scale. Here, we review extensions of the model aiming to capture experimentally observed subcellular features of epithelial tissues including heterogeneity in myosin activity across the tissue, non-uniform contractility structures, and mechanosensitive feedback loops. We discuss how these extensions change and challenge current perspectives on observables of macroscopic tissue properties. First, we find that extensions to the vertex model can change model properties significantly, impacting the critical threshold and in some cases even the existence of a rigidity transition. Second, we find that packing disorder can be explained by models employing different subcellular mechanisms, indicating a source of stochasticity and gradual local size changes as common mesoscopic motifs in the mechanics of tissue organization. We address complementary models and statistical inference, putting vertex models in a broader methodological context and we give a brief overview of software packages utilized in increasingly complex vertex model studies. Our review emphasizes the need for more comparative, systematic studies that identify specific classes of vertex models which share a set of well-defined properties, as well as a more in-depth discussion of modeling choices and their biological motivations.

                <p>by Xi Feng, Xiaoman Wang, Shouhong Guang, Shanshan Pang, Haiqing Tang</p>

In response to nutrient scarcity, cells must reallocate their limited energy for cellular maintenance at the expense of certain processes. How such a tradeoff is achieved remains largely unknown. RNA surveillance is crucial for the integrity of the transcriptome, whose defects are associated with several human diseases. Unexpectedly, we discover that the nucleolar RNA exosome, a key RNA surveillance machine, is inhibited by starvation. This is not merely the cessation of a temporarily non-essential process, but rather a key signal to allocate energy. By rewiring one-carbon metabolism, the inhibition of RNA exosome reduces translation, the most energy-consuming process. Energy is then conserved for fat synthesis to enhance cellular maintenance and starvation survival. Notably, while benefiting starvation fitness, RNA exosome inhibition impairs the life span of well-fed animals, indicating a tradeoff between short-term and long-term fitness. Our findings suggest that the nucleolar RNA surveillance can be temporarily sacrificed to facilitate starvation adaptation.

                <p>by Elisa T. Granato, Jacob D. Palmer, Christian Kirk, Connor Sharp, George Shillcock, Kevin R. Foster</p>

Bacteria commonly use molecular weaponry to kill or inhibit competitors. Genes encoding many weapons and their associated immunity mechanisms can be transmitted horizontally. These transfer events are striking because they appear to undermine bacterial weapons when given to competing strains. Here, we develop an ecological model of bacterial warfare to understand the impacts of horizontal gene transfer. Our model predicts that weapon gene transfer from an attacker to a target strain is possible, but will typically occur at a low rate such that transfer has a negligible impact on competition outcomes. We tested the model empirically using a transmissible plasmid encoding colicin E2, a potent antibacterial toxin produced by <i>Escherichia coli</i>. As predicted by the model, we find that toxin plasmid transfer is feasible during warfare, but the resulting transconjugants remain rare. However, exploring the model further reveals realistic conditions where transfer is predicted to have major impacts. Specifically, the model predicts that whenever competing strains have access to unique nutrients, transconjugants can proliferate and reach high abundances. In support of these predictions, short- and long-term experiments show that transconjugants can thrive when nutrient competition is relaxed. Our work shows how horizontal gene transfer can reshape bacterial warfare in a way that benefits a weapon gene and strains that receive it. Interestingly, we also find that there is little cost to a strain that transfers a weapon gene, which is expected to further enable the horizontal gene transfer of molecular weapons.

                Background Chintamani village, Chikkaballapura district, Karnataka, India was found to possess high aquifer uranium concentrations. Geologically, Chintamani village is located on bedrock that is rich in elements like potassium (K) that naturally contain high levels of radioactive elements, such as uranium and thorium, due to the presence of alkali-feldspar granites and gneisses. Aquifer depletion has caused the concentration of these elements in groundwater to increase over time, posing a potential health hazard to the residents of Chintamani village. Methods Here, we report the sampling of groundwater from 12 borewells located in Chintamani village in between the period of August 2024 to December 2024. We observed groundwater uranium concentrations of 0.018 ppm to 8.64 ppm. Data for borewell depth, the quantity of total dissolved solids (TDS), and the elemental composition of TDS is also reported. We observed a statistically significant spatial distribution of uranium concentrations in Chintamani village. Borewells possessing the highest observed concentrations of uranium were clustered towards the northwestern region of the village. Conclusions This dataset is expected to serve as a resource for guiding potential remediation efforts in these locations.

                Advanced clinical diagnostic tools enable ophthalmologists to diagnose not only ocular pathologies but also identify disorders that extend beyond ocular diseases. Ophthalmodynamometry (ODM), a screening tool that most ophthalmologists do not commonly use, measured reduced mean central retinal artery pressure (MCRAP) in the clinical setting. We describe a 70-year-old female with a reduced MCRAP in the right eye who identified 50% stenosis in her right internal carotid artery (ICA). Early diagnosis facilitated prompt management and potentially prevented future ischemic events.
