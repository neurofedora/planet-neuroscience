">Spatial grouping modulates the link between individual alpha frequency and temporal integration windows in crowding</a></h4>

              
                Previous research has linked endogenous alpha oscillations (~7-13 Hz) to temporal integration windows in visual perception, with higher individual alpha frequency (IAF) predicting improved temporal segregation. Here, we investigated whether alpha-rhythmic temporal integration is a factor in visual crowding and whether this relationship is mediated by spatial grouping mechanisms. 47 participants performed a Vernier discrimination task, in which we manipulated both the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between flankers and targets, and the spatial configuration of the flankers. Specifically, flankers were arranged to either induce crowding or "uncrowding", through the manipulation of good-Gestalt properties. Our results show that crowding has a temporal integration period of around 170 ms but this varies substantially across individuals. Importantly, resting-state IAF predicted individual variance in temporal integration windows: individuals with faster endogenous alpha rhythms could begin to segregate targets from distractors at shorter SOAs. Crucially, this effect was specific for crowding-inducing flankers and disappeared when flankers led to uncrowding. These results suggest that top-down spatial grouping can overwrite the temporal integration constraint imposed by alpha oscillations, highlighting both the relevance of alpha for understanding limits on peripheral visual processing as well as the flexible and context-dependent role of alpha in temporal integration.

">Sensory Compression as a Unifying Principle for Action Chunking and Time Coding in the Brain</a></h4>

              
                The brain seamlessly transforms sensory information into precisely-timed movements, enabling us to type familiar words, play musical instruments, or perform complex motor routines with millisecond precision. This process often involves organizing actions into stereotyped "chunks''. Intriguingly, brain regions that are critical for action chunking, such as the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), also exhibit neural dynamics that encode the passage of time. How such brain regions support both task-specific motor habits and task-invariant internal timing, two seemingly distinct functions, remains a fundamental question. Here we show, using recurrent neural network models, that these two functions emerge from a single computational principle: sensory compression, the functional compression of high-dimensional sensory information into a low-dimensional representation. We find that a sensory bottleneck forces the network to develop stable internal dynamics that implicitly encode time, which in turn serve as a scaffold upon which the brain learns action chunks in response to predictable environmental regularities. This mechanism unifies task-invariant time coding and sensory-guided motor timing as two outcomes of the same process of sensory compression, providing a general principle for how the brain mirrors environmental regularities in both internal stable neural trajectories and external consistent motor habits.

">Benefits of Music Training for Learning to Read: Evidence from Cortical Tracking of Speech in Children</a></h4>

              
                Musical training has long been argued to boost early phonological and reading abilities. Cortical tracking of speech (CTS) has been proposed as a mechanism for this music-to-literacy transfer. In this study, we examined how musical training shapes CTS in young readers and whether it facilitates literacy benefits. In a sample of 57 children aged 5-9, musical training was linked to enhanced reading and phonological awareness (PA). EEG during story listening revealed that higher left-hemispheric and lower right-hemispheric CTS were also associated with higher reading scores. However, children with higher musicality exhibited stronger reading skills at lower levels of left-hemispheric CTS, suggesting more adult-like speech analysis. Critically, PA mediated the relationship between musicality and reading: greater musicality was associated with stronger PA, which in turn predicted higher reading performance, independent of demographic and cognitive factors. These findings indicate that musical training supports literacy by enhancing PA and shaping left-lateralized speech processing.

">Compositional neural dynamics during reaching</a></h4>

              
                The complex mechanics of the arm make the neural control of reaching inherently posture dependent. Because previous reaching studies confound reach direction with final posture, it remains unknown how neural population dynamics in the motor cortex account for arm posture. Here we address this gap with high-density neural recordings and a reaching task in which the same targets serve as start points on some trials and end points on others. We show that neural population dynamics in monkey primary motor cortex and dorsal premotor cortex exhibit a compositional structure with three components that enable posture-dependent control: first, a posture subspace containing fixed points visited whenever the arm is in a specific posture; second, rotational dynamics that transition between these fixed points, systematically organized so that similar rotations produce similar movements while continuously updating the posture representation; third, a condition-independent shift dimension that tracks trial progression across all movements. This compositional structure advances the population-level account of how motor cortical dynamics support skilled reaching.

">HuD controls widespread RNA stability to drive neuronal activity-dependent responses</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal activity shapes brain development and refines synaptic connectivity in part through dynamic changes in gene expression. While activity-regulated transcriptional programs have been extensively characterized, the holistic effects of neuronal activity on the full RNA life cycle remain relatively unexplored. Here, we show that neuronal activity influences multiple stages of RNA metabolism in vitro and in vivo. Among these, RNA stability emerges as a previously underappreciated regulator of gene expression, exerting a stronger influence than transcription on total RNA levels for ~10% of activity-dependent genes. We go on to profile 3'UTR mRNA motifs that are sufficient to modulate activity-dependent mRNA stability and employ machine learning to identify the neuronal-specific RNA-binding protein HuD as a key regulator of activity-dependent mRNA stabilization. We demonstrate that HuD shapes activity-dependent mRNA abundance of hundreds of transcripts in both soma and distal neuronal processes and that neuronal activity drives the reorganization of HuD-interacting proteins, thereby stabilizing HuD-bound mRNAs and directing them into translationally active granules. Finally, we find that many variants associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental disorders disrupt or promote aberrant activity-dependent changes in mRNA stability. These findings reveal mRNA stability as a widespread mechanism of stimulus-responsive gene regulation in neurons with direct implications for the understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders.

">The human factor: development and characterization of a scalable calcium imaging assay using human iPSC-derived neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neuroscience drug discovery is challenged by the brain's structural and cell-type complexity, which is difficult to model in cellular systems compatible with high-throughput screening methods. Calcium oscillation assays, that harness neurons' intrinsic capability to develop functional neural networks in cell culture, are currently the closest cellular models with a relevant functional endpoint to model human neuronal circuitry in a dish. Here we further develop this useful assay towards scalable drug discovery applications. We show the importance of defined neuron-to-astrocyte ratios for optimal cellular distribution and surface adherence in HTS-compatible cell culture vessels and how the cell type ratios determine network firing patterns. We identify DAPT, a molecule previously shown to promote neuronal maturation and synapse formation, as a negative regulator of astrocyte viability. Addition of GABA-ergic inhibitory neurons increases the network spike frequency while reducing network spike amplitudes. We develop a pixel-based analysis for plate reader data to access local field activity in an automated and scalable calcium imaging environment. Using this method, we identify a desynchronization of excitatory neuronal activity by GABA neurons that echoes GABA action in vivo, and dysregulation thereof in pathological conditions.

">Complementary regulation of memory flexibility and stabilization by dentate gyrus granule cells and mossy cells</a></h4>

              
                Accurate memory formation requires hippocampal spatial representations to balance stability, for later recall, with flexibility, to incorporate new information. The dentate gyrus (DG) is essential to memory formation, but the distinct roles of its excitatory cell types, granule cells (GCs) and mossy cells (MCs), remain unclear. To evaluate how GC and MC activity affect hippocampal output, we recorded from CA1 using two-photon calcium imaging as head-fixed mice navigated familiar and novel virtual environments. DREADD-mediated MC inhibition disrupted initial map stabilization, decreasing spatial stability in novel, but not familiar, environments. In contrast, GC inhibition increased map stability in familiar, but not novel, environments by disrupting drift of spatial maps across distinct experiences (episodes) within an environment. These results reveal how distinct DG cell types support hippocampal memory formation in context-dependent ways; MCs promote stabilization of new spatial maps to support accurate memory recall, while GCs promote flexibility to update existing representations.

">A universal dynamic routing architecture governs the flow of human cortical activity</a></h4>

              
                Behaviour requires distributed neural processing to be flexibly integrated and segregated, which in turn demands that information be dynamically routed across the brain. However, whether a unifying principle governs the routing of neural activity remains unknown. Here, we report that the flow of cortical activity is directed through canonical routing modes that are conserved across individuals, robust to variations in age, frequency band, brain state, and even the presence of neurodegeneration. These modes are constructed from the divergence and vorticity of the time-varying unit-phase vector field derived from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. We show that the canonical routing modes are flexibly combined to generate distinct, state- and function-dependent flow architectures that remain consistent across individuals. Disruption to the routing mode dynamics mechanistically links structural abnormalities and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease. Together, these canonical routing modes provide a unified framework for describing, modelling, and predicting the dynamic integration and segregation of macroscopic brain activity underpinning behaviour.

">Neural Subspaces Encode Sequential Working Memory, but Neural Sequences Do Not</a></h4>

              
                The neural mechanisms of multiple-item working memory are not well understood. In the current study, we address two competing hypotheses about the neural basis of sequential working memory: neural subspaces versus neural sequences. Using broadband MEG data from human participants, we applied dimensionality reduction and multivariate decoding techniques to test whether sequential items are maintained during the retention period through the reactivation of individual items in sequence (neural sequences), or by organizing them into distinct low-dimensional subspaces (neural subspaces). Our results revealed behaviorally relevant, low-dimensional neural subspaces that organized memory representations during the retention period but not during stimulus encoding, supporting the neural subspaces hypothesis. In contrast, we found no evidence of sequential neural replay during the delay period, contrary to predictions from the neural sequences hypothesis. Together, our findings suggest that sequential working memory is maintained through structured geometric organization in low-dimensional representational space, rather than through the sequential reactivation of individual items.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Hummingbirds (family <i>Trochilidae</i>) are easily recognized due to their unique ability to hover. Critical to hovering flight is head and body stabilization. In birds, stabilization during flight is mediated, among other things, by the detection of optic flow, the motion that occurs across the entire retina during self-motion. Given this increased requirement for stabilization, it is not surprising that previous studies have shown that hummingbirds have neural specializations in the visual pathways involved in the detection of optic flow. Particularly, previous studies have found some structural and functional differences in the hummingbird brain, in the pretectal nucleus lentiformis mesencephali (LM): compared to other avian species, LM shows a massive hypertrophy, and LM neurons have unique response properties to optic flow stimuli. Here, we used intraocular injections of a neural tracer, cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) conjugated with a fluorescent molecule, to study the retinal projections in Anna's hummingbirds (<i>Calypte anna</i>) and compare them to those of a similarly sized non-hovering species, the zebra finch (<i>Taeniopygia castanotis</i>). Retinal targets in both birds were similar and correspond closely to those reported in other birds from a variety of avian clades. Importantly, we found differences in the projections to LM between hummingbirds and zebra finches. Consistent with previous reports of specialization of LM, it was more intensely labelled compared to other retinal-recipient nuclei in hummingbirds. Moreover, this increase in intensity was most apparent in the lateral subnucleus. This study reinforces previous evidence that the LM of hummingbirds is adapted to sustain the unique flight abilities of this clade.</p>

Real-world decision-making often involves navigating large action spaces with state-dependent action values, taxing the limited cognitive resources at our disposal. While previous studies have explored cognitive constraints on generating action consideration sets or refining state-action mappings (policy complexity), their interplay remains underexplored. In this work, we present a resource-rational framework for policy compression that integrates both constraints, offering a unified perspective on decision-making under cognitive limitations. Through simulations, we characterize the suboptimality arising from reduced action consideration sets and reveal the complex interaction between policy complexity and action consideration set size in mitigating this suboptimality. We then use such normative insight to explain empirically observed phenomena in option generation, including the preferential sampling of generally valuable options and increased correlation in responses across contexts under cognitive load. We further validate the framework’s predictions through a contextual multi-armed bandit experiment, showing how humans flexibly adapt their action consideration sets and policy complexity to maintain near-optimality in a task-dependent manner. Our study demonstrates the importance of accounting for fine-grained resource constraints in understanding human cognition, and highlights the presence of adaptive metacognitive strategies even in simple tasks.

                <p>by Dongju Lim, Kyeong Tae Ko, Hyukpyo Hong, Hyojung Lee, Boseung Choi, Won Chang, Sunhwa Choi, Jae Kyoung Kim</p>

Mathematical modeling is a powerful tool for understanding and predicting complex dynamical systems, ranging from gene regulatory networks to population-level dynamics. However, model predictions are highly sensitive to initial conditions, which are often unknown. In infectious disease models, for instance, the initial number of exposed individuals (E) at the time the model simulation starts is frequently unknown. This initial condition has often been estimated using an unrealistic, history-independent assumption for simplicity: the chance that an exposed individual becomes infectious is the same regardless of the timing of their exposure (i.e., exposure history). Here, we show that this history-independent method can yield serious bias in the estimation of the initial condition. To address this, we developed a <i>history-dependent</i> initial condition estimation method derived from a master equation expressing the time-varying likelihood of becoming infectious during a latent period. Our method consistently outperformed the history-independent method across various scenarios, including those with measurement errors and abrupt shifts in epidemics, for example, due to vaccination. In particular, our method reduced estimation error by 55% compared to the previous method in real-world COVID-19 data from Seoul, Republic of Korea, which includes likely infection dates, allowing us to obtain the true initial condition. This advancement of initial condition estimation enhances the precision of epidemic modeling, ultimately supporting more effective public health policies. We also provide a user-friendly package, Hist-D, to facilitate the use of this history-dependent initial condition estimation method.

This study addresses the pressing global health burden of mosquito-borne diseases by investigating the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for mosquito species identification using wing images. Conventional identification methods are hampered by the need for significant expertise and resources, while CNNs offer a promising alternative. Our research aimed to develop a reliable and applicable classification system that can be used under real-world conditions, with a focus on improving model adaptability to unencountered devices, mitigating dataset biases, and ensuring usability across different users without standardized protocols. We utilized a large, diverse dataset of mosquito wing images of 21 taxa and three image-capturing devices (N = 14,888) and a preprocessing pipeline to standardize images and remove undesirable image features. The developed CNN models demonstrated high performance, with an average balanced accuracy of 98.3% and a macro F1-score of 97.6%, effectively distinguishing between the 21 mosquito taxa, including morphologically similar pairs. The preprocessing pipeline improved the model’s robustness, reducing performance drops on unfamiliar devices effectively. However, the study also highlights the persistence of inherent dataset biases, which the preprocessing steps could only partially mitigate. The classification system’s practical usability was demonstrated through a feasibility study, showing high inter-rater reliability. The results underscore the potential of the proposed workflow to enhance vector surveillance, especially in resource-constrained settings, and suggest its applicability to other winged insect species. The classification system developed in this study is available for public use, providing a valuable tool for vector surveillance and research, supporting efforts to mitigate the spread of mosquito-borne diseases.

Drug-induced liver injury is a leading cause of high attrition rates for both candidate drugs and marketed medications. Previous in silico models may not effectively utilize biological drug property information and often lack robust model validation. In this study, we developed a graph convolutional network embedded with a biological graph learning (BioGL) module—named BioGL-GCN(Biological Graph Learning-Graph Convolutional Network)—for drug-induced liver injury prediction using toxicogenomic profiles. The BioGL module learned the optimal graph representations of gene interactions by utilizing the constructed protein-protein interaction network, which represents initial gene relationships, and gene frequency information obtained from gene enrichment analysis. Finally, the graph convolutional network was used to identify drug hepatotoxicity. Our method pays more attention to gene-gene relationships compared to previous approaches, thereby achieving more accurate predictive performance. We applied BioGL-GCN to predict DILI risk for active components in the integrated traditional Chinese medicine (ITCM) database and validated these predictions through hepatotoxicity experiments using a 3D primary human hepatocyte (PHH) model. The results showed that our model achieved a prediction accuracy of 79%, thus further validating the reliability of the constructed model.

                <p>by Jianing Yang, Gregory R. Grant, Thomas G. Brooks</p>

Simulation of realistic omics data is a key input for benchmarking studies that help users obtain optimal computational pipelines. Omics data involves large numbers of measured features on each sample and these measures are generally correlated with each other. However, simulation too often ignores these correlations, perhaps due to computational and statistical hurdles of doing so. To alleviate this, we describe three approaches for generating omics-scale data with correlated measures which mimic real datasets. These approaches are all based on a Gaussian copula approach with a covariance matrix that decomposes into a diagonal part and a low-rank part. This decomposition allows for extremely efficient simulation, overcoming a hurdle for adoption of past methods. We use these approaches to demonstrate the importance of including correlation in two benchmarking applications. First, we show that variance of results from the popular DESeq2 method increases when dependence is included. Second, we demonstrate that CYCLOPS, a method for inferring circadian time of collection from transcriptomics, improves in performance when given gene-gene dependencies in some circumstances. We provide an R package, dependentsimr, that has efficient implementations of these methods and can generate dependent data with arbitrary marginal distributions, including discrete (binary, ordered categorical, Poisson, negative binomial), continuous (normal), or with an empirical distribution.

                <p>by Pierre Orhan, Yves Boubenec, Jean-Rémi King</p>

Humans can spontaneously detect complex algebraic structures. Historically, two opposing views explain this ability, at the root of language and music acquisition. Some argue for the existence of an innate and specific mechanism. Others argue that this ability emerges from experience: i.e. when generic learning principles continuously process sensory inputs. These two views, however, remain difficult to test experimentally. Here, we use deep learning models to evaluate the factors that lead to the spontaneous detection of algebraic structures in the auditory modality. Specifically, we use self-supervised learning to train multiple deep-learning models with a variable amount of either natural (environmental sounds) and/or cultural sounds (speech or music) to evaluate the impact of these stimuli. We then expose these models to the experimental paradigms classically used to evaluate the processing of algebraic structures. Like humans, these models spontaneously detect repeated sequences, probabilistic chunks, and complex algebraic structures. Also like humans, this ability diminishes with structure complexity. Importantly, this ability can emerge from experience alone: the more the models are exposed to natural sounds, the more they spontaneously detect increasingly complex structures. Finally, this ability does not emerge in models pretrained only on speech, and emerges more rapidly in models pretrained with music than environmental sounds. Overall, our study provides an operational framework to clarify sufficient built-in and acquired principles that model human’s advanced capacity to detect algebraic structures in sounds.

                <p>by Kelsey L. Anbuhl, Alexander T. Ferber, Andrew D. Brown, Victor Benichoux, Nathaniel T. Greene, Daniel J. Tollin</p>

Early sensory experience can exert lasting perceptual consequences. For example, a brief period of auditory deprivation early in life can lead to persistent spatial hearing deficits. Some forms of hearing loss (i.e., conductive; CHL) can distort acoustical cues needed for spatial hearing, which depend on inputs from both ears. We hypothesize that asymmetric acoustic input during development disrupts auditory circuits that integrate binaural information. Here, we identify prolonged maturation of the binaural auditory brainstem in the guinea pig by tracking auditory evoked potentials across development. Using this age range, we induce a reversible unilateral CHL and ask whether behavioral and neural maturation are disrupted. We find that developmental CHL is associated with alterations in a brainstem readout of binaural function, an effect that was not observed in a separate cohort with adult-onset CHL. Startle-based behavioral measures suggest that Early CHL animals exhibit reduced spatial resolution for high-frequency sound sources. Finally, single-unit recordings of auditory midbrain neurons reveal significantly poorer neural acuity to a sound location cue that largely depends on high-frequency sounds. Thus, these findings show that unilateral deprivation can disrupt developing auditory circuits that integrate binaural information and may give rise to lingering spatial hearing deficits.

                <p>Author(s): Takumi Tagaki, Seiya Nishikawa, and Shuji Ishihara</p><p>A model of self-propelled particles that incorporates elastic energy from cyclic substrate stretching successfully reproduces experimentally observed microtubule alignment at specific angles, as well as banded aggregation patterns. It also provides insight into how general active matter systems respond to cyclic mechanical stimuli.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97870">The Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex pangenome is small and shaped by sub-lineage-specific regions of difference</a></h4>

              
                The <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> complex (MTBC) is a group of bacteria causing tuberculosis (TB) in humans and animals. Understanding MTBC genetic diversity is crucial for insights into its adaptation and traits related to survival, virulence, and antibiotic resistance. While it is known that within-MTBC diversity is characterised by large deletions found only in certain lineages (regions of difference [RDs]), a comprehensive pangenomic analysis incorporating both coding and non-coding regions remains unexplored. We utilised a curated dataset representing various MTBC genomes, including under-represented lineages, to quantify the full diversity of the MTBC pangenome. The MTBC was found to have a small, closed pangenome with distinct genomic features and RDs both between lineages (as previously known) and between sub-lineages. The accessory genome was identified to be a product of genome reduction, showing both divergent and convergent deletions. This variation has implications for traits like virulence, drug resistance, and metabolism. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the MTBC pangenome, highlighting the importance of genome reduction in its evolution, and underlines the significance of genomic variations in determining the pathogenic traits of different MTBC lineages.

">WNK-Dependent Phosphorylation of Gephyrin Tunes GABAA Receptors at Inhibitory Synapses and Modulates Anxiety Behavior</a></h4>

              
                The role of the chloride-sensitive kinase WNK1 and its effector SPAK in the brain remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a regulatory mechanism involving WNK signaling that directly controls the synaptic diffusion and clustering, as well as the membrane stability and endocytosis of inhibitory GABAA receptors (GABAARs). We show that activation of WNK signaling stabilizes GABAARs at inhibitory synapses, while inhibition enhances receptor internalization. This regulation depends on the phosphorylation state of two previously uncharacterized residues in the central linker region of the gephyrin scaffold protein. Modulating WNK activity alters neuronal activity and the kinetics of GABAergic currents. In vivo, expression of a phospho-mimetic form of gephyrin at WNK-targeted sites produces anxiolytic effects. By orchestrating the recruitment of GABAARs at inhibitory synapses, the WNK pathway emerges as a master regulator of GABAergic transmission and establishes chloride as a bona fide second messenger in inhibitory synaptic signaling.

">Weakening of subcortical and strengthening of cortical visual pathways across early adolescence</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mounting evidence suggests that amygdalar nuclei receive visual information via both a well-characterized cortical pathway through the inferior temporal cortex and a subcortical route through the superior colliculus and pulvinar. This subcortical pathway may facilitate rapid responses to salient visual stimuli and could explain phenomena such as blindsight. However, controversies remain about the organization of the subcortical pathway, its role in visual processing, and how the cortical and subcortical pathways mature across development. Methods: To address these questions we used longitudinal diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data from 4361 participants in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, reconstructing every major segment of the cortical and subcortical amygdala pathways. We tested the existence of the subcortical pathway against null tractography models, characterized cortical and subcortical pathways development across early adolescence, and investigated their association with visual processing speed. Results: We provide evidence for the existence of bilateral pulvinar-amygdala pathways against a null model (all p < 0.001, corrected). While cortical tracts involving the primary and extrastriate visual cortex and the inferior-temporal cortex strengthened with chronological age and over pubertal development, we demonstrate that subcortical pulvinar-amygdala connectivity decreased over pubertal development. Greater connectivity strength of the right pulvinar-amygdala tract was associated with faster responses on a visual task for both emotional face and place stimuli, a relationship also seen for cortical tracts. Conclusion: This study provides evidence for the existence of pulvinar to amygdala tracts in the largest sample of adolescent participants studied to date. Greater connectivity in both cortical and subcortical tracts were associated with faster reaction time on a visual task, but further work will be needed to investigate the specificity of this association in terms of both task and tract. In line with the hypothesized importance of the subcortical pathway in early development, we show that the developmental trajectories of cortical and subcortical pathways diverge and highlight the influence of pubertal development, with cortical pathways generally strengthening and subcortical pathways weakening across early adolescence.

">Rate of functional network maturity and the role of environmental factors</a></h4>

              
                The developmental period from childhood to adolescence is marked by significant changes to the functional properties of the brain that support various aspects of higher-level cognition. Environmental factors such as socioeconomic status and adversity can have an outsized influence on neurocognitive development. However, not all environmental factors have the same influence on cognitive and brain development. In the current study, we examined the differential influences of SES (i.e., parental education and neighbourhood safety) and adversity on the maturation rate of functional networks in children and adolescents. Using resting-state fMRI data, independent component analysis with dual regression was computed to identify six networks (Default Mode Network (DMN), Left Executive Control Network (ECN), Right ECN, Hippocampal (HPC), Salience, and Sensorimotor networks) of interest in children and adolescents aged 7 to 15 (N=216, acquired from the Healthy Brain Network). A neural maturity index was generated based on the degree of similarity between the spatial configuration of the six networks in each youth brain to that of an adult template (1243 total, with a mean age of 26; independently by sex). Regression analyses were used to determine the association between neural maturity, social-cognitive abilities and environmental factors such as parental education, neighbourhood safety and number of negative life events (adversity). We found one sensory (sensorimotor) and two association (default mode and executive control) networks matured faster than other networks. Only the rate of maturity of the DMN and HPC were associated with environmental factors. Maturity of the DMN was associated with less adversity and better social cognitive ability, whereas maturity of the HPC network was associated with younger participants with higher IQs. Moreover, these effects were stronger in females than males. Our results highlight the importance of examining the unique contributions of distinct dimensions of childhood environments on neurocognitive development.

">A cortical output channel for perceptual categorization</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual categorization allows the brain to transform diverse sensory inputs into discrete representations that support flexible behavior. Auditory cortex (ACtx) has been implicated in this process, but the cell-type-specific circuits that implement category learning remain unknown. We trained head-fixed mice to categorize the temporal rate of amplitude-modulated noise while performing longitudinal two-photon imaging of layer (L)5 extratelencephalic (L5 ET) neurons alongside comparison populations of L2/3 and L5 intratelencephalic (L5 IT) neurons. With learning, L5 ET neurons underwent pronounced tuning modifications and developed robust, categorical responses, whereas L2/3 and L5 IT neurons did not. This categorical code was task engagement-dependent: it was present during behavior and absent during passive listening in the same neurons on the same day, indicating context-gated expression. Using a generalized linear model to dissociate stimulus- from choice-related signals, we confirmed that categorical selectivity in L5 ET neurons reflected sensory encoding rather than motor confounds. All three populations carried choice signals, but these were strongest in L5 ET neurons, suggesting a role in linking sensory categorization to action selection. These findings identify a projection-specific, deep-layer cortical output channel in which L5 ET neurons acquire categorical representations and selectively propagate behaviorally relevant signals to downstream targets.

">Differential Effects of Inducible Cerebellar Granule Cell and Purkinje Cell Ablation on Motor Coordination and Motor Learning in Adult Mice</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum regulates motor coordination and motor learning through highly organized circuits composed mainly of granule cells (GCs) and Purkinje cells (PCs). To investigate their distinct roles, we generated two lines of inducible transgenic mice in which either GCs or PCs could be selectively ablated in adulthood by administration of the progesterone receptor antagonist RU-486. This system combined a Cre recombinase-progesterone receptor fusion, in which Cre activity is induced in an RU-486-dependent manner, with a Cre-dependent diphtheria toxin A expression to achieve cell-type-specific ablation. High-dose RU-486 induced nearly complete loss of either GCs or PCs and resulted in severe ataxia. When partial ablation was induced by low-dose RU-486, different phenotypes emerged. Mice retaining about 20% of PCs were still able to improve motor coordination in the rotarod test and maintained performance in the balance beam test comparable to that of controls. In contrast, mice with about 30% of GCs remaining showed marked deficits, failing to improve across rotarod trials and exhibiting reduced latency to fall in the balance beam test. These results suggest that while both GCs and PCs are indispensable for motor coordination, a sufficient number of GCs is required for both motor coordination and motor learning. This inducible ablation model highlights the differential contributions of cerebellar neurons and provides a valuable tool to dissect circuit-specific functions in the adult brain.

">Cross-Species Evidence for Hippocampal CACNA1C as a Therapeutic Target for Alcohol Use Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Context-induced relapse is a major barrier to recovery from alcohol use disorder (AUD). Identifying molecular targets involved in contextual memories associated with alcohol use may serve as novel pharmacotherapies. Our RNAseq profiling study of the hippocampus from rhesus monkeys with chronic alcohol use identified the voltage-gated calcium channel CACNA1C as a promising therapeutic target. However, data regarding CACNA1C expression in AUD and whether inhibition of CACNA1C can attenuate ethanol contextual memories remains limited. We tested the hypothesis that hippocampal CACNA1C expression is increased in human and nonhuman primates (NHPs) with chronic alcohol use. Further, we used a mouse conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm to test the hypothesis that Nifedipine, a CACNA1C-selective L-type calcium channel antagonist, can attenuate ethanol-induced CPP. CACNA1C mRNA expression was increased in the hippocampus of subjects with AUD (p<0.03). Increased densities of CACNA1C neurons (p<0.01) and glia (p<0.02) were observed in rhesus monkeys with chronic alcohol use. Ethanol-treated mice spent more time in the ethanol-paired chamber compared to the vehicle animals (p<0.04), demonstrating ethanol-induced CPP. This effect was attenuated by Nifedipine, as time spent in the ethanol-paired chamber in the ethanol + Nifedipine group was not significantly different from the vehicle group. These findings demonstrate that chronic alcohol use increases CACNA1C expression in the hippocampus across species and that a CACNA1C subtype-selective antagonist reduces ethanol-induced CPP. Together, these results support CACNA1C as a promising therapeutic target for context-induced relapse in AUD.

">Dissecting Medullary Raphe Neurons Regulating Multiple Thermogenic Pathways</a></h4>

              
                Thermogenesis is critical for survival and health in mammals. Although the thermoregulatory systems in the preoptic area are well documented, the downstream processing of these central signals--particularly by medullary neurons involved in the control of shivering and sympathetic activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT)--remains incompletely understood. Here we show that vesicular glutamate transporter type 3 (vGluT3)-expressing neurons in the medullary raphe pallidus (RPa) become active immediately before a spontaneous increase in body temperature. These neurons remain inactive under experimentally induced hypometabolic conditions and are necessary for rapid recovery from hypothermia. Furthermore, they communicate with multiple brainstem systems involved in the integration of thermal cues. Notably, RPa-vGluT3 neurons can drive shivering via specific brainstem premotor neurons, in addition to regulating sympathetic outflows for BAT thermogenesis and heat-conserving piloerection. These data indicate that RPa-vGluT3 neurons function as medullary hubs, coordinating sympathetic and somatic motor outputs to increase body temperature.

">Next generation neural mass model with dopamine modulation mediated by D1-type receptors</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulation is a complex process in which chemical substances modulate brain activity, allowing its rich repertoire of behaviors. Among these substances, dopamine has a preponderant role, being involved in several mechanisms. Moreover, dysfunctions in the dopamine connections has been observed in pathology, such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. To investigate the mechanism of neuromodulation, we expand a previously proposed mean-field formalism, that describes the average activity of a neural population, by adding the effect of dopamine modulation. This mean-field reduction allows for a direct comparison with the underlying neural network to test its ability to qualitatively reproduce population behavior. The resulting mathematical framework is able to capture network activity in distinct dynamical regimes and transitions between them. Thus, this approach provides a reliable foundation for the development of personalized medicine tools to study how the effect of dopamine modulation on single brain region affects whole brain behavior.

                The transition to motherhood involves profound physiological and neural changes, including adaptations in the sensory systems that support infant care. While the olfactory system plays a critical role in guiding maternal behaviors such as pup retrieval and nesting, how olfactory processing itself is reshaped during motherhood remains poorly understood. Here, we show that firsttime mothers develop a selective preference for pup urine following parturition and early postpartum care, a preference not observed for other social or neutral odors. Using odor preference assays combined with liquid and gas chromatography mass spectrometry, we identify specific volatile compounds in pup urine that may contribute to this maternal attraction. Disruption of olfactory input or restriction of contact chemosensation abolished the preference, indicating that both volatile and nonvolatile sensory modalities contribute, likely through combined input from the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) and vomeronasal organ (VNO). Notably, this preference is absent in late-pregnant females, in mothers separated from pups at birth, and in virgins co-housed with pups or exposed to pup urine- highlighting that pup urine preference depends on the convergence of internal hormonal signals and external chemosensory cues. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized specificity in maternal olfactory behavior and provide insight into how motherhood modulates the sense of smell to support offspring recognition and care.

                Introduction: The striatum is organized into two neurochemically and anatomically distinct compartments, the striosome and matrix, that play specialized roles in motor and cognitive functions. While extensive animal research has elucidated compartment-specific contributions to reward, learning and motor control, direct evidence for compartment specialization in humans is lacking. Methods: We defined human striatal voxels as striosome-like or matrix-like based on biases in structural (diffusion) connectivity. Then we investigated functional activation patterns in those compartment-like voxels using task-based functional MRI (tfMRI) during pre-movement cue and five motor conditions (left/right hand, left/right foot, and tongue movements). Results: Functional activation was strikingly segregated: striosome-like voxels were preferentially engaged during the cue phase, while matrix-like voxels dominated activation during motor execution, especially for tongue and foot movement. Motor tasks elicited robust bilateral activation, with contralateral activation dominating during limb movements. Activation was more lateralized in matrix-like than in striosome-like voxels. Both striosome-like and matrix-like voxels exhibited strong activation at the onset of task execution (e.g., within the first few seconds post-cue). However, activation in matrix-like voxels declined modestly over the course of the movement phase, while striosomal activation dropped sharply at task termination, suggesting a role in behavioral transitions. These findings are consistent with the role of the striosome in anticipatory evaluation and dopaminergic modulation, and matrix specialization for executing automatized routines. Conclusions: This study provides the first task-based fMRI evidence of temporally and functionally distinct striatal compartment dynamics in humans, offering novel insights into striatal microcircuitry in motivated behavior and the planning and execution of movements.

">Modeling Human Visuomotor Adaptation with a DisturbanceObserver Framework</a></h4>

              
                Visuomotor adaptation studies have revealed a range of behaviors, including nonlinear saturation effects, instruction-dependent differences in performance, and distinct explicit and implicit components of adaptation. However, existing computational models have struggled to account for the full breadth of these findings. In this paper, we aim to address this gap by (1) designing a set of experiments to investigate the role of nonlinear saturation under different instructional contexts, and (2) introducing an abstract discrete-time model that captures plausible neural computations underlying the observed behaviors. The model draws on recent advances in control theory and is informed by prior work on oculomotor adaptation and cerebellar function, particularly within the floccular complex.

">Canonical Representational Mapping for Cognitive Neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                Understanding neural representations is central to cognitive neuroscience, yet isolating meaningful patterns from noisy or correlated data remains challenging. Canonical Representational Mapping (CRM) is a novel multivariate analysis method to identify neural patterns aligned with specific cognitive hypotheses. CRM maximizes correlations between multivariate datasets -- similar to Canonical Correlation Analysis -- while controlling for confounding sources of variance, such as shared noise or irrelevant task conditions. We validate CRM with simulations and apply it across diverse neurophysiological datasets: In one application, we use CRM to map large language model activations onto intracranial electroencephalography recordings during story listening, controlling for contextual autocorrelations. In another example, we factorize overlapping representations in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging into distinct context and episode components. Finally, we uncover frequency-coupled representations shared between hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex in navigating rodents. Our results introduce CRM as a powerful tool to isolate representations across modalities and species.

">Memorability of Images Positively Influences Associative Memory Retention</a></h4>

              
                Enhancing memory function is essential for daily living and cognitive health, particularly amid population aging and cognitive decline. However, current methods for memory enhancement often require specialized interventions or effortful practice. Here, we present evidence that the intrinsic memorability of images can serve as a simple, scalable, and involuntary strategy for improving associative memory. We studied its effects on associative memory in adults of distinct ages, memory retention in cognitively impaired older adults, and vocabulary learning in foreign language learners. Our results show that highly memorable images significantly enhance the recall of associated words, especially when the cue image and target word are semantically unrelated. Notably, these effects persist for at least one week and are robust across age groups and cognitive status. In a foreign language vocabulary task, pairing words with memorable images led to either improved recall accuracy or reduced learning time. These findings highlight that, in addition to being an intrinsic memory-enhancing property, image memorability also serves as a general facilitator of associative memory, via a method that is easy to adopt, requires minimal conscious effort, and can benefit the general public, particularly learners and cognitive impairment patients in educational and clinical settings.

">Spontaneous oscillatory activity in episodic timing: an EEG replication study and its limitations</a></h4>

              
                Episodic timing refers to the one-shot, automatic encoding of temporal information in the brain, in the absence of attention to time. A previous magnetoencephalography (MEG) study showed that the relative burst time of spontaneous alpha oscillations () during quiet wakefulness was a selective predictor of retrospective duration estimation. This observation was interpreted as  embodying the "ticks" of an internal contextual clock. Herein, we replicate and extend these findings using electroencephalography (EEG), assess robustness to time-on-task effects, and test the generalizability in virtual reality (VR) environments. In three EEG experiments, 147 participants underwent 4-minute eyes-open resting-state recordings followed by an unexpected retrospective duration estimation task. Experiment 1 tested participants before any tasks, Experiment 2 after 90 minutes of timing tasks, and Experiment 3 in VR environments of different sizes. We successfully replicated the original MEG findings in Experiment 1 but did not in Experiment 2. We explain the lack of replication through time-on-task effects (changes in  power and topography) and contextual changes yielding a cognitive strategy based on temporal expectation (supported by a fast passage-of-time). In Experiment 3, we did not find the expected duration underestimation in VR, and did not replicate the correlation between  bursts and retrospective time estimates. Overall, EEG captures the  burst marker of episodic timing, its reliability depends critically on experimental context. Our findings highlight the importance of controlling experimental context when using  bursts as a neural marker of episodic timing.

">CARACAS, a novel automated tool for Cardiac Artifact Removal in Absence of CArdiac Signal</a></h4>

              
                EEG recordings can contain cardiac related artifacts. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) followed by removal of cardiac Independent Components (ICs) is a powerful and widely used strategy for artifact correction. Most existing methods for automatic labeling of cardiac ICs require simultaneously recorded ECG (e.g., to compute correlation with IC time course, such as CORR algorithm). However, ECG is not always available. To address this limitation, we developed CARACAS (Cardiac Artifact Removal in Absence of CArdiac Signal), a novel tool that identifies cardiac ICs using only the IC time courses. Because cardiac ICs exhibit temporal profiles highly similar to ECG signals, we applied one of our existing function designed to detect cardiac events (PQRST) in ECG signals to each IC time course. Analysis of the detected events enabled the differentiation of cardiac ICs from non-cardiac ICs, where unrelated signal variations are incorrectly identified as cardiac events. Using the 375 EEG-ECG recordings of the open-source dataset OpenNeuro ds003690, we compared the performances of three algorithms: CARACAS, IClabel (a generic IC classifier which does not require ECG), and CORR algorithm. A total of 21,375 ICs were manually and automatically classified. CARACAS achieved high performance (sensitivity = 0.923, specificity = 0.991), substantially outperforming ICLabel (sensitivity = 0.135, specificity = 0.999) and approaching the performance of CORR (sensitivity = 0.970, specificity = 0.998). We present a reliable ECG-free algorithm for cardiac IC detection in EEG. CARACAS provides a practical solution when ECG is unavailable, and is implemented in SASICA toolbox (MATLAB).

">Multi-focal ultrasound neuromodulation to the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex disrupts behavioural and neural pain processing</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is a promising non-invasive technique for modulating deep brain regions involved in pain. TUS applied to the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), a region implicated in chronic pain and established target for deep brain stimulation, has shown potential for reducing pain. This study aimed to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying TUS effects on pain in healthy participants using neuroimaging. Thirty-two participants underwent two double-blind, randomised TUS-fMRI sessions (active or sham). A tonic cold stimulus was applied during multifocal dACC-TUS and during fMRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) blocks. While no significant main effect of TUS on pain intensity was observed, active TUS showed a significantly greater reduction in pain ratings between 28- and 55-minutes post-stimulation, suggesting a delayed analgesic effect. Active TUS also disrupted the typical relationship between stimulus temperature and reported pain intensity, indicating altered sensory encoding. There was increased functional connectivity between the dACC and the supplementary motor area, pre-motor cortex, mid-ACC and the supramarginal gyrus, along with decreased coupling with the periaqueductal grey (PAG), and altered salience network connectivity. Overall, these findings suggest TUS to the dACC has multidimensional effects across behavioural and neural aspects of pain processing, supporting its potential therapeutic value.

">Automated Quantification of Stereotypical Motor Movements in Autism Using Persistent Homology</a></h4>

              
                Stereotypical motor movements (SMM) are a core diagnostic feature of autism that remain difficult to quantify efficiently and validly across individuals and developmental stages. The current paper presents a novel pipeline that leverages Topological Data Analysis to quantify and characterize recurrent movement patterns. Specifically, we use persistent homology to construct low-dimensional, interpretable feature vectors that capture geometric properties associated with autistic SMM by extracting periodic structure from time series derived from pose estimation landmarks in video data and accelerometer signals from wearable sensors. We demonstrate that these features, combined with simple classifiers, enable accurate automated quantification of autistic SMM. Visualization of the learned feature space reveals that extracted features generalize across individuals and are not dominated by person-specific SMM. Our results highlight the potential of using mathematically principled features to support more scalable, interpretable, and person-agnostic characterization of autistic SMM in naturalistic settings.

">A neural network with episodic memory learns causal relationships between narrative events</a></h4>

              
                Humans reflect on past memories to make sense of an ongoing event. Past work has shown that people retrieve causally related past events during comprehension, but the exact process by which this causal inference occurs remains elusive. Here, we employed a recurrent neural network augmented with an episodic memory buffer to examine how memories are retrieved and integrated based on causal relationships between events. The model was trained to predict upcoming scenes as it watched a television episode. At every time step, the model transformed the current scene into two distinct representations--"value" representing memory content and "key" representing memory address--both of which were stored as episodic memory. The model learned to retrieve selective past values by applying self-attention over stored keys, and it integrated these retrieved values with the current scene representation to predict an upcoming scene. By separating representations used for encoding from those used for retrieval, the model learned to retrieve memories in ways that go beyond simple pattern similarity. In turn, the model represented causally related events with similar patterns beyond perceptual or semantic similarities, suggesting that it organized event representations based on latent causal structure. Memories retrieved by the model were similar to those retrieved by human participants who watched the same television episode. The model also exhibited hippocampus-like pattern separation and pattern completion, and its representational structure aligned more closely with human fMRI data than a comparison model without an episodic memory buffer. These findings suggest that the model captures the way humans represent events and retrieve memories based on causal relationships. Together, this work proposes a key-value episodic memory system as a candidate computational mechanism for how humans retrieve causally related memories to comprehend naturalistic events.

">Representational magnitude as a geometric signature ofimage and word memorability</a></h4>

              
                What makes some stimuli more memorable than others? While memory varies across individuals, research shows that some items are intrinsically more memorable, a property quantifiable as memorability. Recently, a new representational signature for image memorability was identified: the magnitude of the population response in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) correlated with image memorability. However, it is unclear if this geometric principle was confined to the visual domain or whether it represents a broader computational phenomenon observable in other stimuli domains as well. Here we show that this representational magnitude effect not only replicates for images in an independent dataset but also generalizes to an entirely different cognitive domain and neural network architecture: lexical memorability and word embeddings. Across three large-scale lexical datasets, we found that the L2 norm (vector magnitude) of word embeddings reliably predicted recognition memorability, independent of word frequency, valence, or word length. This consistency suggests the effect reflects a general property of distributed representations, where representational magnitude may capture how strongly a stimulus projects onto dominant, conceptual/semantically meaningful features in a networks embedding space. At the same time, this effect does not appear to generalize to all domains, as our analysis of a novel voice memorability dataset showed no such relationship between representational magnitude and memorability. Together, these findings indicate that the geometry of distributed representations offers a useful lens for understanding memorability, suggesting an items representational magnitude reflects its projection onto dominant dimensions of representation, in both artificial and biological systems.

">Intrathecal administration of palmitoyl-lysophosphatidylethanolamine reduces secondary injury and improves locomotor recovery following spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                Spinal cord injury (SCI) triggers secondary pathophysiological cascades, including glutamate excitotoxicity, that result in neuronal loss and impair functional recovery. We have previously shown that lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), a lysophospholipid, promotes neurite outgrowth and protects against glutamate excitotoxicity in cultured cortical neurons. However, whether these effects extend to spinal cord neurons and occur in vivo has remained unclear. In this study, we compared the effects of different LPE species: myristoyl-LPE (14:0 LPE), palmitoyl-LPE (16:0 LPE), stearoyl-LPE (18:0 LPE), and oleoyl-LPE (18:1 LPE) in cultured spinal commissural neurons, and evaluated their effects in vivo using a mouse model of SCI. In cultured neurons, all LPE species promoted neurite outgrowth. Although several species demonstrated a tendency toward neuroprotection, only 16:0 LPE exhibited a statistically significant protective effect against glutamate-induced excitotoxic cell death. Intrathecal administration of 16:0 LPE after SCI reduced TUNEL-positive cells in the acute phase and attenuated lesion expansion at 8 weeks post-injury. Moreover, 5-HT fluorescence intensity was increased in 16:0 LPE-treated mice, suggesting enhanced serotonergic innervation. Furthermore, administration of 16:0 LPE after SCI significantly improved hind-limb motor performance compared with vehicle controls, as assessed by the Basso Mouse Scale. Collectively, these findings suggest that intrathecal administration of 16:0 LPE reduces secondary injury and promotes functional recovery following SCI. Our findings highlight its potential as a therapeutic candidate for SCI.

">Axon guidance deficits in a human sensory neuron model of Fabry disease</a></h4>

              
                Fabry disease (FD) is a rare genetic galactosidase alpha (GLA) gene associated lysosomal disorder caused by alpha-galactosidase A (AGAL) deficiency, leading to sphingolipid (globotriaosylceramide, Gb3) accumulation in multiple tissues. Burning pain due to small fiber neuropathy is an early symptom with great impact on health-related quality of life. The pathophysiological role of Gb3 accumulations in sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia is incompletely understood. We have differentiated induced pluripotent stem cells of an isogenic GLA knockout line (p.S364del, hemizygous) and its healthy control into sensory neurons to model FD in vitro. We have compared both lines on transcriptional and proteomic level and investigated the effects of AGAL enzyme supplementation. FD sensory neurons showed dysregulation of disease-related pathways, including axon guidance at both RNA and protein level and microfluidic assays revealed shorter neurite length. While AGAL did not restore the transcriptomic state, it reduced Gb3 accumulation and lowered protein ephrin 5A and glycoprotein M6A level. These findings highlight axon guidance alterations in an isogenic human FD sensory model, with potential implications for early central and peripheral innervation in small fiber neuropathy.

                <p>The causal relationship between gut microbiota (GM) and white matter injury and communication remains unclear. We aimed to scrutinize the plausible causal impact of GM on white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), white matter microstructure, white matter connectivity, and multiple neurological diseases via Mendelian randomization study. We identified four WMH-related bacterial taxa, including class <I>Melainabacteria</I>, order <I>Gastranaerophilales</I>, family <I>Alcaligenaceae</I>, and genus <I>Ruminiclostridium 6</I>. In addition, three bacterial taxa were discovered that have consistent effect on multiple aspects of white matter microstructure. Furthermore, we found 12 strong associations between genetic liability in GM and white matter connectivity. Among these bacterial taxa, the family <I>Clostridiaceae 1</I> demonstrated a protective effect against ischemic stroke (IS). The genus <I>Barnesiella</I> showed protective effect on IS and small vessel stroke while posed a risk effect on neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), as well as on aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD). The order <I>Desulfovibrionales</I> and family <I>Desulfovibrionaceae</I> showed protective effect against cardioembolic stroke, and the genus <I>Ruminococcus gnavus group</I> showed a protective effect on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In terms of the mapped genes of statistically significant bacterial taxa, genes such as <I>CPNE1</I>, <I>PIGU</I>, <I>MED22</I>, <I>SURF6</I>, <I>DOCK10</I>, and <I>COPS3</I> exhibited a significant causal correlation with the corresponding white matter connectivity. This study demonstrated a genetically predicted causal relationship between GM and WMH, white matter microstructure, white matter connectivity, and multiple neurological diseases, based on GWAS data from mixed-sex cohorts without sex-stratified summary statistics. These findings highlight the potential role of GM in influencing brain structural integrity.</p>

                <p>by Giuseppe Agapito, Mario Cannataro, Pietro Cinaglia, Marianna Milano</p>

Network alignment (NA) is a computational methodology employed to compare biological networks across different species or conditions. By identifying conserved structures, functions, and interactions, NA provides invaluable insights into shared biological processes, evolutionary relationships, and system-level behaviors. This manuscript presents a comprehensive overview of NA methodologies, including the importance of preprocessing network data, selecting suitable input formats, and understanding diverse network types such as attributed, temporal, and multilayer networks. Additionally, it explores key challenges such as seed nodes selection, algorithm configuration, and cross-species alignment, emphasizing the necessity of integrating functional annotations, sequence similarity, and network topology for biologically meaningful results. Various NA strategies, including Local and Global Network Alignment, are discussed alongside their respective advantages and limitations. Practical recommendations for effectively documenting and visualizing NA experiments are also provided, ensuring reproducibility and clarity in research. By leveraging diverse alignment tools and adopting best practices, researchers can unlock the potential of NA to advance our understanding of complex biological systems.

Recent efforts by a private company to modify modern species with ancient DNA in the name of ‘de-extinction’ are both scientifically and morally suspect. A bright line requiring more than press releases as well as independent ethical oversight must be drawn before they are extended to distant human and hominid ancestors.

                <p>by John J. Wiens, Kristen E. Saban</p>

An important aspect of the current extinction crisis is the loss of distinct clades (e.g., genera). A recent study suggested that there is rapidly accelerating extinction of genera (and other higher taxa), indicating a current mass extinction event that endangers human survival. However, that study was based only on land vertebrates, which include only about half of vertebrates and <2% of living species. Here, we examine the recent extinction (last 500 years) of higher taxa across living organisms. We find that 102 genera have gone extinct (90 animals, 12 plants), along with 10 families and two orders. Yet, the majority of these genus-level extinctions were among mammals and birds, as were all extinctions of families and orders. There were very few extinctions among the thousands of genera of ray-finned fishes (<i>n</i> = 4; 0.08%), squamate reptiles (<i>n</i> = 2; 0.17%), and amphibians (<i>n</i> = 1; 0.18%). Documented extinctions were also rare among the thousands of assessed genera of arthropods (<i>n</i> = 11; 0.32%) and plants (<i>n</i> = 12; 0.17%), which together encompass most known species. Most extinct genera were monotypic (~80%), and most were island endemics (76%). Moreover, despite the claim that extinctions of higher taxa are rapidly accelerating, the highest rates of genus-level extinctions occurred more than 100 years ago, and have declined subsequently. Overall, the recent extinctions of higher taxa are not as dire as previously suggested.

                <p>by Yutong Song, Tianmu Zhang, Tae Hoon Ryu, Kyle Wong, Zekun Wu, Yanan Wei, Justine Schweizer, Khoi-Nguyen Ha Nguyen, Alex Kwan, Xiaoli Zhang, Kweon Yu, Woo Jae Kim</p>

Neuropeptide SIFamide (SIFa) neurons in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> have been characterized by their exceptionally elaborate arborization patterns, which extend from the brain into the ventral nerve cord (VNC). SIFa neurons are equipped to receive signals that integrate both internal physiological cues and external environmental stimuli. These signals enable the neurons to regulate energy balance, sleep patterns, metabolic status, and circadian timing. These peptidergic neurons are instrumental in orchestrating the animal’s internal states and refining its behavioral responses, yet the precise molecular underpinnings of this process remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that SIFa neurons coordinate a range of behavioral responses by selectively integrating inputs and outputs in a context-dependent manner. These neurons engage in a feedback loop with sNPF neurons in the VNC, modifying behaviors such as longer mating duration (LMD) and shorter mating duration (SMD). Additionally, SIFa neurons interact with dopamine and glutamate to differentially regulate sleep and mating duration. Activating SIFa neurons leads to reduced mating duration and increased food intake, while deactivating them reduces food intake. Overall, these findings demonstrate the importance of SIFa neurons in absorbing inputs and turning them into behavioral outputs, shedding light on animal’s intricate behavioral orchestration.

Neuropeptides play crucial roles in regulating context-dependent behaviors, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We investigate the role of the neuropeptide SIFa and its receptor SIFaR in regulating two distinct mating duration behaviors in male <i>Drosophila</i>: Longer-Mating-Duration (LMD) and Shorter-Mating-Duration (SMD). We found that SIFaR expression in specific neurons is required for both LMD and SMD behaviors. Social context and sexual experience lead to synaptic reorganization between SIFa and SIFaR neurons, altering internal states of brain. We revealed that the SIFa-SIFaR/Crz-CrzR neuropeptide relay pathway is essential for generating distinct interval timing behaviors, with Crz neurons being responsive to the activity of SIFa neurons. Additionally, CrzR expression in glial cell population is critical for regulating LMD behavior. Our study provides insights into how neuropeptides and their receptors modulate context-dependent behaviors through synaptic plasticity and calcium signaling, with implications for understanding the neural circuitry underlying interval timing and neuropeptidergic system modulation of behavioral adaptations.

                <p>by Stephen Thomas, Ayatollah S. El-Zayat, James Gurney, Jennifer Rattray, Sam P. Brown</p>

Bacterial quorum sensing is often mediated by multiple signaling systems that interact with each other. The quorum-sensing systems of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</i> for example, are considered hierarchical, with the <i>las</i> system acting as a master regulator. By experimentally controlling the concentration of auto-inducer signals in a signal deficient strain (PAO1Δ<i>lasI</i>Δ<i>rhlI</i>), we show that the two primary quorum-sensing systems—<i>las</i> and <i>rhl</i>—act reciprocally rather than hierarchically. Just as the <i>las</i> system’s 3‑oxo‑C<sub>12</sub>‑HSL can induce increased expression of <i>rhlI,</i> the <i>rhl</i> system’s C<sub>4</sub>‑HSL increases the expression level of <i>lasI.</i> We develop a mathematical model to quantify relationships both within and between the <i>las</i> and <i>rhl</i> quorum-sensing systems and the downstream genes they influence. The results show that not only do the systems interact in a reciprocal manner, but they do so asymmetrically, cooperatively, and nonlinearly, with the combination of C<sub>4</sub>‑HSL and 3‑oxo‑C<sub>12</sub>‑HSL increasing expression level far more than the sum of their individual effects. We next extend our parameterized mathematical model to generate quantitative predictions on how a QS-controlled effector gene (<i>lasB</i>) responds to changes in wildtype bacterial stationary phase density and find close quantitative agreement with an independent dataset. Finally, we use our parameterized model to assess how changes in multi-signal interactions modulate functional responses to variation in social (population density) and physical (mass transfer) environment and demonstrate that a reciprocal architecture is more responsive to density and more robust to mass transfer than a strict hierarchy.

                Nico U.F. Dosenbach and Roselyne Chauvin spoke with Cell Reports about their recent paper, in which they observed subcortical plasticity in humans following a 2-week arm/hand-casting paradigm with daily brain fMRIs. They discuss the surprising findings and challenges of their work, how they developed a passion for studying the human brain, and their experience publishing with Cell Reports.

                Harbers et al. demonstrate that female marmosets carrying heterozygous FMR1 mutations exhibit phenotypes resembling those of patients with fragile X syndrome, establishing a non-human primate model for the disorder. This distinct model provides a valuable resource for studying pathophysiology and evaluating therapeutic strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104465">Newly discovered and conserved role of IgM against viral infection in an early vertebrate</a></h4>

              
                IgM emerged in jawed vertebrates 500 Mya and remains the most evolutionarily conserved antibody class. However, despite extensive studies on IgM as an ancient antiviral weapon in warm-blooded vertebrates, its role and mechanisms in combating viral infections in early vertebrates remain poorly understood. Here, significant virus-specific sIgM titers are generated in the serum and gut mucus of a teleost fish (largemouth bass) that survive infection, and fish lacking sIgM were more susceptible to viral infection. These results challenge the paradigm that IgM and IgT are specialized to systemic and mucosal immunity, respectively. More crucially, the neutralization assay provides further insight into the role of sIgM in viral neutralization and clarifies the mechanism through which teleost sIgM blocks viral infection by directly targeting viral particles. From an evolutionary perspective, sIgM in both primitive and modern vertebrates follows conserved principles in the development of specialized antiviral immunity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97514">Spatial integration of sensory input and motor output in Pseudomonas aeruginosa chemotaxis through colocalized distribution</a></h4>

              
                The opportunistic pathogen <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> serves as a model organism for studying multiple signal transduction pathways. The chemoreceptor cluster, a core component of the chemotaxis pathway, is assembled from hundreds of proteins. The unipolar distribution of receptor clusters has long been recognized, yet the precise mechanism governing their assembly remains elusive. Here, we directly observed the relative positions of the flagellar motor and chemoreceptor cluster using flagellar filament labeling and gene editing techniques. Surprisingly, we found that both are located at the same cell pole, with the distribution pattern controlled by the polar anchor protein FlhF. Additionally, the efficient assembly of the chemoreceptor cluster is partially dependent on the integrity of the motor structure. Furthermore, we discovered that overexpression of the chemotaxis regulatory protein CheY leads to high intracellular levels of the second messenger c-di-GMP, triggering cell aggregation. Therefore, the colocalization of the chemoreceptor cluster and flagellum in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> serves to avoid cross-pathway signaling interference, enabling cells to conduct various physiological activities in an orderly manner.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106610">Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells as a reservoir for trained immunity</a></h4>

              
                Human and murine studies reveal that innate immune cells are able to mount enhanced responses to pathogens after primary inflammatory exposure. Innate immune memory has been shown to last for months to years, longer than the lifespan of most innate immune cells. Indeed, long-lived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) serve as a cellular reservoir for innate immune memory. In this review, we summarize the evidence that innate immune memory is epigenetically encoded in HSPCs, and we consider whether HSPC subpopulations with differentiation bias, cell autonomous epigenetic reprogramming, or both features underlie the phenomenon of central trained immunity. We further profile the significant implications of central trained immunity in stem cell transplant, aging, inflammatory diseases, and vaccination strategies for the future.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89125">Meaning-making behavior in a small-brained hominin, Homo naledi, from the late Pleistocene: contexts and evolutionary implications</a></h4>

              
                Explorations in the Dinaledi Subsystem of the Rising Star cave system have yielded some of the earliest evidence of a mortuary practice in hominins. Because the evidence is attributable to the small-brained <i>Homo naledi</i>, these analyses call into question several assumptions about behavioral and cognitive evolution in Pleistocene hominins. The evidence from the Dinaledi Subsystem, and at other locations across the Rising Star cave system may widen the phylogenetic breadth of mortuary, and possibly funerary, behaviors. These discoveries may also associate the creation of meaning-making and increased behavioral complexity with a small-brained hominin species, challenging certain assertions about the role of encephalization and cognition in hominin and human evolution. We suggest that the hominin socio-cognitive niche is more diverse than previously thought. If true, technological, meaning-making activities, and cognitive advances in human evolution are not associated solely with the evolution of larger-brained members of the genus <i>Homo</i>.Evidence for complex behaviors associated with a small-brained hominin suggests that large brains are not solely responsible for the manifestation of human-like behavioral complexity.

                <p>Visual perception is characterized by known asymmetries in the visual field; human&rsquo;s visual sensitivity is higher along the horizontal than the vertical meridian, and along the lower than the upper vertical meridian. These asymmetries decrease with decreasing eccentricity from the periphery to the center of gaze, suggesting that they may be absent in the <f></f> foveola, the retinal region used to explore scenes at high-resolution. Using high-precision eyetracking and gaze contingent display, allowing for accurate control over the stimulated foveolar location despite the continuous eye motion at fixation, we investigated fine visual discrimination at different isoeccentric locations across the foveola and parafovea in 12 human observers (both sexes). Although the tested foveolar locations were only <f></f> away from the center of gaze, we show that, similar to more eccentric locations, humans are more sensitive to stimuli presented along the horizontal than the vertical meridian. Whereas the magnitude of this asymmetry is reduced in the foveola, the magnitude of the vertical meridian asymmetry is comparable but, interestingly, the asymmetry is reversed: stimuli presented slightly above the center of gaze are more easily discerned than when presented at the same eccentricity below the center of gaze. Therefore, far from being uniform, as often assumed, foveolar vision is characterized by perceptual asymmetries. Further, these asymmetries differ not only in magnitude but also in direction compared to those present just ~<f></f> away from the center of gaze, resulting in overall different foveal and extrafoveal perceptual fields.</p>

                <p>The hippocampal CA3 region is thought to play crucial roles in episodic memory functions because of the extensive recurrent connections between CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3PCs). However, different methods provided contradicting observations about the synaptic connectivity between CA3PCs. Therefore, we estimated the connectivity rate between individual CA3PCs using a new approach that is not affected by the confounds of conventional methods. Specifically, we used voltage imaging with the Voltron sensor in acute slices from rats of either sex to test CA3PC connections by detecting spontaneous spiking and subthreshold responses in anatomically identified neurons. We detected 164 monosynaptic excitatory connections in 3,078 tested CA3PC&ndash;CA3PC pairs. This 5.3% connectivity rate was much higher than that we observed with the theoretically more sensitive patch-clamp method in similar experimental conditions, but it remained below the anatomically observed number of CA3PC&ndash;CA3PC contacts. We verified that the imaged excitatory connections were mediated by AMPA receptors. Our results also showed that the recurrent connections did not enrich into preferred connectivity motifs and followed a distribution that was consistent with random connectivity in general. Moreover, voltage imaging revealed CA3PCs with distinct firing properties and somatic locations corresponding to previously established heterogeneity and showed that specific connectivity rules create preferred information routes among these subpopulations. Finally, we showed that there is at least one condition, influencing patch-clamp recordings but not voltage imaging, that affects the observable functional connections between CA3PCs. Altogether, our results obtained with a new voltage imaging approach argue for high local connectivity rates between CA3PCs.</p>

                <p>Cerebellum (CB) interactions with forebrain systems contribute to learning cognitive and motor tasks, but the nature of these interactions is unknown. Trace eyeblink conditioning (EBC) is an excellent associative learning paradigm for examining interactions between forebrain systems and CB. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), central amygdala (AM), and CB are essential for trace EBC, and we previously recorded changes in neuronal activity in these areas during learning with paired presentations of the conditional stimulus (CS) and unconditional stimulus (US). We attributed changes in activity to learning CS&ndash;US contingency but did not report contingency manipulations. Here, we analyzed data from the same rats of both sexes during sessions with transitions from CS&ndash;US (paired) trials to CS-alone (extinction) trials and from CS-alone trials to CS&ndash;US trials. All three areas showed changes in activity with changes in contingency, during both stimuli and the intertrial interval (ITI). Subsets of ACC, AM, and CB neurons showed higher activity during paired trials, while others showed higher activity during extinction trials both during trial events and ITI. Within- and between-area neuronal synchrony and machine learning predictions of behavior from neuronal activity decreased during extinction trials relative to paired trials, indicating widespread effects of contingency change on the ACC&ndash;AM&ndash;CB network. The findings suggest that the ACC&ndash;AM&ndash;CB network encodes both within-trial stimulus contingency and between-trial task context. The transition from paired to extinction trials may decrease mossy fiber input consistency to CB from ACC and AM and decrease the likelihood of CRs.</p>

                <p>Autism is characterized by two key diagnostic criteria including social deficits and repetitive behaviors. However, the underlying neural circuit dysfunction that accounts for these coexisting symptoms in autism remains poorly understood. Here we revealed that prenatal valproate exposure induced functional alterations of dopaminergic projections from substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) to dorsomedial striatum (DMS). Specifically, we observed enhanced excitatory input and increased excitability in SNc-&gt;DMS dopamine (DA) neurons, resulting in a basal state of potentiation. This potentiated baseline activity blunted the phasic responses of SNc-&gt;DMS projections, as evidenced by reduction of transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> and DA signaling during social interaction and expression of repetitive behaviors in valproate-exposed male mice. We then utilized chronic chemogenetic and optogenetic approaches to selectively manipulate the abnormal basal activity of SNc-&gt;DMS dopaminergic signaling. This targeted intervention successfully rectified the dysfunction in D1R-expressed medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) associated with social deficits, while simultaneously restoring the functionality of D2-MSNs linked to repetitive behaviors. Collectively, our findings support the hypothesis that prenatal valproate exposure disrupts SNc-&gt;DMS dopaminergic signaling, which mediates the coexistence of two core autism-like behaviors by reshaping the dynamics of direct and indirect pathway MSNs. Moreover, these results highlight potential therapeutic targets for developing interventions for both core symptoms of autism.</p>

                <p>GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>B</SUB>Rs) are an important building block in neural activity. Despite their widely hypothesized role in many basic neuronal functions and mental disorder symptomatology, there is a lack of biophysically and biochemically detailed models of these receptors and the way they mediate neuronal inhibition. Here, we developed a computational model for the activation of GABA<SUB>B</SUB>Rs and its effects on the activation of G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels as well as inhibition of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. To ensure the generality of our modeling framework, we fit our model to electrophysiological data including patch-clamp and intracellular recordings that described both pre- and postsynaptic effects of the receptor activation. We validated our model using data on postsynaptic effects of GABA<SUB>B</SUB>Rs on layer V pyramidal cell firing activity ex vivo and in vivo and confirmed the strong impact of dendritic GIRK channel activation on the neuron output. Finally, we reproduced and dissected the effects of a knockout of RGS7 (a G protein signaling protein) on CA1 pyramidal cell electrophysiological properties, which shows the potential of our model in generating insights on genetic manipulations of the GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R system and related genetic variants. Our model thus provides a flexible tool for biochemically and biophysically detailed simulations of different aspects of GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R activation that can reveal both foundational principles of neuronal dynamics and brain disorder-associated traits and treatment options.</p>

                <p>Adaptive behavior relies on prioritizing relevant sensory information, and decades of research have shown that current task goals and stimulus saliency influence this prioritization. Recent behavioral work indicates that incidental experience with frequently relevant locations or nonspatial features also shapes behavioral prioritization. The present study investigates the neural processing stages affected by incidental learning of nonspatial visual features. We recorded neural activity with high temporal resolution using electroencephalography while human participants (female and male) searched for visual targets that had predictable features (i.e., that appeared more frequently in a particular color). We found that incidental learning of the statistical structure was accompanied by an early differentiation of neural activity for relevant compared with irrelevant features beginning at ~120&nbsp;ms post stimulus onset, followed by an earlier-onset selection of the target item, as indexed by a latency shift of the N2pc (~200&nbsp;ms), and changes in later memory and response-related processes, marked by amplitude modulations of the LPC (&gt;400&nbsp;ms). Importantly, the magnitude of the effects across all three neural measures strongly tracked individual differences in the behavioral benefits of learned prioritization, suggesting that successful learning of feature regularities depends on modulating the flow of information across multiple processing stages.</p>

                <p>Interoception, the perception and integration of physiological signals, is a fundamental aspect of self-awareness and homeostasis. While previous work has explored interoceptive processing in the cardiac system, research in the respiratory domain, particularly in relation to brain structure and function, is limited. To address this gap, we utilized a Bayesian psychophysical model to quantify perceptual, metacognitive, and affective dimensions of respiratory interoception in a sample of over 200 healthy participants of both genders. Hierarchical modeling revealed that respiratory metacognition was associated with higher somatic and lower cognitive anxiety, respectively. Whole-brain microstructural indices of myelin content and cortical iron were measured using quantitative brain imaging. Whole-brain voxel-based quantification revealed distinct microstructural patterns in the insular, cingulate, and primary sensory cortices that underlie interoceptive sensitivity and precision. Myelination in the cingulate cortex and periaqueductal gray was associated with confidence bias, while metacognitive sensitivity correlated with myelination in the midline prefrontal cortex. Our findings highlight key brain pathways involved in respiratory interoception and its perceptual, metacognitive, and emotional dimensions.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/36/e2119242025?rss=1">Uncovering the Role of the Human Hippocampus in Procedural Motor Learning: Insights from Implicit Sensorimotor Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent evidence suggests that the human hippocampus, traditionally associated with declarative memory, plays a role in motor sequence learning (MSL). However, the classic MSL paradigm depends initially on declarative learning. Thus, it is critical to discern whether the participation of the hippocampus relates to its canonical role or to processing a general aspect of learning that transcends the declarative/non-declarative distinction. To address this issue, here we turned to visuomotor adaptation (VMA)&mdash;a type of motor learning involving skill recalibration&mdash;which unlike MSL can be easily manipulated to eliminate the explicit component. We examined the broader involvement of the hippocampus in procedural motor learning by using diffusion MRI in a sample of males and females to assess structural plasticity associated with memory consolidation in VMA and an implicit-only version (IVMA). We found that both VMA and IVMA engaged the left posterior hippocampus in a learning-specific manner. Remarkably, while VMA induced only transient hippocampal alterations, IVMA elicited structural changes that persisted overnight, underscoring the reliance on implicit learning for enduring neuroplasticity. As expected, training on both tasks impacted the microstructure of the cerebellum and the motor and posterior parietal cortex. Notably, the temporal dynamics of changes in these regions paralleled those of the left hippocampus, suggesting that motor and limbic regions operate together as part of the same network. Collectively, our findings support an active role of the hippocampus in implicit motor learning and argue for a unified function in memory encoding regardless of the declarative or non-declarative nature of the task.</p>

                <p>The insular cortex is involved in a wide range of auditory functions in the mammalian brain. We studied the organization and basic response properties of auditory neurons in the insular cortex and adjacent areas by recording responses to sound stimuli in anesthetized female rats. Auditory neurons were present in an insulo-parietal auditory field that spans the boundary between the posterior insula, particularly in the granular insular cortex, and the ventral part of the adjacent nonprimary somatosensory fields. Confirming previous reports, neurons in this field had narrow tuning and were preferentially tuned to relatively low frequencies (&lt;16&nbsp;kHz). Intriguingly, auditory units in this field displayed shorter minimal latencies than units in the primary auditory cortex, as well as weaker sensitivity to deviance. These results establish the existence of a rapid auditory information stream with distinct properties through the insulo-parietal cortex that may parallel the pathway through the primary and anterior auditory fields.</p>

                <p>Prosocial behaviors are crucial for maintaining primates' complex social relationships. As central regions involved in social decision-making, the basolateral amygdala (BLA) processes social salience and value, while the gyrus of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACCg) integrates social information to guide decision-making. Oxytocin, a key modulator of social behavior, can influence both prosocial behavior and neural activity in these regions, but the precise mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated oxytocin's effects on prosocial behavior and neural activity by infusing oxytocin or saline into the BLA (Oxt-BLA, Sal-BLA) and examining the effects of Oxt-BLA on prosocial decisions, BLA and ACCg neural activity, and the coordination between the two regions in male rhesus macaques. We found that Oxt-BLA's behavioral effects were state-dependent: during high prosocial states, it sustained prosocial choices and task engagement, counteracting the natural decline seen in the control condition. However, during low prosocial states, Oxt-BLA had minimal behavioral effects. At the neural level, Oxt-BLA enhanced BLA and ACCg activity for prosocial choices only during high prosocial states. Importantly, Oxt-BLA maintained stable BLA&ndash;ACCg coordination during high prosocial states, preventing the decline in communication observed in control conditions. These findings demonstrate that oxytocin's ability to sustain prosocial behavior depends on social motivational state. These results support that oxytocin processing in the BLA acts as a state-dependent neuromodulator that enhances BLA and ACCg neural responses and maintains BLA&ndash;ACCg communication to guide prosocial decisions.</p>

                <p>Current research strives to investigate cognitive processes under natural conditions. Virtual reality and EEG are promising techniques combining naturalistic settings with close experimental control. However, many questions and technical challenges remain, e.g., are saccade onsets a suitable replacement of fixation onsets as key events in continuous gaze trajectories (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B2">Amme et al., 2024</cross-ref>), and consequently, can VR capture differences across different stimulus categories associated with varying saccade durations? To address both questions, we investigate the N170 face effect in humans (14 males, 19 females, zero diverse) using a free-viewing and free-movement immersive VR study that contained houses, various background stimuli, and, notably, static and moving pedestrians to study face perception under naturalistic conditions. Our results show that aligning trials to saccade onsets leads to more well-defined ERPs than fixation onsets, especially for the P100 component, demonstrating that saccade-onset ERPs are a better-suited analysis method for this type of experiment. Furthermore, we observe an evolution of category-based differences, i.e., face versus background saccade-onset ERPs, compatible with previous reports but extending in a large temporal window and including all electrode sites at different points in time. In summary, employing VR, EEG, and eye-tracking to investigate differences across fixation categories provides insights into the relevance of saccadic onsets as event triggers and enhances our understanding of cognitive processes in naturalistic settings.</p>

                <p>by Sandor Beregi, Kris V. Parag</p>

Deciding when to enforce or relax non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) based on real-time outbreak surveillance data is a central challenge in infectious disease epidemiology. Reporting delays and infection under-ascertainment, which characterise practical surveillance data, can misinform decision-making, prompting mistimed NPIs that fail to control spread or permitting deleterious epidemic peaks that overload healthcare capacities. To mitigate these risks, recent studies propose more data-insensitive strategies that trigger NPIs at predetermined times or infection thresholds. However, these strategies often increase NPI durations, amplifying their substantial costs to livelihood and life-quality. We develop a novel model-predictive control algorithm that optimises NPI decisions. We jointly minimise the cumulative risks and costs of interventions of different stringency over stochastic epidemic projections. Our algorithm is among the earliest to realistically incorporate uncertainties underlying both the generation and surveillance of infections. We find, except under extremely delayed reporting, that our projective approach outperforms data-insensitive strategies and show that earlier decisions strikingly improve real-time control with reduced NPI costs. Moreover, we expose how surveillance quality, disease growth and NPI frequency intrinsically limit our ability to flatten epidemic peaks or dampen endemic oscillations and reveal why this potentially makes Ebola virus more controllable than SARS-CoV-2. Our algorithm provides a general framework for guiding optimal NPI decisions ahead-of-time and identifying the key factors limiting practical epidemic control.

                <p>by Jordy Peeters, Dimitri De Bundel, Kenno Vanommeslaeghe</p>

The serotonin-2A receptor (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R) is an interesting target for drug design in the context of antidepressants that might have a rapid onset of action and/or be effective in treatment-resistant cases. The main challenge, however, is that the activation of this receptor can provoke hallucinations. Recent studies have shown that activating the receptor with certain (partial) agonists could potentially give rise to antidepressant effect without hallucinogenic side effects. Although substantial research has been done in this area, the atomistic details of this differential activation of the serotonin-2A receptor are not fully understood. In the present study we performed multiple atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R bound with two antipsychotics, three different potential non-hallucinogens and two hallucinogens to identify the receptor’s ligand dependent conformations. Overall, our findings suggest that modest 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R activation would only yield antidepressant effects and hallucinations result from excessive activation. While modest activation through microdosing may be problematic on account of abuse potential as well as possibly narrow and patient-dependent therapeutic windows, modest activation through administration of a sufficiently weak partial agonist may offer a viable drug development pathway.

Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are severe mental illnesses that significantly impact quality of life. These disorders are associated with autonomic nervous system dysfunction, which can be assessed through heart activity analysis. Heart rate variability (HRV) has shown promise as a potential biomarker for diagnostic support and early screening of those conditions. This study aims to develop and evaluate an automated classification method for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder using short-duration electrocardiogram (ECG) signals recorded with a low-cost wearable device. We conducted classification experiments using machine learning techniques to analyze R-R interval windows extracted from short ECG recordings. The study included 60 participants—30 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and 30 control subjects. We evaluated multiple machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines, XGBoost, multilayer perceptrons, Gated Recurrent Units, and ensemble methods. Two time window lengths (about 1 and 5 minutes) were evaluated. Performance was assessed using 5-fold cross-validation and leave-one-out cross-validation, with hyperparameter optimization and patient-level classification based on individual window decisions. Our method achieved classification accuracy of 83% for the 5-fold cross-validation and 80% for the leave-one-out scenario. Despite the complexity of our scenario, which mirrors real-world clinical settings, the proposed approach yielded performance comparable to advanced diagnostic methods reported in the literature. The results highlight the potential of short-duration HRV analysis as a cost-effective and accessible tool for aiding in the diagnosis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Our findings support the feasibility of using wearable ECG devices and machine learning-based classification for psychiatric screening, paving the way for further research and clinical applications.

                <p>by Alaska Pokhrel, Lachlan Chisholm, Ariana Costas, Matthew Pittorino, Iain G. Duggin, Bill Söderström</p>

<i>Escherichia coli</i> is arguably one of the most studied bacterial model systems in modern biology. While <i>E. coli</i> are normally rod-shaped gram-negative bacteria, they are known to undergo conditional morphology changes under environmental and nutrient stress. In this study, using an infection-based in-vitro infection model system combined with advanced dynamical imaging, we present the first molecular details of uropathogenic <i>E. coli</i> (UPEC) dividing to form and proliferate as coccoid-shaped cells inside human host cells. For these intracellular UPEC cells, the frequency of cell division outpaced the rate of cell growth, resulting in a morphological transition from traditional rod-shape to coccobacilli. We also visualized the subcellular protein dynamics in these cells and noted that the division proteins follow the similar localization and constriction patterns that have been demonstrated for vegetative growth. However, unlike for fast-growing rod-shaped cells, FtsZ constriction in intracellular UPEC occurs prior to visual nucleoid segregation. Our results suggest that the modulation of division rate contributes to morphological adaptability of intracellular UPEC at the single-cell level.

                <p>by Jan Willem de Gee, Niels A. Kloosterman, Anke Braun, Tobias H. Donner</p>

Theoretical accounts postulate that the catecholaminergic neuromodulator noradrenaline shapes cognition and behavior by reducing the impact of prior expectations on learning, inference, and decision-making. A ubiquitous effect of dynamic priors on perceptual decisions under uncertainty is choice history bias: the tendency to systematically repeat, or alternate, previous choices, even when stimulus categories are presented in a random sequence. Here, we directly test for a causal impact of catecholamines on these priors. We pharmacologically elevated catecholamine levels in human participants through the application of the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine. We quantified the resulting changes in observers’ history biases in a visual perceptual decision task. Choice history biases in this task were highly idiosyncratic, tending toward choice repetition or alternation in different individuals. Atomoxetine decreased these biases (toward either repetition or alternation) compared to placebo. Behavioral modeling indicates that this bias reduction was due to a reduced bias in the accumulation of sensory evidence, rather than of the starting point of the accumulation process. Atomoxetine had no significant effect on other behavioral measures tested, including response time and choice accuracy. Atomoxetine and variations of pupil-linked arousal at slower and faster timescales had analogous effects on choice history bias. We conclude that catecholamines reduce the impact of a specific form of prior on perceptual decisions.

                <p>by Joon Ho Choi, Sungwon Bae, Jiho Park, Minsu Yoo, Chul Hoon Kim, Lukas Ian Schmitt, Youngbin Tchoe, Dongil Chung, Ji-Woong Choi, Jong-Cheol Rah</p>

Understanding the neural mechanisms behind short-term memory (STM) errors is crucial for unraveling cognitive processes and addressing deficits associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. This study examines whether STM errors arise from misrepresentation of sensory information or decay in these representations over time. Using 2-photon calcium imaging in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of mice performing a delayed match-to-sample task, we identified a subset of PPC neurons exhibiting both directional and temporal selectivity. Contrary to the hypothesis that STM errors primarily stem from mis-encoding during the sample phase, our findings reveal that these errors are more strongly associated with a drift in neural activity during the delay period. This drift leads to a gradual divergence away from the correct representation, ultimately leading to incorrect behavioral responses. These results emphasize the importance of maintaining stable neural representations in the PPC for accurate STM. Furthermore, they highlight the potential for therapeutic interventions aimed at stabilizing PPC activity during delay periods as a strategy for mitigating cognitive impairments in conditions like schizophrenia.
